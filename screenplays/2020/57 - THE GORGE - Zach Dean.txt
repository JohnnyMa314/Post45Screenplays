           On the screen we see AN ARCHIVAL, BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 
           IMAGE OF...

           UNITED STATES PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, SOVIET PRIME 
           MINISTER JOSEPH STALIN, AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WINSTON 
           CHURCHILL - THE ‘BIG THREE’ ALLIED LEADERS SIT BESIDE ONE 
           ANOTHER, ENGAGED IN THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION AT THE HISTORIC 
           TEHRAN CONFRENCE IN FINAL DAYS OF NOVEMBER, 1943.

           For a moment, we HOLD CLOSE ON THEIR ICONIC FACES frozen in a 
           moment long in the past... 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Absolute blackness. 

           We hear the VOICE OF LEVI, a young man reciting a POEM...

                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        I know to you, 
                        I am not, 
                        what I am,
                        to myself... 

           We hear the faint BEEP ALARM ON A TACTICAL WRIST WATCH...

           INT. UNKNOWN SUBTERRANEAN LOCATION - O5:00 HOURS

           A WRISTWATCH illuminates in the pitch black darkness as the 
           alarm quietly BEEPS. 

           The watch display reads: 05:00 AM. 

           An instant later the alarm is extinguished as a HEADLAMP is 
           SWITCHED ON...illuminating a dark, extremely cramped space.

           Wearing the headlamp is LEVI, a young man in his mid-twenties 
           with short, buzzed hair and ten days of bearding. 

           Levi lies in a sleeping bag. His face is filthy and his neck 
           is dotted with insect bites. 

           With sleep still in his eyes, Levi glances with indifference 
           at his 4’x5’x6’ claustrophobic surroundings...
           ROOTS extend sinuous fingers from dirt walls enclosing him. 
           MILLIPEDES and FIRE ANTS move in the soil he sleeps on. 

           A black synthetic material creates a ceiling ten inches above 
           his head. It’s as if he’s been buried alive... 

           INT. UNKNOWN SUBTERRANEAN LOCATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Lit by headlamp, Levi unzips his sleeping bag, rolls on his 
           side, and URINATES into a two-gallon PLASTIC STORAGE BOTTLE. 

           Levi screws the lid back on the bottle tightly and fishes in 
           his PACK, retrieving a small NOTEBOOK. 

           He opens the notebook to the CALENDAR PAGE...CLOSE ON 
           NOTEBOOK- TEN successive DAYS have been marked off with red 
           sharpie marker. 

           LEVI DRAWS A RED DIAGONAL LINE THROUGH ANOTHER DAY.

           He turns a few more pages in the notebook to an UNFINISHED 
           POEM he’s composing. He skims the lines as...

           LEVI’S V.O. CONTINUES...

                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        To see me
                        is to see nothing. 
                        I am merely a dry leaf 
                        on a dry day. 
                        But when you hear my song 
                        you will know me like no other... 

           Levi’s V.O. pauses as HE HEARS A FAINT SOUND in the distance. 

           He listens intently as the sound grows louder, 
           nearing...UNTIL WE RECOGNIZE THE SOUND AS A JET AIRCRAFT ON 
           LANDING APPROACH.

           EXT. REMOTE AIRFIELD - VENEZUELA - DAWN - SECONDS LATER

           As dawn breaks over the lush landscape, a private GULF STREAM 
           JET touches down on a remote runway, surrounded by blowing 
           grass fields with thick cloud forest jungle beyond.

           THREE WHITE SUV’s bearing GOVERNMENT FLAGS greet the 
           aircraft’s arrival as...

           WE HEAR LEVI’S V.O. CONTINUE...
                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        For I am the thunder in the hills, 
                        I am the flame taker, 
                        the eater of flowers,
                        the beast in the tower...

           A moment later, a well-dressed CARTEL LEADER and his YOUNG 
           WIFE in a cream-colored dress step out of the jet, exiting 
           down the folding stairs...

           As a DRIVER opens a rear SUV DOOR for the couple, the Cartel 
           Leader’s Wife turns, laughing at something her husband has 
           said. She leans in, KISSING HIM on the cheek...

                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        The toll
                        Of the bell 
                        in your last hour...

           In that instant, THE FORCE OF A BULLET MOVING AT 2900 FEET-
           PER-SECOND SNAPS THE CARTEL LEADER’S FOREHEAD BACKWARD, 
           FLECKING HIS YOUNG WIFE’S FACE AND DRESS WITH BLOOD.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. GRASSY HILLSIDE - 1800 METERS AWAY - A SECOND LATER

           In a blowing grass hillside over a mile away, we see the 
           MUZZLE OF A SNIPER RIFLE discreetly retract beneath the 
           grassy earth...

           INT. UNKNOWN SUBTERRANEAN LOCATION - A SECOND LATER

           Levi quickly sets his rifle aside. 

           He inserts a clump of grass into THE TINY SHOOTING OPENING IN 
           HIS BLIND, extinguishing the light of the rising sun. Once 
           again, he is enveloped in darkness.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           SUPERTITLE:

                                    FOUR MONTHS LATER

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE - NIGHT

           Fluorescent lights hum in the ceiling.
           Levi, now in jeans and a black hoodie, shifts his weight from 
           foot-to-foot. The words,‘INTRO TO POETRY’, are scrawled on a 
           classroom WIPE BOARD behind him.

           We SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL a CLASSROOM FULL OF ADULT EDUCATION 
           STUDENTS of all ages and ethnicity's. 

           JANET, the instructor, a white-haired woman in her late 
           fifties, nods encouragingly to Levi...

                                 JANET
                             (to Levi, re: the pause)
                        Please...continue...

           It’s clear the students are listening intently as Levi looks 
           down at the NOTEBOOK in his hand. He clears his throat...

                                 LEVI
                             (reading aloud)
                        The wishing well 
                        has swelled 
                        and swelled... 

           Levi stops reading mid-poem. 

           He looks at the roomful of eyes falling on him...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (addressing the group)
                        Look...I’m sorry. This...this whole 
                        thing, it just isn’t probably right 
                        for me...

           The teacher makes a face.

                                 JANET
                             (interjecting)
                        Levi, I think I can speak for the 
                        entire class, when I say that we 
                        very much want to hear the rest of 
                        your poem... 

           The students in the room SMILE AND NOD.

                                 JANET (CONT'D)
                             (to Levi)
                        This is a writing workshop. This is 
                        a safe place...

           Levi holds her gaze for an instant...then closes his notebook 
           and grabs his bag.

                                 JANET (CONT'D)
                        Levi...where...where are you going?
           Levi walks silently toward the classroom door.

                                 JANET  (CONT'D)
                             (with an edge)
                        Levi, could you please dignify my 
                        question with a response...

           Levi pauses in the door. He looks at the well meaning 
           instructor, then at the classroom of Students.

                                 LEVI
                             (to the instructor)
                        No such thing as a safe place. 

           INT. LEVI’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A fan spins in the barred window.

           Alone in his hot, empty, one room apartment, Levi sits 
           shirtless at a cheap card table with a pen and his notebook, 
           writing A NEW POEM. 

           He pauses between lines, speaking aloud, attempting to 
           articulate something in verse... 

                                 LEVI
                             (quietly to himself)
                        ...With my boyhood knife, 
                        I will cut the sun from the sky, 
                        and give it...(pause)...to the 
                        night...

           His IPHONE VIBRATES on the table top.

           Levi’s eyes dart to the phone screen, silently reading the 
           UNSEEN TEXT MESSAGE.

           EXT. CHECK POINT - CAMP PENDLETON MARINE BASE - NEXT MORNING 

           The August sun rises over the San Diego mountains as a BLACK 
           MILITARY SUV passes through a security checkpoint entering 
           the expanse of Camp Pendleton Marine Base.

           INT. MILITARY SUV - SAME MOMENT

           As a DRIVER clears the security gate, Levi sits silently in 
           the back of the SUV wearing pressed MARINE DRESS BLUES. 

           A FIRST SERGEANT STRIPE INSIGNIA is embroidered on the left 
           arm of Levi’s uniform. 
           Hung on the left side of his chest is myriad of COMBAT 
           RIBBONS AND MEDALS. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM - CAMP PENDLETON COMMAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Thin slats of morning sunlight cut through the blinds of an 
           empty waiting room.

           Alone, Levi stands at attention, staring straight ahead with 
           his white MARINE HAT tucked under his arm...

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CAMP PENDLETON COMMAND - MOMENTS LATER

           As she enters, Levi salutes Marine COLONEL LOOMIS, a stoic 
           woman in her late forties... 

                                 COLONEL LOOMIS
                             (to Levi)
                        At ease, First Sergeant.

           MAJOR STOWE, the Colonel’s subordinate, quietly shuts the 
           door behind Levi and motions to the conference room table 
           preset TRAY OF BAGELS, PASTRIES, COFFEE AND JUICE.

                                 MAJOR STOWE
                             (to Levi)
                        Please, have a seat.

           As Levi sits, he glances down a long table at BARTHOLEMEW, an 
           older, white-haired man with unusually pale eyes. He is 
           dressed in a sharp suit.

                                 MAJOR STOWE (CONT'D)
                             (to Levi)
                        First Sergeant, would you like a 
                        pastry? Coffee?

                                 LEVI
                        No, sir. I’m fine, sir. Thank you, 
                        sir.

           There’s a prolonged silence in the room as Bartholemew stares 
           critically at Levi, clearly sizing him up... 

           After a moment, the man turns to the two officers.

                                 BARTHOLEMEW
                        Colonel. Major. Would you please 
                        let us have the room.
           Levi salutes again, watching silently as the Colonel and the 
           Major stand and exit without a word of protest, shutting the 
           door behind them. 

           Now just the two of them, Bartholemew levels his stare back 
           at Levi...

                                 BARTHOLEMEW (CONT'D)
                        Let’s you and I have a talk...

           EXT. BUNGALOW - UNIVERSITY HEIGHTS - SAN DIEGO - AFTERNOON

           The sun hangs in the afternoon sky.

           Levi, still in dress blues, walks up the sidewalk of a 
           residential neighborhood in San Diego. 

           The mixed houses and lots are small. Some are well kept while 
           others are fenced and dilapidated. 

           Levi turns a corner and steps up to a SMALL CALIFORNIA 
           BUNGALOW with patch of flowers in the tiny front yard.

           Levi KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. 

           A moment later the door opens and...

           RENÉE, a young woman in her mid-twenties stands with her 
           THREE-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER in a BJORN CARRIER strapped to her 
           chest. Deep in the weeds of newborn parenting, it’s clear she 
           wasn’t expecting anyone.

                                 LEVI
                        Hello, Renée.

           By her expression, it’s clear seeing Levi in uniform brings 
           her mixed emotions.

                                 RENÉE
                        Levi...what...what are you doin’ 
                        here?

                                 LEVI
                        I heard you had your baby.

           Renée gazes down, smiling at the infant on her chest. 

                                 RENÉE
                        I sure did.

           Renée turns to the side so Levi can see her daughter’s little 
           sleeping face.
           Levi speaks quietly, to not wake her...

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the baby)
                        Oh, man. Isn’t she something. 
                        Beautiful...

           Clearly in bliss with her child, Renée nods and kisses the 
           top of her daughters head.

                                 RENÉE
                             (tender to her baby)
                        You’re a keeper, aren’t ya, bug?

                                 LEVI
                        Can we talk a minute?

           Renée’s smile fades as she looks at Levi. She pauses, clearly 
           considering...

                                 RENÉE
                        Levi, I can’t invite you inside. I 
                        got a new baby. My husband’s at 
                        work. I’m not going to explain to 
                        him what my ex was doing in the 
                        house...

           Levi looks at her and nods.

                                 LEVI
                        How about we talk outside?

           EXT. YARD - BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Renée, Levi, and the baby sit on a picnic blanket in a small, 
           postage-stamp yard.

           Renée holds her baby, now awake, upright on her lap. 

           The child’s eyes track a iridescent HUMMINGBIRD darting from 
           a sugar-water feeder to the flowers planted in the yard.

                                 LEVI
                        I’ll be gone at least a year.

                                 RENÉE
                        Where?

                                 LEVI
                        Honestly, I don’t know. Mission 
                        details are classified. They didn’t 
                        tell me much of anything. 
                                 RENÉE
                        They’re making you go?

           Levi shakes his head.

                                 LEVI
                        No. They gave me the choice.

                                 RENÉE
                        I didn’t think they did that.

           He looks at her.

                                 LEVI
                        They don’t. 

           Levi sets an MANILA BUSINESS ENVELOPE on the blanket.

                                 RENÉE
                             (re: the envelope)
                        What’s that?

                                 LEVI
                        Some paperwork I want you to 
                        have... 

           Renée shoots him a questioning look.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        I named you as my beneficiary. 
                        You’ll get my veterans benefits, 
                        pension, and death pay... 

           Renée makes a face and shakes her head.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        It’s all set. You don’t have to do 
                        anything... 

                                 RENÉE
                        Levi, I don’t want your money... 

           He looks at her.

                                 LEVI
                        Look, it’s not a lot, but if 
                        something happens...

           Renée looks at him, cutting him off.

                                 RENÉE
                        Levi...what is this? What am I 
                        supposed to say? 
                                 LEVI
                        Renée, come on...

           Levi motions to her baby.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        I just thought if something 
                        happens, you know...you guys could 
                        use the money. I don’t have anybody 
                        else. You know that.

           She looks at him with a hint of softness...

                                 RENÉE
                        Levi...you don’t have me.

           Levi pauses, nodding.

                                 LEVI
                        I know. I know that. And maybe...if 
                        things would have been different...

                                 RENÉE
                             (sternly cutting him off)
                        Don’t. Just...don’t. (pause) Levi, 
                        we cared about each other once. I’m 
                        not denying that. But you’re messed 
                        up. You’re all full of monsters. 
                        You scare me.

           Renée holds her baby’s little hands in hers...

                                 RENÉE (CONT'D)
                             (re: her baby)
                        I never could have 
                        done...this...with you.

           Levi pauses, then nods silently.

                                 LEVI
                        I understand.

           Renée is about to say something more, when her baby STARTS TO 
           CRY...

                                 RENÉE
                        I...I need to feed her.

           Levi nods and stands, INTENTIONALLY LEAVING THE ENVELOPE ON 
           THE BLANKET. 

           Renée tries to hand the envelope back to him but he shakes 
           his head.
                                 LEVI
                             (re: the envelope)
                        Keep it.

           Renée starts to say something but Levi cuts her off...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Please.

           She nods.

                                 RENÉE
                        Okay.

           Levi looks at Renée and her child. 

                                 LEVI
                        I’m happy for ya, Renée. 

           Renée watches Levi as he steps off the lawn and disappears 
           down the sidewalk.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           SUPERTITLE:

                                   VILNIUS, LITHUANIA 

           EXT. CATHEDRAL SQUARE - VILNIUS, LITHUANIA - DAWN

           Pigeons cull in the early morning chill. 

           DRASA, a young woman in her twenties, smokes a cigarette 
           while watching the sun rise over Cathedral Square in old town 
           Vilnius. 

           Her hair cut short, clad in a black leather jacket, with a 
           LION tattooed on her neck...Drasa sits alone on the polished 
           granite base of a TOWERING MONUMENT. 

           Cast in bronze high above her, the 14th century Grand Duke 
           Gediminas, the pagan founder of Vilnius, is depicted as a 
           towering black rider, gripping the blade of his sword in one 
           hand and reins of his armored horse in the other.

           Lost in thought, Drasa takes a final drag, exhaling smoke 
           into the cold morning air. She crushes the cigarette tip 
           between her fingers extinguishing it.
           EXT. PILIES STREET - VILNIUS  - LATER

           With TWO CUPS OF TAKEAWAY COFFEE in her hands, Drasa walks up 
           the medieval cobblestones of Pilies Street as the morning 
           cafes come to life. 

           Somewhere in the distance we can hear an ACCORDION playing a 
           mournful song.

           EXT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As Drasa turns down a narrow passageway, the sound of the 
           music grows louder. 

           Rounding a bend in the passageway we see ERIKAS, a STREET 
           MUSICIAN in his fifties, sitting in a doorway playing his 
           instrument. 

           There’s a cluster of EMPTY WINE BOTTLES and CIGARETTE BUTTS 
           on the ground surrounding him. It’s clear he’s been there 
           playing all night.

           Erikas’ graying hair is matted. His skin is deep red from 
           years of alcohol abuse and sun exposure...but he plays 
           beautifully.

           As Drasa approaches, Erikas sees her and GRINS. 

           MID-NOTE, ERIKAS INSTANTLY CHANGES THE SAD SONG HE IS PLAYING 
           TO A PLUCKY, JOYFUL TUNE TO PUNCTUATE HER ARRIVAL.

           Drasa smiles at her whimsical musical score and sits down in 
           the doorway beside him. 

           She hands him one of the coffees. 

                                 DRASA
                             (in Lithuanian, subtitled)
                        Three sugars.

           Erik smiles and sets his instrument aside. 

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (raising her coffee cup)
                        To music.

           They touch their paper coffee cups together in toast.

                                 ERIKAS
                             (in Lithuanian, subtitled)
                        To music...

           Erikas has a deep gravely voice as he speaks.
                                 ERIKAS (CONT'D)
                             (in Lithuanian, subtitled)
                        Where have you been, little Lion? I 
                        haven’t seen you in weeks...

                                 DRASA
                             (in Lithuanian, subtitled)
                        I was called to a briefing in 
                        Moscow.

           Erikas makes a distasteful face as he easily pivots to 
           speaking English with a thick Lithuanian accent...

                                 ERIKAS
                             (in English)
                        A briefing in Moscow? (a pause) 
                        Fuck Moscow!

           Drasa smiles, looking at the haggard man. She tenderly tucks 
           a tuft of scruffy graying hair out of his face.

                                 DRASA
                             (in English)
                        Daddy, I’m leaving. 

           Erikas looks at her. 

                                 ERIKAS
                        Leaving? But your birthday is 
                        coming soon. Who...who will make 
                        your birthday dinner? 

           She smiles at him warmly.

                                 DRASA
                        I came to say goodbye to you.

           There’s a silence as Erikas absorbs the moment. 

                                 ERIKAS
                        It’s the way it should be. Vilnuis 
                        is too small for a lion like you. 

           Erikas looks at his daughter. 

                                 ERIKAS (CONT'D)
                        Drasa, your life is your life. 
                        You...are yours. Some poor fuckers 
                        never understand that. But 
                        you...you’ve known it since birth. 
                        Whatever you do...whatever your 
                        path, I will love you without 
                        judgement, like you have loved me. 
           Drasa touches her father’s leathery face.

                                 ERIKAS (CONT'D)
                        But you listen to me now and you 
                        listen well...you beware the 
                        invitation to dinner, where the 
                        main course is you.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Blackness.

           We hear the white noise droning sound of A LONG RANGE 
           AIRCRAFT ENGINE...

           SUPERTITLE:

                                        SEPTEMBER

                           SOMEWHERE NORTH OF THE 64TH PARALELL

           INT. UNMARKED TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT - UNKNOWN LOCATION

           Alone, wearing a parachute and military jump gear, Levi 
           sleeps on a cot inside the long, windowless fuselage of an 
           unmarked TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT. 

           Lit by the red interior aircraft light, Levi stirs awake as 
           the forward door suddenly opens and an AIRMAN emerges from 
           the cockpit. 

           His mind slightly foggy from sedation, Levi sits up on the 
           cot as the Airmen approaches deliberately, carrying an 
           ARMORED CASE in his hand. 

           All business, the Airman does not look directly at Levi...

                                 AIRMAN
                             (re: the armored case)
                        Place your right hand on the 
                        biometric pad... 

           Levi places his hand on the attaché case SCAN PAD. 

           An instant later, Levi’s hand is scanned, and a light on the 
           case ILLUMINATES GREEN. 

           The armored case UNLOCKS. 
           The Airman quickly removes a sealed INTELLIGENCE PACKET from 
           the interior of the case...

                                 AIRMAN (CONT'D)
                        Put your ID, your smartphone, and 
                        your watch in the case.

           Levi does as he’s told, placing his ID, IPHONE, and his 
           IWATCH inside the case. 

           The airman locks Levi’s personal items inside.

                                 AIRMAN (CONT'D)
                        No insignias. The colors on your 
                        shoulder. Take em’ off.

           Levi glances at the AMERICAN FLAG PATCH on the shoulder of 
           his jump gear. He shoots the Airman a look.

           The Airman meets Levi’s gaze for the first time.

                                 AIRMAN (CONT'D)
                        You heard me. Take it off. 

           Levi rips the American flag patch off his shoulder and hands 
           it to the Airman.

                                 AIRMAN (CONT'D)
                        In three minutes we reach the edge 
                        of the no fly zone. That’s as far 
                        as we can take you. From the drop, 
                        you’ll hump another 75 kilometers 
                        north on foot. You’re expected by 
                        16:00 hours tomorrow...

           The Airman HANDS LEVI THE INTELLIGENCE PACKET.

                                 AIRMAN (CONT'D)
                             (re: the Intel Packet)
                        ...Open that on the ground.

           As the Airman turns, heading back toward the cockpit, Levi 
           calls after him...

                                 LEVI
                             (calling after him)
                        Hey...

           The Airman glances back at Levi.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Where are we?
                                 AIRMAN
                        That information’s classified.

           INT./EXT. - UNMARKED TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT - MOMENTS LATER

           At 3000 feet, Levi watches the HYDRAULIC JUMP-DOOR SLOWLY 
           OPEN, REVEALING A VISUALLY IMPENETRABLE WALL OF GRAY RAIN 
           CLOUDS. 

           We hear the HIGH-PITCHED RING of the JUMP SIGNAL. 

           LEVI METHODICALLY RECHECKS HIS HARNESS, THEN STEPS OFF THE 
           AIRCRAFT INTO THE NOTHING... 

           EXT. FREEFALL - SECONDS LATER

           Free-falling through the dense cloud layer, Levi controls his 
           breathing as his heart beats in his ears. 

           We feel the rush of air as Levi checks the ALTIMETER strapped 
           to his vest and PULLS HIS D-RING. 

           His CHUTE DEPLOYS above him, jerking his body upright, 
           instantly slowing his descent to a peaceful drift... 

           Somewhere in the clouds above him, Levi hears the hum of the 
           aircraft engine banking, changing directions at the edge of 
           the no-fly zone. 

           The aircraft sound becomes faint, then fades in the distance.

           An instant later, Levi drops out of the low hanging cloud 
           layer REVEALING...

           A VAST, UNTOUCHED LANDSCAPE OF PRISTINE MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS. 

           1200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, LEVI SCANS THE HORIZON IN ALL 
           DIRECTIONS...THERE’S NOTHING BUT DENSE FOREST VALLEYS AND 
           JAGGED ROCKY PEAKS. 

           THERE’S NO SIGN OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT.

           Below, Levi eyes A RIVER, snaking through the landscape, as a 
           landing site...

           EXT. RIVER BANK - UNKNOWN WILDERNESS - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi lands on his feet on the gravel river bank.

           Light rain falls on the river surface as he quickly removes 
           his harness and gathers his chute.
           The air is cool as Levi kneels, pulling the sealed 
           intelligence packet from his vest. He tears the packet open 
           REVEALING a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP, an ORIENTEERING COMPASS on a 
           lanyard, and an ANALOGUE WRIST WATCH.

           Levi puts on the watch, places the compass around his neck, 
           and unfolds the map...

           CLOSE ON MAP: A SPECIFIC POINT IS MARKED IN RED ON THE FAR 
           NORTHERN EDGE OF THE MAP...75 KILOMETERS FROM HIS POSITION.

           He checks the compass, then LOOKS TO THE NORTH AT THE SEA OF 
           JAGGED MOUNTAIN PEAKS RISING ON THE HORIZON.

           Levi stows the map in his vest, adjusts his pack, and begins 
           hiking north up river...

           EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - UNKNOWN WILDERNESS - PASSAGE OF TIME

           As the rain’s intensity ebbs and flows, we see a SERIES OF 
           SHOTS TRACKING LEVI’S JOURNEY NORTH...

           -LEVI FOLLOWS THE RIVER INTO THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS...

           -WITH HIS PACK HELD OVER HIS HEAD, LEVI FIGHTS TO KEEP HIS 
           BALANCE IN THE SWIFT CURRENT AS HE FORGES ACROSS A RUSHING 
           RIVER...

           -THE RAIN POURS HARDER AS LEVI CLIMBS UP A NARROW ROCK 
           FISSURE TO HIGHER GROUND...

           -NIGHT FALLS, LEVI, IN A MAKESHIFT SHELTER, BRACING AGAINST 
           THE PENETRATING DAMP COLD BY A SMALL CAMPFIRE...

           -DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY - LEVI TAKES A COMPASS BERING AND 
           CHECKS THE MAP...

           -LEVI HIKES ALONG THE NARROW, KNIFE-EDGE RIDGE OF A VAST 
           MOUNTAINSCAPE...

           EXT. CONIFER FOREST - UNKNOWN WILDERNESS - AFTERNOON

           The rain has eased. 

           CROWS call in distance as Levi silently walks though a dense 
           forest of towering pines.

           As Levi nears the edge of the forest, he stops mid-stride, as 
           if SENSING SOMETHING...

           Levi drops to one knee and scans his surroundings for 
           movement. 
           He sees nothing.

           A moment passes as the sun finally breaks out of the low 
           hanging rain clouds, BATHING THE EDGE OF THE FOREST IN WARM 
           SUNLIGHT...

           SUDDENLY, LEVI NOTICES A GLINT OF LIGHT CAUGHT IN THE TINY 
           WATER DROPLETS HANGING OFF A MATRIX OF NEARLY INVISIBLE TRIP-
           WIRES. 

           Levi eyes the trip-wires, carefully stepping over them... 

           EXT. THE GORGE - WESTERN EDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Levi emerges out of the pine forest, he stands on the 
           western edge of a MASSIVE GORGE.

           SPANNING 600 METERS ACROSS TO THE FAR EASTERN SIDE, THE 
           GORGE’S UNBELIVABLE SIZE IS DIZZYING. 

           A DENSE LAYER OF FOG LIES IN THE GORGE BELOW, SHROUDING 
           WHATEVER LIES AT THE DISTANT BOTTOM.

           LEVI TAKES A TENTATIVE STEP FORWARD, GLANCING OVER THE EDGE, 
           REVEALING...

           TWENTY-FEET BELOW THE LIP OF THE GORGE, LEVI SEES A MAN-MADE, 
           EXPANDED STEEL CONTAINMENT FENCE ANCHORED AND CANTILEVERED 
           OUT FROM THE GORGE WALL. 

           THE OUSTRETCHED CONTAINEMENT FENCE EXTENDS NORTH TO SOUTH 
           ALONG THE GORGE LIP AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. 

           COILS OF RAZOR WIRE TOP THE FENCE.

           LIKE DEADLY ORNIMENTS, HUNDREDS OF OMINOUS, SPHERICAL COMBAT 
           MINES HANG FROM THE BARRIER ON STEEL CABLES, DANGLING DOWN AT 
           VARYING DEPTHS INTO THE THICK FOG BELOW. 

                                 LEVI
                             (Re: the gorge, to 
                              himself)
                        What the hell is this...

           Suddenly Levi hears a MAN’S VOICE in the distance...

                                 J.D. (O.S.)
                             (Australian accent)
                        At long last, my sweet prince has 
                        come! 

           Levy pivots toward the voice...
           J.D., a young man in camouflage with a S.A.W. (M249)LIGHT 
           MACHINE GUN slung on his shoulder, makes his way along the 
           lip of the gorge toward Levi.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Punctual, even! Spot on time. What 
                        a guy... 

           Levi raises his right hand to his eye-line in salute...

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Oh fuck, don’t salute me, mate. 
                        We’re not even in the same fuckin’ 
                        army.

           Levi appears thrown for an instant, as J.D. extends his hand. 

           Levi shakes it.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        J.D. Tillman, Aussie S.A.S. Second 
                        Sabre Squadron.

                                 LEVI
                        Levi Rush, USMC Special Operations 
                        Group Scout Sniper.

           Theres a brief pause...

                                 J.D.
                        So...what’d they tell you about 
                        this mission?

                                 LEVI
                        Nothing. Not a thing. (pause) I’ve 
                        got an unmarked topo map. I don’t 
                        even know where I am...

           J.D. nods and smiles...

                                 J.D.
                        I’ve been here an entire year and I 
                        don’t know where I am.

           Levi shoots him a look.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                             (off Levi’s look)
                        Fucked up, right? We’ll that’s just 
                        the very tip of the iceberg of 
                        fucked-up-ed-ness. (pause) Come on, 
                        let’s head to the O.P..
           EXT. WESTERN RIM TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           The sun sinks low on the jagged, mountainous horizon.

           Levi and J.D. hike along the western edge of the gorge in mid-
           conversation... 

                                 LEVI
                        So...I’m sorry...what are you 
                        saying?

                                 J.D.
                        I’m saying, you’re the first 
                        fucking person I’ve spoken to face 
                        to face in a year...

                                 LEVI
                        You’re all alone out here?

                                 J.D.
                        That’s right. And my tour rotation 
                        is officially over at midnight, and 
                        yours is about to begin. 

                                 LEVI
                        I’m essentially your...relief?

                                 J.D.
                        Affirmative.

           For a long moment the men hike in silence as Levi absorbs the 
           information.

                                 LEVI
                        I have a shit-ton of questions...

           At that moment, they round the bend REVEALING...

           EXT. WESTERN RIM TOWER OBSERVATION POST - GORGE - CONTINUOUS

           A decades old, heavily fortified, 20-meter high concrete 
           TOWER OBSERVATION POST (O.P.) perches on the western rim of 
           the gorge. 

           A CIRCULAR OBSERVATION PLATFORM rests atop the tower looking 
           out over the vast gorge.

                                 J.D.
                             (re: the tower)
                        There she is...West Tower. Your 
                        home away from home for the next 
                        365 days. Completely self-
                        sufficient.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Solar with a generator backup. Rain 
                        cistern. Wild game is plentiful. 
                        There’s a garden out back and a 
                        bath house. Everything you need...

           600 meters directly across the abyss-like Gorge, on the 
           eastern rim, RESTS A SECOND OBSERVATION TOWER. 

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the far tower)
                        What’s that on the other side?

           J.D. glances across the gorge.

                                 J.D.
                        That’s East Tower. Don’t worry 
                        about them. They’re not your 
                        problem. (pause) I saw some 
                        movement over there early this 
                        morning. I think they just did 
                        their annual rotation, too.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Levi and J.D. sit in hand-made Adirondack chairs on the tower 
           observation platform. 

           There’s a long range SPOTTING SCOPE and a .50 CALIBER SNIPER 
           RIFLE on a bipod rest nearby. 

           Mounted to the platform rails are several 10k DIRECTIONAL 
           SEARCH LIGHTS.

           They eat a home-cooked meal of ELK STEAK AND GARDEN 
           VEGETABLES as they watch the last of the daylight fade in the 
           mountains.

                                 J.D.
                        Theoretically, your job is 
                        simple...everyday you walk the 
                        western rim. The gorge runs eight 
                        klicks to the south and nine to the 
                        north. You check the containment 
                        fence, the Cloakers, and the 
                        suspended mines. (pause) You ever 
                        work with contact mines before?

                                 LEVI
                        A bit.
                                 J.D.
                        They couldn’t be more basic. Hang 
                        em’, arm em’, and then you touch 
                        em’...they blow the fuck up. By the 
                        way, there’s an armory in the 
                        basement bunker. Weapons. Tools. 
                        Replacement mines. Whatever you 
                        need. Radio check every 30 days. 
                        And you have to keep a tower log, 
                        each day of the mission for the 
                        year...  

                                 LEVI
                             (interjecting)
                        Hold on, what’s a Cloaker?

                                 J.D.
                        Cloakers are a type of...satellite 
                        transmitter. There’s one every 
                        kilometer or so on the rim.

                                 LEVI
                        What do they do?

                                 J.D.
                        They...cloak. 

           J.D. smiles....

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        They send a false signal to all the 
                        satellites that pass over head in a 
                        given day. They’re designed to 
                        render the gorge invisible to spy 
                        satellites, but also work on shit 
                        like google earth. (pause) There’s 
                        no outside contact here. No cell, 
                        no SAT, no nothin’. In the event 
                        your position is overrun, there’s a 
                        panic button on the dedicated 
                        shortwave radio you use for your 
                        monthly radio checks. Button 
                        triggers a beacon that lets them 
                        know...

                                 LEVI
                        Lets who know?

                                 J.D.
                        The powers that be, mate. 
                        Whoever...

           Levi’s expression grows more skeptical.
           J.D. takes a deep breath, as if gearing up to explain...

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Look, here’s the deal...this place 
                        is old. Like end of World War II 
                        early cold war shit. It’s a secret. 
                        Way back then, an agreement was 
                        made and a coalition was formed to 
                        keep it a secret. So every year, a 
                        representative from one of the 
                        original western nations patrols 
                        the western rim. And someone from 
                        the other side patrols the eastern 
                        rim. They’re your counterpart.

           Levi is silent for a beat.

                                 LEVI
                        You’re telling me the leaders of 
                        the east and west have secretly 
                        been working together for the last 
                        seventy-five years?

                                 J.D.
                        Nope. I’m telling you, there’s been 
                        nine Soviet-Russian heads of state 
                        and thirteen U.S. Presidents since 
                        the coalition was formed...and not 
                        one of them has known about the 
                        gorge. 

           J.D. pours LIQUOR from a suspect-looking canister into a tin 
           cup for Levi.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                             (re: the liquor)
                        Here, mate. Give that a spin.

           Levi smells the cup, then takes a swallow.

                                 LEVI
                        That’s...that’s actually pretty 
                        decent...

                                 J.D.
                             (nodding)
                        Am I right? The still is in the 
                        bunker. Recipe’s been passed down 
                        for decades. Don’t fuck it up.

           Levi smiles.
                                 LEVI
                        Listen, man. I’m sorry, but I’m 
                        missing something. Other than 
                        keeping this place a secret...what 
                        the fuck is the actual mission? I’m 
                        trying to keep people from going in 
                        the gorge?

           There’s a beat as J.D. looks at Levi.

                                 J.D.
                        No, mate. You’re trying keep what’s 
                        in the gorge...from coming out.

           There’s a loaded silence as Levi stares blankly at J.D.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                             (off Levi’s look)
                        One year ago, I was in your shoes. 
                        My predecessor gave me the same 
                        speech. And how did I respond?

                                 LEVI
                        Go fuck yourself.

           J.D. laughs...

                                 J.D.
                        Exactly!

           WITHOUT WARNING, J.D. STABS HIS FORK INTO THE ELK STEAK ON 
           LEVI’S TIN PLATE AND PITCHES IT OFF THE OBSERVATION DECK FAR 
           OUT INTO THE GORGE... 

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, I was...

           The falling meat disappears into the fog layer below...

                                 J.D.
                        Shush! Listen!

           Levi falls silent as both men listen...

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Takes about eight seconds to reach 
                        the bottom...

           There’s a brief beat of silence, then from somewhere below 
           the fog layer...

           A SUDDEN SYMPHONY OF HIDEOUS, CHILLING, INHUMAN SHRIEKS ERUPT 
           FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GORGE, ECHOING THROUGH THE VAST, DARK 
           LANDSCAPE...
           Levi looks at J.D..

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the sound)
                        What the fuck is that?

           J.D. looks at him.

                                 J.D.
                        We call them Hollowmen. (pause) 
                        Nobody really knows what they are. 
                        I don’t even know why they’re 
                        called that...

                                 LEVI
                             (interjecting)
                        That’s the name of a poem written 
                        like, a hundred years ago...

                                 J.D.
                             (cutting him off)
                        Well, I don’t know anything about 
                        that. All I know is somebody who 
                        had our job called them that a 
                        long, long time ago, and the name 
                        stuck... 

           J.D. refills their tin cups with his home distilled liquor.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        What I can tell you is in the mid-
                        1950’s, they sent an entire 
                        battalion down into the gorge to 
                        clean them out. (pause) Not a 
                        single man returned. After that, 
                        they shifted to a purely 
                        containment strategy. 

           Levi stares at J.D..

                                 LEVI
                        J.D...come on, man. What the fuck 
                        is really going on here?

                                 J.D.
                        Well, there’s been a lot of 
                        theories over the years about what 
                        the fuck is really going on here...

                                 LEVI
                        And?
                                 J.D.
                        And the theory I think summaries 
                        the situation most succinctly is... 
                        the Gorge is a door to Hell...and 
                        we are standing guard at the gate.

           EXT. WEST TOWER - 05:00 HOURS - THE NEXT MORNING

           First light rises over the eastern rim.

           J.D.’s breath is visible in the cold morning air as he 
           shoulders his heavy pack, preparing to depart.

           Levi stands a few feet away in the sand-bagged entrance to 
           west tower seeing him off.

           J.D. reads Levi’s pensive expression...

                                 J.D.
                        Keep it simple, mate. Day by day. 
                        Anything that tries to crawl outta’ 
                        there, just put a hole in it and 
                        send it back in. 

           Levi nods.

                                 LEVI
                        You must be pretty psyched to get 
                        back to the world...

           J.D. pauses, clearly hesitant.

                                 J.D.
                        Levi...there’s one other thing. I 
                        don’t know whether to tell you or 
                        not. When my predecessor told me, 
                        it really fucked with my head. But 
                        I think you have the right to 
                        know...

           Levi looks J.D. in the eye.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Maintaining the secrecy of the 
                        gorge is clearly of paramount 
                        importance. The logs of the 
                        previous tower sentries are full of 
                        theories and rumors. In some cases, 
                        they’re more like diaries. If you 
                        read some of them, you may feel a 
                        kinship with them. I know I did.

                                 (MORE)
                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        People have even written about 
                        wanting to look up previous 
                        sentries after their tour, but...

                                 LEVI
                             (interrupting)
                        I feel like you’re burying the lead 
                        here, J.D...

           J.D. pauses.

                                 J.D.
                        There’s a running theory that when 
                        our tours are done...they kill us. 

           Levi falls silent, absorbing J.D.’s comment.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Don’t know if it’s true...or it’s 
                        just people left alone with their 
                        thoughts too long.

           J.D. adjusts his pack straps and SLIDES A FULLY LOADED 
           MAGAZINE INTO HIS COMPACT M-4 RIFLE.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        I reckon I’m gonna’ find out.

           J.D. extends his hand. 

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Good luck, mate.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

           Moments later, Levi watches from the outside the tower as 
           J.D., wearing his heavy pack and rifle, disappears into the 
           distant tree line. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Blackness.

           We hear the ROLL OF THUNDER AND HOWLING OF WIND...

           EXT. WEST TOWER - A WEEK LATER- NIGHT

           Lightning illuminates the heavens.
           Hard rain lashes West Tower as a powerful storm system rolls 
           over the wilderness landscape.

           The dark tree line sways wildly in the wind as if it were 
           alive... 

           INT. LIVING QUARTERS - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Rain strikes the tower window.

           The open room is spotless and well kept in military fashion.

           The small kitchen is clean and dishes put away. 

           In the opposite corner is a neatly made bunk. 

           A long bookshelf lines the wall, filled with 75 years of 
           annual LOG BOOKS dating back to the mid-1940’s. 

           The books are nearly identical, with the styles of the book 
           evolving slightly over the decades. 

           Each individual log has the spine LABELED WITH THE YEAR, THE 
           NAME OF THE SENTRY ON DUTY, AND THEIR VARIOUS HOME COUNTRY OF 
           ORIGIN. 

           The MOST RECENT LOG BOOK is J.D.’s.

           Levi stands at the bookshelf. He hasn’t shaved in a week.

           Slowly he runs his hand down the long row of log books, 
           scanning the spines, going back decades further and further 
           in time...

           CLOSE ON A SAMPLE OF LOG TITLES:

                                COTTER - 1999-00 - IRELAND

                                 SOJKA - 1985-86 - POLAND

                                 GAGNE - 1973-74 - FRANCE

                            KRAMER - 1964-1965 - UNITED STATES

                            SHESHUNOFF - 1957-58 - WEST GERMANY

                             WHITE - 1948-49 - UNITED KINGDOM

           At random, Levi selects: WHITE - 1948-49 - UNITED KINGDOM...

           Levi sits in a chair by the window and opens the log to a 
           random page. 
           As he begins to read to himself we hear the VOICE OF WHITE 
           from the entry...

                                 WHITE (V.O.)
                             (British accent, reading 
                              entry)
                        September 21, 1948. Like many 
                        creatures in the wild, they seem 
                        most active in the transition 
                        period between day and night. 
                        Perhaps they hunt in the twilight 
                        and bed-down midday and dead of the 
                        night. But this is, of course, 
                        conjecture. Considering the 
                        relentless fog layer, it’s 
                        difficult to imagine how much 
                        sunlight ever enters the gorge 
                        below...

           White’s voice ceases as Levi pauses from reading. 

           He skips ahead several months and opens to an entry later in 
           the log...

                                 WHITE (V.O.)
                        April 22, 1949. After four months 
                        of silence, the Hollowmen began 
                        again last night. By 21:00 hours 
                        the noise was deafening. I thought 
                        I was going mad. I took two 
                        Benzedrine tablets, filled my ears 
                        with bandage cotton, and hauled an 
                        additional 1000 rounds of .308 
                        ammunition to the platform. I 
                        watched the rim until day break. I 
                        never fired a shot. I never saw a 
                        thing.

           Levi pauses. The rain strikes the tower window. 

           Levi turns, staring out the wet glass into the stormy night, 
           tracking his gaze far out across the abyss of the gorge 
           to...the distant, TINY YELLOW WINDOWFRAME OF LIGHT IN THE 
           EAST TOWER.

           EXT. WEST TOWER - THE NEXT MORNING

           The storm has passed. 

           Thick fog blankets the gorge as Levi steps out of the tower 
           dressed in military bush fatigues. 
           Prepped for his morning patrol, he is armed with the S.A.W. 
           (M249) and a pair of FIELD BINOCULARS.

           EXT. WESTERN RIM TRAIL - MID-MORNING

           Wind blown branches and leaves scatter the trail as shafts of 
           sunlight break through the moody morning sky.

           Levi hikes south along the jagged western rim of the gorge, 
           checking the suspended mines and containment fence. 

           EXT. CLOAKER 9 - WESTERN RIM TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Rounding a bend, Levi approaches a five-meter diameter 
           SATELLITE DISH INSTALLATION, painted camouflage and obscured 
           by radar netting. This is a CLOAKER, one of 16 situated along 
           the western rim.

           Levi inserts a TITANIUM KEY on a neck chain into the 
           Cloaker’s control panel and TURNS IT TO THE LEFT to “SYSTEM 
           CHECK” POSITION. 

           A GREEN LIGHT ILLUMINATES ON PANEL, INDICATING THE CLOAKER IS 
           FULLY OPERATIONAL AND FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY.  

           Levi turns it back to “ON” position, slides the key around 
           his neck, and continues down the rim trail checking the 
           containment fence.

           EXT. WEST TOWER - AFTERNOON

           Returning from his patrol, Levi emerges from the wooded, 
           northern end of the rim trail with his S.A.W. slung over his 
           shoulder. 

           The autumn day has turned warm, and Levi’s tee-shirt is 
           soaked in sweat from the long hike.  

           As Levi crosses the clearing to West tower, he suddenly hears 
           the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW somewhere far off in the distance. 

           Levi pauses, following the sound, peering far across the 
           gorge toward East Tower...where he sees the TINY SILHOUETTE 
           OF A PERSON moving in the afternoon sun...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi steps deliberately out onto the West Tower observation 
           platform and reaches for the long range SPOTTING SCOPE, as we 
           SHIFT TO...
           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SPOTTING SCOPE: Magnified by a power of 
           50x, Levi adjusts the scope’s FOCAL RING, bringing EAST TOWER 
           INTO CRISP FOCUS...  

           After a moment of scanning the east rim, Levi locates the 
           person...HIS UNSEEN EAST TOWER COUNTERPART. 

           With their back turned away from Levi, the Counterpart leans 
           with a heavy chainsaw, cutting the thick branches of a tree 
           that fell during the previous nights storm, blocking their 
           shooting lane to the south.

           After a long moment of sawing, the Counterpart PAUSES MID-
           CUT...AS IF SOMEHOW SENSING THEY ARE BEING WATCHED...

           The Counterpart kills the saw engine and suddenly turns 
           toward the western rim REVEALING THEIR FACE...

           We see DRASA, THE LITHUANIAN, STARING BACK AT LEVI ACROSS THE 
           GORGE...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           SUPERTITLE:

                                         OCTOBER

           Blackness. 

           We hear the amplified crackle of a RECORD PLAYER NEEDLE being 
           gently placed on a spinning TURN TABLE...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. EAST TOWER - KITCHEN - EASTERN RIM - MORNING

           CLOSE UP ON: TWO STICKS OF BUTTER land in the bottom of a 
           heavy, stainless steel COOKING POT and immediately beginning 
           to melt as...

           WE HEAR THE SUDDEN, SEARING ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRODUCTION to 
           the Iggy and the Stooges, 1973 punk rock anthem, SEARCH AND 
           DESTROY*.

           We SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL...

           Drasa THRASH DANCING to the music over the kitchen stove in a 
           tank top, camouflage fatigue pants, and a loaded SIDEARM.

           A decades old, HI-FI STEREO RECORD PLAYER BLASTS MUSIC 
           as...Drasa ADDS TWO CUPS OF SUGAR to the pot, belting out the 
           lyrics, word for word, with the gravelly voice of Iggy Pop...
                                 DRASA
                             (at the top of her lungs)
                        I’m a streetwalking cheetah with a 
                        heart full of napalm... 

           As she sings, Drasa adds A CUP OF HONEY to the butter and 
           sugar simmering in the pot...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        I’m the runaway son of a nuclear A-
                        bomb...

           Drasa pitches in a pinch of CINNAMON, SALT, quickly removes 
           the pot from the stove and begins to WHISK IN EGGS, AND 
           FLOUR...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (singing)
                        I am the world’s forgotten boy, 
                        the one who searches and destroys!

           She pours the cake batter into a circular BAKING PAN and 
           slides it into the oven.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (singing the chorus)
                        Honey gotta help me please, 
                        somebody gotta save my soul, 
                        Baby detonate for me!!!

           INT. EAST TOWER - ALCOHOL RESERVE - MOMENTS LATER

           The MUSIC CONTINUES as...

           Drasa opens a locked cabinet, revealing a reserve of various 
           ALCOHOL BOTTLES.

           She selects a dusty BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. She shuts the 
           cabinet and roars out the chorus into the neck of the 
           champagne bottle like a microphone...

                                 DRASA
                             (singing into bottle)
                        Honey gotta help me please, 
                        somebody gotta save my soul, 
                        Baby, penetrate my mind!

           We hear the POP OF THE CHAMPAGNE CORK as we CUT TO...
           INT. TABLE - EAST TOWER - EASTERN RIM - AN HOUR LATER

           The music has ceased. 

           East tower is quiet as Drasa sits alone at the small table.

           In birthday tradition, she has DECORATED HER CHAIR WITH A 
           HAND MADE GARLAND OF AUTUMN LEAVES AND FLOWERS.

           A SINGLE CANDLE BURNS in the layered LITHUANIAN HONEY CAKE 
           she’s baked...

                                 DRASA
                             (singing to herself, in 
                              Lithuanian, subtitled)
                        May you have a very long life, 
                        may you have a very long life, 
                        we wish you a very long life. 
                        Valio, Valio, Valio.

           In the lonely silence following the absence of her voice, 
           Drasa leans forward and BLOWS OUT THE CANDLE.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi sits in an Adirondack chair on west tower platform 
           reading from a former sentry log. 

           The spine of the log reads: 

                            SHESHUNOFF - 1955-56 - WEST GERMANY

           As Levi reads a random entry we hear the VOICE OF 
           SHESHUNOFF...

                                 SHESHUNOFF (V.O.)
                             (German accent, reading 
                              entry)
                        November 2, 1955. It has been five 
                        weeks since the battalion embarked 
                        on horseback down into the gorge. 
                        With the exception of the 
                        aforementioned small arms fire I 
                        heard the initial week following 
                        their departure, it has been all 
                        but silent. I have no information. 
                        Not one has returned. How can 900 
                        armed men simply disappear? 
           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           A brisk October breeze blows in the trees as Drasa steps out 
           onto the East Tower observation platform.

           A Russian DShK (Dushka) HEAVY MACHINE GUN and SPOTTING SCOPE 
           are mounted on the deck rail nearby.

           Drasa takes a swallow from the champagne bottle. She watches 
           the yellow autumn leaves scatter on the breeze, tumbling 
           downward and disappearing into the foggy gorge below.

           As she fishes A CIGARETTE from her pack, Drasa notices 
           distant movement on the Western Tower observation platform.

           She lights the cigarette and steps over to the spotting 
           scope, peering through the view finder as we SHIFT TO:

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: She sees Levi, her western 
           counterpart, sitting in an Adirondack chair, reading a log 
           book. 

           Drasa steps back from the scope and takes a long drag on her 
           cigarette, clearly considering something.

           She sets her cigarette on the rail, and quickly steps back 
           inside East Tower for something... 

           Drasa reemerges a moment later with SOMETHING UNSEEN under 
           her arm.

           She picks up her smoke off the rail and takes a final drag, 
           then pinches it out, saving the rest for later.

           Drasa draws her SEMI-AUTOMATIC HANDGUN from her hip holster, 
           raises the muzzle to the sky, and FIRES A SINGLE SHOT.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           At the sound of the DISTANT GUNSHOT, Levi immediately sets 
           aside the log.

           Levi stands from his chair and steps over to his spotting 
           scope. He peers at East Tower...

           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Arms crossed, Drasa stares 
           stone-faced back at Levi...then suddenly she SMILES.

           She HOLDS UP A PIECE OF PAPER in front of her. 
           Levi quickly ADJUSTS THE FOCAL RING to focus on the paper, 
           REVEALING A HAND WRITTEN MESSAGE in English in marker...

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                                    WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

           Reading the message, Levi SMILES.

           Levi steps back from his scope, pausing to think, then RAISES 
           HIS INDEX FINGER, as if to indicate...hold on a second.

           Levi hurries inside West Tower, only to return a moment later 
           with a DRY ERASE WIPE BOARD from the kitchen.

           Levi scribbles something unseen on the wipe board and holds 
           it up for her view...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Drasa GRINS as she peers through her scope view finder at 
           Levi’s message...

           LEVI’S WIPE BOARD READS:

                                   I’M NOT THAT EASY. 

                                    WHAT’S YOUR NAME?

           Drasa writes on another piece of paper and holds it up...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Through the scope, Levi reads her message...

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                                    MY NAME IS DRASA.

                                  TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY. 

           Levi pauses to think, then reaches for J.D.’s suspicious 
           LIQUOR CANISTER and POURS AN INCH into his cup. 

           He writes on the wipe board and displays it...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Drasa peers through her scope at Levi’s message...

           LEVI’S WIPE BOARD READS:
                                    MY NAME IS LEVI. 

                                HOW ABOUT WE RAISE A GLASS 

                                    FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

           Drasa sees Levi RAISE HIS TIN CUP in cheers.

           Drasa GRINS and raises her CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE as the two TOAST 
           ACROSS THE VAST 600 METER EXPANSE OF THE GORGE.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SUNSET

           The sun sinks on the horizon, bathing the autumn evening in a 
           rich, golden light. 

           Drasa has dragged the stereo SPEAKERS out onto the East Tower 
           platform...

           INT. LIVING QUARTERS - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Drasa quickly rifles through East Tower’s huge collection of 
           VINYL LP RECORDS - mostly old Eastern European and Soviet era 
           pirated copies of western music.

           Drasa selects an album, places it on the spinning HI FI TURN-
           TABLE, and sets the needle...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           As Drasa DANCES out onto the platform with a SECOND BOTTLE OF 
           CHAMPAGNE...

           The stereo SPEAKERS IGNITE with the OSCILLATING STRUM of an F 
           and C chord on electric guitar, joined by drums and 
           bass..leading into the thunderous intro to The Clash’s 1979 
           song, DEATH OR GLORY*...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           The SKA PUNK music echoes across vast gorge to West Tower 
           platform.

           Levi grins and refills his tin cup with J.D.’s moonshine, 
           setting the canister on the platform rail.

           With a solid liquor buzz, Levi checks the scope viewfinder. 

           Dancing, Drasa HOLDS UP A NEW MESSAGE. 
           P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE, Levi reads it...

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                                LET’S SEE YOUR MOVES, LEVI.

           Levi smiles and shakes his head. 

           He scribbles on his wipe board and displays it...

           CLOSE ON LEVI’S WIPE BOARD:

                             NO CAN DO. I’M A TERRIBLE DANCER.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Drasa makes a face and HOLDS UP A NEW MESSAGE. 

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                           WELL YOU MUST BE GOOD AT SOMETHING? 

                                     WHAT CAN YOU DO?

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           Levi pauses thinking, then scribbles on his wipe board and 
           displays it...

           CLOSE ON LEVI’S WIPE BOARD:

                                 I’M A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Reading his message, Drasa pauses, then SETS HER CHAMPAGNE 
           BOTTLE ON THE PLATFORM RAIL.

           She quickly writes and HOLDS UP A NEW MESSAGE. 

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                                        HOW GOOD? 

           With the music rocking from the speakers, DRASA MOTIONS 
           DRAMATICALLY TO THE BOTTLE ON THE RAIL BESIDE HER, AS IF TO 
           SAY...SHOOT IT. 
           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Realizing what Drasa is implying, Levi MAKES A FACE. 

           HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AS IF DRASA IS OUT OF HER MIND...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Drasa sees Levi’s sheepish reaction through the her scope.

           Without hesitation, she REACHES FOR THE RUSSIAN TOCHNOST 
           RIFLE leaning beside her, RACKS A LIVE ROUND INTO THE 
           CHAMBER, TAKES AIM CROSS THE GORGE AND FIRES... 

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Levi flinches as a .338 BULLET PUNCHES CLEAN THROUGH J.D.’S 
           ALUMINUM LIQUOR CANISTER nearby on the railing, sending it 
           end over end onto the platform floor.

           Levi stares wide eyed at the PUNCTURED CANISTER AS THE LIQUOR 
           DRAINS OUT ONTO THE PLATFORM FLOOR.

                                 LEVI
                        What the fuck...

           Levi looks out across the gorge at Drasa as the MUSIC 
           BLASTS...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (to himself)
                        Oh...Okay...I see...

           Levi SEIZES HIS BARRET M82 RIFLE, racks the action, rests the 
           barrel on the rail, exhales as he aims, and FIRES...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SPLIT SECOND LATER

           The CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE EXPLODES on the rail, sending fragments 
           of glass and Champagne foam everywhere.

           The Clash song ends and theres a beat of sudden quiet as 
           champagne runs down the platform railing.

           Drasa suddenly BURSTS INTO HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 

           GRINNING EAR TO EAR, she picks SMALL SHARDS OF GLASS OUT OF 
           HER FOREARM and HAIR. 

           Drasa giggles to herself as reaches for the FIRST EMPTY 
           BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE she drank. 
           Drasa carefully BALANCES THE EMPTY BOTTLE ON TOP OF HER HEAD. 

           She smiles at Levi across the gorge...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Levi stares at Drasa through his rifle scope...

                                 LEVI
                             (to himself, re: the 
                              bottle on her head)
                        This chick is fuckin’ crazy...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Watched through the scope, Drasa smiles coyly with the bottle 
           on her head, clearly curious about her counterpart’s 
           reaction, when...

           SUDDENLY DRASA’S PLAYFUL EXPRESSION VANISHES, INSTANTLY 
           TURNING TO VISCERAL FEAR...

           She SCREAMS...

                                 DRASA
                             (screaming)
                        BENEATH YOU!!!!

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Through the scope, Levi can’t make out Drasa’s words, but he 
           READS THE EXPRESSION ON HER FACE...

           HE INSTANTLY PIVOTS FROM THE SCOPE, PEERING DOWN OVER THE 
           EDGE OF THE GORGE BELOW HIM...

           HE SEES SIX ‘HOLLOWMEN’ CLIMBING UPWARD OUT OF THE FOG 
           LAYER...AGGRESSIVELY SCALING THE WESTERN GORGE WALL BENEATH 
           HIS POSITION. 

           They are nightmarish creatures, resembling something that 
           were once perhaps human, but no longer...RIB-THIN AND VEINED, 
           WITH GHOULISH DEAD GREY FLESH AND RABID, FRENETIC EYES AND 
           BONE WHITE PUPILS. 

           LEVI SWINGS HIS RIFLE, TAKING AIM, BUT...

           IN THAT INSTANT, ONE OF THE CONTACT MINES SUSPENDED IN THE 
           GORGE BELOW IS DISTURBED, DETONATING WITH UNBELIEVABLE FORCE.
           A BLAST WAVE SURGES UP THE CANYON WALL, KNOCKING LEVI OFF HIS 
           FEET AND NEARLY OFF THE WEST TOWER PLATFORM.

           Four of the creatures are BLOWN OFF THE GORGE WALL by the 
           mine’s concussion...their shrapnel tattered bodies plummet 
           back into the dense fog layer below. 

           But two Hollowmen continue to scale upward, quickly closing 
           the distance to the gorge containment wall...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Pitching the champagne bottle aside, Drasa surges for the 
           DUSHKA HEAVY MACHINE-GUN mounted on the platform. 

           She racks back the action, grips the two V-SHAPED BUTTERFLY 
           TRIGGER with both hands, and OPENS FIRE...

           The fierce recoil of the heavy gun shakes Drasa’a body as SHE 
           BENDS AN ARC OF FULLY AUTOMATIC .50 CALIBER FIRE ACROSS THE 
           GORGE... 

           EXT. WESTERN GORGE WALL - A SECOND LATER

           The GREEN TRACER STREAM OF LARGE CALIBER ROUNDS STRIKE the 
           western gorge wall, CUTTING APART the two remaining 
           Hollowmen...shooting them off the wall before they reach the 
           containment fence.

           Their SHRIEKS fade as they fall downward into the mist. 

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           There is a beat of silence as Drasa stops firing. Her heart 
           pounds as she takes a breath. 

           Her ears ring from the Dushka’s deafening sound.

           Exhaling, she scans the distant western wall for movement as 
           the last of the sun slips behind the mountains. 

           She sees nothing.

           Suddenly Drasa hears a nearby, guttural RASPING SOUND. 

           She shifts her gaze from the far western wall to the Eastern 
           containment fence directly below her, REVEALING...

           NINE more HOLLOWMEN, clinging to the Eastern Gorge wall below 
           her. 
           THEIR MACABRE, DECAYING BODIES SLOWLY CRAWL AROUND THE 
           SUSPENDED CONTACT MINES, ATTEMPTING TO AVOID THEM... 

                                 DRASA
                             (to herself, in 
                              Lithuanian)
                        Mother of god...

           As the lead creature reaches the fence, A HIGH VELOCITY 
           SNIPER BULLET FROM WESTERN TOWER PUNCHES THROUGH IT’S HEAD. 

           Drasa glances up, seeing Levi ACROSS THE GORGE WITH HIS RIFLE 
           POISED...

           The creature’s body goes slack, falling backward off the rock 
           face, BRUSHING AGAINST A HANGING CONTACT MINE. 

           THE MINE IS TRIGGERED, EXPLODING, SETTING OFF A CHAIN 
           REACTION, DETONATING TWO MORE MINES...

           Drasa is STRUCK with a piece of HOT MINE SHRAPNEL, knocking 
           her body to the floor. 

           Blood flares from her shoulder as Drasa SCREAMS in pain, 
           writhing as the fragment of HOT METAL SIZZLES IN THE WOUND.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           In that instant, from across the gorge, Levi sees another 
           WAVE OF CREATURES on the Eastern wall, climbing out of the 
           fog layer...

           Levi sets his sniper rifle aside and seizes his S.A.W. 
           MACHINE GUN.

           Methodically he checks the high capacity drum magazine, rests 
           the muzzle on the railing, and OPENS FIRE WITH A FULLY 
           AUTOMATIC BARRAGE...POCKING THE ASCENDING TARGETS ON THE 
           EASTERN WALL WITH RED TRACER FIRE...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Bleeding, Drasa staggers to her feet, tilts the Dushka 
           barrel, BLINDLY FIRING DOWNWARD...
           EXT. FAR ABOVE - SAME MOMENT

           FROM AFAR ABOVE IN THE NIGHT HEAVENS, THE CRACKLE OF 
           RELENTLESS MUZZLE FIRE AND VIVID TRACERS OF LEVI AND DRASA 
           LIGHT UP THE VAST, LONELY, DARK LANDSCAPE BELOW...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           We hear the sound of BIRDS at first light...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - DAWN

           A small, yellow FINCH lands on the railing of West Tower 
           platform, singing it’s song to the new day.

           Below the Finch on the platform floor, Levi lays on his belly 
           with his S.A.W. Machine gun at the ready. 

           It’s clear he hasn’t slept.

           THOUSANDS OF SPENT AMMUNITION CARTRIDGES are scattered all 
           around him. 

           Exhausted, he stares at the Eastern Wall of the gorge looking 
           for movement, but sees none. 

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Drasa, her tank-top caked with dried blood, sits upright 
           against the wall of East tower.

           She reaches for the TACTICAL KNIFE strapped to her ankle and 
           FLASHES OPEN THE BLADE.

           DRASA INSERTS THE BLADE TIP INTO HER LEFT SHOULDER WOUND AND 
           PRIES THE CHUNK OF MINE SHRAPNEL FROM THE FLESH. 

           BITING BACK A NAUSEOUS WAVE OF DIZZYNESS, SHE TOSSES THE 
           METAL SHARD ASIDE and squirts ANTIBACTERIAL GEL INTO THE 
           WOUND. 

           She shoves STERILE BANDAGE WADDING into the hole and covers 
           it with SURGICAL TAPE.

           Crawling on all fours, Drasa reaches for a stray PIECE OF 
           PAPER and a MARKER lying amongst her own sea of BULLET 
           CASINGS.
           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi sees Drasa HOLD UP A MESSAGE on the East Tower.

           He scans both sides of the gorge again. 

           All is clear. 

           Stiffly he gets to his feet and peers through the spotting 
           scope, adjusting the focus. 

           Suddenly Levi LAUGHS ALOUD, reading her message.

           WE SHIFT TO HIS P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE...

           DRASA’S MESSAGE:

                              BEST. FUCKING. BIRTHDAY. EVER.

           EXT. WESTERN RIM - LATER

           Making a list, Levi peers over the gorge rim at the 
           containment fence, counting the number of contact mines that 
           need to be replaced.

           INT. WEST TOWER ARMOMRY - MOMENTS LATER

           String lights glow overhead as Levi steps down into the large 
           underground armory beneath West tower. 

           An abundance of various LETHAL WEAPONRY hang on a 
           wall...MACHINE GUNS, TACTICAL SHOTGUNS, ROCKET POWERED 
           GRENADE (RPG) LAUNCHERS...

           Industrial shelving is lined with scores of spherical 
           replacement MINES and endless CRATES OF AMMUNITION.

           A RIGGING AND CLIMBING EQUIPMENT locker for mine repair is 
           stocked with SAFETY HARNESSES and PARACHUTES. 

           There’s a comprehensive tool area, with an broad assortment 
           of HAND AND POWER TOOLS, a MIG WELDER, and huge wall mounted 
           SPOOLS holding thousands of meters of BULK STEEL CABLE for 
           mine suspension. 

           At the far end of the armory lies the elaborate home 
           MOONSHINE STILL. 

           Levi eyes the shelves of replacement MINES...
           EXT. WESTERN WALL - BENEATH CONTAINMENT FENCE - LATER 

           Using an motorized AUTO-ASCENDER DEVICE, Levi lowers himself 
           on a cable in a climbing harness below the containment fence 
           and begins to rig a series of REPLACEMENT MINES.

           The nearby gorge wall is charred from mine blasts and stained 
           with Hollowmen BLOOD and BULLET IMPACT MARKS. 

           Yellow October leaves fall past him as he repeatedly scans 
           the fog layer 80 meters below his dangling feet for movement.

           With a CABLE CUTTER and NICRO-PRESS CRIMP TOOL, Levi loops 
           the hanging end of steel cable fastened above through the 
           bolt-eye of a bowling-ball size replacement mine. 

           Using the crimp tool, he crushes the SOFT COPPER CRIMP around 
           the cable loop, securing the mine. 

           With the utmost care, Levi gently inserts a KEY into the base 
           of the hanging mine, carefully turning it counterclockwise, 
           ARMING THE MINE.

           Hanging and completely vulnerable, Levi looks across the 
           gorge at East Tower. 

           He sees Drasa’s distant silhouette on the platform...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Her shoulder properly bandaged, Drasa stands on the East 
           tower platform with her Tochnost rifle raised. 

           She peers through the scope, slowly scanning the fog layer 
           below...PROVIDING SNIPER COVER FOR LEVI AS HE WORKS.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - LATER

           Levi does the same for Drasa, scanning the Eastern wall for 
           movement through his sniper scope as she hangs suspended over 
           the gorge in an AUTO-ASCENDER climbing harness, replacing 
           contact mines.

           INT. WEST TOWER - LATER

           Sitting at the small table, Levi depressing the TRANSMIT 
           BUTTOM on a portable MILITARY RADIO...

                                 LEVI INTO RADIO MIC
                        This is western tower performing 
                        October radio check, do you copy? 
           He removes his finger from the button and listens to the 
           white noise of the channel, awaiting a response...

                                 LEVI INTO RADIO MIC (CONT'D)
                        I repeat, this is western tower 
                        performing October radio check. DO 
                        you copy, over...

           Suddenly a DIGITALLY GENERATED VOICE - Not a live person, 
           responds on the airwaves...

                                 DIGITIZED VOICE
                        Authentication code?

           Levi quickly references a nearby CIPHER-CODE GRID, aligning 
           the date with the correct code.

                                 LEVI INTO RADIO MIC

                        Green.

           There is a brief, silent pause.

                        Procedure is complete. 30 days

                                 LEVI INTO RADIO MIC
                             (interjecting)
                        Wait...please, I have some 
                        questions...

                                 DIGITIZED VOICE
                        Procedure is complete.

           The signal ceases.

           For a long silent beat, Levi stares at the dead radio 
           transmitter in his hand.
           EXT. THE GORGE - SUNSET

           The autumn clouds are under-lit with brilliant red and purple 
           hues as the red sun sinks toward the western mountains.

           We hear J.S. Bach’s CELLO SUITE #1 in G Major on the evening 
           breeze...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           As the sun sets, weapons at the ready, Levi eats dinner on 
           the West tower platform. 

           He listens to the sublime cello music echoing across the 
           gorge as he gazes at East tower...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           Drasa eats dinner on the East tower platform as the hi-fi 
           speakers project Bach out into the evening.

           She peers through her spotting scope, and sees Levi looking 
           back at her through his scope, holding up his wipe board...

           THE WIPE BOARD MESSAGE READS:

                               LOVELY CHOICE OF DINNER MUSIC

           Drasa SMILES TO HERSELF and writes a response on paper...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: He reads her message...

           CLOSE ON PAPER:

                             MAYBE SOMEHOW, SOMEDAY, SOMEWHERE

                       WE COULD HAVE A PROPER DINNER DATE TOGETHER.

           INT. LIVING QUARTERS - WEST TOWER - DAWN THE NEXT MORNING

           Lying in bed, Levi opens his eyes at first light. He listens 
           to the sounds of birds outside the open tower windows. 

           He reaches for another logbook in a stack beside his cot, 
           selecting: 

                                 GAGNE’ - 1973-74 - FRANCE
           We hear the VOICE OF GAGNE’ as Levi reads an entry...

                                 GAGNE’ (V.O.)
                             (French accent)
                        June 28th, 1974. The steady rain 
                        this morning is helping with my 
                        hangover, but that is all I can 
                        state in the positive. I am a man 
                        of only 25 years, but in recent 
                        days, I feel acutely old. My 
                        thoughts constantly betray me and 
                        I’m finding more and more that I do 
                        not enjoy my own company. Perhaps 
                        the bitter truth of the matter is 
                        that I’ve never known myself at 
                        all. Perhaps I have always craved 
                        the presence of others to distract 
                        me from the ugliness of myself. I 
                        do not believe man is intended to 
                        live in this manner. As a species, 
                        we are social beings. We are meant 
                        to cavort and laugh and love and 
                        make our grand mistakes together...

           Levi pauses, thinking. 

           The sound of the birds continue outside the window, but he 
           pays no attention. 

           It’s clear by Levi’s expression that his mind is racing...

           INT. WEST TOWER ARMORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Shirtless, with a cup of morning coffee, Levi walks down the 
           steps into the West Tower armory. 

           He slowly walks through the packed room, scanning the surplus 
           as his eyes dart to various WEAPONS, TOOLS, AND GEAR.

           Levi pauses, gazing at the HUGE 4’ FOOT DIAMETER SPOOLS of 
           3/16” STEEL MINE RIGGING CABLE mounted on the armory wall...

           INT. WEST TOWER ARMOMRY - SERIES OF SHOTS - MOMENTS LATER

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -Levi opens the ARMS LOCKER. From a PROTECTIVE ORDINANCE 
           CRATE, Levi withdraws a 37”-inch, conical, ANTI-TANK 
           ROCKET...

           -He carries the rocket to the tool area WORKBENCH, and gently 
           cinches it in the bench-mounted VISE...
           -With a tiny, star-head SCREWDRIVER, Levi carefully unscrews 
           the front section of the rocket...

           -Ever-so-gently, Levi UNTHREADS AND REMOVES THE ROCKET’S 
           EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD, leaving the ROCKET HOUSING AND PROPELLENT 
           CELL INTACT...

           -Levi SETS THE EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD SAFELY ASIDE and FOCUSES ON 
           THE REMAINING ROCKET HOUSING...

           -Levi pulls on WELDING LEATHERS, A MASK, and GLOVES. 

           -A CRACKLING FLASH OF INTENSE BLUE SPARKS illuminate the 
           armory as Levi WELDS A STEEL ROCK CLIMBING CARABINER to the 
           EXTERIOR OF THE ROCKET HOUSING...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           In a camouflage jacket, Drasa steps out on the East Tower 
           platform and lights her first cigarette of the day.

           Exhaling in the brisk morning air, she notices movement on 
           the western rim of the gorge beside West Tower. She steps 
           over to the spotting scope to investigate...

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: She sees Levi, rolling the 
           heavy 4”-FOOT DIAMETER SPOOL CYLINDER OF STEEL RIGGING CABLE 
           out the lower door of west tower toward two nearby trees.

           She makes a curious face as she peers through the scope...

                                 DRASA
                             (as if to Levi, in 
                              Lithuanian)
                        What...are...you...doing...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WESTERN RIM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sweating as he reaches the two trees, Levi slides a LONG 
           SECTION OF PIPE through the center of the cable spool. 

           Using his legs, Levi lifts the several-hundred pound spool, 
           resting the ends of the long pipe on the thick branches of 
           the two trees, suspending the spool between them...ALLOWING 
           THE SPOOL TO SPIN FREELY. 

           A second later, Levi slides a copper CRIMP FASTENER over the 
           loose end of the cable on the spool. 
           He creates a small loop in the cable’s end, and threads it 
           back through the fastener, and then crimps the fastener 
           closed, SECURING A LOOP IN THE END OF CABLE.

           He quickly disappears back into west tower, only to emerge 
           seconds later with a shoulder fired ROCKET POWERED GRENADE 
           LAUNCHER and the MODIFIED ROCKET he made...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: She sees Levi emerge with the 
           rocket launcher...

                                 DRASA
                             (To herself, re: the RPG)
                        Oh shit...what are you doing?

           EXT. WESTERN RIM - SECONDS LATER

           LEVI SLIDES THE MODIFIED ROCKET INTO THE HEAD OF THE 
           LAUNCHER, THEN CLIPS THE LOOP END OF THE SPOOLED CABLE TO THE 
           STEEL CARABINER HE WELDED TO THE MODIFIED ROCKET...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: She watches as LEVI RAISES THE 
           SHOULDER FIRED ROCKET LAUNCHER TO A 45 DEGREE ANGLE, AIMING 
           ACROSS THE GORGE...

           She GRINS...

                                 DRASA
                             (To herself)
                        Oh...my...my...my...

           EXT. WESTERN RIM - SECONDS LATER

           The anti-tank rocket ROARS AS IT LEAVES THE LAUNCHER, CUTTING 
           A LONG ARCING VAPOR TRAIL INTO THE EARLY MORNING SKY. 

           THE CABLE SPOOL SPINS WILDLY, STRIPPING-OFF HUNDREDS OF 
           METERS OF 3/16”  CABLE AS THE ROCKET CLIMBS HIGHER AND 
           FURTHER OUT OVER THE GORGE. 

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Grinning as she watches the rocket arc across the sky toward 
           her on the eastern rim, Drasa crushes out her cigarette and 
           runs inside East tower...
           EXT. MID AIR - ABOVE THE GORGE - SECONDS LATER

           Reaching the end of its propulsion fuel cell, the ANTI-TANK 
           ROCKET BEGINS TO ARC DOWNWARD TOWARD THE EASTERN RIM OF THE 
           GORGE...

           EXT. PINE TREE - EASTERN RIM - SECONDS LATER

           The rocket STRIKES THE LIMBS OF A SPRUCE TREE on the edge of 
           the tree-line about fifteen feet off the ground, starting a 
           SMALL FIRE.

           Within seconds, Drasa runs toward the tree carrying a FIRE 
           EXTINGUISHER. 

           Despite her shoulder wound, Drasa quickly scales the pine 
           branches and with a few BLASTS OF WHITE FOAM, extinguishes 
           the fire.

           She pulls the rocket casing from the branches, noticing 
           Levi’s custom welded CARABINER...THEN FOR THE FIRST 
           TIME...SHE SEES THE 3/16” STEEL CABLE ATTACHED TO IT.

           DRASA’A EYES QUICKLY FOLLOW THE THIN CABLE GLINTING IN THE 
           MORNING SUNLIGHT...

           SUDDENLY REALIZING IT STRETCHES ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE VAST, 
           600 METER GORGE TO THE WESTERN RIM.

           Her eyes widen with excitement.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Drasa looks through her spotting scope at Levi, holding up 
           his wipe board on the West Tower Platform...

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE...

           THE WIPE BOARD MESSAGE READS:

                                HOW ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT? 

           Drasa GRINS. 

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - WEST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE...Levi smiles as he reads her 
           response...

           CLOSE ON PAPER:
                                        MY PLACE. 

                                          19:00 

           EXT. EAST TOWER - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Drasa wraps the cable around a reinforced concrete support 
           column beneath East Tower platform. 

           Using a nicro-press tool she crimps the cable fastener, 
           firmly securing the eastern end of the cable.

           EXT. WEST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           With the other end of the cable looped around the thick trunk 
           of a tree, Levi pulls it as tightly as he can, then works a 
           CABLE RATCHET back and forth over and over, further 
           tightening the cable...TAKING ALL SLACK OUT OF THE LINE 
           before crimping it closed.

           INT. WEST TOWER ARMOMRY - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi selects his gear: A TACTICAL VEST and GLOVES, a hanging 
           GEAR BAG, a HK-UMP COMPACT SUBMACHINE GUN with SIX EXTRA 
           MAGAZINES, a CLIMBING HARNESS and ZIP-PULLEY ASSEMBLY, a low-
           profile backup PARACHUTE...  

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WESTERN RIM - EARLY EVENING

           As the red sun sinks lower on the horizon, Levi picks a SMALL 
           BOUQUET OF WILDFLOWERS and tucks them into his tactical vest.

           With his assorted gear hanging off him, Levi clips his REAR 
           SAFETY LINE to the cable behind him, and securely locks his 
           ZIP PULLEY ASSEMBLY onto the outstretched cable ahead.

           With red sunlight on his face, Levi pauses for a moment, 
           breathing deeply, staring out at the VAST DISTANCE BETWEEN 
           HIMSELF AND THE EASTERN RIM FAR ACROSS THE GORGE. 

           SUDDENLY LEVI BREAKS INTO A SPRINT, RUNNING FULL TILT AT THE 
           EDGE OF THE GORGE, BUILDING AS MUCH MOMENTUM AS POSSIBLE...

           LEVI’S HEART POUNDS AS HE LEAPS OUT OVER THE ABYSS... 

           The zip-line pulley buzzes as the cable sags more than he 
           calculated...picking up more and more speed, riding the line 
           faster and faster toward the center of the gorge...
           His veins run cold as he glances down at the ominous fog 
           layer 80 meters beneath his feet...

           With gravity on his side, Levi blurs past the center point of 
           the gorge...but his pace begins to slow as the sagging cable 
           now begins to flex uphill toward the Eastern rim.

           Levi eases to full stop about two hundred meters from the 
           Eastern side of the gorge, then BEGINS TO GLIDE BACK DOWN THE 
           LINE TOWARD THE CENTER.

           Levi immediately seizes the thin cable with his gloved hands 
           to stop his reverse movement.

           Slowly, hand over hand, meter by meter, Levi starts to pull 
           himself the rest of the way to the Eastern rim...

           EXT. EASTERN RIM - 30 MINUTES LATER

           Drenched in sweat, his arms trembling with adrenaline, Levi 
           drags himself the final few uphill meters over the rocky edge 
           of the eastern rim and collapses on the ground.   

           Red-faced, he sits on the ground breathing heavily, trying to 
           catch his wind.

           EXT. EAST TOWER ENTRANCE DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Strapped with his heavy gear with damp sweat under his arms 
           and shirt neck, Levi attempts to fix his hair as he 
           approaches the East tower entrance.

           He pauses for a moment, exhaling, the KNOCKS on the plate 
           steel door.

           A moment later the door opens and Levi sees Drasa. 

           His heart races as she smiles at him.

           Drasa wears a men’s XXL WHITE TEESHIRT which falls at her 
           knee. She’s cut the crew neckline into a ‘V’ and added a belt 
           at the waist, fashioning it into a white mini dress. 

           She has accessorized the outfit with her combat JUMP BOOTS 
           and 9MM SIDEARM.

                                 LEVI
                        Good evening, Drasa.

                                 DRASA
                        Good evening, Levi. Do you like my 
                        dress? 
           Levi eyes her impromptu dress.

                                 LEVI
                        Very much.

           She smiles.

                                 DRASA
                             (re: the flowers)
                        What’s that you’re growing?

           Levi looks down, seeing the SEMI-CRUSHED WILDFLOWERS poking 
           out of top of his tactical vest. 

           He quickly unzips his vest and removes them.

                                 LEVI
                        I brought you flowers.

                                 DRASA
                        Of course you did.

           Drasa smiles and accepts them.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        I made rabbit pie. (pause) Do you 
                        like rabbit pie?

                                 LEVI
                        I intend to.

           She grins, looking at his sweat-pitted shirt and appearance. 

                                 DRASA
                        You smell...terribly.

           Levi smiles.

                                 LEVI
                        I do. It’s really bad. (pause) 
                        Somehow I neglected to bring an 
                        auto-ascender, so I had to do the 
                        end part by hand...

           Drasa gives him a look.

                                 DRASA
                        I don’t think I can allow you to 
                        come in smelling that way...

           Drasa motions to the CONCRETE OUT BUILDING about thirty 
           meters away on the eastern tree line.
                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Go wash up quick at the bathhouse. 
                        I’ll hang some fresh clothes of my 
                        predecessor’s outside the door. 

           INT. SHOWER ROOM - EASTERN BATHHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Alone in the bathhouse, Levi soaps up. He closes his eyes, 
           letting the hot water run over him...

           EXT. EASTERN BATHHOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Walking through the tall autumn grass, Drasa approaches the 
           bathhouse carrying a dated MAN’S SUIT on a HANGER.

           Drasa eyes Levi’s TOWEL and CAMOUFLAGE CLOTHES hung on the 
           hooks outside the shower room door...

           EXT. EASTERN BATHHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi, wet and nude, opens the shower room door reaching for 
           the towel, but the TOWEL IS GONE...ALONG WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES 
           AND GEAR.

           Levi takes a few hesitant steps outside looking for his 
           clothes. 

           Suddenly he MAKES A FACE as he sees HIS TOWEL and a MEN’S 
           SUIT...HANGING ON A TREE LIMB 40 METERS AWAY.

           INT. EAST TOWER KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

           Drasa stands at the kitchen window putting the wild flowers 
           in water. 

           She GRINS as we FOLLOW HER GAZE through the kitchen 
           window...WATCHING LEVI RUN NAKED THROUGH THE TALL YELLOW 
           GRASS TOWARD THE TREE WHERE THE CLOTHING IS HUNG.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Shadows are long as the sun sets in the mountains, casting 
           the gorge in a rich, crimson light.

           Drasa, in her impromptu dress, and Levi in an ill-fitting 
           suit, sit at the candle lit table eating the savory pie and 
           drinking wine...
                                 LEVI
                        Yukon. Northwest Territory. 
                        Siberia. Remote Scandinavia, maybe? 
                        They sedated me on the flight. I 
                        don’t know how long I was out.

                                 DRASA
                             (nodding)
                        Same.

                                 LEVI
                        We’re somewhere in the far northern 
                        hemisphere. We know that much.

                                 DRASA
                        How are you so sure of that?

                                 LEVI
                        Seasons. It was turning autumn when 
                        I left the states. It’s still 
                        autumn here.

           Drasa smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        Clever.

           She takes a sip of wine.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        What’s the longest kill shot you’ve 
                        ever made?

           Levi pauses.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        And don’t say you don’t know. Every 
                        top-shelf sniper knows the distance 
                        of every ticket they’ve ever 
                        punched. 

           He smiles. 

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Come on. Spit it out...

                                 LEVI
                        2,341 meters.

                                 DRASA
                        2,341? A kill shot? 

           Levi nods.
                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Doesn’t that put you in...

                                 LEVI
                        Top five in the world. 

           Drasa pauses, thinking. She suddenly SMILES WITH A LOOK OF 
           RECOGNITION...

                                 DRASA
                        Did you make that impossible shot 
                        in Yemen? May of last year...

           Levi looks at her.

                                 LEVI
                             (with tone)
                        I did not participate in, nor do I 
                        have any knowledge of any operation 
                        in Yemen in May of last year...

           Drasa smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        Rumor was it was windy. 25 knots 
                        East to West with gusts to 40. That 
                        would have been a very, very good 
                        shot. 

           Levi smiles as she looks him in the eye.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        I’d kiss the ring of whoever made 
                        that shot. (pause) Too bad it 
                        wasn’t you.

           Levi smiles, changing the subject.

                                 LEVI
                        You know what I keep asking myself 
                        evening after evening while I sit 
                        over there on my platform?

                                 DRASA
                             (interjecting)
                        How you’re going to get in my 
                        pants?

           Levi laughs aloud and takes a quick swallow of wine to mask a 
           wave of boyishly self-consciousness.

                                 LEVI
                        Well...after that...
                                 DRASA
                        Yes...after that...please, tell me, 
                        what do you think about?

                                 LEVI
                        I ask myself...what’s the whole 
                        truth? Right? What is this place? 
                        And what the hell are those things 
                        down in the gorge?

           Drasa looks at him, pausing a silent moment, thinking.

                                 DRASA
                        Can I tell you a story?

                                 LEVI
                             (nodding)
                        I do love stories.

           She smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        A long time ago, before I was 
                        born...before independence was 
                        restored in my country, my father 
                        was KGB. He has often said that 
                        early period of his life...both 
                        created and destroyed him. And 
                        years later, as a child, he would 
                        tell me...(imitating her Erikas’s 
                        gravelly voice) Drasa, my little 
                        Lion, you don’t want to know the 
                        whole truth. It’s better to only 
                        know part of the story... 

           Levi listens as she speaks...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        And I would bitch and whine and 
                        ask...Why Daddy? Why wouldn’t I 
                        want to know the whole truth?

           Drasa pauses, her gaze shifting to meet Levi’s eyes across 
           the table.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Levi...do you know why?

           Levi looks at her, then slowly NODS.

                                 LEVI
                        Because if you know the whole 
                        truth...you’re dangerous. You 
                        become a threat.
           She looks at him.

                                 DRASA
                        Maybe we already know everything we 
                        want to know about those unholy 
                        things down in the fog...and that’s 
                        that a well-placed bullet will kill 
                        them.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER -  LATER

           Night has fallen on the gorge.

           A CANDLE burns low on the small table where the UNCLEARED 
           PLATES AND GLASSES from Levi and Drasa’s dinner remain...

           INT. LIVING QUARTERS - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           CLOSE ON: A RECORD NEEDLE is gently placed on a spinning 
           VINYL RECORD...

           WE HEAR THE DARKLY ATMOSPERIC, VIBRATO CHORDS OF A HAMMOND 
           ORGAN, joined by the MELODIC, DESCENDING NOTES of a HOLLOW-
           BODY ELECTRIC GUITAR... 

           BLUE LIGHT, the hypnotic 1993 single by Mazzy Star*, echoes 
           through the East Tower.

           Swaying to the ether-like music, Levi and Drasa look at each 
           other, slowly touching, intimately dancing in the half light.

           Drasa rises on her toes in her jump boots, KISSING NECK, HIS 
           CHIN, THEN HIS LIPS. 

           He kisses her back.

           Drasa starts to unbutton his shirt when Levi pauses self-
           consciously, looking away from her gaze...

                                 LEVI
                             (quietly)
                        Look...I...I’m kinda fucked in the 
                        head, you know? (pause) Trauma 
                        shit. Sometimes I can’t...you 
                        know...do this...

           Drasa looks at him and nods empathetically.

                                 DRASA
                        I’m kinda fucked in the head, too. 

           She smiles.
                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        So we’ll just do...whatever we 
                        do...

           EXT. GRASSY FIELD - EAST RIM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           We see the NAKED SILHOUETTES of Levi and Drasa chase each 
           other across the starlit field of tall grass carrying a 
           sleeping bag...

           EXT. GRASSY FIELD - EAST RIM - MOMENTS LATER

           Drasa and Levi lie nude together in a sleeping bag. 

           They kiss, holding each other, looking up at the myriad of 
           constellations spread out across the heavens above them.

           There’s a silence.

                                 DRASA
                             (quietly to Levi)
                        Maybe it’s just logical. Part of 
                        the gig. But I think about dying 
                        quite often. (pause) Do you think 
                        about dying often?

           There’s a beat.

                                 LEVI
                        Yes.

                                 DRASA
                        There are several ways I don’t want 
                        to die. (pause) Are there ways you 
                        don’t want to die?

           Levi pauses.

                                 LEVI
                        Just one.

                                 DRASA
                        Which is?

           Levi stares at the constellations above them.

                                 LEVI
                        Alone.
           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER -  DAWN

           The first light of dawn breaks on the horizon.

           Up all night, Drasa and Levi sit at the platform table, 
           laughing as they eat Drasa’a leftover LITHUANIAN BIRTHDAY 
           CAKE for breakfast.

                                 DRASA
                        Poetry? Really?

                                 LEVI
                        Sometimes I write them in my daily 
                        log... 

                                 DRASA
                             (laughing)
                        Honestly?

           Levi laughs and nods.

                                 LEVI
                        I took a class. Wednesday nights 
                        from 7-10pm at San Diego Community 
                        College.

           She smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        Are you talented?

                                 LEVI
                        Not even remotely. I’m terrible.

           She pauses.

                                 DRASA
                        Will you write a terrible poem for 
                        me?

                                 LEVI
                        Maybe I already have.

           Drasa makes a jubilant face.

                                 DRASA
                        Ha! Recite it for me!

                                 LEVI
                        Absolutely not.

                                 DRASA
                        Come on! 
                                 LEVI
                        No chance in hell.

           Drasa laughs.

                                 DRASA
                        Can you at least tell me the title?

                                 LEVI
                        Nope.

                                 DRASA
                        I think you’re lying. You haven’t 
                        written a terrible poem for me at 
                        all, have you?

                                 LEVI
                        I have. Started it, anyway...

                                 DRASA
                        Then prove it. Tell me the title.

           Theres a beat.

                                 LEVI
                        It’s a working title.

                                 DRASA
                        Fine. Tell me the working title!

           Levi pauses self-consciously...

                                 LEVI
                        The Girl with the Chainsaw.

           For a moment Drasa remains silent, considering, then she 
           grins...

                                 DRASA
                        Oh, fuck...I love it. Now I have to 
                        read it...

                                 LEVI
                        No. No. No.

           EXT. EASTERN RIM - AN HOUR LATER

           Strapped into his harness and burdened with all the weaponry 
           and gear he arrived in, Levi locks the zip-pulley assembly 
           around the steel cable.

           Drasa stands a few feet away in a shaft of morning sunlight.
                                 LEVI
                        Maybe you could spin some Miles 
                        Davis tonight? Or Freddie Hubbard?

                                 DRASA
                        Feeling Jazzy?

           Levi tilts his head and shrugs.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        I’ll see what I can find.

           He smiles and pulls on his tactical gloves.

           There’s a beat of silence as they look at each other

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Did you like the rabbit pie?

                                 LEVI
                        Best fucking rabbit pie ever. 

           Drasa smiles.

           Keeping his eyes on hers, Levi leans in, kissing the LION 
           TATTOED ON DRASA’S NECK.

           EXT. EASTERN RIM - A SECOND LATER

           Levi runs full tilt toward the rim and LEAPS OFF the edge.

           The ZIP-HARNESS BUZZES as he picks up speed, moving faster 
           and faster, racing down the cable over the abyss.

           At 300 meters out, Levi looks back a Drasa, growing smaller 
           and smaller as she stands on the eastern rim.

           She WAVES to him as he grows distant.

           Levi raises his hand in reply...

           IN THAT SECOND, HE HEARS A CONTACT MINE DETONATE ON THE 
           WESTERN RIM.

           Racing at high speed, Levi turns his head toward the sound, 
           seeing SMOKE AND MOVEMENT on the western wall of the gorge... 

           In motion, Levi unstraps his compact sub-machine gun, and 
           begins to rack the action...when a SECOND MINE EXPLODES, 
           sending FRAGMENTS OF SHRAPNEL in all directions...

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:
           EXT. WESTERN CONTAINMENT FENCE - SAME MOMENT

           EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: A SHARD OF MINE SHRAPNEL STRIKES THE 
           CABLE, SLICING THROUGH THE ENGINEERED STEEL FIBERS LIKE A HOT 
           KNIFE...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. ABOVE THE GORGE - A SPLIT SECOND LATER

           THE TENSION ON THE CABLE INSTANTLY CEASES, LOSING IT’S 
           ABILITY TO SUPPORT LEVI’S WEIGHT.

           HIS MOTION VAULTS HIM DOWNWARD, WILDLY PLUMMETING TOWARD THE 
           FOG LAYER BELOW... 

           EXT. EASTERN RIM - SAME MOMENT

           TIME SLOWS as Drasa sees Levi fall. 

           Her face contorts into a scream...

                                 DRASA
                        NOOOO!!!

           EXT. MID-AIR - SECONDS LATER

           Free-falling, Levi’s body races toward the fog below. 

           HE DESPERATELY CLAWS AT HIS CHEST, FLAILING, LOSING HIS GRIP 
           ON HIS WEAPON. 

           HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN IS INSTANTLY LOST as he searches for the 
           D-RING on his EMERGENCY CHUTE... 

           EXT. EASTERN RIM - SAME MOMENT

           Watching from 400 meters away on the eastern rim, Drasa 
           screams...

                                 DRASA
                        LEVI!!!

           In the last second, Drasa sees A GLIPMSE OF LEVI’S EMERGENCY 
           PARACHUTE DEPLOY BEFORE HE VANISHES INTO THE FOG BELOW.

           For an instant, Drasa stares in silent horror. 
           Yellow autumn leaves tumble gently downward into the fog... 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. ARMORY - EAST TOWER - SECONDS LATER

           Drasa’s heart pounds in her ears as she rushes down the 
           stairs into the East Tower armory.

           Her mind is a blur as she quickly but methodically selects 
           GEAR: AK-12 RUSSIAN ASSAULT RIFLE, AMMUNITION, FIRST AID, and 
           EMERGENCY RATIONS, TWO AUTO-ASCENDERS, shoving it all into a 
           pack...

           EXT. EASTERN RIM CONTAINMENT FENCE - SECONDS LATER

           With the weapon and PACK STRAPPED TO HER CHEST, and a 
           PARACHUTE STRAPPED TO HER BACK, Drasa scales down the access 
           ladder from the top of the eastern rim to the massive steel 
           containment fence projecting from the gorge wall twenty 
           meters below...

           At the bottom of the ladder, Drasa clips a safety line to the 
           strap of her AK-12, rechecks her CHUTE HARNESS, and BREAKS 
           INTO A SPRINT...

           She runs faster and faster toward the edge...

           DRASA LEAPS HEAD FIRST OFF THE OUTER LIP OF CONTAINMENT 
           FENCE, DIVING INTO THE ABYSS...

           EXT. MID-AIR - SECONDS LATER

           Seconds later, Drasa pulls her D-RING and her parachute 
           deploys, jerking her body as the canopy above her fills with 
           air. 

           With her AK-12 strapped to her, she skillfully controls her 
           descent as she slips into the thick white fog-layer.

           EXT. FOG LAYER - MID AIR - SECONDS LATER

           Immersed in impenetrable white mist, Drasa CANNOT SEE IN ANY 
           DIRECTION.

           As she descends, she listens...hearing the rising SOUND OF 
           RUSHING WATER beneath her...
           EXT. RIVER - GORGE - SECONDS LATER

           Shrouded in fog, Drasa gasps for breath as she PLUNGES INTO 
           THE ICY, TURBULENT WATER OF A FAST MOVING RIVER...

           She’s instantly swept downstream as WHITE WATER AND CLASS 
           FIVE RAPIDS surround her.

           Burdened by the weight of her gear, Drasa fights to keep her 
           face above water as her submerged body is HURLED OVER A SET 
           OF TEN-FOOT FALLS. 

           In that instant, Drasa’a saturated PARACHUTE SNAGS ON AN 
           UPSTREAM ROCK jutting from the river.  

           Suddenly tethered in the rushing white water, the force of 
           the frigid current pulls Drasa under...

           EXT. UNDERWATER - GORGE RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Submerged, Drasa’s nose and mouth fill with water as she 
           kicks for the surface...but anchored to the chute upstream, 
           there’s no chance. 

           Drasa reaches for her ankle sheath, flashing open her 
           TACTICAL KNIFE. 

           She cuts blindly at her chute harness straps, slicing through 
           the webbing.

           OUT OF BREATH, SHE DESPERATELY LASHES OUT AGAIN WITH THE 
           KNIFE, CUTTING...

           Beginning to lose consciousness, Drasa SLICES ONE LAST TIME, 
           and SUDDENLY HER BODY IS FREE OF THE PARACHUTE AND SWEPT 
           AWAY...

           EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Racing downstream, Drasa breaks the surface, heaving for 
           breath, and opening her eyes to see...

           A DEADFALLEN PINE TREE lying across the river...emerging out 
           the fog only a meter in front of her face...

           At the last split second she raises her arms, trying to 
           protect her head as she SLAMS VIOLENTLY INTO THE TREE. 

           A jagged branch-tip gashes her cheek as the momentum of the 
           water pulls her body under again...
           But her fingertips grip the bark of the fallen tree, digging 
           in...and SOMEHOW HOLDING ON... 

           Stretching, her hands FIND BRANCHES TO GRASP. 

           WITH INCREDIBLE STRENGTH, DRASA PULLS HERSELF UPWARD AGAINST 
           THE CURRENT, LIFTING HER LEGS OUT OF THE WATER AND WRAPPING 
           THEM AROUND THE FALLEN TREE, CLINGING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE RUSH 
           OF ICY WATER...

           Blood streams from the wound on her face as she repositions 
           her grip. 

           Inch by inch, Drasa maneuvers herself out of the water and 
           around to the topside fallen tree. 

           Dizzy and soaked, she shakes with adrenaline. Drasa hugs the 
           fallen tree closing her eyes as she heaves for breath.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Blackness.

           We hear the sound of tree limbs creaking in the wind...

           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - SAME MOMENT

           We HOLD CLOSE ON...LEVI’S FACE caked in blood. 

           His unconscious eyes are closed. His mouth hangs slightly 
           ajar.

           We slowly PULL BACK TO REVEAL...Levi HANGS SUSPENDED 20 
           METERS ABOVE THE FOREST FLOOR. 

           With his parachute lines snagged in a dead tree limb high 
           above him, his SLACK BODY SWAYS LIKE A BROKEN MARIONETTE IN 
           THE WIND.

           Appearing dead, Levi’s eyes suddenly FLASH OPEN...frantic, 
           trying to get his bearings...

           Disoriented, his gaze darts to the fog tumbling through tree 
           canopies above him. 

           He looks downward, through the fog and lower branches, seeing 
           the forest floor 60 feet below his boots. 

           Levi takes a breath, trying to focus. 

           He begins to shift his body weight, starting a pendulum 
           motion back and forth, swinging him toward the trunk of the 
           tall pine he’s hung in...
           With each swing he gets closer, stretching out, 
           reaching...nearly able to grasp the thick tree trunk, when 
           SUDDENLY...

           HIS PARACHUTE TEARS FREE FROM THE BRANCHES ABOVE HIM AND LEVI 
           FREE FALLS...

           EXT. FREEFALL - DEAD PINE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           LEVI’S BODY PLUMMETS DOWNWARD, HIS BODY BRUTALLY STRIKING 
           DEAD BRANCHES AS HE FALLS, FLIPPING HIM HEAD OVER HEALS AS HE 
           GRASPS IN VAIN TO GET A HOLD OF ANYTHING...

           AT THE LAST INSTANT BEFORE IMPACT HE EXTENDS HIS ARMS, TRYING 
           TO PROTECT HIMSELF...

           EXT. DEAD FOREST FLOOR - A SECOND LATER

           Levi’s body HITS the forest floor with a SICKENING, SNAP.

           A GUTTERAL SCREAM escapes from Levi’s mouth...

                                 LEVI
                        ARRRGHHH!!!

           He looks down, seeing his LEFT ARM IS HORRIBLY BROKEN...his 
           WRIST BENT AND BULGED IN AN UNNATURAL DIRECTION.

           He writhes in agony...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Fuck...fuck...

           His face is glazed in sweat as he draws in a breath, trying 
           to control the pain. 

           Levi pulls himself upright, slowing his breathing, peering at 
           his surroundings. 

           The dead forest is shrouded in thick, white fog. He can only 
           see a few meters in any direction. 

           Levi sheds his parachute harness and pulls himself to his 
           feet, suddenly pausing...HEARING THE APPROACH OF SOMETHING IN 
           THE DISTANCE...

           WITH HIS GOOD HAND, HE DRAWS HIS GLOCK-19 SIDEARM FROM HIS 
           HIP-HOLSTER AND PEERS THROUGH THE FOG, STRAINING TRYING TO 
           MAKE OUT THE RISING SOUND...

           Suddenly we recognize the sound...the THUNDEROUS APPROACH OF 
           HORSE HOOVES STRIKING THE FOREST FLOOR AS...
           FIVE HOLLOWMEN ON HORSEBACK EMERGE OUT OF THE WHITE MIST IN 
           MID-GALLOP...

           The LEAD RIDER, his tattered clothes hanging like rags from 
           his decaying body, holds a long-bladed, 1940’s era CALVARY 
           SABRE in his grip. 

           He RAISES THE EDGED WEAPON as he races toward Levi... 

           Levi hurls himself on the ground as the BLADE PASSES INCHES 
           OVER HIS HEAD.

           In an instant, Levi scrambles back to his feet. 

           He raises his handgun to fire...BUT ALL FIVE RIDERS HAVE 
           VANISHED INTO THE MIST.

           With his shattered left arm tucked at his side, Levi SCANS 
           THE SURROUNDING FOG.

           HE LISTENS INTENTLY...HEARING THE STEADY ‘CLIP-CLOP’ OF 
           HIDDEN HORSES ENCIRCLING HIS POSTION, JUST BEYOND HIS FIELD 
           OF VISION.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (quietly to himself, re: 
                              his Glock-19)
                        One in the chamber, fourteen in the 
                        mag...

           There’s a sudden silence out in the fog.

           Controlling his breathing, Levi calmly exhales as...

           ALL FIVE RIDERS ATTACK AT ONCE, CHARGING OUT OF THE FOG AT 
           LEVI FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES...

           LEVI METHODICALLY TAKES AIM, FIRING IN THREE-ROUND-BURSTS, 
           SHOOTING THE TWO HOLLOWMEN OFF THEIR MOUNTS.

           LEVI IMMEDIATELY PIVOTS TO FACE THE TWO RIDERS ATTACKING FROM 
           THE REAR. 

           WITH LESS TIME, LEVI OPENS FIRE AGAIN. 

           THE HORSE’S REEL BACK AT THE GUNFIRE, THROWING THEIR RIDERS.

           AS THE HOLLOWMEN HIT THE GROUND, LEVI EXECUTES BOTH CREATURES 
           WITH MULTIPLE SHOTS TO THE HEAD...

           LEVI HEARS THE THUNDERING APPROACH OF THE FIFTH RIDER FROM 
           HIS BLINDSIDE...

           LEVI SWINGS HIS HANDGUN, BUT HE’S TOO LATE...
           THE FIFTH, SABRE WIELDING HOLLOWMEN LEAPS FROM HIS HORSE LIKE 
           A CHEETAH, KNOCKING THE HANDGUN FROM LEVI’S HAND AND DRIVING 
           HIM INTO THE GROUND.

           THE CREATURE IS ON TOP OF LEVI IN AN INSTANT, RABIDLY HISSING 
           AND SALIVATING AS IT ATTACKS...

           LEVI RAISES HIS HAND TO PROTECT HIS FACE AND THE HOLLOWMEN 
           VICIOUSLY BITES DOWN ON HIS FOREARM...

           LEVI WINCES AND REPEATEDLY DRIVES HIS KNEE IN THE CREATURES 
           RIBS, TRYING TO GET IT TO EASE ITS BITE...

           THE CREATURE RELEASES LEVI’S FOREARM FROM IT’S MOUTH...THEN 
           BRUTALLY HEAD-BUTTS LEVI, STUNNING HIM...

           Levi, dazed and panting, looks up as the Hollowmen RAISES THE 
           BLADE...

           WHEN SOMETHING CATCHES LEVI’S EYE...THE FADED NAME FAINTLY 
           STITCHED ON THE CREATURE’S RAG CLOTHES...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Gagne’...

           SABRE RAISED...THE HOLLOWMEN PAUSES IN MID-STRIKE...

           SHIFT TO ANGLE TO REVEAL: THE CREATURES’S FADED UNIFORM TAG 
           READS: 

                                        J. GAGNE’

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (to the Wraith)
                        You’re...Gagne...

           FOR AN INSTANT, THERE’S FLASH OF CONFUSION IN THE HOLLOWMEN’S 
           RABID WHITE PUPILS...A TRANSIENT FLASH OF MEMORY TO A DISTANT 
           HUMANITY...THEN IT’S GONE... 

           THE CREATURE HISSES AND RAISES THE WEAPON AGAIN TO 
           STRIKE...WHEN SUDDENLY...

           WE HEAR A BURST OF GUNFIRE AS THREE RIFLE ROUNDS PUNCH 
           THROUGH ITS NECK AND FACE. 

           The Hollowmen’s body slumps as Levi turns to see DRASA, 
           EMERGING FROM THE MIST WITH HER AK-12 RAISED, SCANNING FOR 
           ADDITIONAL THREATS...

                                 DRASA
                             (to Levi)
                        I count five targets down. Were 
                        there more than five?
                                 LEVI
                        No. I don’t think so.

           Drasa kicks the hideous corpse off Levi and kneels at his 
           side. 

           There’s a silent beat as they look into each other’s eyes. 

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        You came.

           She nods and smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        Of course I did. 

           She eyes his shattered arm.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Your arm is seriously fucked-up.

           Levi nods in painful agreement.

                                 LEVI
                        Duly noted.

           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fog drifts through the dead pine forest.

           With her MEDICAL KIT open, Drasa splints and slings Levi’s 
           broken arm, taping and immobilizing it to his side to prevent 
           further injury. 

                                 DRASA
                        Do you want anything for the pain?

           Levi shakes his head.

                                 LEVI
                        I went ten rounds with a painkiller 
                        thing a few years ago. Can’t do it. 

           Drasa nods with understanding.

           Levi motions to the corpse. 

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (re: the wraith)
                        Check the uniform. What’s left of 
                        it I mean...

           Drasa glances at the dead creature.
                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (re: the uniform)
                        French Foreign Legion. 1970’s.

           Drasa looks at Levi, realizing...

                                 DRASA
                        He was a tower sentry?

           Levi nods.

                                 LEVI
                             (nodding)
                        I recognized his name from the log 
                        library in west tower.

           Drasa pauses.

                                 DRASA
                        They were like us.

           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Drasa and Levi gather their gear, Levi checks the nearly 
           empty magazine on his Glock-19 pistol.

                                 LEVI
                        You have any 9MM ammo?

           Drasa unholsters her own Russian-made GRACH SIDEARM and hands 
           it to Levi along with her two clips of ammunition.

                                 DRASA
                        I have the AK. 

           Levi accepts the handgun.

                                 LEVI
                        Gracias, amiga.

           She smiles.

                                 DRASA
                        Now...I say we put all our efforts 
                        into getting the fuck outta here.

                                 LEVI
                        Agreed. (pause) Unfortunately, the 
                        gorge is a very difficult place to 
                        get out of...

           Drasa interjects.
                                 DRASA
                        Not necessarily. We need to locate 
                        the cable. It’s severed on the one 
                        end, but I left it secured to 
                        eastern rim as a way out. 

           Levi looks at her.

                                 LEVI
                        That’s a good idea. But with this 
                        arm, I don’t think I’d ever make 
                        the climb...

           As if answering him, Drasa pulls out TWO MECHANICAL AUTO-
           ASCENDERS they employed to perform maintenance and replace 
           detonated mines.

           Levi eyes the auto-ascenders.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (looking at her, re: the 
                              auto-ascender)
                        Never rush in unless you know your 
                        way out. Fuck me. 

           He smiles at her.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Where’ve you been all my life?

                                 DRASA
                        Shooting people in exotic places.

           Levi smiles.

                                 LEVI
                        Let’s find that cable.

           Levi pauses, glancing at the horses wandering nearby in the 
           fog, grazing at the undergrowth. 

           Levi shoots Drasa A CURIOUS LOOK.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never really ridden a horse. 
                        (pause) Can you ride a horse?

                                 DRASA
                        Fuck, no.

           There’s a loaded beat of silence between them.

           They exchange another glance.
           EXT. DEAD FOREST TRAIL - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The fog is dense and visibility is almost zero.

           Following the river, Levi and Drasa ride through the white 
           mist ON HORSEBACK down a well-trodden path the horses seem to 
           know. 

           The only sound is the nearby river and the steady clip-clop 
           of their mount’s hooves.

           With their weapons at the ready, the shapes of jagged dead 
           trees, tangles of undergrowth, and rock formations emerge 
           threateningly out of the fog, then disappear again.

                                 LEVI
                        Soon we should find a safe place to 
                        cross the river to the eastern 
                        side...

           The SOUND of the horse hooves falling on the ground SUDDENLY 
           CHANGES...

           Levi abruptly stops speaking as Drasa and Levi look down 
           through the fog at the ground... 

           The forest trail has suddenly changed into weedy, cracked, 
           aged....CONCRETE. 

           They both stare in disbelief...

                                 DRASA
                        It’s...

                                 LEVI
                        A sidewalk.

           EXT. ABANDONED TOWN SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           Shrouded in fog, Levi and Drasa’s horses lead them into a 
           small, long-abandoned TOWN SQUARE.

           A dilapidated BARRACKS and SMALL CHAPEL gone wild 
           undergrowth, slowly being reclaimed by the forest.

           There are wide, SEISMIC CRACKS in the weed covered asphalt.

           An old rusted WATERTOWER lies damaged on it’s side, fallen 
           many decades before by an apparent EARTHQUAKE. 

           In the center of the square, on the same SINGLE FLAG POLE, 
           the RAG REMNANTS OF A BRITISH, SOVIET (U.S.S.R.), AND 
           AMERICAN FLAG stir in the breeze.
           Beyond the flagpole is what appears to be a single story TOWN 
           HALL, overgrown with moss and weeds. 

           Levi and Drasa exchange glances and dismount. 

           They TIE THE REINS of their horses to the porch railing of 
           the Town Hall...

           INT. VESTIBULE - ABANDONED TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           The rusted hinges of the Town Hall door CREEKS as it opens.

           With weapons raised, Drasa and Levi enter the building’s 
           vestibule.

           There is a pungent SMELL in the air. 

           Levi glances at Drasa as they advance into the main room.

                                 LEVI
                             (whispering)
                        That’s a bad smell...

           Drasa nods.

           INT. CENTRAL HALL - ABANDONED TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Slowly, Drasa and Levi enter the building’s large, central 
           meeting hall. 

           Nesting SWALLOWS, disturbed by Levi and Drasa’s unwelcome 
           presence, dart through the rafters, chirping angrily.

           The fog drifts through the broken windows, permeating the 
           building and blanketing the room in mist. 

           Rows of old wooden benches have been pushed aside, clearing 
           the center of the floor, where a 5’x5’x5’ ALUMINUM CAGE sits 
           shrouded in fog.

           With their weapons raised, Levi and Drasa slowly approach the 
           cage as the smell grows more intense...

           They step closer, peering though the mist, trying to see if 
           there is anything inside, when suddenly...

           A REVOLTING HUMAN FIGURE SURGES UP out of the fog at bottom 
           of the cage, SEIZING THE BARS.

           Levi and Drasa both reactively take a step back as...
           THE FIGURE SCREAMS AT THEM WITH A HOARSE, VIOLENT, FEVERISH 
           TONE...

                                 J.D.
                        KILL ME! YOU FUCKING MOTHERFUCKERS! 
                        JUST FUCKIN’ KILL ME!

           The man’s ragged voice is oddly familiar. The accent... is 
           Australian.

           Levi stares at him...

                                 LEVI
                        J.D.?

           J.D.’s face is filthy and his clothing are revoltingly  
           soiled. His eyes are frantic. 

           His hair has turned white as snow. He looks as though he’s 
           aged twenty years since Levi last saw him...nearly 
           unrecognizable.

           J.D.’s wild eyes stare back at Levi, as if he’s desperately, 
           with all the mental faculties he has left, trying to place 
           his face... 

                                 J.D.
                        You’re...fuck...I know you...who 
                        are you...

           J.D. suddenly presses his palms hard into his eyes, as if 
           somehow trying to bring him clarity...

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        You’re...the American. The 
                        Marine...

           Levi nods.

                                 LEVI
                        Levi.

                                 J.D.
                        Right...right. Levi. I remember...I 
                        remember you...

                                 LEVI
                             (motioning)
                        This is Drasa. East Tower.

           It’s clear J.D. is lost in his own traumatized mind.

           Levi and Drasa exchange a glance.
                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        J.D....let’s get you out of there, 
                        okay?

           Hot tears rise in J.D.’s eyes. 

           He slowly nods.

                                 J.D.
                        Okay...

           Levi takes aim at the PAD-LOCK on the cage door with his 
           SIDEARM.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Wait. Please...

           Levi pauses.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Before you let me out...you have to 
                        promise me something, mate...both 
                        of you...

                                 LEVI
                        Alright...

                                 J.D.
                        Promise me, whatever happens...you 
                        cannot trust me.

           J.D. looks at Levi and Drasa.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        If...if there comes a moment...when 
                        you need to put me down. You 
                        fuckin’ put me down. Understand?

           INT. CENTRAL HALL - ABANDONED TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Freed from the cage, J.D. ravenously eats an ENERGY BAR from 
           Drasa’s rations pack. 

           She hands him a canteen of water and he washes the food down.

                                 DRASA
                             (to J.D. re: the bar)
                        Do you want another?

           He nods.

                                 J.D.
                        Please.
           Drasa hands J.D. another energy bar as Levi peers out a 
           broken window into the thick fog, unable to see more than few 
           meters.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        When I left West Tower in 
                        September...I headed south. Four 
                        days out, I was crossing a field 
                        about...140 klicks from here, when 
                        three Blackhawks appeared on the 
                        horizon. I didn’t know if they were 
                        my pickup team or my assassins. I 
                        found out. 

           J.D. pauses, unwrapping the second ration bar with trembling 
           fingers. 

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        They gassed me, drugged me, and I 
                        woke up at the far south end of the 
                        gorge. With no way to get out. I 
                        was able to last a month, exploring 
                        mid-day, hiding at twilight. 
                        Eventually the Hollowmen found me. 
                        But they didn’t kill me. Instead, 
                        they put me in that fuckin’ cage...

           He runs his filthy hand through his white hair.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                             (to Levi)
                        I’m sure you can see for 
                        yourself...I mean, take a good 
                        look...there’s something
                        happening... 

           Levi and Drasa exchange a glance.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        It’s the gorge, mate. It’s this 
                        place. There’s something about this 
                        place. It changes you. Everything. 
                        My eyes...they’re fucked. They get 
                        worse every day... 

           J.D.’s hands tremble. 

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        The Hollowmen...They were all human 
                        beings once. I think they were 
                        soldiers...

           J.D. stops himself. His internal strain is palpable.
                                 LEVI
                        Keep talking, J.D.. Tell us 
                        everything...

                                 J.D.
                        It’s better if I show you.

           EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           With weapons raised, Drasa and Levi follow J.D. through the 
           fog, crossing through the abandoned town square toward a 
           PASSAGEWAY BORED INTO THE ROCK AT THE BASE OF THE GORGE’S 
           WESTERN WALL...

           EXT./INT. PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Drasa and Levi switch on their HEADLAMPS as they step through 
           the entrance, following J.D. down a wet, dark, overgrown 
           corridor.

           They reach a huge pile of decades old DEBRIS in the 
           passageway: random welded together STEEL REBAR, SLABS OF 
           CONCRETE, and OLD FURNITURE that once completely blocked the 
           corridor.

                                 DRASA
                             (re: the debris)
                        Barricade...

           Levi nods.

                                 LEVI
                        Built in a hurry...

           There is a small, NARROW OPENING THAT’S BEEN TUNNELED BETWEEN 
           TWO SECTIONS OF STEEL REBAR, ALLOWING PASSAGE. 

           Drasa REMOVES HER HEAVY GEAR PACK and sets it aside in order 
           to fit through the opening.

           One-by-one they pull themselves through the tight, 
           claustrophobic opening in the barricade. 

           INT. ABANDONED COMMAND CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           The passageway beyond the barricade leads into a large, 
           abandoned, BUNKER-LIKE COMMAND CENTER. 

           BULKY, CIRCA 1940’s ERA COMPUTER TERMINALS AND VACCUM TUBE 
           PROCESSORS, the first of their kind, are overgrown with moss.
           The SKELETAL REMAINS OF A DOZEN HUMAN BEINGS lie in various 
           positions throughout the room. Their clothing and flesh have 
           decayed away over decades. 

           Moisture from the surrounding rock seeps through the paint 
           peeled bunker walls.

           A massive, outdated, 10’x20’ MAP OF THE WORLD looms on the 
           wall covered in dark mold. 

                                 DRASA
                        This was a command and control 
                        center...

                                 J.D.
                        This place...this whole base...the 
                        whole town was some kind of secret 
                        allied contingency plan...

           Levi stares at something nearby. 

           Drasa turns, FOLLOWING LEVI’S GAZE to...

           A large, BLACK AND WHITE FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH hung on the wall 
           of the command center where we see... 

           CLOSE ON PHOTO as we see the ICONIC FACES OF...

           UNITED STATES PRESIDENT FRANKILN ROOSEVELT, SOVIET PRIME 
           MINSTER JOSEPH STALIN, AND BRITISH PRIME MISTER WINSTON 
           CHURCHILL - THE ‘BIG THREE’ ALLIED LEADERS SIT BESIDE ONE 
           ANOTHER, ENGAGED IN THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION AT THE HISTORIC 
           TEHRAN CONFRENCE IN FINAL DAYS OF NOVEMBER, 1943.

                                 LEVI
                             (off J.D.’s comment)
                        ...In the event the Nazi’s won the 
                        war... 

           There’s a pause...

                                 DRASA
                        From the bottom of the chasm at the 
                        far end of the world? Tactically, 
                        you would never stage a last stand 
                        from here?

           Levi’s mind is racing. He glances at the skeletal remains, 
           considering deeply... 

                                 LEVI
                        Unless you were developing 
                        something so dangerous, you needed 
                        complete isolation and secrecy.
           Drasa nods.

                                 DRASA
                        One thing’s for certain. Something 
                        went very, very wrong here.

           Levi nods.

                                 LEVI
                        And for seventy years, they’ve been 
                        trying to keep the aftermath from 
                        getting out.

           INT. PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi, Drasa, and J.D. make their way down the dark, dank 
           passageway back toward the exit barricade...

           Levi glances at J.D.. The man’s eyes are feverish in the 
           light beam of his headlamp. 

                                 LEVI
                        J.D., what other facilities are 
                        here? Is there a lab or something? 

                                 J.D.
                        Don’t know. I only made it this 
                        far. I haven’t been further down 
                        river.

                                 DRASA
                        I don’t get it. If a secret 
                        coalition of allied powers knew 
                        they had self-created some kind of 
                        fucked-beyond-belief situation down 
                        here...why wouldn’t they just send 
                        in a stealth bomber squadron? Erase 
                        it all and call it a day...

           Levi shakes his head.

                                 LEVI
                        Don’t know.

           As they reach the passageway barricade, one-by-one they pull 
           themselves through the narrow opening between the welded 
           steel beams.

           As Drasa reached the far side of the barricade they see 
           daylight at the end of the passageway.

           She pauses suddenly.
                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 DRASA
                        The pack...the pack is gone...

           Levi, Drasa, and J.D. shine their headlamps, looking 
           frantically for Drasa’s heavy gear pack.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        It has the auto-ascenders in it. 
                        That’s our way out.

                                 LEVI
                        Can’t have gotten far...

           Drasa checks the action on her AK-12.

                                 DRASA
                        Let’s go...

           As the three near the passageway exit opening, they slow 
           their advance, proceeding cautiously, peering out the into 
           the thick fog.

           Fifteen meters away in the fog, at the very edge of their 
           vision, DRASA’S HEAVY PACK LIES ON THE GROUND IN THE CENTER 
           OF THE ABANDONED TOWN SQUARE. 

           There is no sign of Hollowmen. 

           Drasa, Levi, and J.D. exchange glances.

                                 LEVI
                        They’re playing with us.

           The fog shrouds their surroundings...but they can HEAR THE 
           SOUND OF IDLE HORSE HOOVES beyond their field of vision.

                                 J.D.
                        They’re out there. Can’t see a 
                        fuckin’ thing...

           Drasa reaches in her waist satchel, retrieving two SMOKE 
           GRENADE CANISTERS.

                                 DRASA
                        Lets make it mutual... 

           Drasa pulls the pin on both smoke canisters and PITCHES them 
           out into the abandoned town square...
           EXT. ABANDONED TOWN SQUARE - SECONDS LATER

           A WALL OF VIBRANT PURPLE SMOKE plumes across the passageway 
           entrance, MASKING THEIR MOVEMENT as...

           Weapons raised, moving as a unit with their backs to one 
           another, Levi, Drasa, and J.D. swiftly advance out of the 
           passageway.

           Between the fog and the smoke, there’s almost zero 
           visibility. 

           Nearing the pack lying on the ground they hear a sudden, 
           audible METALIC RACKING SOUND OF THREE SEPARATE WEAPON 
           ACTIONS somewhere out in the fog.

           Drasa, Levi, and J.D. STOP DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS...

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the racking noise)
                        Sounds like an old Thompson...

           In that instant, somewhere out in the fog, THREE, 70-YEAR-OLD 
           MILITARY TOMMYGUNS OPEN FIRE.

           The barrage is deafening. 

           ORANGE TRACERS STREAK through the fog and purple smoke as .45 
           Caliber rounds hum past Levi, Drasa, and J.D....

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Get the pack!

           They break into a run, RETURNING FIRE, keeping their heads 
           down as they scramble through the fog. 

           Ahead of Levi and J.D., DRASA REACHES THE PACK FIRST, but in 
           the instant she motions to grab it...

           A BURIED LOOP OF HIDDEN CABLE ON THE GROUND CINCHES TIGHTLY 
           AROUND HER BOOTS, SNARING HER ANKLES... 

           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HORSE, SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE FOG, BREAK 
           INTO A SPRINT...

           AND IN THAT SECOND, THE HIDDEN CABLE, EXTENDING OUT INTO THE 
           FOG PULLS TAUGHT, VIOLENTLY JERKING DRASA’S FEET OUT FROM 
           UNDER HER, DRAGGING HER OUT INTO THE MIST...  

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        DRASA!

           In an instant, SHE IS GONE.
           PINNING LEVI AND J.D. DOWN, THE TOMMY-GUN FIRE CONTINUES FOR 
           A FEW MORE SECONDS, THEN SUDDENLY DISSIPATES AS LEVI AND J.D. 
           HEAR TWO MORE UNSEEN RIDERS GALLOP AWAY...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (to J.D.)
                        Come on!

           EXT. TOWN HALL ENTRANCE - SECONDS LATER

           With Drasa’s heavy pack on his back, struggling with his 
           shattered left arm, Levi manages to mount the horse he 
           previously tied to the Town Hall porch...

           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - SAME MOMENT

           AT GALLOPING SPEED, DRASA IS VIOLENLY DRAGGED BY HER ANKLES 
           THROUGH THE DEAD FOREST, STRIKING THE UNDERBRUSH EMERGING OUT 
           OF THE FOG... 

           OUT OF CONTROL, DRASA STRAINS TO FREE HER AK-12 FROM IT’S 
           STRAPPED POSITION FROM BENEATH HER BODY. 

           DRASA PULLS HERSELF UPRIGHT INTO A SIT-UP POSTION, RAISING 
           THE WEAPON, TRYING TO GET A CLEAN SHOT AT THE THREE RIDERS 
           AHEAD IN THE MIST. SHE FIRES...

           EXT. THE TRAIL AHEAD - DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - SAME MOMENT

           DRASA’S BULLET EXITS OUT OF ONE OF THREE HOLLOWMEN’S CHESTS.

           The CREATURE TOPPLES FROM HIS MOUNT as the other two Riders 
           continue...

           DRASA FIRES AGAIN...

           The SECOND RIDER’S HEAD SPLITS OPEN, its body slumping 
           backward like a limp toy...

           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - SAME MOMENT

           Galloping on horseback, following the tracks in pursuit, Levi 
           and J.D. HEAR THE ECHO OF DRASA’S RIFLE SHOTS somewhere ahead 
           in the fog.

           Levi, wildly spurs his horse, galloping faster, barely 
           holding on...
           EXT. DEAD PINE FOREST - GORGE - SECONDS LATER

           TRYING TO HOLD HER DRAGGING BODY UPRIGHT, DRASA TAKES AIM 
           AGAIN, THIS TIME AT THE REMAINING LEAD RIDER PULLING HER...

           When suddenly A TREE STUMP APPEARS AHEAD OUT OF THE FOG. 

           At the last second, Drasa shifts her body trying to avoid a 
           collision.

           WITH A BRUTAL THUDDING SOUND, DRASA STRIKES THE STUMP HARD, 
           HER HEAD SNAPPING BACKWARD.

           DRASA’S BODY SLACKS...THE BLUNT BLOW KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS 
           AS SHE’S DRAGGED ON HER BACK THROUGH THE FOG...

           EXT. RIVER’S EDGE - DOWNSTREAM - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           We HOLD CLOSE ON DRASA. Her eyes are closed. 

           Her body lies still in the mud at the river’s foggy edge.

           WE SHIFT ANGLES to REVEAL...

           A REVOLTING HOLLOWMEN towers over her. Its face is partially 
           rotted. Its hair and pupils are bone white. A WWII ERA 
           THOMPSON SUB-MACHINEGUN is strapped to its chest. 

           A faded NAME-TAG reading...A. SHESHUNOFF, is embroidered on 
           the creature’s tattered remains of a uniform. 

           The Hollowmen seizes Drasa by the collar of her tactical 
           vest, carrying her limp body into the rushing river, 
           venturing deeper and deeper into the current, disappearing 
           into the fog.

           EXT. RIVER’S EDGE - DOWNSTREAM - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Following the tracks, Levi and J.D. arrive at the muddy 
           river’s edge and dismount.

           Levi eyes the Hollowmen’s abandoned horse drinking from the 
           river nearby.

           He spots Drasa’s AK-12 lying on the ground nearby.

                                 LEVI
                        They went into the water here...

           Levi reaches down, pulling Drasa’s AK from the mud. 

           He clears the mud from the barrel and checks the magazine.
           Levi motions to continue...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go.

           J.D. pauses.

                                 J.D.
                        Listen...let’s just take a beat 
                        here, mate. 

           Levi pauses.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Think about it. We have the pack. 
                        We have the auto-ascenders. We find 
                        that cable and we have our way 
                        out...

           Levi stares at J.D..

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Come on, mate. (pause) This 
                        girl...what is she? A Russian?

                                 LEVI
                        She’s Lithuanian. (pause) And so 
                        you, and God, are absolutely 
                        fucking clear...I’m not leaving 
                        this gorge without her. 

           J.D. returns Levi’s gaze for a long beat, then nods with 
           sincere understanding...

                                 J.D.
                        Okay, mate. (pause) I’m with ya.

           EXT. RIVER - DOWNSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER

           Walking in the river with limited visibility, Levi and J.D. 
           make their way downstream.

           As they wade through the fog, the river current quickens. 

           In the distance they hear a RISING SOUND in the 
           fog...something that sounds like an IMMENSE WATERFALL...

           A moment later, appearing out of the fog, Levi and J.D. see 
           an IMMENSE CIRCULAR HOLE IN THE EARTH 20 METERS IN DIAMETER.

           THE RIVER FLOWS DIRECTLY INTO THE HOLE...GIVING THE SENSE 
           THAT THE RUSHING WHITE WATER SIMPLY DISAPPEARS INTO 
           NOTHINGNESS...
                                 J.D.
                        What the...

           A MASSIVE CURTAIN OF FOG PLUMES FROM THE HOLE LIKE A CHIMNEY, 
           FILLING THE ENTIRE GORGE VALLEY WITH IMPENETRABLE FOG.

           Levi shakes his head...

                                 LEVI
                        The fog...it’s like it’s all coming 
                        from down there...

           They move closer. 

           The wild rushing river water cascades off the edge, falling 
           downward...

           Keeping their footing steady in the fast moving in water, 
           Levi and J.D. peer over the edge, unable to see the bottom 
           through the rising fog....

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (re: the hole)
                        It’s too perfect...to circular...

           Suddenly, Levi’s expression is struck with realization...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        My god...

           J.D. looks at him.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        It’s a fucking missile silo.

           J.D. makes a horrified face, then nods.

                                 J.D.
                        Yeah...

           Levi pauses.

                                 LEVI
                        That’s why they couldn’t just bomb 
                        this place off the map.

                                 J.D.
                        But...why would the river flow into 
                        a missile silo?

           At a loss, Levi looks around at the landscape, then a look of 
           realization hits him...
                                 LEVI
                        An Earthquake. Remember the 
                        structures in the town? The fallen 
                        water tower? An earthquake could 
                        have fucked up everything. Changed 
                        the shape of the gorge...the course 
                        of the river...

                                 J.D.
                        Not to mention what it could’ve 
                        done to whatever they were 
                        developing here...

           Levi nods thoughtfully, then motions to the far side of the 
           hole...

                                 LEVI
                        Check the far side. Staircase...

           We FOLLOW LEVI’S GAZE across the expanse of the silo opening, 
           to the top landing of a 70-year-old rusted STEEL STAIRCASE 
           leading down THOUSANDS OF STEPS along the curved interior 
           wall of the silo... 

           INT. STAIRCASE - MISSILE SILO - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The river flows into the silo, free falling downward like a 
           glacial waterfall.

           The rising curtain of fog envelopes Levi and J.D. as they 
           descend the staircase, deeper and deeper into the silo...

           All around them, the rock walls have been TUNNELED OUT BY 
           HAND INTO CAVES like ANCIENT CLIFF DWELLINGS.

                                 J.D.
                             (re: the caves)
                        They must live down here. Like a 
                        hive...

           Through the plume of fog, Levi and J.D. begin to visually 
           MAKE OUT THE LOWER LEVEL. 

           They both stop in their tracks...

           A PALE RADIOACTIVE GLOW emits from the bottom of the silo.

           Below them, a massive, moss-covered, SEVEN-STORY BALLISTIC 
           MISSILE LIES COLLAPSED AND BROKEN IN SECTIONS AT THE BOTTOM 
           OF THE SILO...

           THE OVERSIZED, UNCONVENTIONAL WARHEAD IS RUPTURED. 
           Over the decades it’s been DISCHARGING WHATEVER EXPERIMENTAL 
           PAYLOAD IT ONCE CARRIED INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE SILO. 

           AS THE FALLING RIVER WATER LANDS ON THE CONTAMINATION SITE, 
           IT IS INSTANTLY SUPERHEATED BY SOME UNKNOWN RADIATION, 
           EVAPORATING AND RISING IN FORM OF THE PLUMING FOG FILLING THE 
           GORGE VALLEY. 

           Levi and J.D. stare in horror at the rising vapor...

                                 LEVI
                        It’s...it’s in the fog. Whatever 
                        was in that unholy weapon, they’re 
                        breathing it. That’s what makes 
                        them what they are...the fog.

           J.D.’s mind races...

                                 J.D.
                             (as if to himself)
                        The longer you breathe it, the more 
                        it changes you...

           He glances at Levi...

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        Look at me...

           Levi looks at J.D.. The Aussie’s hair is white and physical 
           appearance is deathly.

                                 J.D. (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been breathing it for five 
                        weeks, mate...

           INT. SILO CAVE CORRIDOR NETWORK - SAME MOMENT

           In the half light of a cave we HOLD CLOSE ON DRASA’S FACE: 
           Her eyes are closed. Her mouth is slightly ajar...

           Suddenly a grey, DECAYED FINGER enters the frame...TOUCHING 
           DRASA’S UNCONSCIOUS LIPS as we...

           We SHIFT ANGLES REVEALING Sheshunoff, the Hollowmen, standing 
           over Drasa. 

           The post-human creature stares with WHITE PUPILS at Drasa’s 
           youthful appearance, as if some transient, long-buried 
           feeling was suddenly unearthed.

           The revolting creature gently RUNS ITS RETCHED FINGERS OVER 
           DRASA’S FACE, when SUDDENLY...
           Drasa’s eye’s FLASH OPEN. 

           LIKE A LION, SHE SEIZES IT’S RETCHED HAND IN HER MOUTH, 
           BITING DOWN HARD.

           As the Hollowmen attempts to retract its hand, Drasa, in one 
           fluid motion, frees her TACTICAL KNIFE FROM HER JUMP BOOT, 
           FLASHES OPEN THE BLADE WITH A FLICK OF HER THUMB, AND SLASHES 
           THE HOLLOWMEN LATERALLY CROSS THE THROAT.

           The creature staggers backward, holding its neck, as a flush 
           of dark blood rushes from between its fingers.

           Drasa is on her feet in an instant, front kicking Sheshunoff 
           hard against the wall. 

           SHE DRIVES HER KNIFE DEEP INTO THE CREATURE’S CHEST, TWISTING 
           THE BLADE, KILLING IT.

           Turning on her headlamp, Drasa picks up the old Thompson Sub 
           Machine gun and checks the magazine...

           INT. STORAGE FACILITY - SILO CORRIDOR NETWORK - SECONDS LATER

           Drasa advances down a narrow cavelike looking for an exit.

           As she turns a corner into a LARGE STORAGE FACILTY, Drasa 
           stops in her tracks seeing...

           SEVERAL HUNDRED DECAYING HOLLOWMEN SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE 
           ROCKY GROUND. 

           THEIR EYES ARE ALL CLOSED. 

           THEIR HEADS ARE BOWED IN A STATE OF MID-DAY TRANCE-SLEEP, AS 
           IF MEDITATING.

           Lining the walls are what appear to SCORES of corroding 
           experimental MISSILE WARHEADS...SOME NUCLEAR, SOME 
           BIOLOGICAL, SOME UNKNOWN...

           On the far side of the storage facility is an EXIT TO 
           DAYLIGHT.

           Trying to remain absolutely silent, Drasa walks quietly 
           through sea of entranced Hollowmen, placing each footstep 
           carefully, attempting not to disturb the idle creatures...

           As Drasa nears the far side of the room she quickens her 
           step, almost at the exit when...

           A SEATED HOLLOWMEN SEIZES HER ANKLE AS SHE PASSES BY. 
           The creatures white eyes open as it unleashes a DEAFENING 
           SHRIEK that echoes through the room, WAKING THE OTHERS...

           Without hesitation, Drasa FIRES A BURST OF ROUNDS FROM THE 
           THOMPSON at point blank range into the seated creature’s head 
           and neck, releasing its grip on her ankle.

           Drasa breaks into a sprint for the exit as the HORDE OF 
           HOLLOWMEN RISE TO THEIR FEET IN PURSUIT OF HER... 

           INT. BOTTOM OF MISSILE SILO - SECONDS LATER

           Firing in bursts over her shoulder with the TOMMYGUN, Drasa 
           races out of the chamber into a wall of ascending fog near 
           the bottom of the silo. 

           She spots the rusted staircase and begins sprinting up the 
           stairs at three at a time...

           INT. STAIRCASE - MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS

           A DOZEN HOWLING HOLLOWMEN race after Drasa up the massive, 
           curving staircase, ascending the curving contour of the 
           missile silo’s inner wall toward the daylight above... 

           As she runs, Drasa takes aim to fire down the stars at her 
           pursuers, but the old Thompson action JAMS.

           Drasa pitches the weapon aside and continues running up the 
           stairs, but the vicious creatures are far faster than humans, 
           and close on her quickly...

           In that moment, the lead HOLLOWMEN LEAPS AIRBORNE ONTO 
           DRASA’S BACK, GRIPPING HER FACE FROM BEHIND.

           Drasa, stumbles, trying to keep her balance as a second 
           CREATURE SEIZES HER LEG.

           Kicking and clawing, Drasa fights with all her strength, but 
           there are simply too many of them. 

           They hold her arms, beginning to drag her backwards down the 
           stairs.

           The Hollowmen gripping Drasa’s face OPENS ITS ROTTED, TOOTHY 
           MOUTH TO BITE DOWN ON DRASA’S EXPOSED NECK when suddenly...

           A SHOT RINGS OUT AND A BULLET HUMS WITHIN AN INCH OF DRASA’S 
           EAR, PUNCHING THROUGH THE CREATURE’S RIGHT EYE.

           A SECOND SHOT IS FIRED, striking the Hollowmen gripping 
           Drasa’s legs.
           Drasa fights free from their grip, looking up through the fog 
           as she runs. 

           She SMILES as SHE SEES LEVI far above on the stairs...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LEVI’S POSTIION ON STAIRS - MISSILE SILO - SAME MOMENT

           With his shattered left arm taped to his chest, Levi is 
           seated on an upper stair with the AK-12 gripped between on 
           his knees. 

           He fires perfectly placed SHOTS...shooting rounds past Drasa, 
           CUTTING DOWN the pursuers behind her as she runs.

           As Drasa nears, the AK-12 ‘CLICK’S-EMPTY’. 

           Levi ejects and pitches the empty magazine. 

           He has no back-up ammunition for her rifle.

                                 LEVI
                        Drasa! Magazine!

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. DRASA’S POSITION ON STAIRS - MISSILE SILO - SAME MOMENT

           Heaving for breath as she runs, Drasa pulls her LAST LOADED 
           RIFLE MAGAZINE FROM HER TACTICAL VEST AND PITCHES IT AIRBORNE 
           UP THE STAIRS...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. LEVI’S POSITION - STAIRS - MISSILE SILO - A SECOND LATER

           Levi somehow CATCHES THE MAGAZINE IN MID-ARC, inserts it in 
           the AK, and OPENS FIRE again...creating a BOTTLENECK OF DEAD 
           HOLLOWMEN on the stairs behind Drasa, slowing their pursuit. 

           At the same time, J.D. pulls a GRENADE from Drasa’s heavy 
           pack and wedges it behind a STRUCTURAL BRACKET anchoring the 
           staircase to the silo wall...

           As Drasa reaches them Levi yells to J.D...

                                 LEVI
                             (to J.D.)
                        Do it!
           J.D. PULLS THE TIMER PIN on the strategically positioned 
           grenade and all three of them sprint up the stairs toward the 
           silo opening...

           EXT. SILO OPENING - GORGE - SECONDS LATER

           Seconds later, as Levi, Drasa, and J.D. race up the stairs 
           toward the silo opening, the GRENADE VIOLENTLY DETONATES 
           BEHIND THEM, DESTROYING THE STRUCTURAL BRACKETS AND SEVERING 
           THE OLD STEEL STAIRCASE IN HALF.

           The collective weight of the Hollowmen collapses the unsound 
           staircase, sending the horrid creatures plummeting downward 
           into the fog.

           At the last second, Drasa, Levi, and J.D. reach the silo rim 
           as the last of the staircase drops out from beneath them.

           EXT. RIM - MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS

           For an instant, standing on the silo rim, Levi, Drasa, and 
           J.D. catch their breath. 

           They peer down into the silo. 

           There’s no movement. No shrieks or howls. Just the sound of 
           the cascading river water and rising of the fog. 

                                 DRASA
                        Nice shooting.

           Levi starts to smile...when suddenly, peering downward, his 
           EXPRESSION TRANSFORMS TO DREAD...

                                 LEVI
                        Fuck me...

           We FOLLOW LEVI’S GAZE downward to REVEAL...

           HUNDREDS OF HOLLOWMEN appear out of the fog below, 
           aggressively scaling the silo walls upward toward them... 

           EXT. RIVER - GORGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Drasa, Levi, and J.D. spur their horses, galloping at full 
           speed upriver...

           Not far behind, a MASSIVE WAR PARTY OF HOLLOWMEN follow on 
           horseback, gaining ground...
                                 DRASA
                             (yelling as she rides)
                        Cross to the east side! Head for 
                        the wall! The cable has to be 
                        close...

           EXT. EASTERN GORGE WALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Drasa, Levi, and J.D. ride hard through the fog, following 
           the contour of the eastern gorge wall frantically looking for 
           any sign of the hanging cable.

           The thunderous sound of the approaching of the Hollowmen army 
           rises through the fog, growing louder and louder...

                                 J.D.
                             (pointing)
                        There! On the ledge! Caught in the 
                        light!

           Levi and Drasa turn as J.D. POINTS TO A ROCK LEDGE ten meters 
           up the canyon wall, where the light catches on the hanging, 
           severed end of a thin, STEEL CABLE that disappears upward 
           into the fog.

           The three dismount their horses and scramble up the rock wall 
           toward the ledge...

           EXT. ROCK LEDGE - EASTERN GORGE WALL - SECONDS LATER

           As Drasa pulls the TWO AUTO-ASCENDERS from her pack the army 
           of creatures emerge out of the fog, surrounding them on the 
           ledge...

           Levi opens fire, taking aim, designating one shot per target, 
           trying to buy Drasa time to rig the AUTO-ASCENDER 
           HARNESSES...

                                 DRASA
                             (to J.D.)
                        How much do you weigh?

                                 J.D.
                        100...maybe 105 kilograms

                                 DRASA
                        Levi, what about you?

           As Levi takes aim, SHOOTING A HOLLOWMEN off his horse...
                                 LEVI
                             (while shooting)
                        190 pounds or so. Don’t know the 
                        conversion off the hand...

           Drasa quickly does the math in her head...

                                 DRASA
                             (to Levi)
                        It’s about 40 pounds less...

           She turns to J.D., handing him a harness.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (to J.D.)
                        You’re going to go first. I’ll 
                        double up with Levi.

                                 J.D.
                             (re: Auto-ascender)
                        Will it handle you both?

                                 DRASA
                        Don’t know....

           She locks the first Auto-ascender on the cable, then clips 
           with a CARABINER to J.D.’s climbing harness. 

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (to J.D.)
                        We’ll be right behind you. Don’t 
                        stop!

           J.D. nods and hits the ASCEND SWITCH. 

           The Auto-ascender’s powerful electrical motor pulses into 
           action, pulling the hanging cable through its multiple pulley 
           system, LIFTING J.D. SWIFTLY UP THE GORGE CANYON WALL.  

           Within seconds, J.D. disappears in the fog above.

           As a WAVE OF HOLLOWMEN begin to climb toward ledge as Drasa 
           feverishly rigs the second auto-ascender to the cable.

           Levi continues to FIRE as Drasa straps a CLIMBING HARNESS 
           AROUND BOTH OF THEM.

           As the first of the creatures come over the edge of the ledge 
           the AK-12 CLICKS-EMPTY, running out of ammunition.

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the rifle)
                        Shit!
           Levi SWINGS THE EMPTY ASSAULT RIFLE LIKE A CLUB, STRIKING THE 
           CHARGING HOLLOWMEN IN THE HEAD as Drasa hits the ASCEND 
           SWITCH on the AUTO-ASCENDER.

           Levi and Drasa are lifted off their feet, riding up the cable 
           into the fog. 

           The electric Auto-ascender motor STRAINS, moving only at half 
           of J.D.’s speed. 

           It’s clear Levi and Drasa’s collective weight is greater than 
           what the device designed for.

           STRAY BULLETS hum through the fog as the Hollowmen take blind 
           shots into the fog with 70-year-old weaponry.

           EXT. CABLE - EASTERN GORGE WALL - A MOMENT LATER

           With their foreheads touching in the shared climbing harness, 
           Levi and Drasa climb higher and higher.

           The sound of sporadic gunshots far below grows distant.

           Half way up the Eastern gorge wall they emerge out of the fog 
           layer. 

           The warm, late afternoon sun falls on their faces and they 
           can see the eastern rim CONTAINMENT FENCE 80 meters above 
           them growing closer.

           For an instant, it feels they have found refuge from the 
           gorge, when suddenly...

           The cable hanging below them BEGINS TO QUAKE.

           Levi and Drasa look down as a DOZEN HOLLOWMEN emerge out of 
           the fog layer, rapidly CLIMBING THE CABLE, FIST-OVER-FIST. 

           Their white-pupiled eyes are rabid and relentless. 

           Numb to pain, dark blood streams down their arms as the thin 
           cable cuts into the flesh of their decayed hands. 

           Levi reaches for his handgun, but it’s long gone.

                                 LEVI
                             (re: no weapon)
                        I got nothin’. You?

           Drasa shakes her head.

           The creatures quickly gain ground on Drasa and Levi...
           EXT. EASTERN RIM CONTAINMENT FENCE - SECONDS LATER

           60 meters above Levi and Drasa, J.D. reaches the Eastern 
           CONTAINMENT FENCE. 

           He pulls himself over the lip to safety.

           J.D. looks down, seeing the Hollowmen closing in on Drasa and 
           Levi. 

           He quickly unhooks his harness, stands, and sprints toward 
           east tower...

           EXT. CABLE- EASTERN GORGE WALL - SECONDS LATER

           On the cable, 40 meters below the containment fence, the 
           Hollowmen in the lead catches up to Levi and Drasa, SEIZING 
           LEVI’S ANKLES IN ITS GRIP.

           The sudden additional weight is too much for the already 
           burdened Auto-ascender, and the DEVICE FREEZES UP AND CEASES 
           ASCENDING.

           The creature bites down on Levi’s leg, drawing blood from his 
           calf...

                                 LEVI
                             (re: the bite)
                        Arrghhh...

           With her boot heel, Drasa viciously KICKS THE BEAST IN HEAD 
           over and over, trying to get it to release it’s grip on Levi.

           In an instant, A SECOND HOLLOWMEN, climbs over the body of 
           the first, seizing Drasa’s legs. 

           She looks up, SCREAMING TO J.D. in the distance as he runs 
           out onto the east tower platform...

                                 DRASA
                             (screaming)
                        J.D.!!! We need help!!!

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           J.D. surges out onto the East tower platform and grabs 
           Drasa’s Russian Tochnost rifle. 

           He aims the weapon downward into the gorge as we...
           SHIFT TO J.D.’S POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Drasa, Levi, and the 
           Hollowmen that climb on them ARE ALL A BLURRED INTO ONE MASS. 
           HE CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM CLEARLY.

           J.D. frantically rubs his eyes, and looks again...but as the 
           CROSSHAIRS SWEEP OVER THEM, HE CANNOT MAKE OUT ONE TARGET 
           FROM ANOTHER...

           EXT. CABLE - EAST GORGE WALL - SECONDS LATER

           Weaponless, Levi and Drasa FIGHT THEM HAND TO HAND, hanging 
           on the cable as more and more overwhelm them from below...

                                 DRASA
                             (screaming)
                        J.D.!!! 

           She looks up...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                             (to Levi)
                        He’s not shooting! Why isn’t he 
                        shooting?

           She looks up, not seeing him on the platform above.

           A look of dread crosses her face...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Is he fucking us?

           Levi looks at her, about to speak when...

           Another SURGING HOLLOWMEN lashes out, grabbing at Drasa’s 
           throat. Levi BLOCKS THE STRIKE AND PITCHES THE FLAILING 
           CREATURE OFF THEM...

           ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY DOZENS MORE WRAITHS climbing up the 
           cable from below...

           EXT. EASTERN RIM CONTAINMENT FENCE - SECONDS LATER

           J.D. races down the rim ladder holding SOMETHING UNSEEN.

           He runs out across the outstretched containment fence to the 
           outer edge.

           Reaching the top of cable, we suddenly see what J.D. is 
           carrying in his hand...A CABLE CUTTER.
           J.D.’s hands tremble as he GRIPS THE CABLE CUTTER, STARING AT 
           THE TAUGHT THIN STEEL CABLE HOLDING DRASA AND LEVI’S LIVES IN 
           THE BALANCE...

           EXT. CABLE - EAST GORGE WALL - SECONDS LATER

           Overwhelmed by a mass of enemies clinging up their bodies, 
           Drasa and Levi fight tooth and nail, STRIKING AND CLAWING AND 
           DIGGING THEIR THUMBS INTO THE EYES OF THE HIDEOUS CREATURES, 
           trying to somehow live...

           But it’s clear by the sheer numbers, their fight is futile. 
           All is lost, until... 

           Suddenly, from somewhere above, they hear a METALLIC ZIPPING 
           SOUND growing rapidly closer... 

           They look up to see a CABLE CUTTER STREAKING DOWNWARD TOWARD 
           THEM ON THE CABLE, ATTACHED WITH A CLIMBING CARABINER.

                                 LEVI
                        J.D...

           With his last shred of strength, Levi breaks the grip of a 
           Wraith and reaches up, grabbing the cutter as it glides down 
           the cable line.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Un clip it!

           Drasa reaches up with her one free hand, unclipping the 
           cutter from the cable above.

                                 DRASA
                        Cut it!

           Levi lashes out with the tool, SEVERING THE CABLE BELOW THEIR 
           ATTACHMENT POINT AS WE...

           SHIFT ANGLES TO SEE: AS IF IN SLOW MOTION, THE SECTION OF  
           CABLE BELOW LEVI AND DRASA FALLS SLACK AS...

           COUNTLESS HOLLOWMEN SHRIEK AND KICK AND FLAIL IN THE AIR.

           THEY PLUMMET DOWNWARD, BACK INTO THE FOGGY GORGE LIKE DEMONS 
           RETURNING TO HELL.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Blackness. 

           We hear the amplified crackle of a RECORD PLAYER NEEDLE being 
           gently placed on a spinning TURN TABLE...
           We hear the PULSING BEAT AND DESCENDING PIANO NOTES of the 
           opening bars of Alicia Key’s 2007 single, NO ONE*...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. EAST TOWER - THAT NIGHT

           The POWERFUL MUSIC CONTINUES as we see a SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -CLOSE ON: NINE SHOT GLASSES in a row are FILLED WITH 
           LIQUOR...

                                 MUSIC
                        I just want you close, 
                        where you can stay forever, 
                        you can be sure, 
                        that it will only get better...

           -SECONDS LATER, AS THE STEREO SPEAKERS PULSE - DRASA, LEVI, 
           AND J.D. TOUCH THEIR GLASSES TOGETHER, POUNDING THREE SHOTS 
           EACH IN SUCCESSIVE UNISON, CELEBRATING THE VERY FACT THAT 
           THEY ARE STILL ALIVE.

           -THEY SLAM THEIR EMPTY SHOT GLASSES DOWN ON THE TABLE...

                                 MUSIC (CONT'D)
                        ...You and me together, 
                        through the days and nights, 
                        I don’t worry cause everything is 
                        gonna be alright, 
                        People keep talking, 
                        they can say what they like, 
                        but all I know is everything is 
                        gonna be alright...

           -THE THREE DRUNK YOUNG SOLDIERS, HOLDING EACH OTHER ARM IN 
           ARM, SING OUT EVERY WORD ALONG WITH THE MUSIC...

                                 DRASA, LEVI, AND J.D.
                             (singing wth music)
                        ...No one, no one, no one, 
                        can get in way of what I’m feeling, 
                        no one, no one, no one,
                        can get in the way of what I feel 
                        for you...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - LATE THAT NIGHT

           The MUSIC QUIETLY CONTINUES in the background as...

           Levi, J.D. and Drasa sit together. 
           They are hammered...talking and drinking out on the east 
           observation platform.

           They stare up at brilliant constellations in the heavens...

                                 J.D.
                             (drunk, to Levi and Drasa)
                        As a kid...I was always afraid, you 
                        know? Growing up. I was afraid of 
                        fuckin’ everything. My brother. I 
                        was terrified of my brother. What a 
                        fucker...

                                                          CROSS DISOLVE 
                                                                    TO:

           MOMENTS LATER - SAME CONVERSATION...

           Drasa stares at the liquor in her glass as she speaks...

                                 DRASA
                             (drunk to J.D. and Levi)
                        She never came back. I mean...that 
                        was it. End of story. Two days 
                        before my ninth birthday. She 
                        just...she just left. But my 
                        Dad...he stayed. And he never left 
                        me be alone on my Birthday...

           MOMENTS LATER - SAME CONVERSATION...

           Levi stands, very drunk, reciting a poem by memory but 
           altering the original verse slightly to the inclusive plural 
           as his two drunk friends listen to his words...

                                 LEVI
                             (drunk, to Drasa and J.D.)
                        We know to you, 
                        We are not, 
                        what we are,
                        to ourselves.
                        To see us
                        is to see nothing. 
                        We are merely dry leaves 
                        on a dry day. 
                        But when you hear our song 
                        you will know us like no other.
                        For we are the thunder in the 
                        hills, we are the flame takers, 
                        the eaters of flowers,
                        the beasts in the tower...
                        The tolling
                        Of the bell 
                        in your last hour.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        The wishing well 
                        has swelled 
                        and swelled, 
                        so deep it is, 
                        We drink from hell.

           There’s a long beat of silence as Levi finishes his poem.

           Drasa and J.D. exchange a quiet glance. 

           Without a word, both Drasa and J.D. stand from their seats 
           and HUG LEVI under the stars.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Blackness.

           We hear the SOUND OF SONG BIRDS AT FIRST LIGHT...

           EXT. EAST TOWER - DAWN THE NEXT MORNING

           CLOSE ON: Levi and Drasa lie together in the first light of 
           morning, passed out cold in a sleeping bag on the floor of 
           east tower.

           There’s peaceful beat as we listen to sound of the songbirds 
           audible in the background, then suddenly...

           A SHADOW ENTERS THE FRAME, LOOMING OVER DRASA AND LEVI as 
           they sleep.

           We SLOWLY PAN UP to REVEAL, A STEEL BLADE OF AN AXE HOVERS 
           SIX INCHES ABOVE LEVI AND DRASA...

           WE CONTINUE TO PAN UPWARD...following THE CONTOUR OF THE AXE 
           HANDLE TO GREY FLESH OF TREMBLING HAND, then up further the 
           arm and shoulder TO REVEAL...

           J.D. STANDING OVER HIS SLEEPING FRIENDS WITH AN AXE IN HAND. 

           HIS BODY SHAKES.

           J.D.’S HEAD TURNS SLIGHTLY, REVEALING THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES 
           HAVE TURNED BRIGHT BONE WHITE...INTO A HOLLOWMEN.

           J.D. raises he axe above his head to cleave them...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           INT. EAST TOWER - MID MORNING - SEVERAL HOURS LATER 

           The mid-morning sun has risen high in the sky, stretching a 
           patch of sunlight across the floor of east tower to where...

           Levi and Drasa lie together, still in the sleeping bag on the 
           floor of east tower.

           Drasa stirs. As her eyes open, she’s instantly greeted with 
           the pain of a searing hangover.

           As Drasa unzips the sleeping bag and staggers to her feet, 
           Levi wakes.

           Levi sits on the floor with the mid-morning sunlight in 
           bloodshot eyes. 

           His broken arm throbs with vicious pain.

           Drasa steps out onto the observation platform, finds a 
           cigarette amongst the empty bottles, and lights it.

           Levi looks at her.

                                 LEVI
                             (to Drasa)
                        I think my arm hurts more than my 
                        head...but it’s pretty close. 

           She coughs as she exhales, then smiles at Levi.

                                 DRASA
                        I need to brush my teeth.

                                 LEVI
                        Same.

           Levi glances around the room.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Where’d J.D. sleep?

           Drasa shakes her head.

                                 DRASA
                        Couldn’t tell ya. It’s all a bit 
                        fuzzy.

           EXT. EAST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi and Drasa carry coffee as they walk out of east tower, 
           looking for J.D, calling his name into the distance...
                                 LEVI
                             (calling out)
                        J.D.!!!

           Levi and Drasa casually walk in different directions...

                                 DRASA
                             (calling out)
                        J.D.!!! Can you hear us?

           There is no answer.

           INT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Levi and Drasa step out on the east platform, each with a 
           SPOTTING SCOPE.

           Looking in opposite directions, together they methodically 
           and meticulously scan the distant tree lines, valleys, 
           forests for any sign of J.D...

           Suddenly Drasa, staring through her scope, grabs Levi’s 
           shoulder...

                                 DRASA
                             (through her scope)
                        I’ve got movement.  To the 
                        southeast...about three klicks, 
                        crossing the meadow...

           Levi immediately pivots and looks through his scope as we 
           shift to...

           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SPOTTING HIS SCOPE...in the far 
           distance, we recognize J.D.’s silhouette hiking southeast at 
           a clip...but something is different...

                                 LEVI
                             (looking through scope)
                        That’s him...

                                 DRASA
                             (looking through scope)
                        Look at his gait. The way he 
                        moves...

           There’s a grave pause...

                                 LEVI
                             (looking through scope)
                        Yeah. I see it.
           LEVI’S P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE: J.D.’S GAIT AND PHYSICAL 
           MOVEMENT HAVE CHANGED.HE MOVES FRENETICALLY, HUNCHED OVER IN 
           THE TELL TALE SIGN OF A HOLLOWMEN...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (like J.D. would say)
                        Oh, mate...

           As their minds race, strain rises in Drasa and Levi’s 
           voices...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                             (softly)
                        God...damn...

                                 DRASA
                        Levi, we’ve got about 20 seconds to 
                        figure this out. If he makes it to 
                        the woods on the far side of that 
                        meadow, we’ll never catch him...

           As frustration grows inside him, Levi stares into the 
           distance at J.D.’s tiny, disappearing silhouette...

                                 LEVI
                             (yelling)
                        Fuck! Fuck! (pause) I don’t want to 
                        shoot him!

                                 DRASA
                        I don’t want to fucking shoot him 
                        either! 

           Drasa pauses...

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        But we made him a promise! He knew 
                        what might be coming...

           There’s a beat of silence as Levi stares at Drasa.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        Levi, we gave him our word.

           After a few seconds, Levi NODS.

                                 LEVI
                        Yeah...you’re right.

           Levi steels himself, then turns and checks the RANGEFINDER on 
           the SPOTTING SCOPE...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        2700 meters...
           Levi pauses, considering. 

           He looks at Drasa.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Drasa, there’s only been two 
                        confirmed kills ever at that range. 
                        With my stabilizing arm the way it 
                        is, I...I can’t deliver that.

           Drasa pauses, then glances at her Russian TOCHNOST RIFLE 
           leaning on the rail beside her. 

           She looks out at the seemingly impossible distance between 
           her and her target...

                                 DRASA
                        Then I’m gonna need your help...

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - A SECOND LATER

           Using the rail for a rest, Drasa TAKES AIM THROUGH THE SCOPE 
           OF HER SNIPER RIFLE...

           Levi stands beside her staring though the spotting scope.

           DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: DRASA LOCATES J.D. NEAR 
           THE FAR SIDE OF THE MEADOW, HEADING FOR THE TREELINE...

                                 LEVI
                        Air temperature: 21 degree Celsius. 
                        Windspeed: 11 knots east to west. 
                        The air is thin due to the 
                        altitude. There’ll be considerably 
                        less drag on the bullet, so correct 
                        for a barometric pressure of 20.6 
                        Hg...

           Taking in the information, Drasa concentrates, controlling 
           her breathing as she peers through the rifle scope...

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Target is moving away from you at 
                        approximately 1.5 meters per 
                        second. Present range 2724 meters 
                        and fading...(pause) You want to 
                        shut my mouth, now?

                                 DRASA
                             (looking through scope)
                        No. Keep talking. I like your 
                        voice. It’s calming...
                                 LEVI
                        What do you want me to talk about?

                                 DRASA
                             (looking through scope)
                        Whatever....tell me the poem. The 
                        one you wrote about me...

           Levi pauses...

                                 LEVI
                        I...I only have first stanza...

                                 DRASA 
                             (looking through scope)
                        Then tell me the first stanza...

           SHIFT to DRASA’S P.O.V. THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Drasa corrects 
           her shot trajectory, moving the CROSSHAIRS off of J.D.’s 
           body...ADJUSTING TO WHERE SHE PREDICTS HE WILL BE ONCE THE 
           BULLET REACHES HIM...

           Levi begins to recite the poem...

                                 LEVI (O.S.)
                        There she is, 
                        far across the world,
                        the Girl with the chainsaw. 
                        You cannot see her, 
                        But I see her...

           EXT. DISTANT MEADOW/EDGE OF FOREST - A SECOND LATER

           Levi’s VOICE CONTINUES as...

           J.D.’s large body trembles as he moves. 

           His eyes are rabid and white as he stalks across the grassy 
           meadow, reaching the edge of the forest...

                                 LEVI (O.S.)
                        In some far off land there hangs an 
                        ancient tapestry
                        from which we were both cleaved, 
                        leaving behind 
                        two holes in time.
                        You cannot see her
                        But I see her,
                        The Girl with the chainsaw...

           As J.D. steps into the trees all ablaze in late autumn color, 
           A BULLET, MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND, EXITS OUT 
           THE CENTER OF HIS CHEST, KILLING HIM INSTANLY.
                                 LEVI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        ...She cuts through it.

           EXT. OBSERVATION PLATFORM - EAST TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           In the wake of J.D.’s death, Levi and Drasa sit in silence on 
           the floor of the observation platform. 

                                 LEVI
                        You know, the other night, I was 
                        telling you the truth. I wasn’t 
                        lying to you. I didn’t make that 
                        impossible shot in Yemen last year. 

           Drasa looks at him, taking a drag on her cigarette in the 
           cool autumn breeze.

           Levi meets her gaze.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Broken arm or not, I couldn’t have 
                        made the shot you just made. 

           There’s a silence between them, then...

                                 DRASA
                        I know you weren’t lying to me. 

           She pinches the cigarette out between her finger tips.

                                 DRASA (CONT'D)
                        I know exactly who made that shot 
                        in Yemen.

           Levi smiles to himself as he realizes...IT WAS DRASA.

                                 LEVI
                        We have a decision to make. 

           Drasa nods.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        There’s 29 days until our next 
                        radio check. We were down in the 
                        gorge less than 12 twelve hours. 
                        They don’t know shit right now. I 
                        could cross back over to my side, 
                        and we take up our separate posts 
                        and move forward like nothing ever 
                        happened...but we know full well 
                        what’s waiting for us when it’s all 
                        over...
           Levi pauses.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        Or...we can disable the cloakers, 
                        and maybe we get lucky and the 
                        world finds out about this place 
                        before they get them back online. 
                        But in doing that, they’ll know, 
                        that we know what’s in the gorge. 
                        And they’ll kill us by dawn...

           Drasa looks at Levi...

                                 DRASA
                        Or?

           EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER

           The late day sun sinks on the horizon, bathing the vast 
           autumn wilderness in a rich, etherial light...

                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        Or...we leave. Today. We pack our 
                        gear light and hike the fuck outta 
                        here with a 29 day head start. We 
                        become ghosts. And they’ll hunt us 
                        until the day we both die.

           There’s a pause.

                                 DRASA (V.0.)
                        If we leave...I don’t want to 
                        separate. I want to stay together.

           From HIGH ABOVE we look down, we see...

           LEVI AND DRASA HIKING ALONG THE NARROW, KNIFE-EDGE RIDGE OF A 
           VAST MOUNTAINSCAPE...INTO THE UNKNOWN.

                                 LEVI (V.O.)
                        Fuck, yes. We’re stayin’ together.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPERTITLE:

                                      33 DAYS LATER
           INT. WEST TOWER - 33 DAYS LATER - DAY

           CLOSE ON...an older MANS HAND’S open LEVI’S DAILY LOG BOOK, 
           slowly leafing through the pages, revealing hundreds of 
           ORIGINAL POEMS scrawled in blue ink...

           We SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL: Bartholemew, the older, white-
           haired man from the opening of our story, stares at the hand 
           written stanzas.

           A LEAD SPECIAL-OPS COMMANDO dressed in anonymous black 
           tactical gear stands guard in the background. 

           For an instant, we HOLD ON Bartholemew’s unusual eyes as he 
           scans the lines of Levi’s verse. 

           His detached expression is unreadable.

           Slowly, Bartholemew shuts Levi’s log book. 

           Without looking at him, Bartholomew speaks to the LEAD 
           COMMANDO standing in the background... 

                                 BARTHOLEMEW
                             (to the lead Commando)
                        Activate the kill teams.

                                 LEAD COMMANDO
                        Which ones, sir?

           Bartholemew pauses...

                                 BARTHOLEMEW
                        All of them.

           Bartholemew INSERTS LEVI’S LOG BOOK on the end of the long 
           bookshelf, TAKING ITS CHRONOLOGICAL PLACE AMONG THE LIBRARY 
           OF MANY DECADES OF TOWER SENTRY LOGS...

                                 BARTHOLEMEW (CONT'D)
                             (to the lead Commando)
                        I want their tower replacements 
                        enroute by sundown.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           FINI.
