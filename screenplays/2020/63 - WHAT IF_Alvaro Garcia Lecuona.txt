           EXTREME CLOSEUP of a computer screen.

           As we slowly ZOOM OUT, the indecipherable pixels gradually 
           form a pair of subtly made up eyes.

                        One of the reasons I like animals 
                        so much is that they’re named after 
                        what makes them unique.

           We’ve zoomed out enough to show a girl’s face. This is KELSA 
           BROWN (17). She’s pretty, casual, just bordering on 
           confident.

           Oh! And she’s trans.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Here are some of my favorite 
                        examples. And they’re gonna come 
                        out somewhere around here, I 
                        believe.

           She points at a part of the screen, where a photo of each 
           animal appears as she names them:

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        The goblin shark, Pink Fairy 
                        Armadillo, scaptia beyonceae, or 
                        the Beyoncé Fly, and the Blobfish. 
                        And usually, what makes them 
                        unique...

           We keep zooming out, past the frame of the video, onto its 
           Youtube page. The video’s title appears below: “SURVIVING

           INT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA

           Kelsa and her best friend CHRIS (17, F, black) make their way 
           down the cafeteria line, slopping food onto their trays.

                                 CHRIS
                        Ugh, I’m so hungry. All I ate last 
                        night was a box Mac n’ Cheese. You 
                        know, Kraft is pretty stingy with 
                        its portions.

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah, well, you gotta keep in mind 
                        it is a meal for children.
                                 CHRIS
                        It’s all Mike knows how to cook. I 
                        love that guy, but sometimes he can 
                        be so straight.

                                 KELSA
                        Well, that’s what we get for being, 
                        you know, straight?

                                 CHRIS
                        I know but it’s like,

           She does an impression of her extra straight boyfriend:

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t cook, I grill. Shut up! 
                        Experiment with gay porn already. 

           They grab their tray from the end of the line and start 
           walking between the tables.

                                 KELSA
                        He’s your boyfriend.

                                 CHRIS
                        Speaking of, we gotta find you a 
                        man.

                                 KELSA
                        You know what? I’m good.

           Out of nowhere, the contents of a FULL CUP OF CHOCOLATE MILK 
           are chucked at Kelsa. She screams.

           Kelsa and Chris turn to see the morbidly ashamed KHALID 
           “KHAL” ZUABI (17, Iranian), holding the now empty cup. Beside 
           him, OTIS (17) laughs obnoxiously. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What the hell is your problem?!

           Khal sinks in his seat.

                                 COACH TIM (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           INT. MR. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa sit in front of the desk while MR. WALLACE 
           (40) stares out the window. Khal turns to look at Kelsa, but 
           when she looks back, quickly averts his gaze.

           Mr. Wallace turns around.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Okay, Khal-ed.

                        Do you have anything to add?

                                 KHAL
                        No.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        You take full blame for the 
                        situation?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Good enough for me. You’re 
                        dismissed. With a warning!

                                 KHAL
                        Okay. How many warnings do I get?

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Before what?

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t know.

           Kelsa stealthily suppresses a laugh.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Go to class.

           Khal exits. Kelsa starts to get up.

                                 MR. WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, Kelsa.

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah?

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        You know I... we. We meaning the 
                        school, support you 100%, and even

           Kelsa winces. Mr. Wallace is painfully walking on eggshells:

                                 MR WALLACE
                        ... a transgender student at 
                        Mission Valley. But you know, we’re 
                        not always gonna be there to help 
                        you out. Eventually you’ll have to 
                        learn to fight your own battles.

           Kelsa fake smiles.

                                 KELSA
                        Can I go now?

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Yeah. Get out of here! Go to class.

           Kelsa picks up her bag.

                        those can be the worst. 

           Kelsa walks to the door--

           --opens it--

           --to find Khal eavesdropping on the other side.

           Khal steps back, desperately looks around, and pretends to be

           Kelsa looks at the poster--GET CHECKED FOR LICE.

           Khal goes beet red.

                        Oh, that’s nasty.
                                 OTIS
                        Paula Kremer, and...

           He looks around and spots Kelsa and Chris in the line.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Kelsa Brown.

           Kevin and Jason laugh. Khal looks over at Kelsa.

                                 KHAL
                        Marry Kelsa, kill Pau--

                                 OTIS
                        Wait. Marry Kelsa?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. We have Art together. She 
                        seems cool.

           Otis leans in close to him.

                                 OTIS
                        You know she has a dick, right?

           Chance and Kevin chuckle.

                                 KHAL
                        Well, you don’t really know--

                                 OTIS
                        Is there something you want to tell 
                        us, Khal?

                                 KHAL
                        No.

                                 OTIS
                        Are you... gay?

                                 CHANCE
                        Man, miss me with that gay shit.

                                 KHAL
                        No. I was just kidding.

                                 OTIS
                        Prove it.

           Khal looks to see Kelsa at the end of the line. Otis hands 
           him the CUP OF CHOCOLATE MILK.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Throw this at her.
           Khal grabs the cup. Kelsa and Chris turn around and start 
           walking their way.

           Khal laughs awkwardly, and starts to put the cup down.

                                 KHAL
                        Alright.

           Otis pushes it back into his hand.

                                 OTIS
                        I’m serious. Prove it.

                                 KHAL
                        No.

                                 KELSA (O.S.)
                        You know what? I’m good.

           Otis slaps the bottom of the cup, the milk goes flying and 
           spills onto Kelsa.

           Khal turns beet red, while Otis and the others laugh.

                                 CHRIS
                        What the hell is your problem?!

                                 COACH TIM (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           Khal leaves Mr. Wallace’s office, and leaves the door open.

           A SECRETARY calls after him.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Can you shut the door, please?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. Sorry.

           He starts closing the door and overhears the conversation 
           inside:

                                 MR. WALLACE (O.S.)
                        But you know, we’re not always 
                        gonna be there to help you out. 
                        Eventually you’ll have to learn to 
                        deal with the consequences of your 
                        identity.
                                 KELSA (O.S.)
                        Can I go now?

                                 MR. WALLACE (O.S.)
                        Yeah. Get out of here! Go to class.

           Khal quickly shuts the door. 

           A second later, Kelsa opens it--

           Which sets Khal’s flight-or-awkwardness response aflame and 
           he awkwardly pretends to be staring at the lice poster.

           He tries his best to commit as Kelsa walks away.

           INT. OTIS’S ROOM - DAY

           Khal and Otis barge into the messy room. Otis drops his 
           backpack on the floor.

                                 OTIS
                        Mr. Wallace is such a pussy. I 
                        could probably beat someone up and 
                        he’d just give me a stern warning.

           Otis sits on his desk. Khal sits on the bed, and fishes a 
           notebook out of his backpack. He leafs through it, opens it 
           up, and throws it on Otis’s desk.

                                 KHAL
                        Here.

           Otis opens up another notebook and starts copying his notes. 

           Khal looks empathetically at Otis’s hand, which makes an 
           awkward clutch on the pen while he writes almost illegibly. 
           He has dysgraphia.

                                 OTIS
                        Does the SAT still have an essay 
                        section? If it does, I’m screwed.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t think it does anymore.

                                 OTIS
                        Screw this, I’ll just photocopy 
                        them later.

                                 KHAL
                        Just do it now, dude, you’re never 
                        gonna read them.
                                 OTIS
                        Yes I will. Wanna play 
                        Battlegrounds?

           Khal smiles.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Dibs on the good controller.

           He takes off running.

                                 KHAL
                        No, fuck you!

           He takes off after him, laughing.

           INT. KELSA’S HOUSE

           Kelsa kicks off her shoes and walks into the house.

                                 KELSA
                        Mom! I’m home.

           She gets to the kitchen. There is a perky lady sitting on the 
           kitchen table, which is filled end to end with thick books.

                                 LADY
                        Hi.

                                 KELSA
                        Hi.

           Kelsa walks up the stairs.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Mom?

           SARAH (45) steps out of her room, a basketful of laundry in 
           one hand, her phone on the other, into which she expertly 
           types a one-handed email.

                                 SARAH
                        Hi, honey.

           She looks at her.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Did you wear a bra today?

                                 KELSA
                        Mom! Law of averages!
                                 SARAH
                        It passes the law! The average mom 
                        would be concerned that her average 
                        daughter’s properly covering her...

           She gestures at her chest.

                                 KELSA
                        Mom, why is there a lady in our 
                        kitchen?

                                 SARAH
                        That’s your college advisor. 

                                 KELSA
                        Mom!

                                 SARAH
                        You should go downstairs. She 
                        charges by the hour.

                                 KELSA
                        I said I didn’t want an advisor!

           Sarah ignores her and walks downstairs.

           INT. KELSA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Kelsa sits across from the lady, RACHEL (35). Thick College 
           Handbooks and SAT guides between them.

                                 RACHEL
                        So have you given any thought about 
                        what you want to write your college 
                        essay on?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah. I guess a little.

                                 RACHEL
                        My only advice? Don’t write about 
                        who your hero is. It’s a little 
                        cliché.

           She over-pronounces that last word. Rachel opens one of the 
           books.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        In my opinion, you should do this 
                        one.

           She flips through the pages and finally sticks her finger in 
           one of them.
                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Okay, here it is. Two. Recount a 
                        time when you faced a challenge, 
                        setback, or failure, and responded 
                        with bravery. How did it affect 
                        you, and what did you learn from 
                        the experience? 

                                 KELSA
                        I was actually thinking--

                                 RACHEL
                        See, bravery. You have it easy. You 
                        can write about your transition! 
                        The disenfranchised, the LGBT, 
                        admissions boards eat that shit up. 
                        Pardon my franche.

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t know if I--

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh! And what happened with your 
                        parents!

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t know if that really 
                        reflects anything about me.

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course it does. You went through 
                        all that at an early age. You know 
                        what that shows? Bravery.

           Kelsa winces.

                                 KELSA
                        Actually, I was thinking I wanna 
                        write about how I rescued Chairman 
                        Meow. 

           She looks at the corner. A shaggy, paranoid looking cat 
           anxiously looks up from his food bowl.

           Rachel takes a deep breath.

                                 RACHEL
                        How do I put this?... Nobody cares 
                        about Chairman Meow.

           Chairman Meow (you guessed it) meows.
           INT. ART CLASSROOM - DAY

           All the tables have been pushed to the edges to make room for 
           stools and easels in the center. Khal sits at one of the 
           tables while MR. KIDD gives a powerpoint presentation.

                                 MR. KIDD
                        Today, we’re gonna paint portraits. 
                        A portrait is a painting who’s main 
                        purpose is to represent the 
                        likeness, personality and even mood 
                        of a person. There are many notable 
                        examples of portraiture...

           He quickly skips through the majority of the presentation 
           showing notable portraits by ancient greeks, da Vinci, Rubens 
           and Warhol, to get to--

                                 MR. KIDD (CONT’D)
                        ...but the most masterful portrait 
                        artist of our time is in fact...

           --a picture of the “Queen as Ziggy Stardust” graffiti by 
           Banksy.

                                 MR. KIDD (CONT’D)
                        Banksy!

           The students groan. Clearly Mr. Kidd has a thing for the 
           infamous street artist.

                                 MR. KIDD (CONT’D)
                        Banksy mixes traditional 
                        portraiture with shocking and 
                        boldly out of place elements to 
                        provide a gritty commentary on our 
                        turbulent time.

           He skips forward to Banksy’s “Girl With the Pierced Eardrum.”

                                 MR. KIDD (CONT’D)
                        This is another Banksy original.

                                 KHAL
                             (to himself)
                        That’s just a ripoff of Vermeer.

                                 MR. KIDD
                        Okay, now everyone has a slit of 
                        paper on their desk with an artist. 
                        You will have a partner with the 
                        same artist, and you will draw a 
                        portrait of each other in the 
                        artist’s style.
           Khal turns over his slit of paper. He smiles when he reads: 
           “Johannes Vermeer”.

                                 STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Does anyone wanna change? I got 
                        Banksy.

           Khal stands up and looks around. Everyone is getting paired 
           up except...

           Kelsa. She stands around awkwardly, movement all around her.

           Khal walks up to her.

           They fake-smile at each other. Eventually--

                                 KHAL
                        Vermeer?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah. You wanna sit here?

           She gestures at a couple of set ups.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

           INT. ART CLASSROOM - LATER

           Khal and Kelsa sit across from each other, working on their 
           portraits in anxious silence. 

           Khal looks at Kelsa. When she looks back, he turns back 
           towards his painting.

                                 KELSA
                        Hey.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah?

                                 KELSA
                        Your name’s Cal, right?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, but not like Calendar. More 
                        like Khal Drogo.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay, Khal, can I borrow some of 
                        that millennial pink?

           She gestures at his palette.
                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. But that’s not millennial 
                        pink. That’s flamingo pink.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay, that one, then.

           She gestures at another shade.

                                 KHAL
                        No, that’s ballet slipper pink.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay, that one.

                                 KHAL
                        That’s just pink.

                                 KELSA
                        I didn’t know you were a color 
                        purist.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t like to simplify things. It 
                        makes everything boring.

           Kelsa smiles. Mr. Kidd walks over.

                                 MR. KIDD
                        Ah, Vermeer. Reminds me of a quote, 
                        “If graffiti changed anything, it 
                        would be illegal”. Put some more 
                        cleft on the chin.

           He walks away.

                                 KELSA
                        What’s going on with my chin?

                                 KHAL
                        I’m kind of struggling, you have 
                        kind of a--

                                 KELSA
                        A butt chin?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 KELSA
                        Just make sure to get a turd 
                        squeezing out of it.
                                 KHAL
                        Well, see, that would be too 
                        accurate. I like to commit to 
                        abstract art.

           He puts his paintbrush up to the painting. Hesitates. Looks 
           at Kelsa.

                                 KELSA
                        If you’re worried about offending 
                        me, lots of girls have butt chins.

                                 KHAL
                        Really?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah. Adele. Sandra Bullock.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay, done.

           Kelsa walks over to see the painting: a pretty solid Vermeer-
           style portrait of her.

                                 KELSA
                        No way. That’s so good.

                                 KHAL
                        You can have it.

                                 KELSA
                        Really?

           Khal second guesses his forwardness, but stands his ground:

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. Let’s see yours.

           They walk over.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, it’s good.

           On the painting: Kelsa took some creative liberties with it.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Why do I have a big gauge earring?

                                 KELSA
                        I didn’t get the shape of your ear 
                        right.

           Khal laughs.
                                 KHAL
                        It’ll look great in my living room.

                                 KELSA
                        You want it?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. Unless you do.

                                 KELSA
                        No, it’s all yours. It’ll be worth 
                        millions one day.

           Khal sits back down.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, I’m sorry about lunch 
                        yesterday.

                                 KELSA
                        Why are you taking the blame? I 
                        know you didn’t do it.

                                 KHAL
                        How do you know?

                                 KELSA
                        Last class, Robby Suarez made a 
                        ceramic soccer ball and put it in 
                        the kiln. 

           INT. ART CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK

           Khal grabs a mediocre soccer ball sculpture out of the kiln 
           and makes a puncture with a steel tool. 

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        After he left, you grabbed it and 
                        poked a hole in it so it wouldn’t 
                        explode with the heat.

           He looks around and puts it back in.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

                                 KHAL
                        How do you know I wasn’t protecting 
                        my Egyptian faience pot from the 
                        detritus?
                                 KELSA
                        Because you were already glazing 
                        it. Robby was the only one still 
                        sculpting.

                                 KHAL
                        Robby’s my friend.

                                 KELSA
                        No he’s not. You’re perpetually 
                        nice and that’s how I know you 
                        didn’t do it. You were covering for 
                        that boy Otis.

           Khal is quiet, then makes an ugly face. Kelsa laughs.

           INT. KHAL’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal’s family sits around the table eating Tabbouleh: his 
           dad, SASAN, mom, SELDA, and little brother, ARWIN.

                                 SELDA
                        Khalid, have you started on your 
                        college essay?

                                 KHAL
                        It’s not due for like 5 months.

                                 SELDA
                        Yes, but if you do it the day 
                        before you’re gonna end up in one 
                        of the trash schools like, I don’t 
                        know, Georgetown.

                                 KHAL
                        Georgetown’s actually a really good 
                        school, mom. I’m never getting into 
                        Georgetown.

                                 SELDA
                        Just start it today.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t even have anything to write 
                        about. Nothing interesting’s ever 
                        happened to me.

                                 SELDA
                        Write about when we went to Syria.
                                 KHAL
                        I mean, we didn’t do much other 
                        than watch grandma slowly 
                        decompose.

           Sasan laughs.

                                 SELDA
                        Khalid!

                                 KHAL
                        Sorry.

                                 SASAN
                        Write about fencing.

                                 KHAL
                        Dad, I only took one class.

                                 SASAN
                        You beat the teacher.

                                 KHAL
                        It was a drill, I was supposed to 
                        touch him with the sword.

                                 SASAN
                        How about when you saved someone 
                        from drowning?

                                 KHAL
                        That was Arwin.

           He points at his little brother, who smirks proudly.

                                 ARWIN
                        They put a framed picture of me at 
                        the police station.

           INT. KHAL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal flops on his bed and opens his computer. He opens Word.

                                 SELDA (O.S.)
                        Work on your essay!

                                 KHAL
                        No!

           Khal writes at the top of the document: “COLLEGE ESSAY”

           He taps on his computer, thinking.
           He looks around. His gaze lands on KELSA’S PAINTING leaning 
           against the wall.

           He goes to the web browser, and clicks on the search bar. He 
           types: “transgender”.

           Khal scrolls through the wikipedia article. He clicks the 
           search bar again, and types: “Kelsa Brown”. The only thing 
           that comes up are images for brown boots.

           Khal takes his hands of the keyboard, cracks his knuckles, 
           and goes to the search bar again: “Trans teenager kelsa in 
           Pittsburgh river valley high”.

           The thumbnail for a Youtube video comes up. He clicks on it.

           It’s Kelsa’s Youtube channel, a video called “2 MONTHS ON 
           HORMONE BLOCKERS”.

           On the screen:

                                 KELSA
                        I really haven’t felt any changes 
                        in my mood or personality, like I’m 
                        not any more emotional or calmer, 
                        because I’ve just had two 
                        injections. I’m thinking of 
                        switching to the Spironolactone 
                        pills, which my doctor says are 
                        less smooth sailing but then again, 
                        needles...

           She makes a disgusted shriek, amplified by a rough replay 
           edit.

           Meanwhile, Khal scrolls through the related videos on the 
           side. He clicks on one of Kelsa’s videos named “DATING WHILE 
           TRANS”

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been thinking a lot about 
                        dating, wether I want to date 
                        because like, what if I don’t want 
                        to disclose that I’m 
                             (distorted)
                        trans? 

           The oh so scary word is followed by SCREAMING and GLASS 
           BREAKING sound effects. Khal laughs.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Like that’s a--

           The computer screen MORPHS into a--
           CLOSE ON KELSA

                        --not really a personal thing but 
                        not something that I would 
                        naturally bring up. And girls get 
                        murdered just because of that. I 
                        don’t know, I’m not really dying to 
                        date anyone either. 

           INT. CHRIS’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Movie night! Kelsa sits on the floor, Chris and her boyfriend 
           MIKE LIEBOWITZ on the couch. 

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        My friend Chris is in a 
                        relationship and I gotta be 
                        honest...

           Kelsa tries to concentrate on the movie but--

                                 MIKE
                        Here it comes.

           He holds up a hand full of popcorn to Chris’s mouth. Chris 
           pecks the popcorn out of it.

                                 CHRIS
                             (baby voice)
                        Mmm, thank you. I’m like your baby 
                        bird.

                                 MIKE
                        And I’m your mama bird?

                                 CHRIS
                        Mhm.

           He pops a handfull of popcorn in his mouth, then starts 
           spitting them into Chris’s mouth.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Mmmm.

           Kelsa makes a grossed out face.

                        ...it doesn’t seem too appealing.

                        Then again, I always wanted to be 
                        that quirky, like not psycho but a 
                        little bit psycho--

                        adventures, obviously set to the 
                        tune of inspiring indie pop songs.

           A CHEESY INDIE POP SONG plays.

                        But, I don’t see myself dating any 
                        time soon... Well, I’m not 
                        completely alone. At least I have 
                        my girlfriends.

           INT. EM’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The video’s indie pop song BECOMES THE SOUNDTRACK as we 
           FOLLOW THE POV OF A BOTTLE spinning around the inside of a 
           circle of four girls: Kelsa, Chris, the annoyingly pretty EM 
           (17) and MEGAN (17).

           The bottle stops, pointing at Chris.

                                 KELSA
                        Truth or dare?

                                 MEGAN
                        Dare.

                                 KELSA
                        Kiss Em.

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh. Okay.

           Megan shrugs. They kiss quickly.

                                 CHRIS
                        This is middle school stuff, 
                        ladies. Let’s step it up.

           She spins the bottle. It lands on Em.

                                 MEGAN
                        Truth or dare?
                                 CHRIS
                        If it’s dare, please don’t kiss 
                        Kelsa. Leave the risqué girl on 
                        girl action action in 2004.

                                 EM
                        Well, would it really be...

           Kelsa stiffens up. Chris glares at Em.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        You know what? Fine. Truth.

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay... help me out, girls.

                                 MEGAN
                        Who’s your crush?

           Em makes a face. “Not that one.”

                                 CHRIS
                        Seriously?

                                 EM
                        Dare.

                                 KELSA
                        No, you can’t switch it.

                                 EM
                        Okay...

           Suddenly her demeanor changes. She looks at the girls like 
           she’s about to change their lives.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        Khal Zuabi.

           Kelsa looks at her, upset, but trying not to show it.

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay, moving on.

                                 KELSA
                        Khal, really?

                                 EM
                        I know, but he’s so sweet. I feel 
                        like I could help him break out of 
                        his shell through a series of 
                        adventures, have like indie pop 
                        music play in the background or 
                        something.
                                 MEGAN
                        You should ask him out.

                                 EM
                        Really?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah. Why not?

           On Kelsa, looking hurt.

                                 CHRIS
                        Alright, let’s get to the kinks 
                        already.

           She spins the bottle.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           CLOSE ON a piece of paper. With a colored gel pen, Em writes 
           in girly letters: “YOU’RE CUTE”. Kelsa, Chris and Megan watch 
           her.

                                 EM
                        Okay, operation Khal Me Maybe is a 
                        go.

           She tries to hand Kelsa the note.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        Give it to him.

                                 KELSA
                        Why me?

                                 EM
                        You’re friends with him, right?

                                 KELSA
                        We just have art class together.

                                 EM
                        Then give him the note.

                                 KELSA
                        You give it to him.

           Em shoots her a final, controlling look. Kelsa sighs and 
           snatches the note from her hand.
           INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

           Khal sits with Otis and the boys.

                                 OTIS
                        So this one guy was like, come 
                        upstairs I’m in bed with your 
                        mom...

           Khal notices Kelsa walking towards him.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        ...so I blasted him so hard--

           Otis goes quiet as Kelsa passes Khal the note, and walks 
           away.

           Khal opens the note and goes red.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        What’s it say?

                                 KHAL
                        Nothing.

           Otis snatches the card from his hands. He makes a disgusted 
           face.

                                 OTIS
                        Ugh. Is it from Kelsa?

           Just then, Em passes next to them.

                                 EM
                             (coyly)
                        Hi, Khal.

                                 OTIS
                        Are you hitting that?

           Otis gets embarrassed. Otis teases him.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        You hitting that?

                                 KHAL
                        No!

                                 OTIS
                        Nice, dude.

           He holds out his fist. Confused, Khal softly completes the 
           fist bump.
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa are working on a mural covering a group of 
           lockers.

                                 KELSA
                        So are you gonna go to art school?

                        good.

           She gestures at his part of the mural.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t know, I don’t think I’m 
                        interesting enough to be an actual

                        Oh.

                                 KELSA
                        Artists are douchebags. You’re 
                        nice.

                                 KHAL
                        I hate when people call me nice.

                                 KELSA
                        I know. 

           Khal notices she was teasing him, smiles.

                        You know what I hate?

                        What?

                        When people say I’m brave.

                                 KHAL
                        Really?

                        “You’re transitioning so young. Do

                                 KHAL
                        I mean, it’s not really brave if 
                        it’s just being who you are.

                                 KELSA
                        Exactly! And it’s so self-
                        congratulatory.

                                 KHAL
                        We need more earth tones.

           They sit down on the newspaper-covered ground and start

                        What?

                                 KHAL
                        What do you wanna study?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah. I wanna be a nature

           Khal drops his paintbrush in excitement.

                        No way! Like Planet Earth.

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah.

           Khal masterfully imitates David Attenborough:

                                 KHAL
                        Antarctica.

           Khal gestures at a boy and a girl painting across the hall 
           from them. The boy is flirting, trying to guide the girl’s 
           hand, but the girl seems like she’s not interested.

                             (Attenborough voice)

           The girl takes out her phone.

                        With a ruthlessness only found in 
                        nature, the female pretends to 
                        text, ignoring the male’s sexual 
                        advances. 

           CLOSE ON the girl’s phone: She is writing in the Notes app: 
           “PRETENDING 2 TEXT SO I DON’T HAVE TO TALK 2 U LOL”

           Kelsa is laughing.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Why do you like animals so much?

                                 KELSA
                        Because they’re named after what 
                        makes them unique.

                                 KHAL
                        Hm...

           As Kelsa says each animal’s name, STOCK FOOTAGE appears of 
           the animal in the wild:

           In the process, her hand brushes up ever so slightly against 
           Khal’s arm.

                        last.

           He continues writing.

           Otis snatches Khal’s notebook and holds it out of reach.

                                 KHAL
                             (whispering)
                        Dude!

                                 OTIS
                        Who are they for?

           Mr. Kuznetsov stops writing and pricks his ear up.

                                 KHAL
                        Em! They’re for Em.

           Otis smirks and hands him back his notebook. Khal turns 
           around to see Megan in the next table, listening in. He goes 
           white.

           Megan lights up at this game-changing piece of gossip. She 
           picks up her phone and opens the texting app. She opens a 
           group chat and starts texting...
           INT. PHILOSOPHY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kelsa reads from a course reader. On the desk beside her, her 
           phone lights up with activity. 

                                 KELSA
                        Men would say of him that up he 
                        went and down he came without his 
                        eyes; and that it was better not 
                        even to think of ascending; and if 
                        any one tried to loose another and 
                        lead him up to the light, let
                        them only catch the offender, and 
                        they would put him to death. 

           Another student reads the next part of the reader, slowly and 
           struggling with the words. Kelsa looks at her phone, picks it 
           up.

                                 STUDENT 2 (O.S.)
                        I--I agree, he said, as far as I am 
                        a--able to un--der--stand you. 

            A look of sadness weighs Kelsa’s face down.

                                 PHILOSOPHY TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Socrates.

           Kelsa keeps looking at her phone.

                                 PHILOSOPHY TEACHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Socrates!

           Kelsa snaps back to reality, puts her phone down, and reads 
           shakily.

                                 KELSA
                        This entire allegory, I said, you 
                        may now append, dear Glaucon...

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Khal transfers books from his backpack to his locker. He 
           shuts the locker door, and Em appears behind it.

                                 EM
                        Hi.

                                 KHAL
                        Um... hi Em, how’s it hanging?
                                 EM
                        Actually, I’ve been feeling kind of 
                        SAD. You know, S.A.D. Seasonal 
                        Affective Disorder.

                                 KHAL
                        Really? It’s only October. And it’s 
                        pretty warm out.

                                 EM
                        I don’t know, I could use a little 
                        whiff of spring.

           She smiles.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        See ya.

           She strolls away confidently. Khal laughs nervously.

           Otis walks up to him and slaps him on the shoulder.

                                 OTIS
                        Hey, you coming to lunch?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, I’ll see you there.

           He takes off in the opposite direction.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Khal bursts into a stall, locks the door, puts the toilet 
           seat down, and sits.

           He takes out his phone and makes a Facetime call to Arwin.

           Arwin answers. He’s in a classroom, in the middle of a 
           lecture.

                                 ARWIN
                        Go for Arwin.

                                 KHAL
                        I can call you later.

                                 ARWIN
                        Nah, it’s chill.

                                 KHAL
                        I messed it up big time.
                                 ARWIN
                        She didn’t like the flowers?

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t know, word got around that 
                        they’re for Em Strayer, one of her 
                        best friends.

                                 ARWIN
                        So?

                                 KHAL
                        So, both of them probably know by 
                        now, and if I give Kelsa the 
                        flowers, all girly hell’s gonna 
                        break loose. 

           He sighs. Resigned:

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I should just give them to 
                        Em.

                                 ARWIN
                        Jeez. Can you believe this guy?

           He talks to some O.S. MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS sitting around him.

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 1 (O.S.)
                        I know.

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 2 (O.S.)
                        Yeah. What a loser.

                                 ARWIN
                        This is classic Khalid. You’re so 
                        desperate to please everyone that 
                        you forget to look out for number 
                        one.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t want to hurt anyone.

                                 ARWIN
                        Uh, news flash, dude. In this life, 
                        you’re gonna hurt people. And if 
                        you try to please everyone, you’ll 
                        end up hurting the ones that matter 
                        most. Do you like Em?

                                 KHAL
                        No.
                                 ARWIN
                        Do you like Kelsa?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 ARWIN
                        Then don’t be a perpetually passive 
                        pussy and give her the flowers!

           The middle school girls peek into the frame.

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 1
                        Yeah, Khalid.

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 2
                        Don’t be a pussy, Khalid.

           We hear the voice of a male MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER:

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Hey! Arwin, give me your phone.

           Arwin looks up at the teacher.

                                 ARWIN
                        I’m using my calculator.

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER (O.S.)
                        This is Language Arts.

                                 ARWIN
                        Why is your generation so resistant 
                        to technology?

                                 MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER (O.S.)
                        I’m 25, Arwin.

           Khal hangs up the call. He looks forward, deep in thought, 
           and finally frowns and puts on a look of newfound resolution.

                                 KHAL
                        I’m gonna put myself first.

            We hear a loud PLOP from the next stall over.

                                 STUDENT IN THE BATHROOM (O.S.)
                        Argh, the splashback!

           Khal grimaces.
           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Kelsa, Em, Chris and Megan sit at their usual table.

                                 EM
                        I think dinner and a movie is 
                        always a good bet.

           Between them, in the background, we see Khal entering the 
           cafeteria, holding the flowers. He looks around, spots them, 
           and starts walking towards them.

                                 MEGAN
                        You should go to Mike Liebowitz’s 
                        party.

                                 EM
                        Yeah. We can hang out for like, an 
                        hour before, that way, if we run 
                        out of things to talk about we have 
                        a time limit.

                                 MEGAN
                        And if you don’t, you can go 
                        together.

                                 EM
                        Exactly. You gotta plan ahe--

           Khal reaches the table. He looks only at Kelsa.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, Kelsa. I got these for you.

           Kelsa did not see this coming at all. Em looks like she’s 
           going into anaphylactic shock.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh!

           Khal walks away, FOLLOWING THE CAMERA, a collage of fear, 
           embarrassment and adrenaline on his face. In the background 
           Em angrily takes off from the table. Megan runs after her.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           On Khal, staring stiffly ahead, traumatized by his own bold 
           move.

                                 ENGLISH TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Can anyone tell me the difference 
                        between specially and 
                        especially?... Kal-eed?
           Khal is somewhere else entirely.

                                 ENGLISH TEACHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Kal-eed!

           He jumps in fright.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh!

           The class laughs.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           At his locker, Khal stuffs some books into his backpack. He 
           overhears some girl STUDENTS gossiping.

                                 STUDENT 1
                        Someone’s crying in the girl’s 
                        bathroom.

                                 STUDENT 2
                        Oh my god, who?

                                 STUDENT 1
                        Em Strayer.

           Khal notices Kelsa walking his way.

           Kelsa looks up and sees him. She immediately does a 180 and 
           starts walking the other way.

           Khal closes his locker. He notices Otis approaching. He 
           rushes to put a jacket on, but can’t find one of the 
           armholes. He spins around desperately.

                                 OTIS
                        Dude, you gave the flowers to 
                        Kelsa? You know she’s a boy, right?

                                 KHAL
                        Yes. I mean, no. 

           He finally sticks his arm in.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know, okay? 

           He picks up his backpack.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        I have to go.
           He walks away, leaving a confused Otis behind.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

           Khal sits in the window seat, looking at his phone. It’s a 
           conversation with Kelsa, ending in an unrequited “HEY” sent 
           by Khal. He swipes on the message, showing the send time of 
           8:05PM. The time on the phone is 7:15AM.

           The driver makes an announcement.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Listen up! One of the buses broke 
                        down so we’re taking in some more 
                        goblin--I mean, children. Please 
                        make room.

           The bus stops, and a line of high schoolers pours in. Among 
           them is Kelsa. She makes eye contact with Khal, then keeps 
           walking and sits in the back of the bus.

           Khal looks back stealthily. He takes a deep breath. Fuck it. 
           He stands up, walks to the back of the bus, and sits next to 
           Kelsa.

                                 KHAL
                        Hi.

                                 KELSA
                        Hi.

           A beat.

                                 KHAL
                        So, did you like the flowers?

                                 KELSA
                        No, I didn’t like the flowers. What 
                        the hell, Khal?

                                 KHAL
                        What? I like you.

                                 KELSA
                        Em likes you. You really did that 
                        in front of her? If you’re trying 
                        to prove you’re not a nice person, 
                        congratulations. It’s working.

                                 KHAL
                        I wanted to do it for you.
                                 KELSA
                        It didn’t occur to you that I 
                        didn’t want to be made a scene of 
                        in front of my friends? In front of 
                        the whole school?

                                 KHAL
                        Sorry. I thought you’d like them. 
                        They’re wildflowers.

                                 KELSA
                        I didn’t.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay. If you don’t like me, just 
                        tell me right now, okay? I still 
                        want to be your friend. If you 
                        don’t want to be friends, I’ll 
                        leave you alone forever, I guess.

                                 KELSA
                        I like you. 

           Khal’s eyes light up.

                                 KHAL
                        You do?

                                 KELSA
                        But you’ve really made a mess of 
                        things.

           Khal thinks.

                                 KHAL
                        Then let’s just walk in there. 
                        Together. It’s too late anyway, 
                        you’re gonna lose a friend, I’m for 
                        sure gonna lose my friends. But 
                        what do you wanna remember from 
                        High School when we’re old? We 
                        could live our own life, right now, 
                        or do what people expect of us and 
                        spend the rest of our life 
                        wondering, what if?

           Kelsa locks eyes with him. She cracks a smile. Khal mirrors 
           it.

           EXT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa stand outside the door to the school. Kelsa 
           wraps her hand in his.
                                 KELSA
                             (Attenborough voice)
                        In a daring move, the human mates 
                        publicly display their affection.

                                 KHAL
                             (Attenborough voice)
                        Will their colony accept them?

                                 KELSA
                             (Attenborough voice)
                        Or will there be carnage?

           Khal opens the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Hand in hand, Khal and Kelsa walk through the hallway. The 
           students on either side of them turn to look, point, and talk 
           among themselves.

           They pass Em. She and Kelsa share a quick glance. She looks 
           devastated.

           Khal avoids looking at Otis, who can’t really grasp the 
           situation.

                                 KELSA
                        This is me.

           They stop outside a classroom. Their hands separate.

                                 KHAL
                        Bye.

           They lean into each other, then jerk away. Khal ends up 
           giving Kelsa an awkward kiss on the cheek.

           Kelsa goes into the classroom and Khal keeps walking, every 
           set of eyes in the student body on him.

           He reaches his classroom, but Otis blocks his way.

                                 OTIS
                        Dude, what’s happening?

           Khal shrugs.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Are you gay?

                                 KHAL
                        No.
                                 OTIS
                        You can tell me if you’re gay.

                                 KHAL
                        I would.

                                 OTIS
                        Sorry, I’d accept you, but I can’t 
                        if you’re in denial.

                                 KHAL
                        Whatever, Otis.

                                 OTIS
                        What?

           Khal forcefully pushes past him.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Khal reaches the end of the lunch line and turns around. He 
           starts walking aimlessly, unsure of what to do.

           He spots Kelsa and Chris, not at their usual table. Kelsa 
           smiles at him. He sits.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey.

                                 CHRIS
                        Hello.

           They start eating in silence.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        So you’ve officially dropped a bomb 
                        on the school.

           Khal looks around.

                                 KHAL
                        Don’t say that so loud.

           Silence again.

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m gonna go get more cookies.

           She stands up and walks away.

                                 KELSA
                        So, how’s it going?
                                 KHAL
                        It’s going.

           A beat.

                       KHAL (CONT'D)
           So I was thinking--
                                                          KELSA
                                              Maybe we should--

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, what?

                                 KELSA
                        No, what were you saying?

                                 KHAL
                        No, you go.

                                 KELSA
                        No, it’s okay.

                                 KHAL
                        No, really.

                                 KELSA
                        Go ahead, seriously.

                                 KHAL
                        I want you to go first.

                                 KELSA
                        Maybe we should go on a date.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah! That’s what I was gonna say. 
                        I was thinking we should go on a 
                        date.

                                 KELSA
                        It’s already official, but we’re 
                        not even dating.

                                 KHAL
                        I know.

           A beat.

                                 KELSA
                        So yeah.

           They laugh.
           EXT. PITTSBURGH NATIONAL AVIARY - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa walk across a lawn to the huge glass building, 
           still carrying their school backpacks.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - CONDOR COURT - DAY

           An enormous condor spreads its wings menacingly. Outside of 
           the cage, Kelsa and Khal look delighted.

                                 KELSA
                        You know, there’s more to me than 
                        liking animals.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. That’s why I asked you on a 
                        calculated date, so I can learn 
                        more about you, and take you on 
                        more calculated dates.

                                 KELSA
                        Or you could just relax.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - PENGUIN POINT - DAY

           An African Penguin waddles across a rock. Beside it, on the 
           inside of a glass dome, Kelsa peeks her head out.

           In the crawl space below the penguin tank, Kelsa sits down 
           next to Khal. Light from the peeking dome softly washes over 
           them.

                                 KHAL
                        So how are things with Em?

                                 KELSA
                        Not good.

           Khal grimaces in embarrassment.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        She was kinda transphobic anyways.

                                 KHAL
                        Really?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah, she kind of treated me like a 
                        mental patient.
                             (imitating Em)
                        Like he said, I’m sorry, like SHE 
                        said.
                                 (MORE)
                                 KELSA (CONT'D)
                             (back to normal)
                        I know that doesn’t sound so bad, 
                        but I know she misgenders me when 
                        I’m not around.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, totally.

           A couple of children run across the crawl space.

                                 KELSA
                        How are things with Otis?

                                 KHAL
                        Not good.

                                 KELSA
                        Damn.

                                 KHAL
                        Maybe it’s for the best too. We 
                        were always “Khal and Oates”. 
                        That’s not even my name, you know?

                                 KELSA
                        Really? What’s your full name?

                                 KHAL
                        Khalid.

                                 KELSA
                        Why did you shorten it?

                                 KHAL
                        Because people can’t pronounce the 
                        Kh. They pronounce it like DJ 
                        Khaled. Eventually you get sick of 
                        the “another one”s and 
                        “congratulations you played 
                        yourself”.

                                 KELSA
                        Sounds like a hard life.

                                 KHAL
                        It is! Meanwhile my brother Arwin 
                        gets the anglo name.

                                 KELSA
                        That’s like, a serial killer name.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised.
                                 KELSA
                        Well, I’m gonna call you Khalid. 
                        Did I say that right?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 KELSA
                        Names are what make us unique, 
                        remember?

                                 KHAL
                        I thought only animals.

                                 KELSA
                        No, people too.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - TROPICAL RAINFOREST OPEN EXHIBIT - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa slowly walk throw a densely foliaged room, 
           small birds waddling around on the floor around them.

                                 KHAL
                        I know what your name means, by the 
                        way.

                                 KELSA
                        Ugh. How?

                                 KHAL
                        There’s this cool new website where 
                        you can look up the answer to any 
                        question. It’s called... Goggle?

                                 KELSA
                        I gotta check that out.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 KELSA
                        Did you find anything else?

           Khal hesitates.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. Your videos. Did you not want 
                        them to be seen?

                                 KELSA
                        I kind of do. I publish them for a 
                        reason, it makes me feel like I 
                        don’t have to hide who I am.

                        And like, if one person looks at my 
                        channel and comes to understand 
                        themselves better, that would make 
                        me happy.

                                 KHAL
                        Why aren’t you like that in school?

                                 KELSA
                             (defensive)
                        It’s different. I don’t want to be 
                        known for being trans, I have other 
                        things to offer, you know? I don’t 
                        have to be some activist.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, it’s fine. You’re amazing just 
                        like you are.

           Kelsa blushes.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - TROPICAL RAINFOREST HALL - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa stop in front of the Rhinoceros Hornbill 
           exhibit.

                                 KELSA
                        It’s crazy how evolution works. We 
                        think we’re genetically superior 
                        to, like, sea cucumbers but we’re 
                        not. We just evolved to 
                        successfully procreate in different 
                        environments.

                                 KHAL
                        Well, humans are superior. Because 
                        we’re genetically modified by 
                        reptilian aliens.

                                 KELSA
                        Oh my god, I love conspiracy

                                 KHAL
                        Me too!

           They keep walking.

                                 KELSA
                        Did you know the government made 
                        selfies popular to build a facial 
                        recognition software?
                                 KHAL
                        Oh yeah. Once I was convinced my 
                        parents were spies from the New 
                        World Order. So I put glass in

                        If they were lizards, they would 
                        have eaten it no problem.

                                 KELSA
                        Sounds like a lose-lose.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 KELSA
                        Chapstick has little shards of 
                        glass in it so you keep buying it.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, you’re preaching to the choir. 
                        Wanna do the bird feeding thing?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - BIRD FEEDING EXHIBIT - DAY

           A sweet looking lady ORNITHOLOGIST hands a little tub of 
           nectar to Khal.

                                 ORNITHOLOGIST
                        Now, just hold it up.

           Khal slowly holds up the nectar. All at once, three birds fly 
           into his hand and start pecking it.

                                 KHAL
                        Aaaaah!

           He drops the tub, and the birds fly away.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The ornithologist hands Khal another tub. Khal looks 
           terrified.

                                 KELSA
                        Here.
           She faces him and holds his hand, slowly raising his arm with 
           him. The birds fly and land on Khal’s hand. He winces, but 
           then looks up and laughs.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, my god!

           He looks at Kelsa, only inches from his face.

           WIDE SHOT: Khal and Kelsa are alone in the room. The 
           Ornithologist is busy filling up the tubs. It’s the perfect 
           opportunity for a kiss...

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, look, its empty already. 

           He lowers the tub and he and Kelsa separate.

           INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

           Khal and Kelsa sit together on the bus.

           Kelsa puts her head on Khal’s shoulder. Khal stiffens up, but 
           smiles.

                                 KELSA
                        Ugh, I don’t wanna go home. I have 
                        to work on my college essay.

                                 KHAL
                        Same. I haven’t done anything. What 
                        question are you gonna do?

                                 KELSA
                        My counselor says I should do 2.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, I was also thinking 2.

                                 KELSA
                        She wants me to do it about my 
                        parent’s divorce... no, more like, 
                        how I pretty much caused it because 
                        I’m trans.

                                 KHAL
                        Wow. I didn’t know...

           Kelsa takes her head off his shoulder. She isn’t here for 
           anyone’s pity. But then--

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Thats so brave of you.
           He’s only kidding! Kelsa smirks.

                                 KELSA
                        Shut up.

                                 KHAL
                        If it makes you feel better, I 
                        don’t even have anything to write 
                        about.

                                 KELSA
                        I’m pretty sure you do.

           Khal smiles.

           EXT. KELSA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Khal and Kelsa stop in front of the driveway.

                                 KELSA
                        Ok, um... bye.

                                 KHAL
                        Bye.

           They give each other a SUPER AWKWARD HUG.

                                 KELSA
                        Why are we so awkward?

           Khal shrugs. After a silent beat, Khal turns around to leave.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Khal spins back around.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you wanna make out?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

           Kelsa walks up to him. They start KISSING deeply.

           They stumble to the edge of the driveway and fall down on a 
           patch of grass, now having a FULL ON MAKE OUT SESH.

           They finally separate and laugh.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay. I really have to go now.
           They stand up, and give each other one final kiss. Kelsa 
           walks inside.

           Khal starts walking down the street. He looks down, then back 
           up with a look of embarrassment. He looks around nervously, 
           then puts his backpack on one shoulder and to the side, 
           strategically covering his crotch area. 

           INT. KHAL’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Zuabi family eats silently.

                                 KHAL
                        I think I have a girlfriend.

                                 SELDA
                        Oh, mama, that’s very sweet.

                                 ARWIN
                             (suspiciously)
                        What’s her name?

                                 KHAL
                        Kelsa.

                                 SASAN
                        Hm.

                                 ARWIN
                        Good.

                                 SELDA
                        You know her, Arwin? What’s she 
                        like?

           Khal shoots him a look.

                                 ARWIN
                        She’s... a very special girl.

                                 SELDA
                        That’s nice.

                                 KHAL
                        And while we’re at it... I’m 
                        thinking of applying to art school.

                                 SASAN
                        What? I thought Georgetown?

                                 KHAL
                        No. I’m not-- can we forget about 
                        Georgetown? That’s so random.
           The family eats.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        So, what do you think?

                                 SASAN
                        We support you.

           Khal sighs in relief.

                                 SASAN (CONT’D)
                        And when you’re selling pasta 
                        necklaces in the New York subway 
                        I’ll toss you a quarter.

           Selda swats him.

                        You know who was a great artist? 
                        Your great uncle.

                                 KHAL
                        Which one?

                                 SELDA
                        Your great uncle Khalid. It’s in 
                        the name, I guess.

           Khal’s eyes brighten up.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Khal walks down the hallway, radiating happiness.

           He notices Chris walking his way.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey.

           Chris grabs him and pulls him into the girl’s bathroom.

           INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Khal tries to get out, but Chris blocks the exit.

                                 CHRIS
                        How was the date, huh?

                                 KHAL
                        Chris, this is the girl’s bathroom.
                                 CHRIS
                        Did you try anything funny?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, I try to make her laugh when 
                        I can.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, you got jokes, huh?

                                 KHAL
                        That’s what I said.

           Chris grabs Khal by the shirt and pins him against a slimy 
           wall.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Ew.

                                 CHRIS
                        Listen here, guy, you might think 
                        you’re a very special boy, but 
                        you’re not. There are a lot of men 
                        who are attracted to trans women, 
                        and when it gets down to it...

           She glances down at his crotch.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        ...they’re not down to get to it.

                                 KHAL
                        It’s not like that at all. I don’t 
                        care about that. She could have a 
                        full human hand down there doing a 
                        Vulcan salute and I’d still like 
                        her.

           Chris does a Vulcan salute to herself.

                                 CHRIS
                        Okay, I didn’t peg you for the 
                        type, but prove me wrong, and I’ll 
                        skin your face and wear it like a 
                        mask.

           She mimes putting a mask on her face, then mumbles and acts 
           awkward, imitating Khal.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Do you think I’m scary?
                                 KHAL
                        Absolutely, but everything you say 
                        makes a lot of sense.

                                 CHRIS
                        Good.

           She releases him.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Khal reaches his locker. A few lockers away is Otis. The two 
           transfer books in and out without a word. Otis closes his 
           locker and walks away.

                        Hey reddit. I noticed you’ve been 
                        asking for an update, so here it 
                        is. I ended up getting her 
                        wildflowers, and giving them to her 
                        in the middle of lunch. Not the 
                        best of advice, but everything 
                        worked out in the end. We’re going 
                        out! I don’t think I’ve ever been 
                        happier. 

           INT. KHAL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal lies on his bed, looking at his phone.

                                 KHAL (V.O.)
                        I can’t fall asleep at night 
                        because I’m waiting for her to 
                        respond to my texts.

           INTERCUT - TEXT CONVERSATION

           We see Khal and Kelsa through the POV of their respective 
           phones. We INTERCUT with the text conversation on their phone 
           screen:

                                 KHAL
                        Would you have sex with your clone?
                                 KELSA
                        Probably not. We’d have so little 
                        to say to each other, it would just 
                        be awkward.

                                 KHAL
                        I would. But it would have to be 
                        immediately after he materialized. 
                        The more time that passes, the more 
                        of an independent being it is, and 
                        the less similar it is to 
                        masturbation.

           INT. KELSA’S ROOM - DAY

           Kelsa leads Khal into her room. He looks around in awe.

                                 KHAL (V.O.)
                        I finally saw her room. It’s less 
                        girly than I imagined. It’s really 
                        just mostly filled with SAT prep 
                        books. She does have good taste in 
                        art. 

           Khal’s portrait of Kelsa hangs on the wall.

           INT. KELSA’S ROOM - LATER

           Khal and Kelsa are in her bed looking at Kelsa’s laptop. The 
           screen shows a black and white video of a team of military 
           doctors wearing contamination suits performing an autopsy on 
           an alien. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Is this indeed a top secret autopsy 
                        performed on an alien in 1947?

                                 KHAL
                        How is that not real?

                                 KELSA
                        There’s no way it can be real, but 
                        how could they have done that? 
                        There’s blood oozing out every time 
                        they cut it.

           She starts typing on her phone.

                                 KHAL
                        It would be common knowledge by 
                        know, wouldn’t it?

                              phone)
                        Oh, yeah, it’s obviously not real.

                        So I’m finally starting estrogen, 
                        so I expect some bigger changes in 
                        the coming months. Oh! And my 
                        facial hair finally isn’t growing 
                        back anymore. I was so excited I 
                        let my boyfriend come to my laser 
                        appointment.

           INT. LASER HAIR REMOVAL - DAY - IPHONE VIDEO

           Kelsa films from her POV on the reclining chair in the middle 
           of the room. Khal sits on a chair nearby while the TECHNICIAN 
           puts the laser on Kelsa’s face.

                                 KHAL
                        Does it hurt?

                        No. It, like, hurts good, you know?

                                 KHAL
                        Can I try it?

                        Yeah. Really quick.

           Khal puts out his arm. The technician puts the machine up to 
           it and turns it on briefly.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, fucknuggets!

           He jerks away and shakes his arm in pain. Kelsa bursts out 
           laughing and points the phone at the ceiling.

                        And, about that... having a 
                        boyfriend. I thought being with a 
                        boy would help me feel more like a 
                        girl. But, I don’t think it’s that 
                        different for me. And that’s the 
                        thing about being trans. If you 
                        poke under the whole, it’s 2020, 
                        oh, the times we live in stuff,

                        I don’t feel more like a girl... I

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Chris drives, with Kelsa in the passenger seat. They stop in 
           front of a suburban home.

                                 CHRIS

           Girls in gym clothes start getting changed.

           Among them is Kelsa, who walks to her locker, grabs her 
           clothes, and walks through the crowd of girls into a nearby 
           bathroom stall. She starts to undress.

           Right outside, Em and Megan approach and start changing on a 
           bench.

                                 EM

                        Not since Chris went all psycho and 
                        vandalized his house.

           Kelsa frowns.

                        Duh. You know why they broke up,

                        condoms.

                        Can you stop spreading rumors about

                        Well, you should know, you’re her 
                        friend. Oh, I forgot.

           She gets close to Kelsa menacingly.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        You don’t give a shit about your 
                        friends.

                        Get off me.

           She pushes Em gently. Em retaliates by GRASPING Kelsa’s arm.

           The light skirmish results in Em taking a step back and 
           TRIPPING over the bench. She spins and tries to catch her 
           fall.

           Em’s ring finger hits directly against the floor, bending 
           where it shouldn’t.

                                 EM

           Em steps out of the locker room, pretty much in Megan’s arms.

           Kelsa comes out behind them.

                                 KELSA
                        Em, I’m sorry.

                                 EM
                        Shut up, you broke my finger!

           In the bleachers nearby, OTIS turns a curious head.

           INT. NURSE - DAY

           Silicone tape is WRAPPED around a splint on Em’s finger.

                                 EM
                        Ow!

           The NURSE finishes the procedure.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any painkillers? They 
                        gotta be strong. Something that’ll 
                        really zonk me out.

                                 NURSE
                        This is a High School, so we have 
                        chamomile tea.

                                 EM
                        Ugh. Fine.

           The nurse walks away.

           Otis walks in and smoothly approaches her.

           Em’s injured hand is resting on a table, the splinted middle 
           finger sticking upwards.
                                 OTIS
                        Hey, quit flipping me off.

           Em makes a face at him and actually flips him off with her 
           other hand.

           Otis laughs.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 EM
                        I’m fine. It’s Kelsa Brown who’s 
                        got mental problems.

                                 OTIS
                        Yeah, I heard she stole your man.

                                 EM
                        She didn’t steal my anything. He 
                        wasn’t my man. She’s just a 
                        conniving bitch.

                                 OTIS
                        Hey, I get it. She stole my best 
                        friend.

           Em gives him an understanding look.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        You wanna get back at her?

           Em’s ears prick up.

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I’m pretty liberal and 
                        everything. But it sounds to me 
                        like you were just assaulted... in 
                        a space meant for women only.

           Em looks at him, understanding...

           INT. MR. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Em sits across from Mr. Wallace, wearing a conspicuous FINGER 
           SPLINT.

                                 EM
                        It’s our space. A women’s space. 
                        And she brought her... socialized 
                        male energy into it. I’m fine with 
                        her lifestyle, I really am.

                                 EM (CONT'D)
                        But it stops being okay when she 
                        enters our spaces to... assault us.

           Mr. Wallace gives her a concerned look.

           CLOSE ON KELSA - YOUTUBE VIDEO

           Kelsa hesitates, thinking about what to say. She looks 
           miserable.

                                 KELSA
                        Surviving High School.

           INT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

           Kelsa walks among a herd of students. Mr. Wallace grabs her 
           arm. He gestures at her to come with him.

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        Here’s another useful tip:

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           Coach Tim blows his whistle. Girls in P.E. uniforms start to 
           sprint off the field.

           But Kelsa strays from the pack. She grabs a BACKPACK from the 
           sidelines and makes her way to a barely kept structure.

           INT. SOCCER FIELD BATHROOM - DAY

           The bathroom is GROSS. A small pack of teenagers smoke out of 
           VAPE PENS. Kelsa squeezes through them.

           She goes into a stall. Looks around. She lowers the seat and 
           places her backpack on the toilet. She unzips it.

                        Don’t be trans.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD BATHROOM - DAY

           We zoom out of the door. A grimy, decaying ALL GENDER SIGN 
           hangs from it.

           INT. KELSA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kelsa presses “publish” on a video entitled “BATHROOM DRAMA”
           She gets up off her desk and plops on the bed. Her phone 
           CHIMES.

           It’s a Facetime call from Khal. His picture of his phone is 
           one of a funny sloth.

           Kelsa smiles. She answers.

                                 KHAL
                        Question for you: in 100 years when 
                        your granddaughter is engaged to a 
                        robot, will you be pro-robot-human 
                        marriage or are you gonna be an 
                        annoying conservative who’s against 
                        their beautiful union?

                                 KELSA
                        Hm... pro robot marriage. At least 
                        they don’t smell like boys do.

                                 KHAL
                        Aha. Okay. I see how it is.

           Kelsa is immediately cheered up.

                        Hey, Mike Liebowitz is having a 
                        cabin thing for new years. 
                        Everyone’s going, but is it gonna 
                        be awkward for Chris if we go?

                                 KELSA
                        Chris is fine. She wants to do Mike 
                        Liebowitz exposure therapy to get 
                        over him.

                                 KHAL
                        Why did they break up?

           Kelsa lies:

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t know. Some drama.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay well, it’s gonna be cold. Pack 
                        your long johns.

                                 KELSA
                             (laughs)
                        What even are long johns? 

                                 KHAL
                        Like underwear pants.
                                 KELSA
                        Who’s john?

                                 KHAL
                        John Long John, the inventor of the 
                        long john.

           Kelsa laughs.

           INT. KHAL’S PARENT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           BIRD’S EYE VIEW: Selda and Sasan are tucked in bed, reading. 
           We hear a KNOCK. Selda looks up.

                                 SELDA
                        Oh, look who it is!

                                 SASAN
                        Come on, get up here.

           Khal climbs in the middle.

                                 SELDA
                        How long has it been since you were 
                        on our bed?

                                 KHAL
                        Mom, Dad, can I go to a party on 
                        New Year’s?

                                 SELDA
                        But we always go to Basha Cafe, 
                        then watch the ball drop on TV.

                                 KHAL
                        I know, but it’s my last year of 
                        High School, and all the seniors 
                        are going to Mike Liebowitz’s 
                        cabin. It’s tradition.

                                 SELDA
                        Yes, but we have our own tradition.

                                 SASAN
                        Will Kelsa be there?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 SASAN
                        You should go.
                                 KHAL
                        Mom?

                                 SELDA
                        Fine. But we’re going to Basha Cafe 
                        for your birthday.

                                 KHAL
                        Deal.

           He lies between them silently, cherishing the soon to be rare 
           family moment.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Do you guys care that I’m dating a 
                        white girl?

           Sasan laughs.

                                 SELDA
                        No, mama. We want you to be happy. 
                        There are worse things in the world 
                        than dating a white girl.

           Khal tenses up.

                                 KHAL
                        Like what?

                                 SELDA
                        I don’t know. Just don’t tell your 
                        Jadda.

                                 SASAN
                        She’ll finish decomposing.

                                 SELDA
                        Sasan!

           He chuckles to himself.

           INT/EXT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - NIGHT

           10 seconds before the new year. Khal’s schoolmates are 
           dressed in party hats and New Year apparel. Khal and Kelsa, 
           holding hands, rush through the crowd, evading the other kids 
           as the countdown begins.

                                 EVERYONE
                        10, 9, 8, 7...

                        Hurry, we’re gonna miss it!
           They go out the door and onto the deck. There are still 
           people there, so they quickly descend the stairs into the 
           edge of the woods.

                                 EVERYONE
                        6, 5, 4, 3...

           Finally alone, they turn towards each other...

                        2, 1...

           ... and KISS passionately, smiling in between each others’ 
           lips.

                                 EVERYONE (O.S.) (CONT’D)

                        It’s freezing.

                        Let’s go inside.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ'S CABIN - NIGHT

           Khal leads Kelsa through the party by the hand. He passes by 
           Otis and Kevin, making brief eye contact.

           When they pass by, Otis dramatically shivers in mock disgust.

           They find Chris on a couch, talking to Chance.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah, but you talk in African 
                        American Vernacular English, and 
                        you’re white. What’s so hard to 
                        understand?

                                 CHANCE
                        I know what AAVE is. And I don’t 
                        speak it.

           A PARTIER passes next to them.

                                 PARTIER
                        Yo, Chance, what’s good?

           Chance fist bumps him.

                                 CHANCE
                        Stayin’ black, stayin’ alive.
           Chris rolls her eyes.

           Kelsa leads Khal down a hallway and into an empty bedroom.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Khal sits on the bed while Kelsa locks the door. She walks 
           over, sits next to Khal. They start kissing. Soon, their 
           shirts are off.

           We hear a SCREAM from outside.

                                 KHAL
                        What’s that?

                                 KELSA
                        Don’t worry about it.

           They keep kissing. Khal keeps his eyes open.

           We hear another, slightly shorter SCREAM.

           Kelsa slightly opens her eyes.

           KELSA’S POV - A blurry view of Khal’s open eye.

           Kelsa retreats.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you have your eyes open?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah.

                                 KELSA
                        It’s kinda freaky.

                                 KHAL
                        Sorry.

                                 KELSA
                        It’s okay.

           She kisses him. Another SCREAM.

                                 KHAL
                        I kinda wanna know what they’re 
                        screaming about.

           Kelsa scoots away.

                                 KELSA
                        Do you not wanna do this?
                                 KHAL
                        I’m sorry. It’s really not you. I 
                        don’t want you to think that... I’m 
                        not attracted to you, and to every 
                        part of you. Because I am.

                                 KELSA
                        Khalid. I know. If you’re not 
                        ready, we don’t have to.

                                 KHAL
                        Are you sure?

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah.

           She picks up her shirt.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey.

           Kelsa turns towards him. 

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        You’re beautiful.

           He kisses her tenderly.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal and Kelsa come out into a scene of chaos. Girls hide 
           behind couches and tables. Boys cower, protecting their face 
           with their hands. 

           Only the brave Mike Liebowitz himself takes action, waving a 
           broom around to steer a zigzagging BAT out of the house, with 
           little luck.

                                 KELSA
                        Stop! Mike, do you have a torch?

                                 MIKE
                        Like a tiki torch?

                                 KELSA
                        No, like a big flashlight.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, hang on.

           He grabs a torch from one of the living room drawers, and 
           hands it to Kelsa.
           Kelsa turns it on and points it near the bat.

                                 KELSA
                        They’re like little vampires.

           The bat avoids the light, and Kelsa steers it out of the open 
           door. Everyone CHEERS. Mike closes the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, back to the game.
                             (to Kelsa)
                        You wanna play?

                                 KELSA
                        What are you playing?

                                 MIKE
                        Hot seat.

           Kelsa thinks about it.

                                 KELSA
                        Sure.

           Everyone forms a circle, including the amused Khal, and Kelsa 
           sits in the middle. 

                                 MIKE
                        You know the rules right? For a 
                        minute, anybody can ask you any 
                        question, and you have to answer.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay, but two things are out of 
                        bounds.

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.

                                 KELSA
                        You can’t ask me about my genitals.

           The group nods in agreement.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        And you can’t ask me what my 
                        deadname is.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. Everybody got it?

           The group murmurs in agreement.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        And... 

           He starts a timer on his phone.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Start.

           The partier from earlier speaks up.

                                 PARTIER
                        What’s a deadname?

           Everyone laughs.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kelsa mingles with the crowd. People are interested in 
           talking to her, and she’s having a good time.

           From across the kitchen, Em eyes her jealously.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Kelsa waits in line for the bathroom. Em comes out.

                                 EM
                        Hang on.

           She looks at the bathroom.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah. It’s gender neutral. 

                                 KELSA
                        What else do you want from me? You 
                        win, okay? I know I was never 
                        supposed to like anyone.

                                 EM
                        You were allowed to like whoever 
                        you wanted, you chose to like the 
                        guy I told you I liked.

                                 KELSA
                        You don’t get to choose who you 
                        like. I definitely don’t get to 
                        choose who likes me back.

                                 EM
                        You should have chosen me.
                                 KELSA
                        Yeah, well, I guess I payed the 
                        price, right? Now I can’t even use 
                        the girl’s bathroom.

           Almost in tears, she enters the bathroom and SLAMS the door.

           Otis is giggling. Khal glares at him.

           Chris knocks on the bathroom door. She’s about to go in--

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, can I go?

                                 CHRIS
                        Sure.

           Chris turns to look at a smirking Otis. His smirk dissappears 
           when Chris approaches him--

           And THRUSTS her body at him in a fake attack. Otis flinches 
           embarrassingly.

           INT. MIKE LIEBOWITZ’S CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Khal carefully opens the door.

           Kelsa sits on the toilet, wiping her tears with toilet paper.

                                 KHAL
                        Are you okay?

                                 KELSA
                        I’m fine.

           Khal squats in front of her.

                                 KHAL
                        What’s this about the girl’s 
                        bathroom?

                                 KELSA
                        Nothing, Khal.

                                 KHAL
                        What can I do?

                                 KELSA
                        Nothing!

                                 KHAL
                        Well, I want to help.
                                 KELSA
                        Forget about it, it’s trans stuff.

                                 KHAL
                        I can handle the trans stuff.

                                 KELSA
                        Why do you care?

                                 KHAL
                        Because I’m your boyfriend and 
                        you’re trans.

                                 KELSA
                        What does me being trans have to do 
                        with being my boyfriend?

                                 KHAL
                        Nothing! But--

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t need you to save me, okay?

           Khal looks at her deeply. Kelsa avoids his gaze.

           INT. KHAL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal sits in the dark. An eerie internet light from his 
           laptop illuminates his face.

           On the screen: Kelsa’s BATHROOM DRAMA video.

                                 KELSA
                        So, apparently I’m not allowed to 
                        use the girl’s locker room or 
                        bathroom. It... doesn’t feel great. 
                        Um, I had a whole rant about how I 
                        have rights and Mr. Wallace’s a 
                        clueless fascist and I’m above it 
                        and I know my worth and I know I’m 
                        a girl but I... I don’t really feel 
                        like it anymore.

           The video ends.

           Khal contemplates.

           He slowly moves the cursor to the SHARE button. CLICKS, then 
           moves the cursor up...

           ...to the FACEBOOK ICON...

           CLICK.

           He slows the treadmill down as the video starts.

                        So apparently I’m not allowed to

           Otis and Kevin furiously tap on their controllers. Chance

           He puts the tablet in front of his friends.

           Mr. Kuznetsov sits in front of his computer, its screen the 
           only light in a dark, sinister room. He raises an eyebrow as 
           he takes out a huge cigar and lights it.

           INT. LINGERIE STORE - NIGHT

           Rachel looks at her phone, a proud look on her face.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           In a dark movie theater, Chris looks at her phone. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, no he didn’t.

           An ANGRY WOMAN behind her speaks up.

                                 ANGRY WOMAN
                        Please, your screen is irritating 
                        my eyes!

           Chris ignores her, and turns the brightness way up.
           INT. MR. WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mr. Wallace looks at his computer, a fist against his mouth 
           in frustration.

           On his screen:

           Morning. Khal is fast asleep.

           Khal opens his eyes. Arwin is standing next to his bed.

                                 KHAL
                        What are you doing?

                                 ARWIN
                        I wanted to congratulate you. You 
                        went viral, dude.

                                 KHAL
                        What?

           Arwin holds out his phone. It’s Khals post sharing Kelsa’s 
           video: 12,000 shares.

           Khal jerks up.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

                        KELSA!!!

           Kelsa jumps.
           INT. KELSA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kelsa sits on her bed, her computer in front of her. It shows 
           her Youtube video, but subtitled with fun and digestible 
           animated text: “GET THIS: THIS TRANS GIRL IS STICKING IT TO 
           THE HATERS”. It’s been reposted on Facebook by a viral news 
           site. 

           Sarah stands next to the bed with her arms crossed.

                                 KELSA
                        Mom, I didn’t do this.

                                 SARAH
                        You didn’t film this video?

                                 KELSA
                        I did, but it was supposed to be 
                        personal.

                                 SARAH
                        Take it down, now.

                                 KELSA
                        I can’t. Even if I do, Get This has 
                        already used it. It went viral, it 
                        has 50 thousand views.

           Sarah moans as if the views were actually 50 thousand pins 
           through her heart.

                                 SARAH
                        How long have you been making those

                        No. Answer my question.

                        Since I started hormone blockers.

                        your personal life?

                        I don’t know, like 200.

                                 SARAH
                        Take the channel down. I don’t want 
                        you to make one more video.

                        What? You can’t do that.

                                 SARAH
                        Yes I can. This is your body, what 
                        you do with it is nobody’s

                                 SARAH
                        Then I’m taking your computer.

           She takes the computer and walks out into the hall.

                                 KELSA
                        Mom!

           Kelsa follows her.

                                 SARAH
                        We have an old desktop somewhere.

                        It makes me feel good, why can’t

           The chase continues into...

                                 SARAH
                        How? How can it possibly make you 
                        feel good?

           Sarah holds the computer on one side of her bed, with Kelsa 
           on the other side.

                                 KELSA
                        It helps with my self esteem.

                                 SARAH
                        By having whatever weirdo out there 
                        look at you?

                        Oh my god, they’re not weirdos. 

                           SARAH
           No. They are weirdos. You 
           think the world is on your 
           side because I’ve provided an 
           accepting environment. You 
           live in a bubble! There are 
           people out there that will 
           hurt you. They want to hurt 
           my baby, and I don’t know how 
           else to protect my baby!

                                              They’re people like me. I’m 
                                              helping them, and if just one 
                                              person looks at my videos and 
                                              comes to understand--oh, 
                                              okay, mom, accepting? Listen 
                                              to what you’re saying! You’re 
                                              controlling me because Dad 
                                              left and you felt like you 
                                              needed to protect me--

           Sarah starts crying. Kelsa walks back towards her room.

                        I still have a phone with a camera.

           This time, Sarah follows her, stern mom face back on.

                        Ok, how about I follow you, since I 
                        am an anonymous member of the 
                        public, and if you don’t take it 
                        down, you won’t be going to a

           She SLAMS the door to her room right in Sarah’s face.
           INT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH - GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Chris looks at herself in the mirror, stretching out the skin 
           on her face to check the severity of her breakouts.

           The door to the bathroom opens. We hear the voice of two 
           BOYS.

                                 BOY IN BATHROOM 1 (O.S.)
                        All I’m saying is, there’s really 
                        no reason to separate sports into 
                        guys and girls. Why don’t they do 
                        it according to weight, or simply 
                        skill level?

           The boys appear behind Chris, and go into adjoining stalls.

                                 BOY IN BATHROOM 2
                        It’s pure misogyny, bro. Guys don’t 
                        want to even have the option of 
                        losing to women.

           Confused, Chris walks out of the bathroom.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           She looks at the door and, sure enough, the girls’ symbol is 
           there. She walks a few steps down the hall and enters the 
           boy’s bathroom.

           INT. BOY’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Two girls stand in front of the urinals. They turn towards 
           each other.

                                 GIRL IN BATHROOM 1
                        Should we try it?

                                 GIRL IN BATHROOM 2
                             (really excited)
                        Yeah.

           They unzip their pants. Chris is completely confused. She 
           looks around.

                                 CHRIS
                        Is my blood sugar low? What is 
                        going on?

           Another girl comes out of the stall washes her hands.
                                 GIRL IN BATHROOM 3
                        Aren’t you on Facebook?

                                 CHRIS
                        Bitch, I’m on Linkedin only.

                        After Khal Zuabi bravely shared his 
                        girlfriend’s story, Mike Liebowitz
                             (Chris frowns at the name)
                        organized a protest. Until the 
                        school respects Kelsa Brown’s human 
                        rights, we’re pulling a She’s The 
                        Man on the bathrooms.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, she’s not gonna like this.

           We FOLLOW HER as she exits the bathroom.

           She walks down the hallway. Mike stands on a chair:

                                 MIKE
                        Do not use the bathroom that aligns 
                        with your gender identity! We stand 
                        with Kelsa!

                                 STUDENTS
                        We stand with Kelsa!

           Chris bumps into Kelsa, who covers her face with her hoodie.

                                 CHRIS
                        Kelsa!

                                 KELSA
                        Not now, Chris.

           We FOLLOW Kelsa as she keeps walking, leaving Chris behind. 
           She makes her way among the crowd.

           Khal comes at her from the other direction.

                                 KHAL
                        Kelsa!

           Kelsa shakes her head. She’s furious at him. She turns around 
           and walks the other way.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Kelsa wait!

           Kelsa walks into the library.
           INT. COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Kelsa sits in an empty lab, completely overwhelmed. Khal 
           enters.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, is everything alright?

                                 KELSA
                        Is everything alright? How could 
                        you do this to me? You were the 
                        only one who knew about those 
                        videos. 

           Khal goes white. Busted.

                                 KHAL
                        Everyone’s helping you.

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t want that! I never did. I 
                        can take care of myself, I don’t 
                        need anyone to save me, especially 
                        not you.

                                 KHAL
                        You said you wanted to make a 
                        difference with those videos. You 
                        said, if one person--

                        That is not your call, Khalid. 

                                 KHAL
                        Well, you don’t talk to me! I just 
                        wanted to help you! That’s all I’ve 
                        wanted this whole time. I lost all 
                        my friends for you.

                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. I never asked you 
                        to do any of that. What, do you 
                        want me to thank you?

                                 KHAL
                        I...

           He can’t say it, but yes.

                        You know, you think you’re so 
                        special helping everyone but really 
                        you just wanna show off how morally 
                        superior you think you are. 
           Khal doesn’t know how to defend himself.

                        Go back to Otis. You deserve each 
                        other.

           She exits. Khal follows her into the hallway.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 KHAL
                        Kelsa, what’s happening?

                                 KELSA
                        We’re done! Get that through your 
                        skull.

           She walks away. Khal notices Otis within earshot and sighs.

                                 OTIS
                        What’s going on, Khal? You didn’t 
                        want to suck his cock?

           Khal walks up to him, threateningly.

                                 KHAL
                        What did you say?

           Otis makes himself larger, refusing to give up his power over 
           Khal.

                                 OTIS
                        I called you a cocksucker.

                                 KHAL
                        I don’t care what you called me. 
                        What did you call her?

                                 OTIS
                        Him. Remember? It’s a him. He’s 
                        just crazy.

                                 KHAL
                        It’s Her, and no, she’s not.

                                 OTIS
                        He has a mental disorder.

                                 KHAL
                        No, she doesn’t.
                                 OTIS
                        Maybe you do too. You’d have to be 
                        pretty messed up to wanna have sex 
                        with someone like that. I think you 
                        have a mental disorder.

                                 KHAL
                        No, you do, you illiterate fuck!

           He hits a nerve. Otis pushes Khal. He regains his balance, 
           and pushes him back. The two of them square up. This is 
           happening.

           Passing by students stop and gather around the upcoming 
           fight.

           Khal and Otis step lightly, anticipating each other’s moves. 
           Finally, they lunge towards each other... and grab each other 
           by the hair.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           They pull each other’s hair, both keeping their heads down as 
           low as possible to ease the pain.

                                 OTIS
                        Let go!

                                 KHAL
                        You let go!

           They’re stuck in a really lame Mexican standoff.

                        This sucks!

           Finally Khal lets go. He uses Otis’s downward force to knock 
           his hand from his scalp, then lands a solid punch.

                                 MR. KIDD (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           Alarmed, Khal and Otis take off separately.

           INT. KHAL’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Khal walks into the house. His parents are sitting around the 
           empty dining room table. Sasan looks extremely concerned. 
           Selda is crying. 

                                 KHAL
                        What’s going on?
           Neither Sasan nor Selda wants to answer. 

                                 SASAN
                        We got a call from Otis’s mom 
                        saying you fought. He came home 
                        with a black eye.

           Selda finally holds back her tears.

                                 SELDA
                        I knew there has been something off 
                        with you. So we went through your 
                        internet history.

                                 KHAL
                        You guys went through my history?

                                 SELDA
                        We found searches for hormones, 
                        laser hair removal... sex change 
                        surgeries.

           She bursts into tears again.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, god.

                                 SELDA
                        Are you transgendered?

                                 KHAL
                        No!

                                 SELDA
                        You’re going to live such an 
                        unhappy life.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay, first of all, that’s not 
                        true. I could live a happy and 
                        fruitful life. Second of all, I’m 
                        not trans.

           Sasan takes a breath of relief.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        My girlfriend is.

                                 SASAN
                        I told you. He’s just gay.

                                 KHAL
                        Ugh!
           He storms off.

           INT. KHAL’S ROOM - DAY

           Khal lies on his bed, browsing reddit.

           We hear a KNOCK. Khal says nothing. Selda slowly comes into 
           the room. Khal stares hard at his computer screen.

           Selda sits at the foot of his bed and slowly closes the 
           computer screen, making Khal look directly at her.

                                 SELDA
                        Khalid...

                                 KHAL
                        What?! I’m sick of people calling 
                        me gay or crazy when they’re the 
                        ones who are so wrong about her...

           He’s tearing up.

                                 SELDA
                        Stop. You don’t have to explain 
                        anything to me. I understand. You 
                        have always been so kind.

           Khal makes a deep, guttural sound of utter frustration.

                                 SELDA (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t like to hear it, 
                        but you are kind. That’s always 
                        been who you are.

           She touches his hair.

                                 SELDA (CONT’D)
                        And that’s why you see that girl 
                        for who she really is.

           Khal lets her run her fingers through his hair for a moment, 
           then jerks his head away.

                                 KHAL
                        It doesn’t matter. She broke up 
                        with me.

                                 SELDA
                        Then she has bigger problems, 
                        because she’s an idiot.

           Khal can’t help but smile.
           INT. MR. WALLACE’S OFFICE

           Kelsa and Sarah, Em and her mom KAREN sit opposite Mr. 
           Wallace.

           Karen’s annoyingly soft voice finishes a rant:

                                 KAREN
                        Our little girls should be able to 
                        go into a restroom and feel safe. 
                        Because of one of the members of 
                        our community...

           She gestures at Kelsa, who has her arms crossed, sinked back 
           in her seat. Defeated.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        ...they no longer have this 
                        assurance. Kelsa brown is a bully. 
                        I don’t know why we’re rallying for 
                        the bully, why we’re protecting the 
                        bully, when she shouldn’t be using 
                        the girl’s bathroom in the first 
                        place.

                                 SARAH
                        Watch it, Karen.

           Karen turns towards her.

                                 KAREN
                        You know, transgenderism is not 
                        found in nature.

                           SARAH
                                                     KAREN (CONT'D)

                                              We are not fish!

                                              It doesn’t sound right to me.
           Hyenas, lions, species of 
           fish, all display similar 
           behaviors. Even if they 
           didn’t. Look around you. 
           People are trans, Karen. 
           You’d know this if you’d 
           finished college.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I finished college.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay, then you should have taken 
                        biology or feminist studies instead 
                        of how to marry rich and impotent.

                                 KAREN
                        You’re very rude.
                                 SARAH
                        You’re a dumbass.

           Kelsa puts a hand to her mouth. She can’t help but be 
           delighted by the mom fight.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Okay look, the bottom line is, 
                        Kelsa assaulted and injured Em in 
                        the bathroom. I know optically it’s 
                        not ideal, but I can’t have them 
                        together in an unsupervised space.

                                 SARAH
                        You can’t ban my daughter from the 
                        bathroom. It’s illegal.

                                 MR. WALLACE
                        Not when there was actually an 
                        assault.

           Sarah is stumped. On Em, something boiling inside her...

                                 KAREN
                        Are we done here?

           Kelsa and Sarah look defeated. It looks like they are done 
           here when--

                                 EM
                        She didn’t assault me, okay?

           Everyone turns to look at her.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        I made it up because we were 
                        fighting. I broke my finger by 
                        accident. 

                                 KAREN
                        Emberlee, honey, you don’t have to 
                        defend her.

                                 EM
                        I’m not. She didn’t assault me, 
                        that’s stupid.

           She looks at Kelsa. With all the strength she can muster:

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Kelsa smiles.
           INT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Kelsa and Em walk out of the office.

                                 KELSA
                             (teasing)
                        Your full name’s Emberlee?

                                 EM
                        Shut up.

           She storms off.

                                 KHAL (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Kelsa’s smile disappears. She turns around to see Khal.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        How’d it go?

                                 KELSA
                             (dry)
                        Fine.

           Sarah steps out of the office.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Mom, this is Khalid.

                                 KHAL
                        Nice to meet you, Ms. Brown.

                                 SARAH
                        Nice to meet you too.

                                 KHAL
                        I just wanted to make sure 
                        everything turned out okay.

           He looks at Kelsa, who avoids his gaze.

                                 SARAH
                        It did. Thank you, Khalid.

           A loaded thank you. Khal smiles.

           Kelsa starts stepping away from the conversation. Sarah gets 
           the cue, and they start walking away. 

           Khal looks after her mournfully.
           INT. SARAH’S CAR - DAY

           Sarah and Kelsa drive in tense silence. Kelsa finally speaks:

                                 KELSA
                        Thanks for helping me, mom. You 
                        didn’t have to.

                                 SARAH
                        I know I didn’t have to.

                                 KELSA
                        I know, but I don’t want you to 
                        feel like you need to protect me 
                        because dad refused to.

           They reach a stoplight.

                                 SARAH
                        Honey, the thing with me and your 
                        dad, do you think it had something 
                        to do with you? With you being...?

                                 KELSA
                        I mean, yeah. I was such a burden 
                        to you guys that your marriage just 
                        couldn’t take it.

                                 SARAH
                        I mean, sure, it put some strain on 
                        the situation but honey, the wound 
                        was there.

                                 KELSA
                        It’s okay, mom. My relationship 
                        couldn’t take it either.

           Sarah takes her hands off the wheel and looks deeply at 
           Kelsa.

                                 SARAH
                        Kelsa, look at me.

           She doesn’t.

                                 KELSA
                        I don’t wanna talk about this.

           The light turns green.

                                 SARAH
                        Kelsa...

           She gestures at the light.
                                 KELSA
                        Go.

                                 SARAH
                        Kelsa, just because you’re trans--

                                 KELSA
                        Law of averages!

                                 SARAH
                        No! No. You are not average. In no 
                        shape or form. You are incredible. 
                        You’re my incredible, inconceivably 
                        above average little girl and you 
                        know what? Being different does not 
                        make you a burden. You have never 
                        been a burden to me, do you 
                        understand? Not to me or to anyone. 
                        You are a lightness and a blessing--

           Kelsa TOSSES herself at Sarah and hugs her tightly. They both 
           WEEP.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        --and the only burden’s gonna be 
                        not having you around.

           The cars behind them honk, but they keep holding on to each 
           other, both of them refusing, for this once, to move forward.

           They separate. Sarah accelerates. She wipes tears from her

           EXT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - BEHIND THE POOL HOUSE - DAY

           A GROUP OF SKATER BOYS smoke cigarettes among the forgotten 
           pool paraphernalia. Khal approaches one of them.

                                 KHAL
                        Hey, can I... scrounge a coffin 
                        nail?

                                 SKATER BOY
                        What?

                                 KHAL
                        Can I... you know... mooch a... 
                        fag?

           Khal gestures at the cigarettes.

                                 SKATER BOY
                        Oh, bum a stoge? Sure, dude.

           Khal puts the cigarette in his mouth. The burnout lights it. 
           Khal’s face contorts in disgust, but he tries to play it 
           cool.

                                 KHAL
                        Thanks.

           He steps aside. Tries to smoke the cigarette, but can only 
           inhale so much without choking.

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        What’s up, 

           Chris walks up to him. Khal looks at her.

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah, I’m going for the “lost 
                        everything, don’t know what to live 
                        for now” look.

                                 CHRIS
                        It doesn’t suit you.

                                 KHAL
                        You’re right, I don’t think 
                        voluntary smoke inhalation’s really 
                        my thing.

           He tosses the cigarette aside.

                                 CHRIS
                        Walk with me.
           EXT. RIVER VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - POOL - DAY

           Khal and Chris sit on the pool bleachers. Above the pool, the 
           DIVING TEAM gathers on a platform.

           One of them steps forward. Gets ready. DIVES.

           On the bleachers:

                                 CHRIS
                        You know, you didn’t have to save 
                        her. Loving her was enough.

                                 KHAL
                        I’m perpetually nice, what can I 
                        do?

                                 CHRIS
                        I don’t think you’re nice.

                                 KHAL
                        Thanks.

                                 CHRIS
                        I think you’re one better. You’re 
                        brave, Khalid.

                                 KHAL
                        I’m not brave for loving a trans 
                        girl.

                                 CHRIS
                        Oh, hell no. Did I say that? Did I 
                        say that.

                                 KHAL
                        No.

           Another team member dives. BELLY FLOP. The rest of the team 
           “ooooh”s. Khal winces.

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you know why I broke up with 
                        Mike?

                                 KHAL
                        I heard rumors. You disagreed on 
                        which McDonald’s dipping sauce to 
                        get?

                                 CHRIS
                        I got pregnant.
                                 KHAL
                        Oh. Wow, I didn’t know.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah. Obviously I got an abortion. 
                        And don’t get me wrong, I was 
                        stoked to suck that clump of cells 
                        out of my body.

                                 KHAL
                        Of course, yeah.

           Another diver walks up to the edge of the platform. She 
           hesitates. Clearly afraid of belly flopping herself.

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        But when I decided I was gonna do 
                        it, I texted Mike... nothing. The 
                        day of my appointment came... 
                        nothing.

           Khal nods solemnly.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Through thick and thin, we said, 
                        but when it got thick, he wussed 
                        out.

           The diving team EGGS the diver on.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Look, Khal. Any douchebag can fall 
                        in love with a trans girl. But 
                        really loving someone. With 
                        confidence. With kindness. Saying 
                        fuck what people think, this is my 
                        person. Whoever it is. That’s about 
                        the bravest thing anyone can do.

           The diver LAUNCHES herself off the platform... a perfect 
           dive.

           Khal nods.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Now text her! Unless you’re still 
                        “afraid of the drama”.

           Khal perks up.

                                 KHAL
                        Are you-- did you comment on my 
                        post?
                                 CHRIS

                        internet, narutofan2003.

           Khal BLUSHES profusely.

           Chris walks off the bleachers.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                             (yells)
                        By the way, you can’t get erectile 
                        dysfunction from watching too much 
                        porn!

           The entire diving team looks over at Khal, who comes close to 
           death-by-embarrassment.

           INT. KHAL’S ROOM - DAY

           Phone in his hand, Khal paces back and forth.

           ON HIS PHONE: an open conversation with KELSA.

           Khal keeps pacing. Above his head, we see the EMPTY TEXT 
           ENTRY BOX, with a BLINKING BLUE BAR on its left side.

           As Khal types, the text shows up in the box:

                                 “HEYOOOO!!”

           Khal frowns. DELETE.

           He keeps thinking. But then--

           A TEXT pops up from Kelsa!

                                 “Hey, meet me somewhere?”

           Khal’s eyes go wide in surprise!

           EXT. PITTSBURGH NATIONAL AVIARY - DAY

           Khal walks among the tall trees in the park outside the 
           Aviary.

           In his hands-- WILDFLOWERS.

           He looks around. Spots KELSA next to a tree, facing away from 
           him.

           He nervously turns around...
           Takes a deep breath...

           Turns BACK around and starts walking towards Kelsa.

           When he’s mere steps away--

           --Kelsa turns around, revealing she’s also holding a BOUQUET 
           OF WILDFLOWERS.

           Khal stops in his tracks.

           Their smiles feed off each others’.

                                 KELSA
                        Um...

           She laughs.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           She holds the flowers out.

           Khal takes them. Holds his own out.

                                 KHAL
                        Here.

           Kelsa takes them. They look at each other. Sweet, sweet 
           awkwardness.

                                 KHAL (CONT’D)
                        Wow. No one’s ever given me flowers 
                        before.

                                 KELSA
                        Someone has for me. It was weird 
                        and too much, but also kind of the 
                        best feeling I’ve ever had.

                           KHAL

                                              So, look--

           They laugh.

                           KHAL
           I had a speech, but now I’m 
           nervous--

                                              --it’s okay, you don’t have 
                                              to--

           They stop.

                        Why are we so awkward!

                        feelings for someone. It was messy, 
                        and stupid, and dramatic. But if I 
                        hadn’t, I’d probably have spent the 
                        rest of my life wondering...

           INT. KELSA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kelsa and Khal sit on Kelsa’s bed, staring at her computer.
                                 KHAL (V.O.)
                        ...what if?

                                 KHAL
                        Hit refresh again.

                                 KELSA
                        I just did.

                                 KHAL
                        I feel like this is the one.

                                 KELSA
                        You said that about the last seven 
                        schools.

                                 KHAL
                        Just putting the energy out there.

                                 KELSA
                        Shit, it updated.

           She presses her face against Khal’s neck.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t look. You check.

           Khal reads the computer screen.

                                 KHAL
                        Oh, dang, that sucks...

                                 KELSA
                        What?

                                 KHAL
                        Your mom’s gonna be so bummed 
                        you’re going all the way to UCLA.

                                 KELSA
                        What?!

           She looks at the screen, and SCREAMS with joy.

                                 KELSA (CONT’D)
                        You asshole!

           She hugs Khal. They start kissing, laughing, undressing...

           Khal accidentally kicks the laptop off the bed. He gets up to 
           fix it, but Kelsa pulls him back towards her.
           INT. KHAL’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Khal takes his shoes off right in front of the door. He 
           starts to walk in the house, but turns back and moves his 
           shoes to the side. 

           INT. KHAL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Khal looks around for his family. 

           He hears something coming from his parents’ bedroom.

           INT. KHAL’S PARENT’S ROOM - DAY

           Khal finds Sasan, Selda and Arwin sitting on his parents’ 
           bed. They are all crying.

                                 KHAL
                        Who died?

           Selda holds out a letter. 

           Khal takes the letter. The letterhead reads: “SCHOOL OF THE 
           ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO”. Khal looks at his family. Smiles 
           widely.

           They all join together for a group hug.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           Graduation. A line of students wearing gowns and embarrassed 
           smirks walk down the center isle, parents on either side 
           climbing over each other to get a good picture. 

           When Kelsa walks by, looking gorgeous in her graduation day 
           makeup, Sarah steps in front of her, blocking the procession 
           to snap a picture.

                                 KELSA
                        Mom!

           She walks by her, followed by Khal, who Sarah also 
           photographs, not before he pops a painfully awkward smile.

           Sarah steps back into the crowd, next to Selda and Sasan.

                                 SELDA
                        Can you send that?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah.
           INT. KELSA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sarah holds an iPhone up for a photo as Kelsa and Khal and 
           Chris (proudly going stag) pose on the stairs, all dressed up 
           for prom.

           Chris fixes her own corsage. Kelsa looks at her warmly.

           INT. MULTI PURPOSE ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal and Kelsa dance. They clumsily spin each other around 
           and get close to each other.

           As Khal finishes a spin, he spots Otis sitting at a table, 
           eyeing him.

           They share a brief look. 

           Then, Khal’s attention magnetizes back to Kelsa.

           INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Kelsa holds Em’s hair back as she throws up into the sink. 
           Chris and Megan stand behind them, looking equally concerned 
           and disgusted. Khal comes in with a bottle of water.

                                 KHAL
                        I brought some water.

           He passes it to Kelsa.

                                 KELSA
                        Em, drink this. You’ll thank me 
                        tomorrow.

           Em wipes the vomit from her face and starts sipping from the 
           water bottle.

                                 EM
                        Thanks, Kelsa. I miss you guys.

           She hugs her three friends. Kelsa and Chris look at each 
           other behind her back and smile.

                                 EM (CONT’D)
                        Promise me we’ll keep in touch.

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah.

                                 EM
                        Promise me we’ll keep in touch!
                           KELSA
                                                          CHRIS
           Promise!
                                              Promise!

           Khal looks at the group of friends from a distance.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Get in here, Khalid.

           Khal slowly inches towards them. Chris pulls him into the 
           hug.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Like it or not, you’re one of us 
                        now.

           She rubs a friendly hand through his hair. Khal smiles.

           INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           A receptionist hands Khal and Kelsa a set of keys.

                                 KELSA
                        Thank you.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Khal struggles to get the door open. He and Kelsa spill into 
           the room. Kelsa looks around and nods in approval. Khal grabs 
           her face and kisses her deeply.

           They lean against the door, and, as is now their signature, 
           smile in between each other’s lips.

           In case you haven’t noticed, a CHEESY INDIE POP SONG is 
           playing.

           INT. NATIONAL AVIARY - PENGUIN POINT - DAY

           Two penguins waddle across the exhibit.

           In the crawl space beneath, Khal and Kelsa sit in the 
           familiar spot under the peeking dome. They play with each 
           other’s fingers, discovering all the different ways their 
           hands can fit together.

                                 KELSA
                        So, what’s gonna happen, with us?
                                 KHAL
                        Well, do you wanna do long 
                        distance?

           Kelsa thinks about it.

                                 KELSA
                        No. We’ll end up getting sick of 
                        each other.

                                 KHAL
                        No we won’t.

           Kelsa smiles.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay. But still, we’re going to 
                        college, We have to experience 
                        things, meet other people, or else 
                        we’ll never grow.

                                 KHAL
                        So that’s it, then?

                                 KELSA
                        I mean, I’ll see you during 
                        Thanksgiving. And New Year’s. 
                        Summer. Until one of us meets 
                        someone else and breaks the other’s 
                        heart.

                                 KHAL
                        Sounds complicated.

                                 KELSA
                        Yeah.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay, um, so...

                                 KELSA
                        So...

                                 KHAL
                        ...broken up, then, I guess?

                                 KELSA
                        Broken up.

                                 KHAL
                        Okay.
                                 KELSA
                        I think I’m just gonna head home 
                        alone, if that’s okay?

                                 KHAL
                        Yeah. I’ll stick around for a 
                        while.

                                 KELSA
                        Have a good trip tomorrow.

           She gives him a small kiss on the cheek, and hesitates. Khal 
           turns his head towards her--

           They KISS FOR THE LAST TIME, then hug strongly.

           Kelsa breaks away.

                           KHAL
                                                     KELSA (CONT'D)
           I love you.
                                              I love you.

           They laugh at their awkwardness. They look at each other one 
           final time, and Kelsa starts crawling towards the exit.

                                 KHAL
                        Wait.

                                 KELSA
                        What?

                                 KHAL
                        If we’re gonna break up, I don’t 
                        want to feel like I missed 
                        anything.

                                 KELSA
                        Okay.

                                 KHAL
                        I’m trying to think if there’s 
                        still anything I don’t know about 
                        you... Oh! I know.

                                 KELSA
                        What?

                                 KHAL
                        What’s your favorite animal?

           Kelsa smiles.

                                 KELSA
                        Let’s save that one.
           Khal smiles back.

           EXT. CORAL REEF - DAY

           In Planet Earth style, we follow a RIBBON EEL swimming around 
           a reef and engaging in the behavior that Kelsa explains in 
           voiceover:

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        The ribbon eel is a species of 
                        Moray Eel native to the Indo-
                        Pacific Ocean. They’re named after 
                        their mesmerizing style of 
                        swimming, which looks a lot like a 
                        rhythmic gymnast waving a ribbon 
                        around. 

           STOCK FOOTAGE: A 1940s rhythmic gymnast waves a ribbon 
           around.

           Back in the reef:

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        The juvenile males are jet black 
                        with a yellow dorsal fin. In 
                        adults, the yellow is replaced by 
                        blue. However, if enough females 
                        are removed from the ecosystem, the 
                        male will undergo a metamorphosis, 
                        and change sex, its colors also 
                        changing to make it almost entirely 
                        yellow. Now, it’s absurd to draw a 
                        parallel between this change and 
                        transgender humans, since being 
                        trans for us depends on more 
                        complicated social and biological 
                        factors, and of course reflects the 
                        specific culture around it. So, I 
                        like to say my favorite animal is 
                        the ribbon eel because of its 
                        unique and magnificent showmanship. 
                        But to myself, I can say:

           The eel swims away into the blue, waving its colors proudly.

                                 KELSA (V.O.)
                        Look at that beautiful, talented 
                        trans girl.

                                 THE END.
