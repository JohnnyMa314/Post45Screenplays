           INT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           MONTAGE: The hustle and bustle of the first morning of THE 
           BIG SALE. Cosmetics, perfume, lingerie, shape-wear, and 
           shoes, womanhood is offered up as a construct and a commodity 
           to covet, tailor, buy, discard, and repeat. This effulgence 
           of femininity features the whimsical and the gratuitous, the 
           gorgeous and the grotesque, the lovely and the lurid. 

           The main doors open into Cosmetics. Enter FRAN (42, white, 
           trans, east coast, a casual frock, big sunglasses, bangles, 
           and a shawl) with an impish grin and a bounce in her step. 
           Fran loves all the shiny things and looks ready to shop.

           A moment later, enter ALTHEA (32, black, trans, west coast, 
           nice jeans, vintage concert tee and a woolly thrift store 
           cardigan) who finds all this indulgent, capitalist frippery 
           somewhat distasteful. Althea is a serious woman. 

           They make eye contact and share a look that says, "Are we 
           really doing this? Yep, we're doing this." Fran heads off.

           Althea enters maternity wear. A glowing pregnant woman beams 
           while trying on a cute dress. Althea feels a PANG of loss, 
           and unconsciously touches her own belly that will never be 
           with child. She feels it, shrugs it off, and heads upstairs.

           INT. WOMEN'S WEAR - DAY

           Fran rifles through racks of dresses looking for something. 
           She's about to give up when a CLERK approaches from behind.

                                 CLERK
                        Can I help you find something?

           Startled, Fran's voice resonates deeper than she would like.

                                 FRAN
                        Huhm? No.

           Fran clears a frog in her throat and draws her posture up.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                            (her usual femme voice)
                        Pardon me. No. Thank you.

                                 CLERK
                        Oh. Well it seems as though you're 
                        looking for something particular.

                                 FRAN
                            (sardonic)
                        Aren't we all, honey?
           The miffed clerk leaves her be. Fran gives up the search. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS LAVATORY - DAY

           Althea enters a stall, takes a wrench from her bag, crouches 
           down, disconnects the toilet's water supply, then uses the 
           wrench to crush the threads so it can't be reconnected.

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Fran considers two similar shades of lipstick. Althea enters.

                                 ALTHEA
                        What are you doing? Where is the 
                        dress?

                                 FRAN
                        Don't know, I looked everywhere. 
                            (twists one tube up)
                        What do you think of this color?

                                 ALTHEA
                        Ugh. I bet you could wear lipstick 
                        every day for the rest of your life 
                        and you wouldn't use up the stuff 
                        you already own.  

                                 FRAN
                        You suck the fun out of everything, 
                        don't ya? A fun vampire, you are.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We're not here for fun, girl.
                            (checks the time)
                        Think anyone recognized you?

                                 FRAN
                        Nah. This dye job is working for 
                        me, right? That's why I need new 
                        lipstick. My whole palette is-
                            (something catches her 
                            eye)
                        Oohwp! -- here we go.

           Across the floor, the UPS GUY AKA GARY (36, muscly and cute) 
           wheels a dolly with several big cartons. Althea gives him 
           terse nod. Fran gives a comical wink. They trail him-

                                 ALTHEA
                        I wish you'd found that damn dress.

           -through women's wear, past the changing rooms to a corridor.
                                 FRAN
                        You wish I found it? I'm the one's 
                        supposed to get married in it.

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           The UPS GUY stacks four cartons outside the ladies room. 
           Althea and Fran arrive right on time to sign for them.

                                 UPS GUY
                        Are you guys sure about this?

                                 FRAN
                            (with humorous faux angst)
                        Can anybody really be sure about 
                        anything in this madhouse world?

                                 ALTHEA
                            (ignoring Fran's schtick)
                        We'll be fine, Gary. 

           UPS GUY AKA GARY really wants hugs but resists the urge. He 
           squeezes Fran's hand, and locks eyes with her.

                                 UPS GUY
                        Good luck. And be careful, please!

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           The main downstairs ladies room is spacious and plush. They 
           check the stalls, all clear. There's a gilt framed vanity, 
           fresh flowers, old gas-light sconces, damask wall paper.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Let's get to work.

           They bring in the cartons and crack them open.

                                 FRAN
                        Work? This is fun!

           Althea, vampire-like, raises an imaginary cowl to her face.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (Dracula-style)
                        Gwah - ah ah ah!

           Fran's face says Althea's 'The Count' schtick isn't all that.

                                 FRAN
                        Nuh-uh.
           Fran uses a drill to install a deadbolt on the inside of the 
           door. Althea lays out neatly bundled, color-coded cords, a 
           laptop, a video camera, some spot lamps.

           Someone tries to enter. Fran pushes back and locks the door.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, occupied. 

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           MADISON (25, basic, white) is bored by her friend testing 
           highlighters. The BIG SALE is going well; the place is busy.

                                 MADISON
                        I'm gonna go to the lav, OK?

           Her friend doesn't bother to acknowledge her, whatever.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea inspects two handguns, and handles them like a pro. 
           She slides in a clip, CLACK. Fran looks over at the guns, and 
           is clearly apprehensive about their presence.

                                 ALTHEA
                        You knew that the plan meant-

                                 FRAN
                            (cuts her off)
                        Well... I don't frikkin' like it, 
                        OK? Dr King never used a .38.

                                 ALTHEA
                        This is Portland, Oregon in 2020, 
                        not Selma in '65. Open carry is 
                        legal, and we've got permits. And 
                        they're .45s, by the way, not .38s. 

           Fran gives her the Marge Simpson, "hrrm".

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        It's a prop, OK? Just don't put 
                        your finger on the trigger. Ever.
                            (calm, focused)
                        No one is getting shot, I swear.

           Fran plugs in an electric kettle, boils water, and sets out 
           mugs for tea. Althea sets out four fancy camping chairs.
           INT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           Madison, completely engrossed in her phone, somehow gets 
           through women's wear and down the corridor to the restroom 
           without bumping into anything or anyone.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           The trap is set. Supplies are laid out and organized; 
           rations, water bottles. A video camera is on a tripod which, 
           as seen on the laptop monitor, captures the large mirror and 
           everything happening in the room.

           Fran is seated in the center of the room. Althea is by the 
           door. Someone JOSTLES the knob to enter, but finds it locked.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (to the knocker)
                        Just a minute, please!
                            (to Fran)
                        Are you ready?

           Fran checks her face and hair on the monitor. 

                                 FRAN
                            (maudlin, in jest)
                        Is anyone really ever ready for 
                        anything?

                                 ALTHEA
                            (almost rises to 'curt')
                        Enough of that. It's not funny.

           Fran gives her a great vampire HISS of revulsion. 

           Althea half unlocks the door, sees that Fran left her gun on 
           the counter, grabs it and hands it to her. MORE KNOCKING.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                            (intense, combat ready)
                        Franny, this shit is real. Don't 
                        you play now.

                                 FRAN
                        Blech. Fine, Althea. Wait, eww, you 
                        got somethin' -- in your teeth.

           Althea opens the door. Madison enters, and Althea picks at 
           her gum-line. Madison, rapt in her phone, is oblivious to the 
           presence of firearms. Fran points to an incisor.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Nope.
           Madison just keeps on texting, head down. Althea picks at her 
           teeth. Althea shows her teeth to Fran, "Did I get it?" Fran 
           points to her other incisor. Althea gets the tooth debris.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Althea, thumb up)
                        You got it.
                            (then addressing Madison)
                        Ah-HEM.

           Madison finally looks up from her phone, and sees guns.

                                 MADISON
                            (mildly perturbed)
                        Ugh. Is this like, an active 
                        shooter thing? I can't even.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (soothing, pleasant)
                        This is an inactive shooter thing. 
                        Be chill. Do what we ask, which is 
                        just sit there for a while, and 
                        it'll stay inactive. Easy enough?

           Madison has no visible reaction, blank-faced blinking.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        OK?

                                 MADISON
                        Sure. I guess.
                            (beat)
                        Can I pee?

                                 ALTHEA
                        Of course, just hand over your 
                        phone. Please.

           Turning over the phone upsets her far more than the guns did.

           INT. WOMEN'S WEAR - DAY

           CANDACE (42, white, country-bougie, a default sneer on her 
           face) rifles through socks and then gets mad not finding 
           exactly what she wants. Uh-oh. Her hand goes to her belly and 
           a sudden abdominal disturbance sends her toward the restroom.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           CANDACE enters and is greeted by guns. Fran sits. Althea is 
           at the door. Candace jumps, goes white, and clutches her bag.
                                 CANDACE
                            (frightened)
                        Are you all for real? What is this?

                                 FRAN
                        Hi! Oh my goodness, sorry. You OK, 
                        honey? We're not going to hurt ya.

           Althea locks the door. Candace looks ill. With a hand on her 
           belly, she blows past Fran, and goes straight in to a stall.

                                 CANDACE
                        I just got my damned... You mind?

           INT. A STALL - DAY

           Candace settles in on the potty; she's got nasty cramps.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                            (stern)
                        Ma'am, you need to pass me your bag 
                        and your phone, right now.

           Candace fumbles her phone from her purse and it hits the 
           floor. She kicks it along the ground, and Althea grabs it.

                                 CANDACE
                            (nervous, thinking)
                        OK, OK, I'm sorry, I just need...
                            (rooting in her bag)
                        Christ Almighty, I... I need a pad.

           She carefully removes a loaded .38 and a pad from her purse.

                                 ALTHEA
                        OK. We're not going to hurt you.

           Candace pushes her bag out under the stall door with a foot.

                                 CANDACE
                        I just need a minute.

           She puts a finger on the trigger and contemplates going out 
           there, guns-a-blazing. She comes to her senses, but then sees 
           she has a gun in her hand and nowhere to put it.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea shows Candace's phone and social media feed to Fran 
           who snickers. Fran then shows Althea a meme from Madison's 
           feed. Althea shrugs, "I don't get it".
           INT. A STALL - DAY

           Candace buttons up and flushes, then uses the sound as cover 
           to wedge the gun between the toilet tank and the wall.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Candace exits the stall. Fran gestures with her gun, inviting 
           Candace to sit in the open chair, next to Madison.

                                 CANDACE
                        What is this shit? You can't hold 
                        me here against my will. I've got-

           Althea holds the barrel of her gun to her lips, "shhhh."

                                 FRAN
                        I'm sure you got lives to get back 
                        to, families, jobs and all that. 
                        We're sorry for the disruption. We 
                        don't wanna hurt... anybody. 
                            (pause, then to Althea)
                        I had this whole thing, like 
                        memorized. Now my mind's all blank.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Hey. We've got plenty of time.

           Fran points to the camera and monitor.

                                 FRAN

                        and our version. Just this tape.

                                 MADISON
                        Yah, but like what is happening? I 
                        mean, why are we here?

                        I'm ready to scream my head off. 
                        You can't do this.

           Fran and Althea resume scrolling on their guests' phones.

                                 MADISON
                        You can't. That's private property.

                        who's who. It's totally rude; we're 
                        sorry. One of you is leaving in a

                        Hmpf. Guest? More like a hostage.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We'll call it hostage, if you like.
                        My name is Althea. This is Fran.

                        My Mother passed. 'bout a year ago.

                        I cry all the time. Like a lot. 
                        Last night, my friend posted this-

                            (hand up to stop her)
                        OK OK. If you could go to another 
                        planet on a luxury spaceship but 
                        never return to Earth, would you?
                                 MADISON
                            (blank stare)
                        I dunno. Like, luxury is good, but 
                        a spaceship? Maybe, I guess; as 
                        long as I can bring my dog.

           They all look to Candace for her answer to the same question.

                                 CANDACE
                        Why do I need to go space? You two 
                        might as well be aliens. I know 
                        what you are! You don't fool me. 

                                 ALTHEA
                            (amused, indifferent)
                        And what's that? That we are, 
                        according to you? Hmm?

           Candace's lips contort, holding back invective.

                                 CANDACE
                        I'll answer your first question.
                            (relents, deflects)
                        Why would I go to another planet 
                        when I never seen Paris, or New 
                        York even? Stupid questions.

           Fran and Althea share a look and know what the other is 
           thinking. KNOCK KNOCK goes the door.

           Candace knows exactly who she would kill right now. KNOCKING.

           Althea eyes Candace, and holds her spiteful gaze for a sec.

                        see for himself. Then you can go.

           A child WHINES at the door. Candace is unhappy to find she's 
           the one staying put. Fran returns Madison's phone and bag.

           Althea unlocks the door. ANGRY DAD pushes against it and 
           Althea uses her body to block him.

                                 ANGRY DAD (O.S.)

                        can't come in right now.

           Fran bolts the door.

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - DAY

           A rack of suits, a musty old couch, and teetering stacks of 
           document storage boxes surround a messy desk. In the midst of 
           this, frets Mike (52, white, fussy, frazzled, well dressed 
           but already rumpled) who pores over sales figures.

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Mike?

           SUSAN (58, hair up, elegant, sensible, tidy and together) 
           KNOCKS, and enters without waiting for a reply. She knows 
           this should be her office and her job, but she rolls her eyes 
           and plays the part of assistant manager.
                                 MIKE
                            (doesn't look up)
                        Susan, did we get those mannequins 
                        done last night? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes. They look great. Mike--

                                 MIKE
                        This sale needs to be huge, Susan. 
                        This quarter's been awful. There's 
                        talk of more store closings, and 
                        we're not going to be one.

           He polishes off his umpteenth coffee, dribbling on his chin.

                                 SUSAN
                        Mike, this young lady needs a word.

           Madison waves meekly from the door. Mike's irritated, 
           confused, and then welcoming in a matter of seconds.

           INT. NORDSTROM'S-STOREROOM AREA - DAY

           Mike walks briskly past racks of clothes, dusty cartons, and 
           partially limbed mannequins. Madison and Susan keep up.

                                 MIKE
                        Can't you just tell me what it is?

                                 MADISON
                        She said, you'll just have to see.

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Mike stops the procession at a fixture, and rotates each 
           bottle so they all face label out, in the same direction.

                                 MIKE
                        Ugh. Come on, Euphrazia.

           Employee EUSTACIA BELLOWS (26, tattooed, with her punk-chic 
           style buttoned up and tidy for this bougie-bullshit job) is 
           hungover or maybe presently under the influence. She looks up 
           from her phone, and dispassionately watches Mike fuss.

                                 EUSTACIA
                        It's 'u-stay-zya'. 
                                 MIKE
                        I know you don't give a fuck, but! 
                        if you can make it look like you 
                        give a fuck, then I don't give a 
                        fuck that you don't give a fuck. 
                        See? How much easier could this be?

           He continues his march toward the restroom, Madison follows. 
           Susan hangs on a moment. Eustacia watches him go.

                                 SUSAN
                        Eustacia, I'm sorry, there's no 
                        need for that language.

           Eustacia gets her coat and bag. She looks a little nauseous.

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (blase and detached)
                        Whatever.  I don't need this shit. 
                        Fuck that guy and fuck this place. 
                        Susan, you're a peach, but I quit.

           Eustacia walks off. Susan watches her, moves to speak but 
           doesn't. She disappoints herself, then follows after Mike.

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Several women are waiting and irritable. Mike is confused, he 
           pushes, but the door won't swing for him.

                                 MIKE
                            (alarmed, to Susan)
                        There's no lock on this door?

                                 SUSAN
                        There wasn't one an hour ago.

           Two patrons drop armfuls of stuff and walk off.

                                 PATRON
                        I really gotta go. The coffee shop 
                        next door is always clean. Come on.

           Mike is traumatized to see sales walk away, but is more 
           stumped by a door he can't push open.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Fran has an ear to the door.
                                 MADISON (O.S.)
                            (gently RAPPING the door)
                        Hi guys. Here's Mike, he's the 
                        manager, OK? I'm sorry.
                            (unsure why she is sorry)
                        Good luck?

                                 FRAN
                        Thank you.

           Fran unlocks the door, Althea's chair is positioned so that 
           she faces the crack. Her weapon leveled at Mike, who calls 
           out to the departing patrons to save the sale.

                                 MIKE
                        Ladies, there is another restroom 
                        upstairs. Please...

                                 FRAN
                        Hey, Mikey! Get yer buns in here.

           He pauses, sees the gun, but does not accept it as real.

                                 MIKE
                        Whatever this-
                            (looks around the room)
                        - this little, camp out or whatever 
                        is, it's over. Take your pop guns 
                        and go home, or I call the cops.

           He heads after the patrons. Althea cocks her gun. He freezes.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Do you remember us?

                                 MIKE
                            (studying the girls)
                        Yes, I remember you two.

           Althea waves him in. Fran locks the door, leaving Susan out.

                                 FRAN
                        Then you can imagine why we might 
                        go to all this trouble?

           Mike knows why they're mad, but keeps his mouth shut.

           He notices Candace for the first time. She is seated 
           comfortably, drinking a cup of tea in the corner.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait, who are you?
                                 CANDACE
                        Me? I'm the hostage, dummy. Now ask 
                        these nice-
                            (finding the nomenclature, 
                            then patronizing)
                        -girls what they want, give it to 
                        'em, and get me outta here.

           Mike struggles to wrap his head around all this.

                                 MIKE
                        OK I'll bite. Let's pretend those 
                        guns are real. What do you want?

                                 ALTHEA
                        First, you apologize, to us.

                                 MIKE
                            (phony obsequious)
                        I am very sorry. You were treated- 
                            (searches)
                        -poorly by this establishment, but 
                        the awkward circumstances--

                                 FRAN
                        Wow. You apologize poorly too.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We would like a written apology, 
                        500 word minimum.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you crazy?

           Fran and Althea just look at him, and he just looks back.

                                 CANDACE
                            (had enough of the 
                            silence)
                        Look around. They got tea, snacks, 
                        and moisturizer enough to last a 
                        month in here. Yeah, they're crazy.

           Mike looks around the room for answers, finds none.

                                 MIKE
                            (turns to leave)
                        Very well.

                                 FRAN
                        Ah, ah, ah. I want my dress, too.

                                 MIKE
                        What?
                                 FRAN
                        I was trying on a dress. Cream 
                        colored, with a lace brocade. 
                        Ruched in the hips, size 10.

           Mike looks to Althea, "seriously?". She nods, affirmative.

                                 MIKE
                        How am I to find this one dress? 

                                 FRAN
                        We'll give you plenty of time, 
                        Candace here may not like it 
                        though. Also, remember that mean 
                        ol' biddy, who made a big stink?

                                 MIKE
                        That "biddy" was Helen Beaumont.

           He waits for a reaction to her name that he does not get.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        She owns half of this town.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We don't care what she owns, she 
                        needs to come down here and talk.

                                 MIKE
                        You want me to call Helen Beaumont? 
                        And tell her to come here? To the 
                        bathroom? And talk to you?

                                 ALTHEA
                        You've got your work cut out.

                                 MIKE
                        When the cops come in here, you're 
                        going to be in big trouble. You, 
                        you and your little fake cap guns.

                                 CANDACE
                        Mister. I seen my share of guns, 
                        they're real alright.

                                 MIKE
                        And how do I know you're not in on 
                        this whole thing too?

           Fran unlocks the door. Susan almost falls in, having had her 
           ear to it. Fran graciously reaches to break Susan's fall with 
           her unarmed hand. Susan gets her balance-
                                 SUSAN
                        Thanks.

           -and then the tense dynamic reasserts itself.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (all business, gun level)
                        All three requests. Got it? 

           Mike backs out of the room. The door is locked behind him.

                                 CANDACE
                        Y'all don't really not know who 
                        Helen Beaumont is, do you?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. UPSTAIRS LAVATORY - DAY

           Mike is crammed in on the floor studying Althea's handiwork. 
           The HANDYMAN chews gum and looks on.

                                 MIKE
                        This is vandalism.

                                 HANDYMAN
                        It's an easy enough fix; it'll just 
                        take a while to go get parts.

                                 MIKE
                        Why are you here then? Go. GO!

           The handyman heads off. Susan looks at Mike expectantly, as 
           he stands and brushes toilet floor cooties off his suit.

           He catches a whiff of an un-flushed mess in the toilet.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Why is there no lid on this?

                                 SUSAN
                        Can we just call the cops now?

                                 MIKE
                        Those guns aren't real. They're 
                        bluffing.

                                 SUSAN
                        Mike, have you lost your mind?

                                 MIKE
                        Susan, if we call the cops, the 
                        store will be cleared out.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        We need these sales numbers or 
                        corporate's gonna close this store.

                                 SUSAN
                        And what if someone gets shot? 
                        That's pretty bad for business, no?

                                 MIKE
                            (pooh poohs her)
                        Don't be ridiculous. No one's 
                        getting shot. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I just think we should-

                                 MIKE
                            (cut's her off)
                        They made me the manager, which 
                        means I'm making the decisions, ok? 
                        You want to be shift-lead working 
                        the swing at Big Box? 
                            (no reply)
                        Me neither. Follow my lead, and 
                        this'll be over before you know it.

           Susan holds her tongue. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        We're gonna need this toilet fixed 
                        for the sale, or to flush our jobs. 
                        Now, run and get me some of those 
                        out of order and wet floor signs.

           INT. LADIES ROOM -DAY

           Althea fixes herself another tea. KNOCK KNOCK

                                 FRAN
                        Occupied. Sorry.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        It's me.

           They ready weapons; Althea takes the chair. Fran unlocks the 
           door. Mike enters, humble now. Fran locks up behind him.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I do not appreciate what you did to 
                        my restroom upstairs - but I am 
                        willing to forget this whole thing.
                                 ALTHEA
                        You do not seem to appreciate the 
                        gravity of this situation.

                                 FRAN
                        Yeah. You're hopping around like 
                        it's the moon but it's more like 
                        Jupiter up in here.

           Mike looks about confused, "what is she talking about?"

                                 CANDACE
                            (rolls eyes)
                        There ain't no gravity on the moon, 
                        but on Jupiter it'd crush you.

           Mike still doesn't get it, scratches his head.

                                 FRAN
                        Forget it. You find my dress yet? 

                                 MIKE
                        Look, you hand over the toys, I'll 
                        get you a 500 dollar gift card.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Sir, you don't seem to get it-

           Mike brandishes his phone like it's a weapon. 

                                 MIKE
                        No, you're the ones who're gonna 
                        get it, when I call the cops.

                                 FRAN
                        Oh, dear. Please, just call the 
                        damned cops already. Maybe they can 
                        help you write your apology.

           He obviously doesn't want the police involved. KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 MIKE
                            (snarls)
                        It's fucking occupied alright!

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Mike, it's me.

                                 MIKE
                            (takes a breath)
                        Did you find that dress yet?
                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        No. If it's what I think it is, the 
                        computer says we have one in stock 
                        but I can't find it anywhere.

           Althea looks to Fran. They're stumped too.

                                 FRAN
                        There was this sassy, sort of 
                        snarky kid with neck tattoos 
                        helping me. Maybe she knows?

                                 MIKE
                        Ugh, of course. Susan, would you 
                        run and get Eustacia down here?

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                            (a beat, then)
                        Mike, she just walked off. Quit.

           Mike's dismay creates an awkward silence.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Mike?
                            (no reply)
                        Mike, I'm calling the police.

           Mike turns a hateful gaze on Fran.

                                 MIKE
                        You don't need to do that Susan 
                        because these bitches are-

                                 FRAN
                        Bitches? Well, you're finally 
                        gendering us correctly. Shoulda 
                        tried that the first time. 

           Mike steps toward Fran with his fists clenched at his side.

                                 MIKE
                        --these bitches are going to give 
                        up their silly, little game, hand 
                        over their toys, take a gift card 
                        and get the hell out of my store.

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Mike, come out, please. Just let 
                        the police handle this.

                                 FRAN
                        You are thick. Listen to the woman.

           He extends a hand, expecting Fran to hand him her weapon.
                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        That is not how this goes.

           Candace tries to get small, and skootches away from them.

                                 MIKE
                            (in Fran's face now)
                        Oh yeah? Let's see your little toy.

           CLICK, Althea draws the hammer back with Mike in her sights. 
           He closes his eyes, and crosses his arms to say 'go ahead'.

           Fran doesn't like this. Althea looks from Fran to Mike, then 
           moves her weapon slightly, and before Fran can say anything-

           BAM! Althea doesn't bat an eye, and shoots a toilet from her 
           seat, legs crossed, still sipping tea with her other hand.

           Candace falls from her chair, blood running down her face.

                                 CANDACE
                        You... You shot me! God Almighty!

           Fran screams. Althea is horrified, and looks at her gun.

           Mike hits the ground and curls up in a fetal position. 

                                 MIKE
                            (loudly whimpering)
                        Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

           Candace clutches her face, blood oozes from between her 
           fingers. Fran rushes to help her, but gets swatted away. 

                                 CANDACE
                        Get the fuck off of me!

           The noise still reverberates in the small room, ears ring. 

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Mike?! Oh my God! What happened? Is 
                        everyone OK? 

           Althea grabs the first aid kit, and kneels by Candace.

                                 CANDACE
                            (her resistance fading)
                        I said fuck off, bitch.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Don't be a fool. You need medical 
                        attention. Let me see.
           Althea inspects Candace's wound, and places gauze on it. She 
           picks up a bloody shard of porcelain, and figures it out.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        It was just this chunk of the 
                        toilet. I am sorry, I didn't think 
                        it would...

           Fran is livid, fingering her ringing ears.

                                 FRAN
                            (loudly)
                        You're an asshole. And a liar.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (gently helps Candace sit)
                        Here, hold this, and apply a little 
                        pressure. We'll get you fixed up, 
                        in a moment, OK? I am so, so sorry.

           Althea walks over to Mike, still on the floor.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        Hey.
                            (no response)
                        Hey, you.
                            (nudges him with a foot)
                        I killed eleven people on tour in 
                        Iraq. This is serious. You feel me? 

           Mike's eyes blink open. He un-clenches from the fetal pose.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        Use your words.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes. Yes. Mother Mary and...

                                 ALTHEA
                        Don't you blaspheme, now.
                        Stand up.

           Mike gets up, humiliated, and trying to cover up that he peed 
           a little. He composes himself, fixing his tie and hair.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        You remember your to-do list, now? 
                        Apologize, find that dress and get 
                        the Beaumont woman down here.

           The door opens, Susan sees a bloodied Candace and gasps.
                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        It's just a bad scratch.
                        Ma'am, did you get all that?

                                 SUSAN
                            (slightly dazed, but 
                            alert)
                        Apology, dress, Beaumont,yes. The 
                        police are on their way. 

                                 ALTHEA
                        Thank goodness. It's about time.

                                 SUSAN
                            (sincerely)
                        I - I'm sorry.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Me too. Me too.

           Mike exits, tail between his leg, and the door is locked. 

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           A squad car pulls up and parks in the red zone. OFFICER 
           MELODY VASQUEZ (32, latinx, uniformed, fit) emerges. 

           She casually looks all around the building; everything seems 
           normal. She heads up the stairs to the main entrance.

           INT. COSMETICS - DAY 

           Vasquez waits, all this girlie-girl stuff amuses her.

           Susan and Mike approach. Mike has gathered himself, but is 
           still a bit frazzled. Susan is composed.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Hello, I'm Officer Vasquez.

           Vasquez addresses Susan, till Mike throws himself in between.

                                 MIKE
                        Mike Strauss. Store manager.

                                 SUSAN
                        Susan Lowell. Assistant manager.
                                 VASQUEZ
                        So, what exactly is the nature of 
                        your disturbance? Someone won't 
                        leave the toilet?

           Vasquez sees signs pointing to the ladies room and is set to 
           head that way. Mike looks nervous, and heads to his office. 

                                 MIKE
                        We don't want to disturb all these 
                        nice people, do we?

           Vasquez, skeptical, looks to Susan, who grits her teeth and 
           abides. They follow Mike to the storage area, and the office.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea finishing the final stitch on Candace's brow. 

                                 ALTHEA
                        I can't tell you how sorry I am.

           Candace winces watching Althea work in the mirror.

                                 CANDACE
                        I'm gonna be disfigured.

                                 FRAN
                        C'mon. I got bit by a dog once, 
                        right here, huge gash --
                            (indicates arm)
                        no stitches.

                                 CANDACE
                        I don't see nothing.

                                 FRAN
                        Exactly! Neosporin, works miracles.

           Candace is unimpressed. Althea stops and pulls up her pant 
           leg, to reveal a very long scar that is almost invisible.

                                 ALTHEA
                        See that?
                            (Candace nods)
                        I sewed that up myself in Iraq. 64 
                        stitches. Shrapnel ripped it right 
                        open. You can barely see it. This? 
                        Tis but a scratch. It'll give you a 
                        great story to tell one day.

           Candace grimaces, and clenches her teeth.
                                 CANDACE
                        The time two drag queens kidnapped 
                        me in the john. Great story.

           Althea patiently gives her a "now, now", finger wag.

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - DAY

           Mike at his desk, Susan stands aside, and Vasquez is seated.

                                 MIKE
                        And now they won't leave.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        And what triggered all this?

                                 MIKE
                        A few weeks ago, there was a... 
                        incident.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        What did they do?

                                 MIKE
                        What did they do? Nothing.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Nothing? Really?

           Mike hems and haws. Vasquez gestures, "and?"

                                 SUSAN
                            (has had enough)
                        They're trans, and Mike threw them 
                        out when someone complained about 
                        their presence in the women's room.

           Vasquez looks at Mike with disgust; Mike is squirrely.

                                 MIKE
                        Susan, that's not exactly-

                                 SUSAN
                        Well that's the gist of it. And now 
                        they've shot one of our toilets. It 
                        was like a warning shot.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Sir, when were you going to share 
                        this important detail?
                                 MIKE
                        We are having a very important 
                        sale. The store is very crowded, if 
                        people were to panic...

           Vasquez looks to Susan, "is this guy for real?". Susan almost 
           curtsies in apology for having abided Mike's way till now.

                                 VASQUEZ
                            (to Susan)
                        When did this happen?

           Vasquez walks out -

           INT. NORDTROM'S-STOREROOM AREA - DAY

           - Susan and Mike follow. Vasquez moves quickly.

                                 SUSAN
                        15, 20 minutes ago?

                                 MIKE
                        Um, this is not, uh, I don't think- 

           Vasquez, stops, pivots, glares at Mike, thumbs her radio.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        This is unit 372.

           No reply, just the hum of STATIC.

                                 SUSAN
                            (interjects)
                        I'm sorry. If I may.
                            (Vasquez is listening)
                        These women, they seem very 
                        reasonable. I know how that sounds, 
                        but maybe you could talk to them 
                        and end this before it turns into 
                        an episode of SWAT.

                                 DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                        Unit 372, go ahead.

           Vasquez hesitates, then against her better judgement-

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Stand by, dispatch.

           She starts walking again, not sure if this is a good idea.
           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           An OUT OF ORDER sign and WET FLOOR pylon stand guard. Vasquez 
           is dismayed by that as she enters with Susan and Mike.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Fran looks at her phone. Candace thumbs through magazines, 
           and Althea writes on her laptop. KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 VASQUEZ (O.S.)
                        Officer Melody Vasquez, Portland 
                        PD. Can we talk a minute?

           Everybody freezes.

                         ALTHEA
                                                       FRAN
           We hear you.
                                           We're listening.

                                 VASQUEZ (O.S.)
                        It's just me here. I'll leave my 
                        weapon outside. I heard some one 
                        got a boo boo, and I just want to 
                        check on you all. 

           Fran and Althea silently hem and haw.

                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        I promise, nothing stupid, OK?

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           A beat, Vasquez shrugs "I tried", and thumbs the radio. CHONK 
           goes the deadbolt and the door is and opened. 

           Vasquez slowly sets her gun down before entering, hands up.

                                 ALTHEA
                        And the taser. And the body cam.

           Vasquez obliges.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Vasquez takes in the whole set up, and is impressed.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Ma'am. Are you OK?
                                 CANDACE
                        Have to give credit where it's due. 
                        That... 
                            (indicates Althea)
                        ...one fixed me up good.

                                 VASQUEZ
                            (to Althea and Fran)
                        The manager isn't denying that you 
                        were done wrong here, and it sounds 
                        like they have some amends to make.
                            (indicates toilet)
                        But you all discharged a firearm. 
                        That's a big deal, and it means 
                        that I could get in some trouble 
                        for having not called that in.

                                 ALTHEA
                        So then, why exactly are you here?

                                 VASQUEZ
                        I thought, maybe, you would like a 
                        chance to rethink this thing.

           Vasquez looks for enthusiasm for this idea. She finds none.

                        We can walk out of here now and 
                        avoid some serious charges, but if 
                        you're going to persist...

                                 ALTHEA
                        That's kind of you, but we made 
                        three demands, and none's been met. 

                                 VASQUEZ
                        See, it's language like that, 
                        demands. Brings to mind some 
                        serious charges. Federal charges.

                        Our civil rights were violated. It 
                        was this or a lawsuit, and who's 
                        got the money or time for that?

           Vasquez looks at how deep they're dug in, literally.

                        Look. I've been a cop for ten 
                        years, and I am as gay as the day 
                        is long. You know what that's like? 
                        It ain't as bad as it used to be, 
                        but still, it ain't good.

                        We appreciate you trying, we do. 
                        But if you've gotta get the SWAT 
                        and shut this store down, to make 
                        that guy put a pen to paper, and 
                        write an apology, so be it.

           Fran nods, even though she's queasy at the thought of SWAT.

                        on her head. Whaddaya say?

           Candace's hopes rise until Althea shakes her head, "no".

                        OK. But the next cops aren't going 
                        to be queer and sweet like me.

                        and I'm going to need it.

           Vasquez looks at Fran like she's nuts. Fran gives her kooky 
           eyes to play it up, and conceal her own unease.

                        I am sorry, but we need to close 
                        the store. It's an emergency.

           Merchandise is dropped and trampled. Mike's heart breaks.

           SERGEANT ACRES (M, 52, crew cut, square jaw, all business)

                                 FRAN
                        Ew. That's a verb, not a noun.
           Candace looks at them, thinking, "What in God's name?"

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - DAY

           Mike, at his desk, stares at a blank word document. Acres is 
           texting. Susan is waiting for Mike to start typing.

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you regret how you handled 
                        things that day?

                                 MIKE
                            (sullen)
                        I was just doing my job.

                                 SUSAN
                        No. Your job was to tell that busy 
                        body to take a chill pill, and let 
                        those poor women use the bathroom 
                        in peace.

                                 MIKE
                            (aggrieved)
                        That's not fair. Helen Beaumont is 
                        a philanthropist and she has 
                        given... Do you know how much she 
                        spent on Christmas gifts for her 
                        staff here last year?

                                 SUSAN
                        There are things more important 
                        than sales and a commission, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Without sales, there's no store, 
                        Susan. She's bought a-lot more than 
                        one measly dress here.

                                 SUSAN
                            (gobsmacked, gives up)
                        You know what? I gotta pee.

                                 MIKE
                        Where you gonna go?

                                 SUSAN
                        That's a great question!

           Susan exits, Acres sees her go and looks up from his phone.

                                 ACRES
                            (to Mike)
                        You finish writing that apology?
           Mike looks from Acres to the blank screen, to his hands that 
           won't come up with words, and back at Acres.

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Vasquez is impatient, irritable. Cop 1 plays Candy Crush.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Hey. I gotta go.

                                 COP 1
                        Where?

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Like, I gotta go, to the bathroom.

           Cop 1 looks at the door, like, you're already here.

                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        I need to actually use a toilet.

                                 COP 1
                        Oh. Where are you gonna go?

           She shrugs, "I dunno", and walks off.

                        What do I tell Acres?

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Tell him I had to go.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea knits. Fran does a crossword. Candace studies them, 
           repelled yet curious, then decides to pray.

                                 CANDACE
                            (murmuring)
                        Lord, forgive these... people and 
                        grant us safe passage through this-

           They notice her praying and watch respectfully.

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        - and please give these here first 
                        responders your guidance in this 
                        harrowing ordeal.

           Her mumbling goes low, she crosses herself, looks to the sky.
                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        Amen

           She sees that Fran and Althea had been looking at her.

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                            (defensive)
                        You think I'm a rube, for praying.

                                 ALTHEA
                        I watched friends bleed out in 
                        Iraq, prayer doesn't make you a 
                        rube. You don't need to pray for 
                        me. I keep council with my own God. 

           Candace is clearly skeptical of Althea's god.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        Your misinterpretation of the bible 
                        doesn't mean I’m going to hell.

                                 CANDACE
                        The Lord'll decide who's goin' to 
                        hell, but he's there for you even. 
                        If you're ready to repent. I pray 
                        for all sinners, myself included.

           Candace is a little uncomfortable, physically.

                                 ALTHEA
                        If I'm going to hell, it's for sins 
                        I did in 'service' to this country. 
                        Not this -- thing, or this.

           Althea gestures around the room indicating the "situation", 
           and at her own body, implying her transness.

                                 CANDACE
                            (sort of patronizing)
                        I thank you for your service.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (snorts in derision)
                        You'd have given up your seat on a 
                        plane for me if you'd seen me in 
                        uniform ten years ago.

           Candace has a full on hot flash. She's sweaty and red.

                                 CANDACE
                            (fanning herself)
                        Oof. I need some air.

           Fran looks at the vent up in the ceiling.
                                 FRAN
                        Can't help you there, but feel free 
                        to splash some water on your face.

           She goes to the sink and runs cold water to cool herself.

                                 CANDACE
                        Goddamn menopause.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           Some cops relax and mill about by their vehicles. Vasquez 
           exits and heads to the coffee shop next door.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Vasquez finds Susan in line for the toilet, on her phone.

                                 SUSAN
                        It's just bonkers. I can't believe 
                        the news isn't here.
                            (she sees Vasquez)
                        Oh, I gotta go. It's fine, I'm 
                        gonna stick around for a while.
                            (beat)
                        OK. Love you too.
                            (to Vasquez)
                        Hi, I just wanted to say thank you 
                        for your patience back there.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Of course, this is a pretty unusual 
                        situation. 

           The door opens, and it's Susan's turn.

                                 SUSAN
                        Sure. Let me buy you a coffee. OK?

           Vasquez nods affirmative, and Susan enters the restroom.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Vasquez and Susan exit, drinks in hand. They stop to talk.

                                 SUSAN
                        Again, I'm so sorry, I should have 
                        just ignored him, and just told you 
                        there was a shot fired.
                                 VASQUEZ
                        You're fine.

                                 SUSAN
                        Well, I'm mad at myself, I guess. 

           They start to walk slowly toward the store.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Can you tell me about this girl 
                        with the tattoos? Is it possible 
                        she knows where this dress is?

                                 SUSAN
                        Hmm? Oh, Eustacia Bellows. She was 
                        here about eight months. Hard to 
                        put a finger on what made her tick. 
                        Sweet, but she had an edge alright.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        And she quit? Just this morning?

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah, well Mike rubbed her the 
                        wrong way.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Sounds like he rubs a lot of people 
                        the wrong way.

                                 SUSAN
                        Ugh. You don't know the half of it.

           Vasquez raises an eyebrow. They stop for a moment -

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Wait, he does not literally rub 
                        people. He's just -- off-putting.

           -then carry on.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Do you know how to find Eustacia?

                                 SUSAN
                        I didn't know her that well, but I 
                        imagine that she is probably not 
                        fond of the police.

           Susan starts scrolling through her phone.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Yeah? What makes you say that?
                                 SUSAN
                        I dunno. Call it a hunch.

                        I know I shouldn't, and if anyone 
                        asks, I didn't.

                        Maybe I should come. Maybe she'll 
                        react better to a friendly face?

                        Jeez, that stall is huge. I bet I

                            (exasperated and loud)
                        Are you serious? It's occupied!

                                 ACRES
                        Ladies. It's me, Sergeant Acres. I 
                        have someone here who has something 
                        he would like to say.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea waves Fran over to the door. Candace swallows her 
           retort to Fran and shuffles her chair closer so she can hear. 

                                 FRAN
                            (hushed)
                        This oughta be good.

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Mike steps up. Acres waves him on, as they've rehearsed.

                                 ACRES
                        Mike. Please.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, you know, I'm a little 
                        embarrassed to say, I don't know 
                        your names. I'm not sure who this 
                        apology should be addressed to.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        How about "Ladies"? That would 
                        constitute progress.

           Acres is peeved.
                                 MIKE
                            (grasping, nervous)
                        I think it would be better if --

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        It would be better if you just said 
                        what you came to say. Please.

           Mike looks to Acres, "well I tried". Acres waves him on.

                                 ACRES
                            (hushed)
                        It's OK. Read it. Read it.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea and Fran each put an ear to the door.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Dear Ladies.  I have a learned a 
                        great deal since you called my 
                        attention to the awful treatment 
                        you received as a customer in my 
                        store.

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           He stops and looks for Acres' approval. Acres waves Mike on.

                                 MIKE
                        Customers are the very life blood 
                        of any business. My failure to 
                        respect you as customers, and more 
                        importantly as women, was like 
                        poisoning the very blood of this 
                        business.

           He is awfully proud of his analogy here.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Fran and Althea look at each other in amusement.

                                 FRAN
                            (stifling a giggle)
                        Oh my god. This fucking guy.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Shhh, shh.
           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Susan enters from off screen, sipping her coffee. Mike 
           hesitates, now sort of embarrassed to read in front of her. 

                                 ACRES
                        Go on. Go!

                                 MIKE
                        A human being's right to relieve 
                        oneself in peace is a fundamental 
                        part of the right to shop and 
                        partake in the fruits of the free 
                        market. Irregardless of one's 
                        genitalia. We apologize with the 
                        utmost sincerity.

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                            (stifling a chuckle)
                        Let's see it posted on the Twitter, 
                        and we can get talking.

           Mike is shattered. He'd written the letter and extricated 
           himself from the equation; dazed, he holds a one man meeting.

                                 MIKE
                            (to himself)
                        The twitter? That's marketing?
                            (no, no, no)
                        Who can authorize this?
                            (chews a nail)
                        The CEO is going want to weigh in.

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        That's why you get the big bucks, 
                        kid. Make a few calls.

                                 ACRES
                        Can I have a phone number? We're 
                        going to set up some comms, and 
                        it'll be easier than yelling 
                        through the door. No?

           Althea picks a phone and reads the number off the blue tape.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        Five oh three oh one eight seven 
                        seven two nine.

                        trust, sir. Sharing your number.
                                 ALTHEA
                        It's a burner, SIR. Sorry, I could 
                        hear you getting all excited there. 

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Acres is foiled and frustrated. Mike is bummed to see that. 

                                 MIKE
                            (hushed but angsty)
                        This isn't going well!

           Acres looks angry for the first time, he gnashes his teeth.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        Sergeant, I need you to do me a 
                        favor, OK? It wasn't on the list of 
                        demands, but it is now.

           Acres goes into his Taekwando ready stance to find calm.

                                 ACRES
                        What? 

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        Go get whoever is the most in 
                        charge, someone whose name starts 
                        with captain, OK?

           Acres red faced, flails his hands in a minor tantrum.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Althea gives the cue and "Would I Lie to You", by the 
           Eurythmics, comes on the speaker. Fran does a little dance.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           CAPTAIN LYDIA LINDEN (37, no-nonsense, glasses, plain-
           clothed, pant suit) strolls toward the storefront, sips tea, 
           and heads up the steps. BAD COP (white, smug) heads her off.

                                 BAD COP
                        Sorry, store's closed.

                            (sorta rude)
                        Police business, alright?

           A shopper high steps it toward the door with her head down.

                                 BAD COP (CONT’D)
                            (quite rude now)
                        Where do you think you're going?

                                 BAD COP
                        Nah. Beat it. Store's closed.

                                 LINDEN
                        You should mind your tone.

                        'Scuse me? You say something?

           Linden pulls her jacket back just enough to flash the badge 
           clipped on her belt. He is humbled and bumbling.

                                 LINDEN
                        Mind your tone. Dealing with the 
                        public. This job is hard enough 
                        without you giving us a bad rap.

                                 BAD COP
                        Yes sir. I mean ma'am. Jesus.
                            (looks about)
                        Where did you even come from?

                                 LINDEN
                        I live two blocks away, and I've 
                        got a rewards card.

           She walks away.

                                 BAD COP
                        Where are you going? Did you want 
                        to come in? I'm sorry, I didn't...

                                 LINDEN
                        See you around.

           She walks past the store front and heads down a side alley.

           TECH COP (32, vanilla bro) sets up a phone for a secure

           One of the phones marked with blue tape and sharpie rings. 
           All ears perk up. Fran quickly answers the ringing one.

           Fran answered Althea's personal cell, and it's Althea's ex. 

                                 FRAN
                        No, sorry she's right here.

           Fran holds the phone out to Althea, and shrugs, "oops."

                        What!? No! 

           Althea takes a deep breath, then finally the phone.

                        time. I'm really in the middle of--

                        You want to talk to Daddy?

           Althea cringes a bit, the D word. Candace can hear all this, 
           and meets Althea's eyes. Respect? Pity? Both?

                                 TONYA (CONT’D)

                        Now he doesn't want to talk.

                            (somber, chokes up)
                        It's okay. Look, tell him I love

                        Althea, sorry. What's wrong?

           Althea looks to Fran, who is feeling the big empathy feels.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Look. I'm in a bit of trouble. I 
                        don't know when we'll talk again.

                        I literally just said the words,

                        We're OK now, right? We're still 
                        some kind of family.

           Althea is about to really lose it with the tears, when 
           another phone BUZZES on the counter. Fran picks it up.

                        They just tweeted out his apology. 
                        They spelled "fundamental" wrong.

           Althea gets a tissue. Fran types on her own phone.

                        there peaceably, and into custody, 
                        well, that'll be di-no-mite? Are we 
                        clear? 

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - DAY

           Linden casts a long eye at Acres.

                                 LINDEN
                        Yes sir. Now--

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                            (cutting her off)
                        I would like everybody in that room 
                        to say, "Yes sir, Mister Mayor, I 
                        understand."

           They all look at each other, "Is he serious?" A long pause 
           says that he is serious. Linden conducts them--

                                 ALL IN UNISON
                            (slow, stilted, awkward)
                        Yes sir Mr. mayor I/we understand.

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                        Now go on. Get them out of there.

                                 LINDEN
                        Yes sir, about that. Have you had 
                        any luck getting a hold of Helen 
                        Beaumont?

           INT. THE MAYOR'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The mayor cranks his recliner forward and, oopsie, the bowl 
           of chips hits the floor. He puts her on speaker.

                                 MAYOR
                        Helen Beaumont? What's that 
                        reactionary harpy got to do with 
                        this?  

                                 LINDEN (O.S.)
                        Oh, I'm sorry. Thought you were in 
                        the loop. They want to interview 
                        Helen Beaumont, on camera.
           He glares at Chuck, who shrugs, "I dunno".

                                 LINDEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ms Beaumont was involved in the 
                        initial altercation a while back.

           The mayor is up and pacing the room now.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                            (interjects)
                        It was just a misunderstanding, 
                        there was no altercation.

                                 MAYOR
                            (irritated)
                        Who the hell is that?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        A-hem. Mike Strauss, store manager.

           The mayor steps on spilled chips, CRUNCHA CRUNCHA, then looks 
           to Chuck, "Who's gonna clean this up?", and resumes pacing.

                                 MAYOR
                        So you were the one who threw these 
                        women out of the store?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        They weren't thrown, per se.

                                 MAYOR
                            (cuts him off)
                        So you're responsible for this 
                        whole thing then? Please, shut up 
                        and stay shut up, and stay out my 
                        people's way. Hear me?

           The mayor stumbles over Chuck, who is picking up the chips.

                                 MAYOR (CONT’D)
                            (irritated with Chuck)
                        Shiiiit!!!

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                            (terrified now)
                        Yes. Sir. Yes, sir.

                                 MAYOR
                        How in hell are we supposed to get 
                        Beaumont's brittle butt down there? 

                                 LINDEN (O.S.)
                        I would be glad to speak to her if-
                                 MAYOR
                            (a tinge of sad, vexed)
                        Do you know how much cash she 
                        dumped into the last election?

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - DAY

           The pause indicates, this question is not rhetorical.

                                 LINDEN
                        A lot, sir?

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                        Yes, and all to my opponent.
                        What else do these girls want?

                                 LINDEN
                        A dress, sir.

                                 MAYOR
                        A what?

           INT. EUSTACIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Eustacia's house is an anarcho-anti-capitalist collective. 
           She hits a joint while in pigeon pose on her yoga mat.

           BARNEY (27, pale, gaunt) drinks rose from a jar. He wears 
           Fran's dress, and plays chess with ALLISON, (33, homeless 
           fortune-teller-chic), who is more into her phone right now.

           A rack in the living room brims with designer clothes, all 
           with the tags from Nordstrom still on them. There is a table 
           with a small pack and ship operation, and a laptop nearby. 

                                 EUSTACIA
                        Barney, don't get any wine on that 
                        dress, we're not getting more merch 
                        any time soon.

                                 BARNEY
                        Fine. 

           Barney takes Allison's rook, she doesn't notice. He starts 
           changing out of the dress. Eustacia gets into crow pose.

                                 BARNEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You playing?
                                 ALLISON
                            (stoned, a bit slow)
                        Check this out. Stazia? Don't you 
                        work at the Nordstrom's downtown?

                                 BARNEY
                        Not anymore. She quit this morning.

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh.

           Allison keeps reading, oblivious to the others waiting for 
           her to speak. Barney carefully places the dress on the rack.

                                 BARNEY
                        Well? What is it?

                                 ALLISON
                        Hmmm? Oh, yeah.
                            (another weird pause)
                        It says two trans women hijacked 
                        the bathroom there. 

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (falling off her mat)
                        What!?

           Barney dons a tattered, old kimono, and returns to the chess.

                                 BARNEY
                        Wait, how do you hijack a bathroom?

                                 ALLISON
                        It's all over queer Twitter, an 
                        apology from Nordstrom for not 
                        letting them use the women's 
                        restroom. 

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (now on her own phone)
                        Jesus. I was there when that 
                        happened. Mike, you turd.

                                 ALLISON
                        There is like a protest down there.

                                 EUSTACIA
                        I'm going down there.

           Allison remembers the chess game, and quickly make her move.

                                 ALLISON
                        Got your queen.
                                 BARNEY
                        What? Awwww, man. Fudge!

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Candace has a cat-that-ate-the-canary look on her face. Fran 
           and Althea try to give each other space in a 10' x 10' room. 

           Althea feels Candace's eyes on her.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (almost snippy)
                        What?

                                 CANDACE
                        It's weird. If you ask me.

                                 FRAN
                        No one asked, so --

                                 ALTHEA
                        No. It's fine, what's weird?

                                 CANDACE
                        That you was married to a girl and 
                        she had no idea you're gay, then 
                        you turn out to be a transgender on 
                        top of that.

           Fran wants to speak but leaves it to Althea, who doesn't even 
           know where to start. 

                                 ALTHEA
                        Oh dear. You don't get out much do 
                        you? I wasn't really gay until I 
                        transitioned.

                                 CANDACE
                        Wait, what?

                                 ALTHEA
                        I always liked women, and I still 
                        like women. So now that I am a 
                        woman, I'm a lesbian, because I am 
                        a woman who likes women. See?

                                 CANDACE
                        So you did the thing just so you 
                        could, like.. and now you like, 
                        can't even...

                                 ALTHEA
                        What's the thing I did?
                                 CANDACE
                            (making finger scissors)
                        You chopped off your, you know...

           Ugh, so crude, really? Althea looks to Fran for some help.

                                 FRAN
                        You asked for it. It's 2020 out 
                        here, but in there-
                            (points to Candace's head)
                        -it's I dunno, the 80s?

           Althea gathers herself and studies a defiant Candace.

                                 ALTHEA
                        OK Candy, let's start at the start.

                                 CANDACE
                            (suddenly seething)
                        Don't call me Candy.

                                 ALTHEA
                        OK. Don't ask other humans about 
                        their genitals. Deal?

           EXT. EUSTACIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           The house lists to one side beneath a mossy, sagging roof. 
           The lawn is decorated with rusted bikes, a mannequin, a 
           derelict school bus that may be an apartment, or a grow op.

           Vasquez walks up the path and sees signs for leftist causes, 
           BLM, and ACAB, just visible through an overgrown graden.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Oh, boy.

           At the front door, she looks down at her uniform, crosses 
           herself, and then raises a hand to knock.

           INT. EUSTACIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Colored Christmas lights illuminate the living room. Barney 
           and Allison try to use a Ouija board and eat some molly at 
           the same time. KNOCK KNOCK. Allison's back is to the door.

           Goosebumps! They are convinced that it is a spirit!

                                 ALLISON
                            (spooked, but into it)
                        Whoa!
                                 BARNEY
                            (terrified, not into it)
                        What the fuck?! Go away, go away!

           KNOCK KNOCK. Allison passes the molly to Barney, then closes 
           her eyes, which stay closed as she gets deep into the ouija.

                                 VASQUEZ (O.S.)
                        Hi. I'm Officer Melody Vasquez with 
                        the Portland poli--

                                 BARNEY
                        We summoned the spirit of a cop?!

                                 ALLISON
                        What do you want, Melody?

           Vasquez RAPS on the door and it just CREAKS open.

                                 VASQUEZ (O.S.)
                        I need to speak to Eustacia 
                        Bellows. It's very important.

                                 ALLISON
                        What do you want from her, spirit?

           Barney finally sees her, with a pinky full of dope on his 
           tongue. Vasquez doesn't enter, just waves non-threateningly.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Hi, yes, so sorry to bother you.

           Barney puts his hands up. Vasquez puts her hands up. Barney 
           quickly licks a last bit of drugs off his finger, and smiles.

                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Hi! I love your whole thing here, 
                        it's... 
                            (taking in the decor)
                        cool. I just need a word with 
                        Eustacia. I'm not looking to bust 
                        anyone for possession or anything.

           He stashes the stash.

                            (gasps, eye open, bug out)
                        Possession! Oh God! 

                                 BARNEY
                        Ally, turn around, it's a real cop. 
                        She means narcotics possession.
                                 ALLISON
                            (turns around finally)
                        Oooohhhhhh!

           Allison gets up, walks to Vasquez and locks eyes. Allison's 
           pupils are blown out. She touches Vasquez' heart chakra.

                        Yeah. Why not?

           They have a nice long hug.

                        We totally would have gone, but 
                        we're pretty high, and that scene

                        No. Just like, intense, you know? 
                        Protest can take many forms, you

                        I do, but it won't help. She left 
                        it here, so they can't place her 
                        there.

                        C'mon. You know how they do. Facial 
                        recognition, "location services" 
                        they're watching you, man.

                        protest, but I gotta go find her.

                        You're not gonna get close to her, 
                        in that uniform.

           Vasquez looks down at her blues. He's got a point.

                                 BARNEY (CONT’D)
                            (full of his own nobility)

                        gonna try an' help those women, 
                        I'll help you get dressed for some 
                        undercover protest action. OK?

           Vasquez is not real keen on this idea, but nods, "OK".

                                 ALLISON
                        This is good. I feel good about 
                        this.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - DAY

           The protest has grown. Cops erect barricades. There are signs 
           being made. SWAT is there. Phones record everything.

           Linden is at the door. Acres and Mike lean in to listen.

                                 LINDEN
                        Hello, Captain Lydia Linden, here.  
                        I have the Mayor here on the phone. 
                        He would like a word.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        So we can get the mayor to talk to 
                        us but not the scion of the city's 
                        storied uber-WASP clan?

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                            (with peanut butter mouth)
                        Wait, can a woman even be a scion? 
                        Grand Dame, maybe?

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

                                 ALTHEA
                            (with peanut butter mouth)
                        I don't believe the word scion is 
                        gendered inherently, etymologically 
                        speaking, but historically, in 
                        terms of usage?
                            (shrugs, "I dunno")

           A pause to wash down the peanut butter with some tea.

                            (trying to create urgency)
                        Um, the mayor is holding for you.
                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        OK, fine put him through--

           Linden slides her phone onto speaker, then under the door.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        -- whatever - he's a fucking hack 
                        like the rest of 'em.

           Linden stifles a laugh, and cringes.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           The Mayor performs some exaggerated THROAT CLEARING. Fran 
           looks down and sees the phone on speaker.

                                 THE MAYOR (O.S. PHONE)
                        Now, Ms, maybe I am just a hack 
                        like the rest of them, but my 
                        administration's support for LGBTQ 
                        folk is staunch.

           Fran chagrined, snickers, and looks to Althea.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Mr Mayor, to be honest, my friend 
                        is right, you are a bit of a hack, 
                        but I voted for you, twice, if that 
                        is any consolation.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Hnh, I truly do appreciate your 
                        support. We justly want to make 
                        sure that there is a peaceful 
                        solution and resolution to this 
                        pickle we're all in. There's a lot 
                        of ways this can end, let's find an 
                        ending that works for everybody.

                                 FRAN
                        There's only one ending, really.

           INT. THE MAYOR'S KITCHEN - DAY

           More aides and some cops are on the scene now. The ballgame 
           is on in the background. The mayor, fixing himself a big, 
           Dagwood sandwich, licks some mustard off a knife.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Ms Beaumont is seventy two.
                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        We don't really care how old, 
                        senile, busy, or rich she is. Tell 
                        her... tell her there is a nice fat 
                        tax cut down here for her. 

           The mayor laughs heartily, sawing his sandwich in half. Chuck 
           the aide is taking notes, and eyes the sandwich with envy.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Tax cut. That's a good one!

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        Someone needs to coax, cajole, 
                        carry or just drag her ass here.

           The mayor is pleased with his sandwich. Chuck takes a pickle 
           from the jar. The mayor gives him the eye, but allows it.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           They're playing it cool on the phone but Althea and Fran are 
           all like, "holy shit! We're talking with the freaking mayor!"

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                        Ladies, it’s just not that simple.

                                 FRAN
                            (super cool)
                        Oh, but it is just-that-simple. 
                        Goodbye.

           Fran slides the phone back out under the door. Althea gives 
           her a thumbs up. Fran shakes off the tension.

           The mayor has suddenly lost his appetite, and pushes the 
           sandwich over to Chuck.

                                 THE MAYOR (O.S. PHONE)
                        Who do we know is going to have 
                        Helen Beaumont's phone number? 
           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - LATE IN THE DAY

           At the protest: music's bumping and the vibe is delightful. 
           SWAT and the police are not sweating it.

           Signs include, "FREEDOM ISN'T PEE", "OH LAWDY LAWDY, WE LIKE 
           TO POTTY", "UNRESTROOMS? NO! RESTROOMS? YES!". A triptych 
           reads "MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, WHEN DOING YOUR BUSINESS, IN A 
           PLACE OF BUSINESS". 

           It's all rather chill, until:

           Three huge pick ups roll up on the sidewalk, they fly a huge 
           American flag, a "Don't Tread On Me", and a Confederate flag. 
           A diesel deliberately belches copious, thick exhaust.

           Men in body armor and helmets, exercising their open carry 
           rights, with long guns and sidearms, hop out of the trucks. 

           PAUL BUMPLOT (38, white, neat beard, hipster lumberjack look) 
           leads the goon squad up the steps to the cops. SIDEKICK (42, 
           just a lesser version of Bumplot) plays the wing man.

                                 BUMPLOT
                        We heard a friend of our is been 
                        held against her will by some men 
                        in the ladies room of this place.

           BAD COP discreetly flashes the white power "OK" hand sign, 
           Bumplot winks back. COP 2, (black) puts a hand to his 
           sidearm, the other hand says, "STOP" to Bumplot.

                                 COP 2
                        You all need to take a big step 
                        back. Sorry about your friend, but 
                        the situation is being dealt with 
                        by professionals.

                                 BUMPLOT
                            (stroking his firearm)
                        Well, we don't uh.. cotton to our 
                        friends being held at gunpoint. 

           Cop 2 looks from the AR-15, to Bumplot, back to the gun, and 
           back to Bumplot, who doesn't seem to appreciate the irony.

                                 COP 2
                        Well, that makes two of us. So if 
                        you all don't take that big step, 
                        we're not going to be "cottonin'" 
                        to one another quite a bit.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I don't remember. Alma? Pam?

                                 LINDEN
                        Do you have contact information for 
                        the woman who they let go?

                                 MIKE
                            (embarrassed)
                        No.

                                 LINDEN
                        You have been very helpful.

           Linden moves to exit, as she touches the knob, the door moves 
           and bonks her hand. Susan enters, carrying an open laptop.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh! Sorry, sorry.

           Linden smiles, 'no big deal', and continues to leave.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                            (excitedly!)
                        Wait! I found the dress.
           Linden stops. Susan has everyone's attention.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Not the dress. But on-line. Same 
                        label, same size, color. Worn once. 
                        The seller'll take 300. It's only 
                        an hour from here.

           Susan looks at Mike expectantly, as do Linden and Acres.

                                 MIKE
                        Don't look at me. There are 
                        procedures to requisition funds.

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you serious right now? Tell you 
                        what. I'll split it with you, out 
                        of pocket, deal?

                                 MIKE
                        It's just, I don't think that...

                                 SUSAN
                            (has had enough)
                        OK, I'm done.

           She tosses the laptop down, just hard enough to indicate her 
           disgust, but carefully enough to make sure it doesn't break.

                                 MIKE
                        Where are you going?

                                 SUSAN
                        I hear they're hiring swing shift 
                        supers at Big Box.

           Susan's hand on the knob and CHONK, it turns as Cop 2 enters.

                                 COP 2
                        Sorry to interrupt, but the 
                        situation outside? It just got fu-
                            (he trails off)

                                 ACRES
                        Got what?

                                 COP 2
                        -- complicated.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - DAY

           Fran finishes up her makeup and hair just so. The vanity 
           looks like a back stage dressing room, product everywhere. 
           Althea is focused, writing on her laptop and drinking more 
           tea. Candace watches Fran primp with amusement and contempt.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (reads from her screen)
                        Does this sound right? "This action 
                        is taken in the name of no one 
                        other than ourselves, and while we 
                        hope to call attention to the 
                        unfounded fears, irrational anger, 
                        and ignorant treatment of queer and 
                        trans people everywhere --

                                 FRAN
                        Too preachy, college girl. We gotta 
                        talk like a couple o' regular joes.

                                 CANDACE
                            (fake deep voice)
                        You talk like regular Joes alright.

           Fran shoots her a look, "not funny, just offensive".

                                 ALTHEA
                        We don't want to be misunderstood.

                                 FRAN
                        And that's why you keep it simple.
                            (indicates Candace)
                        For the simple folk.

           Candace snickers. Althea looks at her suspiciously. BZZZ 
           BZZZ, Fran's phone is vibrating. She checks it.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.

                                 ALTHEA
                        What is it?

                                 FRAN
                        Look, the goon squad is here.

           CLOSE UP: FRAN'S PHONE, AN IMAGE OF THE GOON SQUAD OUT FRONT.

           Candace has a good chuckle.

                                 CANDACE
                        You're not the only ones with 
                            (does air-quotes)
                        "allies".

           Althea realizes what happened, but Fran is a moment behind.
                                 ALTHEA
                        She didn't text her family. She 
                        called in the conservative cavalry.

                                 FRAN
                        What the hell?! How did you let her 
                        get away with that?

                                 ALTHEA
                        Me? This room is tiny? You were 
                        right there.

           Fran scrolls through her own feed looking for more info.

                                 FRAN
                        You're the brains of this 
                        operation, I'm the beauty.

                                 CANDACE
                        Hah!

                                 FRAN
                        Look, sure. We took you 
                            (with air quotes)
                        "hostage" but we've treated you 
                        pretty decently on the balance, 
                        that's two strikes. One for calling 
                        in the bigot brigade, and another 
                        for being a snarky bitch.

                                 CANDACE
                            (let's the venom show now)
                        Bitch? Me? You tranny freaks come 
                        in here and-

           ZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTT - RRRIPPP, Althea peels six inches of duct 
           tape off a roll and goes to put it over Candace's mouth.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We tried being nice.

                                 CANDACE
                            (suddenly penitent)
                        -- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --

                                 ALTHEA
                        No, you shouldn't have.

                                 CANDACE
                            (remorseful)
                        Please? I'm sorry. I mean, she 
                        called me a bitch first.
           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - DUSK

           IN THE QUEER PROTEST - Eustacia sits, legs akimbo, in a 
           circle with other protesters, having an intense discussion. 

           PULLING BACK - The police erect more barricades to separate 
           the two groups of protesters, and to keep a path between the 
           store and the street clear. 

           AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS -  Linden, Acres, Mike and Susan 
           appear at the main entrance and survey the scene. Mike half 
           hides behind Acres. The sun is getting low.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh my -- My store.

                                 ACRES
                            (to Linden)
                        Should I call in for more men.

           Linden nods yes, then grabs Acres' arm as he heads off.

                                 LINDEN
                        Remember what the mayor said. Di-
                        no-mite.

           Acres nods and hustles off toward the barricades with Cop 2.

           With Acres gone, Mike shades behind Linden. Susan heads off.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait! Where are you going?

                                 SUSAN
                        To get that dress, clown.

           Mike looks at Linden, who shrugs.

                                 LINDEN
                        It'll take her away from all this 
                        and that's got to be safer.

           Mike sees that is true and eyes going after Susan.

                                 LINDEN (CONT’D)
                            (heads back in)
                        Uh uh, you're with me, Mr Manager.

           Mike looks at the chaos, shudders, and scurries after Linden.

           AT THE CURB - A local news truck arrives, and cops converge 
           on it. Susan finds her path cut off; she must exit to one 
           side or the other. It's angry men with guns, or the queer 
           dance party. She's not thrilled with either choice.
                                 SUSAN
                        This whole stupid day, ugh.

           THE GUNS CROWD - a lot of camo, stars and stripes, stars and 
           bars. A PASTOR (57, white, collared frock et al) joins hands 
           in a prayer circle. Bumplot looks on, and refuses a hand when 
           offered.

                                 PASTOR
                        Lord, we are not here out of spite. 
                        We bear no hate for these lost, 
                        deviant, souls. We pray for their 
                        salvation as we pray for our own.

           Bumplot finds the prayer funny, he pops a pill. Sidekick nips 
           at a flask. Bumplot gives him a pill for a nip at the flask.

           NEWS CHANNEL NINE'S CREW - is tickled pink to find they're 
           first on the scene. The tech guy hustles to set up lights and 
           the camera. SAM SIMEON (ageless, race-less, handsome, creepy 
           yet benign) touches up his own makeup.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                            (looking around, cocky)
                        We're gonna lead tonight.

           IN THE CROWD - Remember Madison from way back? Her eyes track 
           Simeon from the crowd of neutral gawkers who've assembled 
           behind the police presence, safely between the factions. 

           BANG!!! and a SHRIEK!!! 

           All eyes go the QUEER RIGHTS SIDE OF THINGS - someone 
           inflating balloons popped one, but the tension is revealed. 

           Vasquez, now suitably bedraggled in drab cargo pants and an 
           over-sized, threadbare, moth-eaten sweater, wades into the 
           crowd of queer activists and Antifa, with Barney in tow. 

           Susan struggles to move through said crowd. BOINK, she 
           physically collides with Vasquez.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Hey!

           Susan is a little frightened, and doesn't recognize her.

                                 SUSAN
                        I'm so sorry, I'm just trying to-

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Hello, ma'am.
                                 SUSAN
                        Oh! Hi offic-

                                 VASQUEZ
                            (cutting her off)
                        Ixnay on the officer thing, OK? 
                        Call me Mel.

                                 SUSAN
                        OK, Mel. Did you find Eustacia?

                                 VASQUEZ
                        No. But my new pal, Barney here, 
                        says she is somewhere in... here.

           They look around at the crowd, it's huge and daunting.

                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Give us a hand? Maybe help those 
                        girls get out of there?

                                 SUSAN
                            (hems, haws, then)
                        Why not?

           EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DUSK

           Two cyclists crest a hill. CAROL STRONG (32, black, fit) 
           slows down, so that HELENA BEAUMONT (73, white, metallic 
           hair, great bone structure) can keep up. Manicured shrubs and 
           trees line the road. This is a wealthy neighborhood.

           They pause, share a smile, then descend with abandon. Zooming 
           in a crouch, they swoop through curves, neck and neck. 

           EXT. THE BEAUMONT ESTATE - NIGHT

           The cyclists race right up through the grand stiles and open 
           gate, then stop at the palatial entrance to the home. 

           Helmets come off, they sip water, panting and sweating.

                                 CAROL
                        Ms Beaumont. You're a demon. You 
                        have no fear.

                                 HELEN
                        Fear? To live in fear is to believe 
                        that the worst is inevitable. 
                            (searches pockets)
                        Although, I am afraid that I left 
                        my glasses back on that bench.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HELEN (CONT’D)
                            (puts her helmet back on)
                        Are you up for a few more miles?

                                 CAROL
                        That was five miles back!
                            (looks around at the 
                            obvious wealth)
                        You can afford another pair.

                                 HELEN
                        Yes, but you don't get rich, and 
                        certainly won't stay rich, if you-

           The maid, SARAH (white, 47) emerges from the grand doors, 
           harried, and interrupts.

                                 SARAH
                            (short of breath)
                        Ms B, the Mayor called for you.

                                 HELEN
                            (mildly astonished)
                        The mayor? I can't imagine.

                                 SARAH
                        Twice. It's very urgent, he says.

                                 HELEN
                        Well the mayor can wait.
                        I need to fetch my sunglasses.

           Helen puts her helmet back on. Carol follows suit.

                                 SARAH
                        Ma'am, it's a matter of life and 
                        death. He said.

                                 HELEN
                        So dramatic, just like a lib.
                            (to Carol)
                        Drats. I suppose I will have to buy 
                        myself another pair of glasses. 

           INT. BEAUMONT ESTATE - THE GUEST KITCHEN - EVENING

           Helen and Carol sit at a counter. Helen listens on the 
           handset of the wall mounted rotary phone, Carol eavesdrops.

                                 HELEN
                        Well, why don't you just go in with 
                        tear gas and roust these cretins 
                        out of there?
                                 THE MAYOR (O.S. PHONE)
                        Ma'am. This is a hostage situation, 
                        and we need to be sensitive to-

                                 HELEN
                        Sensitive? To what? Violent 
                        criminals?

                                 THE MAYOR (O.S. PHONE)
                            (cringes audibly)
                        Our hope is that you can help us 
                        avoid any violence. Ms. Beaumont, 
                        speaking directly to you, on 
                        camera, is their primary demand.
                            (no reply)
                        I personally guarantee your safety.

           Helen laughs heartily at this.

                                 HELEN
                            (skeptical)
                        I have no faith in a guarantee from 
                        your government, or any other.
                            (she mulls)
                        But I will consider this with my 
                        attorney. We'll be in touch.

           She hangs up, and purses her lips in thought.

                                 HELEN (CONT’D)
                        So attorney? Might we have a bit of 
                        fun with the this, hmmm?

                                 CAROL
                        Your idea of fun is... curious.

                                 HELEN
                        Someone one needs to stand up these 
                        leftist bullies.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Fran is poised in her chair, with perfect lighting; legs 
           crossed, hands at rest on her knee. 

           Althea looks at Fran on the monitor and fiddles with the 
           camera. Candace looks on, the duct tape holds up a lamp.

                                 ALTHEA
                        You look amazing by the way. Ready?

           Fran does some vocal warm up exercises.
                                 FRAN
                            (call back to her earlier 
                            existential schtick)
                        Is anyone ever ready for anything?

           Althea just shakes her head, "it's still not funny".

                                 CANDACE
                        What is all this? What are you on 
                        about? Making some kind of TV show?

                                 FRAN
                        Why, you want to be in it?

                                 CANDACE
                        Me? No.

                                 FRAN
                        You sure you don't have anything 
                        you want to say to us? You've been 
                        speaking your mind plenty, so far.

           Candace clams up.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 CANDACE
                        Like what?

                                 FRAN
                        Like, where do you think I should 
                        go, you know, when I have to go?

                                 CANDACE
                        You mean like, "go" "go"?

                                 FRAN
                        "Pee pee poo poo", as the kids say.

           Candace doesn't want to answer.

                                 CANDACE
                            (points to Althea)
                        She just said she's still got a-
                        Look, women make babies and neither 
                        of you-

                                 FRAN
                        You're not making any babies 
                        either, my menopausal friend.
                                 CANDACE
                            (doesn't like that)
                        Look, I don't hate nobody. I just 
                        wanna walk down the street and be 
                        free to...

           She trails off into a long pause.

                                 ALTHEA
                        -- and what? Be free from my 
                        existence? Free from worrying about 
                        what I use to pee, and where?

           Candace won't say it but that is the answer.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        Your kind is always freedom this 
                        and freedom that, but Lord forbid 
                        anyone use that freedom different 
                        than you.

           Candace sits up tall, with resolve and pride in her opinions. 

           BZZZT, a phones starts vibrating. Then another phone vibes 
           itself right off the counter.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S -EVENING

           QUEERSIDE: Antifa types at the barricade, bandannas, bike 
           helmets, gas masks, black denim and hoodies. Among them are 
           sparkly disco protesters, blowing kisses to the patriots. 

           GUNSIDE: Bumplot and his boys at the barricades, armed and 
           armored; they would look more at home in Basra. They stare 
           intently across, un-amused by the kisses. 

           Some Westboro-Baptist-Church-types hoist signs imploring, 
           "GAY? HELL AWAITS, NO PEARLY GATES". Sam Simeon is well lit, 
           in the foreground. The camera is rolling.

           CLOSE UP: A TELEVISION SCREEN- "LIVE AT NORDSTROM'S DOWNTOWN 
           PDX" ON THE BANNER. WE'LL PERIODICALLY CUT AWAY TO SHOTS OF 
           VARIOUS CHARACTERS WATCHING THIS BROADCAST ON THEIR DEVICES.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        We do know that these women are 
                        armed, and that at least one shot 
                        has been fired. With us here we 
                        have Madison Freiberg. She was in 
                        the ladies room with the current 
                        hostage and the two hijackers.

                        Madison, what can you tell us about 
                        the situation?

                                 MADISON
                        Well. The women, I mean they had 
                        guns and I guess it was sorta 
                        scary, but they were sorta sweet, 
                        considering, you know? I was never, 
                        like, really worried.

           THE MAYOR HOPS ABOUT, PUTTING HIS PANTS ON TWO LEGS AT ONCE 
           AS THE TV PLAYS. CHUCK IS STILL WORKING TWO PHONES.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        And what can you tell us about your 
                        fellow hostage?

                                 MADISON
                        I don't know. She was like, angry. 
                        I guess maybe I woulda been too, if 
                        I was the one they kept there.

           FRAN AND ALTHEA WATCH, THEY ARE KIND ENOUGH TO ANGLE THE 
           SCREEN SO THAT A GRUMPY CANDACE CAN SEE. 

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        And do you know what their demands 
                        are? Did they say anything else?

           LINDEN AND MIKE WATCH ON HER PHONE AT THE LADIES ROOM DOOR.

                                 MADISON
                        They wanted a to talk to the 
                        manager. He was like, kind of a di-
                            (self censors)
                        jerk, and was totally mean to a 
                        girl for like, just working there. 

           MIKE IS ALL, "OH MAN. ARE YOU SERIOUS WITH THIS?"

           HELEN BEAUMONT, WRAPPED IN TOWELS, FRESH FROM THE SHOWER, 
           STOPS TO WATCH AS CAROL SHOWS HER THE BROADCAST ON A TABLET.

                                 MADISON (CONT’D)
                        They wanted a dress or something, 
                        and I don't know. Oh yeah. They 
                        wanted to talk to some rich lady, 
                        she's the one that got them kicked 
                        out of the store in the first 
                        place. I mean, I would be pissed 
                        too, if that happened to me.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        So you think what they're doing is 
                        reasonable?

                                 MADISON
                        No, but... I don't know. I mean, 
                        it's 2020, people can like just pee 
                        wherever. Just wash your hands, and 
                        keep the seat clean. I can't 
                        believe this is even a thing.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        Thank you very much. Also now we 
                        have been informed that one of the 
                        kidnappers is a Francine Carter. 
                        Formerly Franklin Carter. The 
                        identity of the other woman is as 
                        of yet unknown.

           THE DREADED BEFORE AND AFTER. FRAN'S OLD ROUGH FACE, 
           ALONGSIDE A RECENT CUTE, SELFIE FROM HER SOCIAL MEDIA.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - EVENING

           Fran is dumbstruck; her face, past and present, on TV.

                                 SAM SIMEON (O.S.)
                        It looks like a long night out here 
                        with the protesting factions 
                        growing, as is the tension.

           Althea wants to reach out to hug Fran but holds back. Candace 
           feels revulsion, curiosity and pity all at once.

           Fran is about to say something pithy and brush it off, but 
           doesn't. She goes and quietly locks herself in a stall.

           INT. THE MAYOR'S KITCHEN - EVENING

           The mayor is stress eating some ice cream out of the 
           container in front of the open freezer. He mumbles to 
           himself. Chuck keeps working the phones. 

                                 CHUCK
                            (astonished, whispering)
                        It's Homeland Security. For you. 

           The mayor does not want to deal with that, and is saved when 
           he gets an incoming call on his own phone. He poo-poos Chuck.
                                 MAYOR
                            (into his phone)
                        Ms Beaumont? How may I help you?

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        Hello, Mr Mayor. I have had a 
                        change of... mind. I will meet with 
                        these... people.

                                 MAYOR
                            (thrilled, but stays pro)
                        Well, we are in your debt. You have 
                        my assurance that you will be safe.

           INT. BEAUMONT ESTATE - EVENING

           Helen, robed, sits at her vanity, mid-blowout. Sarah holds a 
           hair dryer and brush - on standby.

                                 HELEN
                        Hmph. I'll be at the employee 
                        entrance at 7:45. Until then.

           Her eyes fall on a framed photo of her and her departed 
           husband on their yacht in the 80's, looking WASPY as can be.

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                        Ma'am. May I ask why you changed 
                        your mind? What swayed you?

                                 HELEN
                        I am not the villain here, and I 
                        refuse to be portrayed as such by 
                        the media. 7:45.

           The phone goes back in it's cradle. Her blowout resumes. The 
           VVVRRR of the dryer is as loud in the ears of the audience as 
           it is to Helen, who idly peruses a fortune in jewelry.

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           Vasquez, still in incognito mode, wades through the crowd 
           with Barney and Susan. They're trying to cover a wide area.

                                 BARNEY
                            (half yelling)
                        Stazy? Where you at?
                            (no reply)
                        STAAA-ZEEE?

           Something catches Susan's eye, she moves off. Vasquez sees 
           her and follows. Barney, oblivious, goes the other way.
           Susan finds Eustacia in a circle of women, an altar of 
           flowers, wine, and lit candles are in the center.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hi! Eustacia, it's me don't freak 
                        out, OK? I have a police officer--

           The crowd peels back at the words "police" and officer". Mean 
           and distrustful eyes fall on Vasquez, who half way puts her 
           hands up. Eustacia gathers her things, ready to bolt.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh! Honey, it's ok. She's nice -

           The crowd's murmur turns ugly. Vasquez is now more concerned 
           for her and Susan's safety than Eustacia or the dress.

                                 RANDOM ASSHOLE
                        Get the fuck out of here narc.

                                 ANOTHER ASSHOLE
                        We don't need your cointelpro 
                        bullshit here, you fucking pig.

           Eustacia is about to disappear into the crowd but pauses, 
           suddenly more curious about what Susan is doing out here with 
           a cop, than afraid of a cop. Vasquez is tense, head on a 
           swivel. Susan is on the edge of panic.

           Someone throws a fistful of glitter at Vasquez, it settles on 
           her face and hair rather fashionably.

           Barney shows up and enters the circle that has opened up 
           around Vasquez, and stands by her side.

                                 BARNEY
                            (even keeled)
                        Hey. What's going on here?

                                 RANDOM ASSHOLE
                        What? Is this pig a friend of 
                        yours?

                                 BARNEY
                        As a matter of fact she is. And 
                        she's a cool motherfucker.

                                 ANOTHER ASSHOLE
                        Yeah?

                                 BARNEY
                        Yeah. All cops are bastards, we 
                        know that.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARNEY (CONT’D)
                        I bet she knows that, but she's 
                        here to help the women in there.

           Random Asshole doesn't buy it. Vasquez rolls up her sleeve 
           and shows off a faded pink triangle tattoo from way back 
           when. This 'cred' seems to work, and they ease off.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        I'll be on my way shortly, OK?

           Meanwhile --

                                 SUSAN
                        Stazy, there was a dress, cream, 
                        size 10, with a floral brocade. Do 
                        you remember?

           Eustacia is absorbed in the goings on with Vasquez. Out of 
           patience, Susan snaps her fingers for Eustacia's attention.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey! We're trying to find that 
                        dress. One of the women tried it on 
                        the day she got kicked out. Do you 
                        know where it is?

           The kerfuffle has subsided, and Barney and Vaquez come near.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        They won't leave that bathroom till 
                        they get that dress.
                            (now Eustacia listens)
                        We tore the store apart. Do you 
                        know where it is?

           Eustacia looks at Vasquez, sizing her up.

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (to Vasquez)
                        I know the dress. I should've quit 
                        that day, on principle. You going 
                        to give me immunity or something?

                                 VASQUEZ
                        I just want to get these girls out 
                        of there and safe. All this, going 
                        on out here? Not my deal.

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (unapologetic)
                        I stole it.

           Susan's hands go to her knees like a tired ballplayer.
                                 EUSTACIA (CONT’D)
                        But you gotta ask him, he was 
                        wearing it the last time I saw it. 

           Vasquez looks at Barney and slaps her forehead. 

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Seriously?

                                 BARNEY
                            (blushing)
                        You didn't ask me about any dress!

           INT. VINTAGE MERCEDES SEDAN - NIGHT

           A pristine, S-class diesel, Helen driving, pushes in the dash 
           lighter. Steely Dan is on the radio. Carol works her phone.

                                 CAROL
                        The Founders Family Heritage Caucus 
                        is asking for two hundred 75K for 
                        the monument preservation campaign.

                                 HELEN
                        Done.

                                 CAROL
                        And last one, Women's Life Choices 
                        want 50 for a new adoption center.

                                 HELEN
                        Hmmph. They never thanked me for 
                        the last 50, but we must save the 
                        little babies, mustn't we?

                                 CAROL
                        Got it. You know, live on the 
                        internet, there's no edits. No 
                        backsies. If you mess up, it'll be 
                        out there forever. As your lawyer--

                                 HELEN
                            (cuts her off)
                        I know what the internet is, dear. 
                        And I look forward to making my 
                        position plain and clear.

           Helen cracks her window, the lighter pops and she lights a 
           Virginia Slim. Carol doesn't question her decision further.
                                 CAROL
                            (in fun)
                        As your lawyer, it is my duty to 
                        remind you, smoking kills.

                                 HELEN
                            (icy)
                        Shht. Or I'll send you back to that 
                        godforsaken public school in the 
                        hood where I found you.

           That barb gives Carol a wince of humiliation.

           EXT. THE MAYOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The mayor's house is a cozy craftsman with a very tidy yard. 
           He walks down the garden path to a waiting squad car, aides 
           in tow. He hops in, they drive off with a two car escort.

           INT. A RESTROOM STALL - NIGHT

           Fran sits on the toilet, seat down, and is on the phone.

                                 FRAN
                            (has been crying)
                        Gary, where are you? They doxxed 
                        me, before and after pictures, they 
                        fucking dead-named me on TV. I knew 
                        it might happen but...
                            (she wipes snot with TP)
                        Look, it won't be long before the 
                        press or the police find you.
                        Will you call me? Please?

           INT. LADIES ROOM -NIGHT

           Fran exits the stall, her make up run through with tears.

                                 CANDACE
                        You know what? I still hope they 
                        throw your ass in jail when this is 
                        over, but that's gotta suck. 

                                 FRAN
                            (whatever)
                        Thanks.

                                 CANDACE
                        May I use the - um - restroom?
           Althea nods, and rises to give Fran a big hug. Fran accepts 
           it half-heartedly. Candace locks herself in a stall.

                                 FRAN
                        What're we even doing here?

                                 ALTHEA
                            (fixing Fran's hair)
                        I'm sorry, babe.  You look pretty 
                        hot in that "after" pic they used. 
                        Small consolation, I know.

                                 FRAN
                        It's true. That is a great picture.

                                 ALTHEA
                        This also might feel like small 
                        consolation now, but take a look.

           Althea turns the laptop so Fran can see it--

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        We have a lot of friends! Look, 
                        we're pre-empting Wheel of Fortune.

           Sam Simeon is on screen, at the protest. Althea un-mutes it.

                                 SAM SIMEON (O.S. SCREEN)
                        --and as you can see the competing 
                        factions here seem to be --

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           Some right wing folks at the front of the barricade chant, 
           and mark the perimeter of their turf with tiki torches.

                                 RIGHT WING CHANT
                        - there's only two genders- not 
                        your rainbow agenda - 

           The other side has glow-sticks twisted and connected into 
           rainbows and hearts that festoon the barricades.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        Earlier, I spoke with one of the 
                        protesters.

                        What brings you out here tonight?
           Bumplot sees his AR-15 is not in frame, and hikes it up. 

                                 BUMPLOT
                        People worry about guns like this 
                        in real American hands, but who's 
                        waving one around in there? A lib. 

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        What would you say to these women?

                            (disgusted)
                        Women? They're some fellas in need 
                        of serious psychological help.

                                 SAM SIMEON
                        How does you bringing your gun here 
                        help this situation?

                        Thugs. And libtards, like these 
                        fellas in the store.

           Sam Simeon is suddenly quite uncomfortable next to this guy.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           The newscast, live again, camera on Sam Simeon, on the 
           laptop. In the foreground, Althea turns to Fran, with a smile 
           that says "we made quite a ruckus."

                                 ALTHEA
                        It looks like a Trump rally got 
                        double booked with a Burning Man 
                        thing out there.

                            (quite wary of all this)
                        That moron with the gun scares the 
                        living shit out of me.

                            (mild gravitas)
                        Although it's quiet at the moment, 
                        here on the scene, one spark could 
                        cause a wildfire the likes of which 
                        we've never seen. 

           The shot pans from Sam to the store front, tiki torches and 
           glow-sticks in frame, then up and zooming out to show the 
           store's whole facade with Sam back in the frame.
           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           Sam is looking up at the building along with the camera.

                        And this is only half the story, as 
                        we have no idea what is happening 
                        at the epicenter of this crisis. 

           -- and CUT. Sam is quite pleased with himself.

                        mean, we just killed that.

           The camera man gives him a high five, chest-bumping bro hug.

           INT. OFFICE OF THE STORE MANAGER - NIGHT

           Linden's phone cuts from the broadcast to an incoming call.

                                 LINDEN
                        Mr Mayor?

                                 MAYOR (O.S. PHONE)
                        Captain, Beaumont is on her way. 

                                 LINDEN
                            (lively now)
                        Beaumont's coming? When?

           Mike hears the name and like Pavlov's dog, pops up, and 
           grooms himself in a mirror, smoothing wrinkles in his shirt.

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                        She's coming in the employee 
                        entrance at 7:45. Get down there 
                        but don't start anything till I get 
                        there, you hear? 

           Mike pops a piece of gum in his mouth, inspects his teeth, 
           and finger combs his hair.

                                 LINDEN
                        Very good, sir. We're on it.

           Linden hangs up and turns to find Mike standing at attention.

                                 MIKE
                            (with newfound vigor)
                        Let's go.
           INT. SUSAN'S MINIVAN - NIGHT

           Susan is at the wheel. Vasquez rides shotgun, Eustacia and 
           Barney are in the back.  

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           The minivan is in a logjam of news trucks, police vehicles, 
           and protesters all fighting to get close to the action.

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Farts.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           WHOOOSSSHHH the sounds of running water.

           Fran has washed her face at the sink. The faucet stops. She 
           looks in the mirror, studying every detail of her wet face, 
           jaw line, hair line, brow line, the bags under her eyes.

                                 FRAN
                        Ugh.

           Althea plays AV, untangling some cords while she pretends not 
           to watch her friend with concern. It gets very quiet.

           FLUSSHHH.

           INT. A STALL - NIGHT

           Under cover of the flush, Candace draws the gun from where 
           she had wedged it, tucks it in her Spanx, and exits.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Fran sees Candace behind her in the mirror.

                                 CANDACE
                            (chipper)
                        So, what's the plan?

           Awkward silence. Althea's eyes lead Candace to her chair.

                                 ALTHEA
                        That's your plan, right there.

                                 CANDACE
                            (in good humor)
                        Alright, alright.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        Going to wash my hands first 
                        though. Is that OK?
                            (start washing up)
                        Can I have a cup of that tea?

           Althea smells something amiss, but tea does sound good.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Yeah, why not. Franny? Tea?

                                 FRAN
                        Yeah. An herbal. I got nerves 
                        enough, I don't need any caffeine.

           Althea's phone rings. It's her son, Henry, on a Facetime. Her 
           heart exploding at the sight of his face, and she bobbles it.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Hi Baby! So good to see you!!!

                                 HENRY
                        Daddo? Why are you upside down?

            She turns it right side up.

                                 ALTHEA
                        How are you? Where's Mom?

           Henry's eyes dance, looking at everything except the phone.

                                 HENRY
                        OK. Mom's crying. You're on TV.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (carefully)
                        I am on TV.

                                 HENRY
                        Mom says you're going to get 
                        yourself kilt.

                                 ALTHEA
                        No. I survived a war, remember?

           Henry's eyes finally return to the phone and he sees Althea.

                                 HENRY
                        OK. You look weird.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Do I? We haven't seen each other in 
                        a while. You look big.
                                 HENRY
                        I am big. I can get cookies off the 
                        fridge now.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Wow. That is big! Look, buddy, when 
                        this silliness is over, I want to 
                        hang out and goof off with you. 
                        Like the old days.

                                 HENRY
                        It's not like that anymore.

                                 ALTHEA
                        No. Some things are different. I 
                        bet we can still have fun though.

                                 HENRY
                        I don't know.

           Henry hangs up suddenly. Althea is speechless.

           EXT. NORDSTROMS BACK DOOR - NIGHT

           Several SWAT officers in full regalia are bored, looking at 
           phones, or half asleep. TIK TOK TIK TOK.

           They startle to life and level their weapons at the noise.

                                 SWAT #1
                        Put your hands above your head and 
                        stop right there.

           TIK TOK TIK TOK They can't see what's headed their way as 
           it's back lit by bright lights. TIK TOK TIK TOK. 

                                 HELEN
                        Relax. It's just a little old lady.

           It's Helen Beaumont's heels, TIK TOK, she and Carol approach.

           The back door SQUEAKS and SLAMS open. The SWAT guys startle 
           and swing their guns around at Linden, who doesn't flinch.

                                 LINDEN
                        Ms. Beaumont. Thank you for coming.

                                 HELEN
                        Well. I find myself here hardly at 
                        my pleasure, so you're welcome.

           She breezes past Linden, nose in the air. Mike holds the 
           door, head bowed. She is nobility to him. Carol follows.
           Linden claps for the attention of the SWAT crew and using two 
           fingers points to her own, and then everyone else's eyes:

                                 LINDEN
                        Things are hot out there. No one 
                        enters without my permission. OK?

           She leaves, SWAT #1 slyly mouths, "fucking dyke", another cop 
           catches it, is disgusted, but says nothing.

           INT. EUSTACIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The van squad enters. Allison shuffles tarot cards. Barney 
           pulls back a tapestry, and reveals the stolen merchandise 
           resale operation. 

           Vasquez and Susan are shocked.

                                 SUSAN
                        Holy shrinkage, Eustacia!

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (seething, to Barney)
                        Fucking idiot! We didn't have to 
                        cop to the whole thing.
                            (defiant, to Vasquez)
                        I was granted immunity.

                                 SUSAN
                            (upset)
                        From her, not me. This is crazy. 
                        The store is struggling and you-

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (cuts her off)
                        The store is struggling? Have you 
                        seen my paychecks? Fuck that place, 
                        and fuck the stockholders, and fuck 
                        the sweatshops that make this shit.

                                 SUSAN
                        So fuck me, is what you're saying?

                                 EUSTACIA
                        They fucked you, whenever they made 
                        that asshole Mike the manager.

                                 SUSAN
                            (that hurt)
                        Fine. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em in the 
                        earhole, but that doesn't justify -
                            (gestures, "all this")
                                 EUSTACIA
                        It doesn't? How much do you put up 
                        with before you do more than say 
                        fuck 'em, and actually start 
                        fucking 'em.

           Susan has no answer and sees a truth in her words.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Do you have any idea what the 
                        penalty is for this?

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (deadly serious)
                        You said immunity, pig.

           Barney pops out from the rack.

                                 BARNEY
                            (psyched!)
                        I found the dress! It's a little 
                        wrinkled but...

                                 EUSTACIA
                            (salty and done with this)
                        Great. Take the dress and get the 
                        fuck out.

           Barney is sad now and so is Susan, who takes the dress from 
           him. Vasquez and Stazy lock eyes. Stazy doesn't back down.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        OK then.
                            (to Barney)
                        Thank you.

           Susan inspects the dress. It looks OK, considering.

                                 SUSAN
                        Don't ask me for a reference.

           Vasquez and Susan leave.

                                 BARNEY
                        Dude, you didn't need to do that. 
                        That might be the only cool cop in 
                        the city.

                                 EUSTACIA
                        Whatever. There are no cool cops.
                                 BARNEY
                            (hangdog, he was smitten)
                        They were a ride back to the 
                        protest too.

           Eustacia looks at the rack. Maybe she feels guilt? Maybe not.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Fran has just fixed her makeup, and is feeling good about it. 

                                 FRAN
                            (to the mirror)
                        I'm about as ready for my close up 
                        as I'll ever be.

           Althea brushes her teeth, Candace is jealous and shmeks her 
           own fuzzy teeth. Althea digs in her ditty bag and pulls out a 
           brand new toothbrush, and offers it to Candace.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Hmm?

           She tosses the toothbrush in Candace's lap and offers up 
           toothpaste, as if to say, "c'mon, time to clean up".

           Candace gulps, billows her shirt, ensuring her weapon is 
           concealed, and goes to the sink. She opens the brush.

                                 CANDACE
                            (magnanimous)
                        Look at us. Just sharing a 
                        restroom. Like...

           Althea is mid-spit-and-rinse, and pauses, thinking; "rinse- 
           and-spit, then give her the what for, or pontificate on the 
           irony of her words immediately while foaming at the mouth". 

                                 CANDACE (CONT’D)
                        ...it's ironic. Ain't it?

           Before Althea can enumerate said ironies, a phone vibrates on 
           the counter. Althea looks to see which phone it is.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (foamy mouthed)
                        It's Gary.

           Fran grabs the phone and enters the stall for privacy.

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        Gary? Baby, where are you?
           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           Gary struggles to move through the lefty side of the protest. 
           The high emotions have waned. It's all on edge now, a few 
           yawns, some agitation.

                                 GARY
                        Franny! This is bonkers. There are 
                        like, hundreds of people out here.

                                 FRAN (O.S. PHONE)
                        It's pretty damned crazy in here.

                                 GARY
                        You guys stirred up some serious 
                        shit.

           POW! Is it another balloon popping, wonders the crowd? No, 
           one more. POW. The crowd panics, people dive and scatter.

           AT THE STEPS: Acres and COP #2 look toward their left.

           PATRIOT RALLY: SIDEKICK has a bullet in his foot, he's 
           splayed on the ground; flask and rifle on the floor with him.

                                 BUMPLOT
                        What the fuck?

                                 SIDEKICK
                        I don't know!
                            (howls and clutches foot)
                        It just went off.

           Bumplot goes to one knee, SIDEKICK offers his foot to Bumplot 
           for aid, but Bumplot only picks up the gun and flask.

                                 BUMPLOT
                        Went off? You dumb ass.

           GARY: crouches and waddles through the crowd to the shop, his 
           phone held up round his head as if it offers some protection.

                                 FRAN (O.S. PHONE)
                        Jesus, what's happening?

           Protesters shriek, the police bark commands. Gary can't hear. 

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Gary? Gary?
                            (BANG BANG over the phone)
           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           BANG BANG on the door. All three women freeze.

                                 LINDEN (O.S.)
                        She's here.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Who?

                                 LINDEN (O.S.)
                        Beaumont.

           Fran and Althea are shocked; it takes a second to process. 

                                 FRAN
                            (mildly distraught)
                        Gary, I gotta go, babe.

           Althea draws her gun and waves Candace into her chair, 
           mindful not to actually point it at her.

                                 GARY (O.S. PHONE)
                        What! Franny!? I can't--

                                 FRAN
                        I gotta go. I'll see you soon.

           She smooches his image on the phone, and swipes the call off.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (to Linden)
                        Question?

           EXT. THE LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Linden's at the door, Helen and Carol are in tow.

                                 LINDEN
                        Yes.

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        Can I have your email, please?

                                 LINDEN
                        Why?

                                 ALTHEA (O.S.)
                        You guys make Ms Beaumont comfy, 
                        offer her water, tea, whatever. And 
                        in a little while, we'll have a 
                        nice little telechat.
           Linden looks to a hesitant Beaumont.

                                 ALTHEA (CONT’D)
                        It will be more civilized than 
                        yelling through the door, no?

           Beaumont looks to Carol, who gives her assent; Beaumont nods.

                                 LINDEN
                        Is there anything else you want?

                        If you focus on what ya got in life 
                        you'll always have plenty. If you 
                        focus on what you don't got in 
                        life, you'll never have enough.

                                 LINDEN
                            (fishing for a clue)
                        What is that? The Tao or something?

                                 FRAN (O.S.)
                        Oprah. Now, how 'bout that email?

           Beaumont rolls her eyes, and Carol chuckles.

                                 LINDEN
                        OK. It's "L dot L-I-N...

           EXT. NORDSTROM'S - NIGHT

           The mayor's convoy rolls up; Acres and SWAT approach.

                                 ACRES
                        Sir, we have a situation here.

           The mayor's face says, "no shit".

                                 ACRES (CONT’D)
                        We've got some major unknowns now.

                                 MAYOR
                        How about you give me the known 
                        knowns first? Then the unknowns.

           An aisle is formed by the barricades, leading from the closed 
           off street, up to the steps of the store. They make their way 
           up that aisle.

                                 ACRES
                        As you can see we have a great deal 
                        of, um, civic engagement here.
                                 MAYOR
                            (sensing the ugliness)
                        I see that. I see that.

                                 ACRES
                        We had two shots fired just before 
                        you got here.

           The mayor stops on a dime. SWAT forms up around he and Acres.

                                 MAYOR
                            (alarmed but level headed)
                        Injuries? Who was it?

                                 ACRES
                        We don't know that. We think it 
                        came from the Patriots.

                                 MAYOR
                        You don't know who fired a gun? 
                        Wait, are you implying that the 
                        other side here are not patriots?

                                 ACRES
                        No, sir. That's the group's name, 
                        Prayerful Patriots.

           The mayor sees armed men at the barricades, and finally gets 
           the scale of this shit show.

           The mayor's phone rings. It's Beaumont.

                                 MAYOR
                            (to Acres)
                        I have to get in there. You keep 
                        this under control till I get back, 
                        you hear?

           The Mayor and Chuck head to the store, with a SWAT escort.

                                 MAYOR (CONT’D)
                            (answering the phone)
                        Ms. Beaumont. How are we?

           Acres left alone in between the factions, heads to safety.

                                 ACRES
                        Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike applies a sample of some night cream on the back of 
           Helen's free hand, as she speaks on her phone.
                                 HELEN
                            (imperious)
                        We're all waiting for you now.

                                 MAYOR (O.S.)
                            (hurrying up the steps)
                        Things are rather unsettled here.

                                 HELEN
                        Well. That's all to be settled in 
                        here, no? Please, come along.

           PULLING BACK: at another counter, a chair is set up for her. 
           As is a tripod and a camera, wired into a laptop monitor.

                                 LINDEN
                        Ma'am, we're ready for a test.

           Helen hangs up. She touches her moisturized hand, approves, 
           drops the sample into her purse, and goes to the chair.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, please let me just--

           He picks a piece of lint off Helen's shoulder. TECH COP turns 
           on a hot light. Her hand shields her face and eyes.

                                 HELEN
                        No.

                                 TECH COP
                        We can't see you without it.

           Mike comes up with a shaded fixture from behind the counter.

                                 TECH COP (CONT’D)
                        Sure. Whatever.

           Tech Cop plugs in the light and it casts a flattering glow.

                                 HELEN
                            (lifting her chin)
                        Raise that camera about a foot, and 
                        move it a few inches to the left.

                                 TECH COP
                        Lady, this isn't the Today Show.

           Helen is not used to insolence. He looks to Linden, "is this 
           lady for real?" and Linden nods for him do as he's been told. 

                                 HELEN
                        And turn that monitor around. So 
                        that I can see.
           Linden nods again, the Tech Cop turns around the 
           monitor/laptop, and Helen looks sidelong at her own profile.

           EXT. NORDSTROMS -NIGHT

           Gary is at the police barricade near the doors, pleading his 
           case to a dismissive and disinterested Bad Cop.

                                 GARY
                        Please, let me speak to whoever is 
                        in charge. The woman in there, the 
                        one with the gun, she's my fiance.

                                 BAD COP
                            (walking away)
                        Just let the pros handle it, buddy.

           Gary ducks under the barricade to approach the cop and finds 
           himself in a brutal choke hold. The patriots cheer, and the 
           other side roils at the sight of police brutality.

                                 GARY
                            (barely able to breathe)
                        Please, Jesus...

           Acres enters. Bad Cop looks up at him and eases off a bit. 

                                 BAD COP
                        This man jumped the barricade, sir.

                        C'mon. Media is here, ok? Ease up.

           Gary is released and he sees Sergeant Acres name tag.

                            (to Gary)
                        Stay with me.

           Gary follows Acres to the store, and flashes a stink eye at 
           Bad Cop who is left facing a very angry crowd.

           EXT. NORDSTROM - EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Susan and Vasquez approach the alley. The SWAT guys aim guns 
           at them right away. Vasquez holds up her badge and hands -

                                 VASQUEZ
                        I'm a cop. 

                                 SWAT #1
                            (laughing)
                        What are you, undercover homeless?

           Vasquez tries the locked door.

                                 SWAT #1 (CONT’D)
                        The PIC says no one in or out 
                        without her permission.

                                 VASQUEZ
                        See this dress?

           Susan holds up the dress.

                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                        Those girls get this dress, and we 
                        all go home. Now, you gonna let us 
                        in there, or what?

                                 SWAT #1
                            (amused with himself)
                        I'm gonna go with the "or what'. 

                                 VASQUEZ
                        Call Linden on the radio and tell 
                        her I have the dress.

           He laughs, shaking his head "no".
                                 VASQUEZ (CONT’D)
                            (looks to the other cops)
                        Are you guys kidding me with this?

           Susan, uses her middle-aged female powers of invisibility, 
           quietly unlocks the door with her own keys, slips in and 
           holds the door for Vasquez, who darts in. The door is almost 
           closed, when Susan's head pops back out.

                                 SUSAN
                        I sure hope you enjoy being a jerk, 
                        because no one else enjoys you 
                        being a jerk.

           She slams the door. One of the guys laughs at SWAT 1.

                                 SWAT #1
                        Fuck you.

                        You're hardly welcome. I am here 
                        out of civic duty. I look forward

           Despite her words, Helen seems to enjoy all the attention.

                        Sure. Why do you think we were so  
                        insistent you come down here today?

                                 HELEN
                        Because you're angry, most likely.

                        Your kind are always angry about 
                        something. So bitter, you are.

                                 FRAN
                            (hushed to Althea)
                        Don't tell me that shit!

                                 HELEN (O.S. SCREEN)
                        Ex-cuse me?

                                 FRAN
                        Sorry, not you, it's- Wait, my 
                        kind? And what do you mean by that?

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Helen is distracted by the arrival of Vasquez and Susan.

                                 LINDEN
                            (hushed, but all smiles)
                        Holy cow! Is that the dress?

           Susan nods 'yes', thrilled but mostly relieved and exhausted. 
           Mike goes to hug her, and she gives him the "stop" hand.

                                 SUSAN
                        I will tell you what I used to tell 
                        my son when he was bad. I hope you 
                        really enjoy being a jerk, because 
                        no one else...

           Linden shakes Vasquez' hand heartily, and notices the glitter 
           on her from earlier. She almost asks, but decides against it.

                                 LINDEN
                            (extra hushed)
                        That's great, thank you, thank you, 
                        thank you, but we're in the-uh- 
                        middle of something.

           Vasquez realizes this is the Helen Beaumont and offers Linden 
           a fist bump. Linden hesitates, then accepts, 'why not?'.
           Helen summons her most graceful, pedantic posture and form.

                                 HELEN
                        Your kind? Liberals, always howling 
                        when the alternate reality you have 
                        on campus meets the real world.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Candace watches and fidgets her gun, no one notices.

                                 FRAN
                        As I recall, I was minding my own 
                        business when you came upon me. 
                        Instead of minding your beeswax, 
                        you howled to the manager. I guess, 
                        I'm a reality you disagree with? 

           INT. COSMETICS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 HELEN
                        The manager of the store should 
                        have said so, if your presence in 
                        the women's lavatory was allowed.

                                 FRAN (O.S. SCREEN)
                        Now who's in an alternate reality? 
                        You've probably spent more on a 
                        coat here than I earn in a month. 
                        In what world does he take my side?

                                 HELEN
                        That is hardly my fault.

                                 FRAN (O.S. SCREEN)
                        It's not your fault you were born 
                        into so much wealth that people 
                        tend to just do what you ask?

                                 HELEN
                            (deflecting)
                        I've several gay friends, you know.

                                 FRAN (O.S. SCREEN)
                            (finds that quite amusing)
                        Wow. Did you tell your three gay, 
                        and no doubt wealthy friends what 
                        you did here?
                                 HELEN
                        This is class war nonsense. You're 
                        making me out to be some villain. 
                        I'm not a reactionary caricature.

           They both realize they're fired up and sort of enjoying this.

                                 FRAN (O.S. SCREEN)
                        Am I a villain? For getting 
                        emotional while trying on wedding 
                        dresses and taking my tears to the 
                        ladies room? Feeling pretty but 
                        ugly, happy but sad? Only to get 
                        harassed by some looky-loo 
                        scrutinizing my entire body?

           They hold each other's gaze for a long beat, Helen flinches.

           The store's front doors break open. CHAOS from outside 
           WHOOSHES in. A TROMPING phalanx of federal troops led by 
           AGENT CARRUTHERS (30s, white, suit). Acres and Gary follow in 
           their wake.

           The Mayor intercepts Carruthers and his men before they can 
           reach a distracted Beaumont and the camera, shhhhhh!

                                 MAYOR
                        Hello, Mayor Ralph Evans, who do I 
                        have the pleasure of addressing?

                                 CARRUTHERS
                        Try answering your phone, asshole.
                        Charles Carruthers, Homeland 
                        Security. This- 
                            (waves at camera et al.)
                        -this is over.

                        We're just about wrapping up here, 
                        then we can brief you.

                                 CARRUTHERS
                            (patronizing)
                        Uh huh. That ship has sailed, pal.

           Back to Helen, who notices Fran snapping her fingers on the 
           monitor trying to bring her attention back to the screen.

           INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

                        Yes. Any man who identifies as a 
                        woman can just waltz into the 
                        ladies room? The changing room? I

                        And yet, I am the one who was 
                        harassed and thrown out. Don't I 
                        have that same right to safety?

           Helen's refusal to answer this question is her answer.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        I must have seemed terrifying,

           The callback to Fran's own earlier, jokes, makes her chuckle.

                                 FRAN
                        You're aware there's no lock on 
                        that door, right? Any man can just 
                        walk right in anytime, without 
                        going through the trouble of 
                        pretending to identify as anything.

           Helen's lost her footing for a moment, but doesn't slip-
                                 FRAN (O.S. SCREEN)
                        Maybe one of your foundations could  
                        research what turns men into 
                        rapists instead of fussing over who 
                        pees where.

           -and returns to her talking points.

                                 HELEN
                        Men are men. Women are women. Real

                        Fact is, I'm a woman.

                                 HELEN
                        Don't be fatuous. You may feel like 
                        something other than a man inside, 
                        but I've a uterus inside. You libs 
                        are always crying, science this,

                        I speak for the silent majority of 
                        real women, and we're entitled to-

                        To more rights than a trans woman?

                        You are the ones entering our 
                        space. You are the transgressors.

           Helen had been saving that one, and relishes it.

                        Ha. I see what you did there. And 
                        yet, trans women are women too.

                        You are assuredly not like me.

                        I am keenly aware of the reality of 
                        my body versus yours. I mean, 
                        that's sort of what being trans is. 
                        And yet, I am a woman.

                        A dress doesn't make you female.

                        wearing those tacky earrings? 

           Helen, not used to be spoken to like this, is indignant.

           A beat. Helen is embarrassed, and out of talking points.

                        am I?

           Fran takes a beat before replying.

                                 FRAN
                        I don't know, but if your idea of  
                        womanhood is just making babies, 
                        and looking pretty, I pity you.

           Helen is flummoxed. She goes to speak but no words come out.

                        recommend a wonderful therapist.

           Helen won't look at Fran or the camera. She sits up straight 
           retreating to her posh-ness, avoiding the eyes of everyone.

           her gun. The camera is knocked to the floor and breaks.

                        I'm fine, but you gotta come out 
                        now. People are going nuts out 
                        there. Homeland Security is here. 
                        You gotta come out before someone 
                        gets hurt. You won.

           Candace looks at the gun she was never really going to use.

                                 ALTHEA
                        I was never going to use mine 
                        either, don't feel bad.

           Althea grabs Candace's handbag and offers it back to her. 
           Candace takes it, puts her gun away and zips it up. Althea 
           unloads her own weapon and makes sure the chamber is clear.

                        brought. The rest were dummies.

           Candace is salty to find she'd been had all this time.

                        What did you think? We were going 
                        to jump down the toilet in a 
                        Cadillac, holding hands? Or go out 
                        there guns a' blazing like Butch 
                        and Sundance? This all ends on a 
                        freeze frame?

           Candace touches the wound on her head, and maybe she really 
           sees Althea for the first time.

                        Quick, before my boss hears. OK?

           Fran unlocks the door. Gary slips in with the dress. She 
           locks the door behind him, and they have quite a hug.

           for the moment. They talk into phones and give orders.

           Fran and Gary stand before the mayor, who can't believe he is 
           going along with this. Fran and Althea are already in cuffs. 
           Fran has to turn around so they can put rings on one another.

                        And with these rings I now 
                        pronounce you man and wife.

           Althea by the arms and drag them toward the front door.

           Dawn breaks. The crowd is still there. Half cheer, the others 
           boo. Some transphobic and homophobic invective is hurled.

           Althea and Fran are exhausted but proud. From atop the steps, 
           they survey the scene their actions generated. Below them, 
           the barricaded aisle they head down splits the two factions.
                                 FRAN
                        Shouldn't they be on the right and 
                        them on the left?

                                 ALTHEA
                            (mulls, then)
                        Not from their point of view.

           BAM! A gunshot echoes. Everyone hits the deck, or stampedes. 
           The angriest elements on each side, overwhelm and discard the 
           barriers, charging at each other. Glass breaks, haymakers are 
           thrown, heads are cracked; it's civil war.

           Althea's eyes bug out, hyper alert and in war zone mode, 
           tinged with PTSD. She picks herself up, assesses, surveys and 
           finds Fran clutching her belly. She's hit right dead center 
           in the abdomen, blood is pooling from just below her navel. 

                                 FRAN
                        Ach, my dress.

           Althea begins triage with tears in her eyes. Gary runs to her 
           side. Fran's eyes roll back in her head. Vasquez takes a 
           knee, providing cover. Even Mike shows a lot of concern.

           SCREAMS and SHOUTS are heard from the MELEE, more GUNSHOTS. 
           Tear gas drifts with the dirty naptha smoke of a Molotov

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF INCARCERATION LATER

                                                          FADE IN:

           INT. OLD SCHOOL VIDEO ARCADE - DAY

           Tonya, Gary and others clear the table of pizza remains and 
           plates, while setting up for cake. A "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HENRY" 
           sign is hung with some balloons. 

           A beat. Fran rolls up in a wheelchair, and nudges Gary. 

                                 FRAN
                        I'm getting pretty good at this.

           She shows him an almost wheelie, wobbles, gives herself a 
           little scare and settles back down. It makes Gary anxious.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, that bathroom made me miss the 
                        one at Nordtrom's. 

                                 (MORE)
                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                            (she points back in the 
                            direction she came from)
                        If that's what we're calling 
                        "accessible" in 2020, someone ought 
                        to do something...

           Gary's face says, "Oh dear. Please, not again". Fran winks.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        Relax, I don't have anything too 
                        drastic in mind. 

           She looks longingly over at the vintage 80's arcade games.

                                 FRAN (CONT’D)
                        And how am I ever going to beat my 
                        high score at Galaga with the 
                        joystick way up there now? 

           A STRANGER (20s, non-binary, dorky) approaches, timidly.

                                 STRANGER
                        Hi. I am so sorry to bother you, 
                        but you're Fran Carter, right?

           Fran nods, not thrilled to be hassled, but she likes the cut 
           of this kid's jib.

                                 STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        You are the one of baddest bitches, 
                        ever. I just had to say thank you.

           Fran feels awkward, and unsure just what to make of that.

                                 FRAN
                        You're welcome? I guess.
                            (pats the arm of her 
                            chair)
                        Don't play with guns though, ok? 

                                 STRANGER
                        Yes. Of course. Thank you.
                            (beat)
                        Can I get a picture with you?

                                 FRAN
                        Sure, but only if you take ten and 
                        let me choose which one you share.

           The stranger enthusiastically nods, and they huddle up for 
           some selfies.

           Elsewhere, Althea and Henry play Skee-Ball, sharing a bag of 
           popcorn. They are clearly enjoying themselves.
                                 HENRY
                        Mom's boyfriend smells weird, but 
                        he's really good at video games and 
                        he let's me play a lot.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Oh yeah? He seems like a nice guy. 
                        I'm happy your Mom has a friend. 
                        It's good to have friends.

           Henry looks for the courage to say something.

                                 HENRY
                        If you're a Mom too now, it's 
                        confusing, because then... then you 
                        both have the same name, "Mom".

           Althea can see that he is very concerned by this, and 
           reflects that gravity to show Henry that she gets it.

                                 ALTHEA
                            (lining up her last shot)
                        Did you know that in Japan, some 
                        kids call their mothers Haha.

           BONK BONK BONK, the shot bounces out for a measly 15 points.

                                 HENRY
                        Haha? That's so funny.

                                 ALTHEA
                        Ain't it though?

                                 HENRY
                        HA-HA-HA, Haha.

           They enjoy this laugh. The game is over. Henry excitedly 
           gathers the tickets the game spits out.

                                 ALTHEA
                        We should probably go, I think it's 
                        almost cake time. Can't have cake 
                        without the birthday boy, right?

                                 HENRY
                        OK, Haha

           They head toward the others. Henry's hand reaches up for 
           Althea's hand with the popcorn. Althea tips the bag toward 
           him, offering the corn. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Uh-uh.
           Henry takes the bag of popcorn from her, but only so he can 
           put his little hand Althea's hand and hold it. Althea looks 
           at the hand in her hand, and her eyes smile with a radiance 
           that we haven't seen till this moment.

           They are welcomed to the party zone with big smiles from 
           Tonya and the new boyfriend, Fran's new friend, the stranger, 
           Gary, and a few kids who just drool over the cake.
