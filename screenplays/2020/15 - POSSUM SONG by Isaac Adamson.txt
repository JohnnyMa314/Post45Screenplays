           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Moonlight and shadows.

           A POSSUM waddles down the middle of the road. He stops, 
           sensing danger. Looks back over his shoulder.

           Pinpricks of light emerge in the distance behind him. 
           Headlights. They grow closer, bigger. 

           The lights belong to a massive, gleaming black semi-truck. It 
           bears down on the possum, coming right at him with demonic, 
           otherworldly speed. 

           Blinded by the headlights, rattled by deafening ROAR of the 
           the semi, the possum freezes. It’s too late to flee. 

           The possum’s lips curl back. His eyes close. His body grows 
           rigid. He loses consciousness, falls over just as...

           The truck THUNDERS over him, tires racing by on either side 
           of his body, undercarriage passing overhead, the sound like a 
           chorus of SCREAMING dead animal souls...

           ...and then the truck continues past him and is gone.  

           DAY

           The possum lies rigor mortis stiff in the middle of the road, 
           eyes squeezed closed, mouth a sharp-toothed rictus. Noxious 
           liquid the color of anti-freeze is pooled on the asphalt 
           beneath his anus. 

           Its ears twitch. Its back legs kick. It opens its eyes and 
           springs to its feet, very much alive. 

           We follow the possum as it saunters away from the road and 
           cuts into a mossy forest.

           INT. TV STUDIO - BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           We follow country star EDDIE VESCO (32) -- rangy, blue-eyed, 
           a tall glass of water -- as a starstruck PRODUCTION ASSISTANT 
           (20s, female) escorts him down a backstage hallway. 

           SUPER: “NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE”

           His manager RANDY (40s) follows.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m just saying you need to rein in 
                        the spending a little. The advance--
                                 EDDIE
                        You’re my accountant now? Thought 
                        you were my manager.

                                 RANDY
                        You won’t take Jim’s calls, so he 
                        told me to tell you. He’s 
                        concerned.

                                 EDDIE
                        He’s always concerned.
                             (to Production Assistant)
                        That’s why I don’t take his calls.

           He winks at her. She smiles, charmed.

                                 RANDY
                        You signed a contract, Eddie. The 
                        clock is ticking. If you don’t 
                        deliver demos in two weeks, you 
                        have to return the advance money. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Already spent the advance money.

           This is so not what Randy wanted to hear.

                                 RANDY
                        Shit. Okay. Shit. That being the 
                        case we need to come up with a 
                        plan, otherwise--

                                 EDDIE
                        Eddie Vesco has a plan.

                                 RANDY
                        What?

                                 EDDIE
                        Eddie Vesco has a plan.

                                 RANDY
                        You have a plan?

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Production Assistant, 
                              off Randy)
                        Best ears in country music, right 
                        there.
                             (to Randy, louder)
                        I have a plan.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s your plan?
                                 EDDIE
                        You’re about to find out.

           Randy is confounded. Over the PA system, we hear the voice of 
           show co-host KATIE COOK.

                                 KATIE COOK (V.O.)(O.S.)
                        Now put your hands together and 
                        give a warm Nashville welcome to 
                        the one and only Eddie Vesco! 

           The Production Assistant parts a curtain. Eddies passes 
           through it...

           INT. TV STUDIO - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           ...and strolls onstage to massive APPLAUSE. He’s on the set 
           of the “CMT Hot Twenty” TV show. Eddie waves to the audience. 
           He crosses to shake hands with co-host CODY ALLAN, then gives 
           her cohort Katie Cook a hug.  

           Eddie acknowledges the audience once more and then sits as 
           the applause dies down.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Welcome back.

                                 EDDIE
                        Good to be here. 

                                 KATIE COOK
                        You’ve been lying low on us.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        Tell us what you’ve been up to.  

                                 EDDIE
                        Well, after being on the road 
                        forever with my last record, I 
                        needed to step away for a awhile. 
                        Decided to use that time to get 
                        involved with a few community 
                        programs that are close to my 
                        heart.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        We understand you volunteer at an 
                        animal shelter?
                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah, I love animals. But I’m here 
                        today to talk about my new project, 
                        which is CRIME.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        You do realize we’re on national 
                        TV?

           Audience LAUGHTER.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ha! It’s nothing like that. CRIME 
                        stands for Creative Rehabilitation 
                        of Inmates through Musical 
                        Education. Most folks know my 
                        story. I had substance abuse 
                        issues. Did some things I’m not too 
                        proud of. As a result, I was 
                        incarcerated for a spell. 

           The hosts nod sympathetically. Randy looks on from the wings.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s when I got focused on 
                        songwriting. Prison gave me a 
                        second chance. By putting CRIME 
                        behind bars, as we like to say, we 
                        aim to help folks turn their lives 
                        around. Just like I did.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        Sounds like a great program.

           The audience politely CLAPS.

                                 EDDIE
                        You can learn more about it on my 
                        Twitter. Uh, Instagram. There’s a 
                        whatsit, a hashtag...

                                 KATIE COOK
                        We’ll post links. But now here’s 
                        the question that’s on everyone’s 
                        mind -- when can we expect the next 
                        Eddie Vesco record?

           The audience MURMURS in agreement. Eddie gives them a smile.

                                 EDDIE
                        Funny you should ask.

           OFFSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
           Randy listens. On pins and needles.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Just so happens, I’m headed up to 
                        the farmhouse next week. 

           Randy smiles, relieved. It’s about time.

           INT. MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie lies in a giant bed inside his opulent bedroom. Next to 
           him, his wife CHARLENE (28), former model turned painter now 
           five months pregnant. 

           Both eat bowls of ice cream and watch Eddie’s TV appearance.

                                 CODY ALLAN (V.O.)(O.S.)
                        This is where you write? 

           One of Charlene’s works hangs on the wall behind the bed -- 
           an amateurish, strangely disturbing portrait of herself and 
           Eddie on their wedding day.

                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        Yes, sir. I rustle up maybe twenty 
                        song ideas, just embryonic sketches 
                        really, and then I head off to this 
                        old farmhouse out in the country. 
                        Can’t say exactly where, you 
                        understand.

           On TV: Eddie winks at Katie Cook.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Look at you winking at her.

           Charlene jabs an elbow in his ribs. He chuckles.

                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        Up there it’s just me, an old reel-
                        to-reel recorder. A couple guitars, 
                        a beat up piano. I work on the 
                        songs until I’ve narrowed them down 
                        to thirteen I can live with.

                                 CODY ALLAN (V.O.)
                        And that’s the album?
                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        Pretty much. Then it’s just a 
                        matter of bringing those thirteen 
                        songs back here to Nashville, 
                        prettying them up and setting them 
                        loose. 

                                 KATIE COOK (V.O.)
                        I bet our audience would love a 
                        behind-the-scenes peek at the Eddie 
                        Vesco creative process.
                             (off audience applause)
                        Any chance we could come visit?

                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        Well, songwriting is a messy 
                        business. 
                             (smiles)
                        But I tell you what. When I get 
                        back, maybe I’ll bring one of the 
                        demos with me and you can give it a 
                        listen.
                             (to audience)
                        What do y’all think?

           On TV: The audience goes wild. Eddie grins, eating it up.

           Charlene switches OFF the TV. Eddie gives her a look.

                                 EDDIE
                        I was just getting to the part 
                        where I talked about you and your 
                        painting.

           She puts down her ice cream bowl. Nuzzles against him.

                                 CHARLENE
                        You really have to go do this now?

                                 EDDIE
                        I owe them a record. 
                             (off her baby bump)
                        Besides, that baby is going to need 
                        diapers. Last I checked, those 
                        weren’t free.

                                 CHARLENE
                        But why some rundown old farmhouse? 
                        Why can’t you just do it here? Or 
                        better, we could go to Paris. I 
                        could study paintings at the Louvre 
                        while you messed around with your 
                        songs.
                                 EDDIE
                        There’s just something about that 
                        farmhouse. Hell, it’s brought Eddie 
                        Vesco a platinum record, a Grammy 
                        and two CMAs, and you. 

                                 CHARLENE
                        That’s what I am to you? Some kind 
                        of prize?

                                 EDDIE 
                        I didn’t mean it that way.

                                 CHARLENE
                        And how do I know you aren’t 
                        shacking up with some honey out 
                        there?

           Eddie puts his ice cream down. Puts his arm around her.

                                 EDDIE
                        I tell you what. You call anytime, 
                        day or night, and I’ll pick up in 
                        two rings. Even if I’m in the 
                        middle of laying down the track 
                        that’s gonna put Eddie Junior 
                        through college. How about that?

                                 CHARLENE
                        ‘Eddie Junior?’ What makes you so 
                        sure it’s a boy? 

                                 EDDIE
                        I just reckoned we’d name it Eddie 
                        either way.

           Charlene shakes her head. Crawls on top of him.

                                 CHARLENE
                        You gonna write a love song for me?

                                 EDDIE
                        Sorry, I don’t take no requests.

           Charlene punches him playfully in the arm. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey now, not in front of the baby. 
                        You don’t want to set a bad 
                        example. 

           She turns off the nightstand light. 
                                 CHARLENE
                        Baby ain’t here yet. We still got 
                        time to be a little bad.

           Eddie grins in the dark. Life is good.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - DAY (MOVING)

           A beautiful sunny day. Eddie rumbles down a Nashville 
           freeway, full of excitement as he energetically sings along 
           to some Garth Brooks (or similar) on the radio.

                                 EDDIE
                             (singing)
                        I’ve got friends in low places, 
                        where the whiskey flows and the 
                        beer chases my blues away...

           NIGHT

           Tired now, he moves down a deserted, two-lane rural highway, 
           mumble-singing to Hank Williams’ “Lost Highway.”

                                 EDDIE/HANK WILLIAMS 
                             (singing)
                        Now boys don’t start
                        Your rambling round...

           He spots a pair of GLOWING EYES in the road ahead. Slows.

                                 EDDIE/HANK WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
                        On this road of sin
                        Or you’re sorrow bound...

           Frozen in the headlights is a big fat raccoon. Eddie brakes 
           to a stop. Quits singing. The raccoon just stares at him. 
           Eddie gives the HORN a tap.

                                 EDDIE
                        Go ahead, buddy. I’m waiting.

           The raccoon resumes crossing. Its comical waddle makes Eddie 
           smile a little.

                                 HANK WILLIAMS (ON STEREO)
                        Take my advice
                        Or you’ll curse the day...

           The raccoon has just made it across the center yellow line 
           when Eddie spots pinpricks of light in the distance. 
           Headlights of an oncoming vehicle. They rush closer with 
           demonic, otherworldly speed. 
           Eddie flashes his brights to get the driver’s attention.

                                 EDDIE
                        Slow down, mister.

           The semi-truck doesn’t. The raccoon is smack dab in the 
           middle of the opposite lane now, right in the truck’s path.

                                 HANK  WILLIAMS (ON STEREO)
                        You started rolling down...

           Eddie lays on the HORN. The semi-truck just keeps coming, 
           headlights growing bigger, brighter, blinding...

           ...and then there’s a dull THUD and a SPLAT as the same 
           massive, gleaming black semi-truck we saw earlier pulverizes 
           the poor creature. 

           The truck thunders past with a harrowing ROAR...

           ...and recedes in the distance. All is silent. 

                                 HANK WILLIAMS (ON STEREO)
                        ...that lost highway.

           Eddie gazes sadly out the windshield at the dead raccoon. Its  
           mouth agape, body flattened, gore besmirched.

                                 EDDIE
                        Christ almighty.

           Eddie glances in the rearview mirror. The semi-truck is long 
           gone. Like it was never even there.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT 

           Moonlight throws shadows across the road as Eddie navigates 
           slowly down a narrow, one-lane dirt road lined by mossy 
           forest on either side.

           Nothing on the stereo now. It’s quiet. Spooky.

           The headlights illuminate a ramshackle farmhouse up ahead. 

           Eddie pulls to a stop. Cuts the engine. Kills the lights.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eddie carries a duffle bag in one hand and a case of beer in 
           the other as he approaches, taking in the old farmhouse. 
           Sagging porch, peeling paint, yard overgrown with weeds.
           Crickets sing. An owl hoots.

           He walks up the rickety porch stairs. Pulls open a CREAKY 
           screen door. Pushes the main door open.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie enters, drops his bag. Puts down the case of beer. 

           He crosses to the living room. Turns on the light. There’s an 
           old grandfather click quietly TICKING. A threadbare couch. 
           Coffee table. Ratty rug. 

           Eddie wrinkles his nose. Bad smell.

                                 EDDIE
                        Jesus.

           He crosses. Opens a window. Better.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie moves towards a door at the end of the hallway. Just as 
           he reaches out to open it, he’s startled by a SKITTERING 
           sound from inside the walls.

           He stops. Listens. No more sounds. He opens the door.

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie enters, flips on a light switch. He takes in the room.

           It’s filled with musical equipment, most of it old and worn.  
           A couple acoustic guitars. An old electric hollow body 
           Gibson. A stand up bass. Barebones drum kit. Dusty amps 
           stacked six foot high in the corner. Mic stands. Cables.  

           Upon a low table sits a reel-to-reel four track tape 
           recorder. Next to it, a beat to hell upright piano.

           Eddie crosses to it. PLUNKS a key. He plays the intro lick to 
           ‘Dueling Banjos’...but hits a jarringly wrong last note. 

                                 OTIS (O.S.)
                        Always did manage to land on a sour 
                        note.

           Eddie turns. Sitting against the wall is OTIS REDFERN (43, 
           Black) -- scrawny, feral. Meth mouth, greasy hair under a 
           greasy ballcap pulled low over his ears. His face is covered 
           with weird scratch marks.
                                 EDDIE
                        Thought there was a bad smell in 
                        here.

           Otis chews off a slice of his fingernail. SPITS it out. 
           There’s another SKITTERING sound in the wall behind him. 

                                 OTIS
                        Critters in the walls.
                             (smiles)
                        My muses.

           Eddie gestures to the four track tape recorder.

                                 EDDIE
                        My songs on there?

                                 OTIS
                        Seven down, five to go.

                                 EDDIE
                        That’s twelve, Otis. Seven and five 
                        is twelve.

                                 OTIS
                        Six to go then. You got something 
                        for me?

           Eddie reaches into his jacket. Removes a small plastic bag 
           filled with stacks of cash. He tosses the bag to Otis. Otis 
           tries to catch it, misses.

                                 EDDIE
                        Five thousand dollars.

                                 OTIS
                        Deal was thirteen.

                                 EDDIE
                        Deal was for thirteen songs.  

                                 OTIS
                        You’ll get your songs.

                                 EDDIE
                        And when I do, you’ll get the rest 
                        of your money. Shit, I thought 
                        you’d have ten for me by now. Ten 
                        at least. What you been up to here 
                        all week?

           Otis scratches his the back of his forearm. 
                                 OTIS
                        You in some kind of hurry, Eddie?

           Eddie steps to him. Kneels so they’re face-to-face.

                                 EDDIE
                        Nah, I ain’t in no hurry. 
                        Except...well, thing is, Eddie 
                        Vesco’s got this career that’s like 
                        a brand new Ferrari. It’s waxed 
                        down and gassed up and ready to 
                        rumble. But for the past two years, 
                        this Ferrari has just been sitting 
                        on cinder blocks because your 
                        junkie ass had to go and get locked 
                        up again. So excuse me if the sight 
                        of you sitting here scratching 
                        yourself and munching on your 
                        booger hooks has got me sounding 
                        less than patient.

           Otis chews another nail. Spits it out.

                                 OTIS
                        I’ll finish them songs.
                             (then)
                        Except I’m thinking maybe this time 
                        you keep your money. And I’ll keep 
                        them songs. Go make my own record. 
                        Tour the world. Make a million 
                        dollars, marry some model... 

                                 EDDIE
                        Charlene isn’t just some model. 

                                 OTIS
                        ...live in a big ol’ mansion...

                                 EDDIE
                        She’s an artist. And a damn good 
                        one, too.

                                 OTIS
                        ...get me a gold record and a nice 
                        new truck. I’m thinking maybe I’ll 
                        just do that instead.

           Eddie smiles. Tugs the brim of Otis’s cap down. Otis swats at 
           his hand, annoyed, but misses. 

                                 EDDIE
                        You do you, buddy. 

           Eddie stands. Crosses. Picks up an acoustic guitar.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Just make sure you think this 
                        through.

           Eddie strums an open chord. Winces. The guitar is out of 
           tune. He plucks open strings and twists the tuning pegs, 
           trying to put it right as he speaks.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, if you believe that night 
                        after night thousands of people are 
                        gonna travel from miles around and 
                        spend money they don’t have to see 
                        your scrawny old ass stumble out 
                        there quivering and shaking all 
                        dope sick, then sure. Go for it. 

           Otis glowers.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Course, some folks may get upset 
                        when that chicken squawk voice of 
                        yours gives out after only two 
                        songs. Or you have to cancel a 
                        bunch of dates because of 
                        “exhaustion” or “laryngitis” or 
                        “the flu.” But you know, haters 
                        gonna hate.  

           Eddie continues tuning but for all his confident plucking and 
           peg twisting, he’s only making the guitar sound worse.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Media is a pain in the ass, too. 
                        Sitting through all them 
                        interviews, trying to smile and be 
                        polite and sound smart. People 
                        taking your picture all the damn 
                        time. But a handsome, educated 
                        young fella like you? I don’t 
                        foresee any problems there.

                                 OTIS
                        Alright. You said your piece.

                                 EDDIE
                        The only problem I can see, the one 
                        detail that could get in your way, 
                        is if anyone were to find out you 
                        spent eighteen years in prison for 
                        killing your wife. 

           Otis glares at him.
                                 OTIS
                        I’m an innocent man.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hell, maybe you are. Except you 
                        couldn’t convince no judge and 
                        jury, could you? But hey, maybe 
                        you’ll do better with the American 
                        public. They’re a non-judgemental, 
                        open minded bunch. If you think 
                        that, then by all means. Shoot your 
                        shot. 

           Eddie strums the guitar. It sounds awful now, completely out 
           of tune. Oblivious, Eddie puts it down with a smile.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Otherwise? Maybe we just stick to 
                        our arrangement.

           Otis stands. Tears in his eyes. He steps to Eddie.

                                 OTIS
                        You’re a mean son of a bitch. 
                        That’s what no one knows about 
                        Eddie Vesco. Underneath it all, 
                        you’re nothing but a lowdown 
                        vermin.

           Eddie turns. Strolls toward the door. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Finish them songs, Otis.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

           Eddie kicks back in a rocking chair, drinking beer, watching 
           fireflies dance in the yard. He listens through the wall as 
           Otis plays a demo he’s been working on. It has no vocals yet. 

           Eddie calls over his shoulder, into the house.

                                 EDDIE
                        Damn, Otis. You sure can put chords 
                        together. Think how good those are 
                        gonna sound with my voice. Could be 
                        Eddie Vesco’s best record yet.

           Otis stops the playback.
                                 OTIS (O.S.)
                        Gonna need you to go ahead and shut 
                        the fuck up now so I can get to 
                        work.

                                 EDDIE
                             (amused)
                        Sure, buddy. You’re the boss.

           Eddie is taking another sip of beer when he’s startled by a 
           noise behind him. He turns and glimpses a naked rodent tail 
           as it slithers into a hole in the wall. 

           Eddie shudders. Shakes his head. Takes another sip.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           Otis sits on the piano bench, scratching. He ties a ligature 
           around his arm. He takes out a baggie of heroin and a spoon. 
           Then he looks to a small hole in the wall near the drum kit.

           Inside the hole, two beady eyes stare back at him.

                                 OTIS
                        Don’t worry. I won’t let nothing 
                        happen to you.

           Otis cooks up his heroin shot. Produces a needle. 

                                 OTIS (CONT’D)
                        Just need to take my medicine, then 
                        we’ll get started.

           He draws the liquid into a needle. In the other room, the 
           grandfather clock begins its MIDNIGHT CHIME.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Blue skies and sun. Birds singing in the breeze. 

           Another glorious day in God’s country.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A bleary-eyed Eddie wakes on the couch, disoriented. He 
           squints at the empty beer cans on the coffee table and 
           remembers where he is.

           He rises unsteadily, head throbbing.
           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie enters the kitchen. Opens the fridge. 

           Inside, nothing but a half empty two-liter bottle of grape 
           soda and a take-out container.

           Eddie opens the take out container. It’s filled with worms 
           wriggling in dirt. He makes a face, disgusted. Yells.

                                 EDDIE
                        Otis, goddamnit. Can you not keep 
                        your fish bait in the fucking 
                        fridge for Christ’s sake?

           No answer. Not that he was expecting one. He puts back the 
           container, closes the fridge door.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie snorts and scratches his ass and makes his way toward 
           the music room door. KNOCKS on it.

                                 EDDIE
                        You in there?
                             (beat)
                        Come on, Otis.

           Silence. Eddie pushes the door opened.

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie enters. Looks around the room. Finally spots Otis lying 
           on the floor near the piano bench.

                                 EDDIE
                        Rise and shine, buddy.

           No reply. Eddie crosses. Nudges Otis with his boot.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Wake your ass up.

           Eddie shoves him harder with his boot. Otis rolls over. His 
           eyes are squeezed closed, stiff blue lips pulled back in a 
           rictus of a smile. 

           Otis is deader than disco.

           Eddie eyes the ligature nearby. The spoon. The needle. A 
           baggie of heroin.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        You dumb son of a bitch.

           He backs away. Paces. Frightened. Unsure what to do. He eyes 
           the tape recorder sitting on the table. Eyes Otis again.

           At length he reaches a silent decision.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - DAY (MOVING)

           Eddie motors up the narrow dirt road. The radio HISSES 
           static. He turns it off, focused on the task at hand.

           Eddie eyes the rearview mirror. Sees Otis’s body wrapped in a 
           blue tarp in the back of the pick up truck.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SUNSET

           Two tire-tracks cutting through weeds. Eddie pulls over. 

           He looks around. One one side, thick forest. On the other, an 
           old railroad trestle bridge crossing a deep river.  

           Eddie walks to the back of the pick-up. He takes another look 
           to make sure no one is around, then OPENS the tailgate.

           The tarp SNAPS and RUSTLES in the wind.

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Shouldering Otis’s tarp-wrapped corpse, Eddie crashes through 
           underbrush and trees as he heads down the embankment toward 
           the river. He sweats with the effort.

                                 EDDIE
                             (breathless)
                        How’d a skinny bastard like you get 
                        so damn heavy?

           He stumbles, nearly falling. Rights himself. Continues.

           EXT. RIVER BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie lurches down the side of the river until he has reached 
           the base of the trestle bridge. He tries to lower Otis gently 
           to the ground but loses his grip. 

           Eddie winces as Otis hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. 
                                 EDDIE
                        My bad.

           He checks one more time to make sure no one is watching, then 
           unwraps the tarp. 

           He drags Otis corpse across the ground by its heels, then 
           props it into a sitting position against the base of the 
           bridge. 

           He then arranges the heroin gear nearby -- the ligature, 
           baggie, spoon, hypodermic needle.

           Eddie rolls up the tarp. Tucks it under his arm. Then he 
           steps back, scrutinizes his work.

           The wind blows harder now.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry, Otis. But Eddie Vesco 
                        can’t have folks sniffing around, 
                        asking about what you were doing at 
                        the farmhouse and such. Even if I 
                        buried you, well, you might still 
                        get found, and then it would look 
                        like foul play. Instead of what it 
                        was, which was you dying from the 
                        pre-existing condition of being a 
                        dumbass. 
                             (then)
                        Not to speak ill of the dead. 
                             (then)
                        So this is gonna have to do for 
                        your final resting place. 
                             (then)
                        I guess I should say a few words.

           Eddie removes his hat. Lowers his head.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Dear Lord, here lies -- er, sits -- 
                        Otis Redfern. He might not have 
                        been what you’d call a good man, 
                        but he wasn’t the worst. Taught me 
                        a lot about music when we were cell 
                        mates. And he wrote some damn good 
                        songs for that first album of mine.
                             (then)
                        Otis, I hope we cross paths again 
                        one day. Don’t want think too much 
                        about where that might be, but I 
                        reckon at least we’ll have plenty 
                        of company.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Amen.
                             (then)
                        Take care, buddy.

           Eddie’s just turning to leave when a GUST OF WIND blow’s 
           Otis’s hat clean off his head, revealing a large bald spot. 

           As Eddie looks closer, he’s startled to see small, downy 
           white hairs sprouting from the top of Otis’s head. Thick 
           black hairs grow from the upper tips of his ears, which look 
           strangely elongated.

           Eddie turns away, disturbed, and heads up the embankment.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eddie rolls up in his truck, blasting country music. He slams 
           on the brakes, kicking up a cloud of dust that swirls in the 
           headlights. 

           He kills the engine. The music and lights die. All is silent.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie enters. Takes in the room. It feels different now that 
           Otis died here.

           He walks over to the tape recorder. Rewinds it a bit. He puts 
           on the headphones. Hits playback on the last song Otis was 
           recording. A slow, dark country dirge on piano. He hears 
           Otis’s phlegmatic, slurry delivery of the lyric...

                                 OTIS (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        She said ‘I’ve come,
                        But I cannot stay,
                        Wind what carried me here,
                        Gonna carry me away.’

           Eddie listens intently, moved by the song. The tune goes on a 
           moment longer...then there’s a PIANO CRASH like someone 
           hitting the keyboard followed by...

           ...the SCREECH of animal? 

           Then silence.

           Puzzled, he rewinds. Listens again.

                                 OTIS (V.O.)
                        Wind what carried me here,
                        Gonna carry me away.
           Then CRASH. SQUEAL. Silence. Eddie stops the playback. Takes 
           off the headphones.

           He crosses, sits at the piano. Takes a deep breath. Cracks 
           his knuckles. In the other room, the grandfather clock begins 
           to CHIME midnight.

           Eddie plays a chord. Sings over it...

                                 EDDIE 
                             (singing)
                        She said ‘I’ve come,
                        But I cannot stay...

           He wrinkles his brow. Doesn’t sound right. He tries again 
           with a different starting chord...

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        She said ‘I’ve come...’

           Chord is still wrong. Frustrated, he tries again.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        She said ‘blah blah blah,
                        How you doing today,
                        The wind...
                        It fucking blows...

           Eddie sputters out. He pounds the keyboard. Once, twice, 
           three times, hitting it in time with the chiming of the 
           clock. As both sounds die out he looks up and sees...

           A possum. It’s standing atop the piano, staring right at him. 

           Eddie SCREAMS! Equally startled, the possum HISSES and leaps 
           from the piano.

           The possum scurries across the room. Eddie jumps up from the 
           piano bench, grabs a guitar by the neck. He brandishes it 
           like a club as he chases Possum through the room, trying to 
           corral it toward the door.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You little bastard! Get!

           But instead of going out the door to the hallway, the animal 
           scurries the opposite direction, toward the drum kit. 

           Eddie swings at it and misses, hitting the crash cymbal. 
           CRASH! The cymbal falls, hitting a snare drum, knocking it 
           right in Eddie’s path. 
           He trips over it, making an UNHOLY RACKET as more drums and 
           cymbals come crashing down...

           ...and the possum squeezes into the hole in the wall.

           INNER WALL - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The possum races through a narrow, twisting tunnel in the 
           walls as Eddie rages other the other side.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        Don’t come back now! You hear?

           Terrified, heart POUNDING, the critter clamors over a path 
           strewn with scavenged food remnants -- apple cores, egg 
           shells, animal bones, empty cans of cat food. 

           He hits a downhill section of the tunnel. Falls and tumbles 
           head over heels into the...

           INNER WALL - POSSUM DEN - CONTINUOUS

           ...where he finally rolls to a stop in thick nest of leaves, 
           twigs, discarded food wrappers. The possum lies on his back, 
           eyes closed panting, gasping for breath. 

                                 POSSUM JILL (O.S.)
                        Jack?

           POSSUM JACK -- for that is his name -- opens his eyes to see 
           POSSUM JILL standing over him, looking down, confused.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        You’re back already?

           Possum Jack rolls to his feet. Shakes himself off.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We’ve got to get out here.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Why? What happened?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Patron is gone.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        What?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        There was some new guy in the song 
                        place. 
                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Who?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I don’t know. The guy I saw last 
                        night on the porch. He tried to 
                        kill me. We’ve got to leave. Now.

           Possum Jill grimaces. Begins to pace.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Calm down. Let’s think this 
                        through. You said this guy was in 
                        the song place?
                             (off his nod)
                        Was he making songs?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        He was trying.

           Possum Jill ponders. Reaches a conclusion.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Bite him.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        What? No. Jill, I’m telling you, 
                        this guy is crazy. There are people 
                        you bite, and people you don’t, and 
                        this guy --

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Give him the itch. Make him the new 
                        patron.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        No. No, no, we’ll go somewhere 
                        else. Somewhere new, a place with 
                        lots of patrons, where we can make 
                        an informed choice before --

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Oh no you don’t.

           She steps to him, simmering with anger.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        This was your idea. I wanted to go 
                        to the city, where there’s patrons 
                        everywhere, but no. You insisted we 
                        come here. 

           Possum Jack backs away, intimidated.
                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        You said the old patron wouldn’t 
                        endure, that he was taking too much 
                        medicine, that he was going to die 
                        any moment. You said we’d be able 
                        to feast on him the whole winter.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We would’ve! If this new guy hadn’t 
                        come along and --

           Possum Jill makes a jack off motion.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        If-if-if-if-if. I’m sick to death 
                        of nothing ever being your fault.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Fine. It’s my fault. I’ll take full 
                        responsibility if it makes you feel 
                        better. But we need to get out of 
                        here before --

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        We’re not going anywhere.
                             (then)
                        I’m pregnant.

           Possum Jack takes this in, mouth agape. Possum Jill turns to 
           face the wall, as if looking into the room beyond it. Her 
           resolve hardens.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        Bite him. It’s our only hope.

           LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Eddie is crashed out face down on the couch. His phone rings 
           from the coffee table. Once, twice. He wakes groggily. The 
           phone rings a third time. He picks it up.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hey, sugar.

                        Late night in the studio. How you 
                        doing? 
           INT. MANSION - ART STUDIO - DAY

           The room is crammed with easels and drop cloths and painting 
           supplies. Charlene wears overalls splattered with red paint.

                                 CHARLENE 
                        Been better. I was just at Moxie 
                        Art Supply. Our credit card got 
                        decline.

                                 EDDIE (ON PHONE)
                        It did? I’ll look into it. Just use 
                        the other one for now. What are you 
                        working on?

           On Charlene’s canvas, a lone figure walking down a deserted, 
           moonlit highway. Charlene scrapes away a bit of paint with a 
           sharp, stainless steel palette knife.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh. Right.

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t see how me being there is 
                        gonna affect the outcome much one 
                        way or the other.

                        I’m kidding. I’m kidding.

           He wasn’t.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be there. When is it again?

                                 CHARLENE
                        On Wednesday.
                             (then)
                        How are the songs coming along?

           There’s a sudden SCRATCHING sound under the floorboards 
           beneath his feet. He glowers. Forces cheer into his voice.

                                 EDDIE
                        Good. Everything is good.

           MUSIC ROOM - SUNSET

           Eddie sits at the piano. He unscrews a handle of Jack Daniels 
           and puts it on top of the piano. He looks down at the 
           keyboard, determined. Trying to psyche himself up.

                                 EDDIE
                             (under his breath)
                        Alright, Eddie Vesco. We’re getting 
                        these songs done one way or the 
                        other.

           He plays the opening chord of Otis’s last song.

           HOURS LATER

           Atop the piano, the whiskey bottle is half empty.

           A wasted Eddie plays the same chord again, badly.

           He sways back and forth, glassy eyed. Then he leaps to his 
           feet. Flips the bench over in a rage. He grabs a tambourine 
           and HURLS it against the wall.

           INNER WALL - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Possum Jack winces as the tambourine HITS, the sound 
           reverberating in the tunnel. He cowers, watching Eddie rage. 
           Is he really going to try to bite this mad man?
           MUSIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie lies spread-eagled the floor, laughing maniacally.

           Possum Jack timidly emerges from his hole. He creeps around 
           the drum kit. Tiptoes underneath the piano. 

           He inches closer to Eddie. Petrified now, careful not to make 
           the slightest sound.

           Possum Jack approaches Eddie’s outstretched hand. Summoning 
           every last ounce of courage he opens wide his mouth...

           ...and BITES!

           Eddie hollers! Scrambles to his feet. Sees Possum Jack’s tail 
           snaking around the drum kit. 

           Possum Jack sprints toward the hole in the wall, legs 
           churning, safety just within reach.

           Then he’s suddenly hoisted in the air by his tail, upside 
           down and nose-to-nose with Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Gotcha.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie now carries Possum Jack by the scruff of the neck. 
           Possum Jack SNARLS and HISSES, squirming to break free. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Relax, buddy. I ain’t the killing 
                        type.  

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Still holding Possum Jack aloft in one hand, Eddie searches 
           under the kitchen sink with the other.

                                 EDDIE
                        Just gonna drive you somewhere...

           He finds a sturdy, reusable shopping bag -- good enough -- 
           and a roll of duct tape.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        ...far enough away you don’t never 
                        find your way back. 
           Eddie stands. Starts to lower Possum Jack into the bag. 
           Possum Jack’s eyelids flutter and his mouth goes wide and 
           he’s just about to lose consciousness from fear when his 
           SCREECHES suddenly transform into intelligible English.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Put me down! Please! Let me go!

           Eddie stares. Gape mouthed. Astonished.

           Then he SCREAMS!!!

           He drops the possum on the counter backs away, terrified.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing to be afraid of.

           Eddie’s lips move but no words will come.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        In a moment, you’re going to pass 
                        out. But we’ll speak again soon.

           Eddie turns and races from the room in a panic.

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He stumbles some ways down the hall and then stops, unable to 
           continue. 

           His mouth goes wide and his eyes roll back and he falls like 
           a sack of potatoes.

           NIGHT

           Eddie comes to with a start. Sweaty, achy, vision swimming as 
           he stares at the ceiling. He scratches the throbbing bite 
           wound on his hand. 

           Then he shifts his gaze and sees Possum Jack sitting atop his 
           chest. Eddie SHRIEKS! He sits up, dislodging Possum Jack from 
           his chest, and scrambles backward.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        You’re okay. You’re not 
                        hallucinating or going crazy or 
                        anything like that. I can talk. I 
                        always could. All that’s changed is 
                        you can understand me now because 
                        you have the itch.
                                 EDDIE
                        Wh-wh-wha--

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Relax. It’s a good thing. It means 
                        now I can help you make songs.

           Eddie stares, slackjawed.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Come. I’ll show you.

           Possum Jack traipses down the hall. Eddie rises unsteadily. 
           Shakes his head. Hesitates. Then follows.

           MUSIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Possum Jack walks into the room, then leaps up onto the 
           coffee table next to the tape recorder. Eddie follows.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Let me know when you’re ready.

           Eddie eyes him suspiciously. He REWINDS the tape a bit. Hits 
           PLAY. Nothing but empty TAPE HISS. He rewinds further. Hits 
           PLAY again. Same hiss. Panicked, he rewinds the reel 
           completely back. Hits PLAY. There’s nothing. The reel is 
           completely blank. 

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Old Patron’s songs are gone.

           It takes a moment for this to sink in.

                                 EDDIE
                        No. No, no, no.

           Eddie hits PLAY again, frantically fiddles with knobs on the 
           recorder, hoping against hope. But there’s nothing. Eddie 
           hits STOP, defeated.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We must make new songs. For New 
                        Patron. That’s you.

           Eddie can’t believe it. He looks like he might cry.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Pick an instrument. Any instrument.

                                 EDDIE
                        Seriously?
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Pick one.

           Eddie stands. Looks around. Grabs an acoustic guitar. 

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Do you know chords?

                                 EDDIE
                        Some.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Play a chord. Any chord.

           Eddie smirks. Strums an open G. 

           Possum Jack begins to subtly sway from side-to-side as if 
           animated by the notes’ vibrations. 

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Excellent choice. Now look at me. 
                        Look me right in the eye and play 
                        it again.

           Eddie strums the chord again. As the notes ring out...

           ...the room slowly transforms, growing dark and cavernous. 
           The walls take on a skin like texture and are lined with 
           downy white hairs. It’s like being inside, well, a marsupial 
           pouch. 

           Eddie looks around, freaked out.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Keep your eyes on me. Play the 
                        chord one last time.

           Eddie swallows hard. Strums the chord. Possum Jack sways more 
           deeply now. His tail moves like a snake-charmed cobra. Eddie 
           stares, hypnotized by Possum Jack’s movement.

           Then Possum Jack closes his eyes, opens his mouth as wide as 
           possible...and goes completely rigid.

           Eddie bursts into song. His hands dance across the guitar, 
           simultaneously fingerpicking the bass line and melody of a 
           rollicking uptempo romp.

           Words fly out of his mouth.
                                 EDDIE
                             (singing)
                        Met an ol’ gal down in Tullahoma,
                        And the lovin’ she gave me,
                        Nearly put me in coma,
                        Now I’m on the run,
                        Her husband after me... 

           Suddenly Possum Jack’s eyes pop open. His mouth snaps shut. 
           Eddie’s music instantly stops. The room goes back to normal.

           Eddie drops the guitar like it’s bitten him and stares at 
           Possum Jack in disbelief.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        The fuck was that?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Making a song.

                                 EDDIE
                        How do you know about Tullahoma? 
                        Nobody knows about Tullahoma.
                             (changing courses)
                        Shit, who cares? Hot damn! Let’s 
                        get this on tape.

           He hastily plugs in a mic. Positions it. Picks up the guitar 
           again. He hits RECORD.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. From the top.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We must first reach an agreement.

           Eddie grimaces, annoyed. Stops recording.

                                 EDDIE
                        Everyone has a price, huh? Alright, 
                        fine. What do you want?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        No harm must come to me or my kin.

                                 EDDIE
                        Done. Won’t touch a hair on your 
                        head.

           He goes to press RECORD again. But Possum Jack continues.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Each day you must make an offering.
                                 EDDIE
                        A what now?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        You must bring food. 

           INNER WALL - TUNNEL - SAME TIME

           Possum Jill watches anxiously out the hole in the wall, 
           silently mouthing Possum Jack’s words as he speaks.

                                 POSSUM JACK (O.S.)
                        This offering must be delivered to 
                        the song place each day by sunset.

           It’s clear she’s rehearsed Possum Jack for the negotiation.

           MUSIC ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We must be left to consume this 
                        offering, undisturbed, until 
                        midnight.

                                 EDDIE
                             (chuckling)
                        Four hour lunch break? You a union 
                        possum? 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        At midnight, you may enter. 
                        Together we will make a song. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Just one? 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Upon its delivery, I shall depart.

                                 EDDIE
                        So just one song per night?
                             (off his nod)
                        For how long?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        For as long as you are New Patron.

                                 EDDIE 
                        And how long is that?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        For as long as you endure.
           Eddie makes a face, not liking this answer much.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        Do we have an agreement?

           Eddie ponders a beat before...

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah. We got an agreement.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Excellent. The hour has grown late. 
                        I must go now. We’ll begin 
                        tomorrow. Don’t forget, the 
                        offering must be made by sunset.

           With that Possum Jack waddles off.

                                 EDDIE
                        Right. Sunset.

           Once Possum Jack is gone, Eddie picks up the guitar again. 
           Tries to play the song they just started together. His 
           efforts are fumbling, clumsy. He can’t get through two bars.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Aw, fuck it.

           Realizing the futility, he puts the guitar aside. 

           INT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY

           Eddie picks items from the shelves. Cheetos. Ding-Dongs. Slim 
           Jims. The wound on his hand is swollen, festering. 

           He grabs some anti-septic cream. Band-Aids. Cotton swabs. 
           Anti-itch cream. Then he makes his way to check out.

           The CLERK (50s) sets aside the Bojangles fast-food chicken 
           sandwich he’s munching on. Eyes Eddie’s hand as Eddie puts 
           his items on the counter.

                                 CLERK
                        Something got a piece of you, huh?

                                 EDDIE
                        Yep. Possum.

                                 CLERK
                        Couldn’t have been no possum. 
                        Possum don’t bite.

           The clerk rings him up. Eddie scratches himself. 
                                 EDDIE
                        Guess this one is special.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - INNER WALL - POSSUM DEN - NIGHT

           Possum Jill eyes the junk food, unimpressed. 

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        New Patron calls this an offering?

           She picks up the Cheetos bag, reads.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        ‘Ferrous Sulfate, Niacin, Thiamin

                        processed junk! 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        He’s new.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Half these babies are gonna be born 
                        dead if you feed me this stuff. 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’ll speak with him.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        When? I’m due in a week.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Tonight. I’ll encourage him to 
                        offer more nutritious --

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Don’t encourage. Demand.

           He looks away, ashamed. Softening, she sidles up next to him. 
           Leans her head against his shoulder.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good possum, Jack. And you 
                        have a gift. You’re a Legend. But 
                        when it comes to patrons, you 
                        always get this Stockholm Syndrome 
                        thing-- 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I know how they suffer.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        -- where you can’t see what’s 
                        really going on.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT'D)
                        Patrons are not your friends. If 
                        you don’t stand up for yourself, 
                        people will stick a knife in you 
                        every time.

           Possum Jack grows pensive. Wistful.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I miss Old Patron. I feel like we 
                        had something special.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        I was looking forward to eating 
                        him, too. But life goes on. This is 
                        the New Patron we’ve been given. We 
                        have to make the most of him.

           Possum Jack nods along. She’s right, as usual. 

           MUSIC ROOM - LATER

           Possum Jack is frozen stiff, mouth hanging open, eyes 
           squeezed shut. The room is in marsupial pounch mode -- skin 
           walls covered with hair.

           Eddie is on the electric guitar, ripping through an chicken 
           pickin’ outro solo that would make Brad Paisley sweat.

           He hits a high note then rumbles down the neck like a runaway 
           train into the finishing chord. 

           Possum Jack’s eyes spring open and his mouth closes and the 
           room goes back to normal.

           Eddie hits STOP on the recorder. Wipes the sweat from his 
           brow. Labors to catch his breath.

                                 EDDIE
                        I feel like I had a goddamn baby!

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        You like our song?

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you kidding me? Did you hear 
                        that, what I did there?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        It’s a good song.

                                 EDDIE
                        Fuckin’ A.
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I assume you wish all of the songs 
                        to be of a similar quality?
                             (off his nod)
                        Then I have a request. Rather, a 
                        demand.

           Eddie eyes him. Suspicious.

                                 EDDIE
                        Do you now?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        High quality songs depend on high 
                        quality offerings. We need better 
                        food.

                                 EDDIE
                        Like what?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Food from the black path. Beyond 
                        the woods.

           Eddie scratches himself. Puzzles through it.

                                 EDDIE
                        You mean the highway? 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Yes. Creatures felled by the Grim 
                        Traveler.

                                 EDDIE
                        Grim Traveler? What’s that?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        The Grim Traveler rides the black 
                        path at night. He is swift and 
                        powerful and always on the horizon.

           Eddie is even more puzzled now. Slowly it dawns on him.

                                 EDDIE
                        Roadkill? Are you saying you want 
                        roadkill?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Yes! If you wish the songs to be of 
                        high quality.

           Eddie shakes his head, chuckles.
                                 EDDIE
                        This just keeps getting better.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - DAY (MOVING)

           Eddie drives down a rural highway, scanning the two-lane 
           blacktop with mounting frustration. 

           Finally he spots something lying dead by the roadside.

           He SLAMS on his brakes. Cuts the engine. 

           He snaps on a pair of rubber gloves and hops out of the cab.

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

           Eddie pulls up a bandana over his mouth and nose, nearly 
           gagging. The smell is overwhelming. His eyes water as he 
           approaches the dead thing by the side of the road.

           It’s a skunk. Half-flattened, guts spilling out.

           Eddie takes a plastic garbage bag from his back pocket, 
           unfolds it. He winces as he kneels next to the dead skunk.

           Trying to avert his eyes, he reaches out. Grabs the skunk 
           corpse by its neck. There’s a wet STICKY sound as he slowly  
           peels it off the asphalt. 

           His phone RINGS. Still holding the dead skunk, he digs the 
           phone from his pocket.

           Caller ID says “Charlene.” He frowns. Answers.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hey, honey.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Where are you?

                                 EDDIE
                        Out on the highway.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        What highway? Are you almost here? 
                        My appointment is in forty minutes.

           Oh shit -- he totally forgot.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        You forgot didn’t you?
                                 EDDIE
                        What? No, I just --

           Just then, the rotting skunk corpse he’s holding rips in 
           half. Entrails SPILL out and hit the pavement with a SPLAT. 
           Eddie audibly gags, drops the skunk.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        You say something?

                                 EDDIE
                        I was on my way. I had a blowout. 
                        Front left tire. I’m not gonna make 
                        it in time, sugar. I’m real sorry. 

           There’s a long silence on the other end.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Hello? You there?

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Eddie Vesco, I don’t believe you 
                        for one minute.

                                 EDDIE
                        It’s the truth!

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Oh yeah? Send me a picture.

                                 EDDIE
                        Charlene --

           But she’s already hung up. Eddie eyes the truck. Sighs.

           INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie tosses the bagged skunk carcass onto the floor of the 
           passenger seat.

           Then he digs around in the glovebox. Finds a pocketknife.

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie JAMS the knife into his front right tire, yanks the 
           blade sideways. There’s a POP and HISS of air.

           He watches as the tire deflates. Then he whips out his phone, 
           puts on a sad, just-my-luck face, and takes a selfie next to 
           the deflated tire. 

           He sends it to Charlene.
           Then he goes back to the skunk. Finishes bagging both corpse 
           halves, nearly puking in the process.

           Work finished, he gets out his phone again. Dials.

                                 EDDIE 
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah, I’m out on old highway 13 
                        just a ways past Gallows Creek. I’m 
                        gonna need a tow.
                             (then)
                        Really? Ninety minutes?
                             (sigh)
                        Okay. See you then.

           He hangs up, deflated. Looks toward the sun hanging low on 
           the horizon. It’ll be a race to be home before sunset.

           His phone BUZZES. He checks it.

                                 CHARLENE (TEXT)
                        You said front LEFT tire!

           He looks at the truck. Realizes his mistake. Could this day 
           get any worse?

           INT./EXT. TOWTRUCK - DAY

           Eddie sits in the passenger seat, anxious, fidgety. He gazes 
           out the window. Watches the sun sink on the horizon. 

                                 EDDIE
                        So how fast can one of these trucks 
                        go, anyway?

           The TOW TRUCK DRIVER gives him a look.

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                        Fast enough.

                                 EDDIE
                        Sure. But like, what’s the fastest 
                        you’ve ever got it up to?

           The driver thinks. Shrugs.

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                        Speed limit.

           Eddie lets it drop -- no use. The driver sniffs, looks 
           disgusted. Eddie reeks like skunk.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

           Eddie bursts through the door clutching the dead skunk 
           wrapped in the garbage bag. We follow him as...

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...he tears down the hall and then busts into the...

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...where he reaches into the garbage bag for the dead skunk. 
           He arranges the corpse pieces on the coffee table next to the 
           tape recorder, giddy relief overcoming his revulsion.

                                 EDDIE
                        Food’s here! I know I’m a little 
                        late, but no matter. Come and get 
                        it.

           Eddie looks to the hole in the wall. Possum Jack stares out.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Suppertime, buddy. Ring-a-ding-
                        ding.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We can’t accept this offering.

                                 EDDIE
                        What do you mean? I got the good 
                        stuff. Felled critter on the black 
                        path, just like you asked for.

           INNER WALL - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Possum Jack looks to Possum Jill, beseeching. Possum Jill 
           shakes her head, insistent.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Be strong.

           Possum Jack nods sadly. Addresses Eddie.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’m sorry.

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINOUS

           Eddie is angry, confused.
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        We must be firm. Rules are rules.

                                 EDDIE
                        Aw, come on, man.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        There will be no songs made 
                        tonight.

                                 EDDIE
                        This is bullshit!

           Eddie sweeps the skunk parts off the table. Paces.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I should advise you that you will 
                        soon experience discomfort. 

           Eddie stops pacing. Concerned.

                                 EDDIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        When a patron has the itch, a 
                        patron must make songs. When a 
                        patron can’t make songs, the itch 
                        grows worse.

           Eddie scratches at his hand and recoils in horror -- thick 
           black and white hairs grow all over the back of it. 

           His nail are yellow. Longer than before. Claw like. He checks 
           his other hand -- same thing. What the hell?

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        We’ll reconvene tomorrow. Try not 
                        to harm yourself too much.
                             (then)
                        It’s going to be a long night.

           BATHROOM - LATER

           Bug-eyed and pouring sweat, Eddie shaves the backs of his 
           hands with a razor. His body twitches all over. 

           In the living room, the clock CHIMES midnight.

           He drops the razor. Tears off his shirt. 

           He starts scratching like crazy. Arms, shoulders, neck, face.
                                 EDDIE
                        No!

           He forces himself to stop. Puts his hands on the bathroom 
           sink. Anchoring. Bracing himself.  

           The clock continues its midnight countdown. Eddie catches his 
           reflection in the mirror. The man gazing back at him is 
           ravaged and sick and all kinds of scared.

           HALLWAY - LATER

           Calmer now, Eddie trims his nails with nail clippers.

                                 EDDIE
                             (mumbling)
                        Ride it out, Eddie Vesco. Just ride 
                        it on out. You been through worse. 
                        Keep your head. Focus.

           A SCRATCHING in the walls startles him. His hands shake.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Focus, goddamnit.

           His body twitches. Starts to convulse. He drops the clippers.

           Eddie screams and thrashes and claws at himself.

           KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Body hash marked and bloody, roll of duct tape clasped 
           between his teeth, Eddie yanks open cabinet drawers one after 
           another until he finds... 

           Oven mitts.

           He grabs one. Jams it onto his hand. Frantically tapes the 
           mitt in place, looping tape around his wrist.   

           LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Eddie lies curled on the floor, feverish, oven mitts on both 
           hands to keep from clawing at his flesh. Sunlight creeps 
           through the window, hitting his eyes, making him wince.

           He sits up. Looks himself over. Better now. No shaking. The 
           urge to scratch himself subsided. He’s made it through the 
           night, but it’s left him deeply rattled.  

           He chews at the tape on his wrists.
           MOMENTS LATER

           Mitts off his hands, sitting on the couch now, Eddie listens 
           as an outbound phone call rings and rings. Finally...

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Do you know what time it is?

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, baby.

           There’s a long silence on the other end. Tears well in 
           Eddie’s eyes -- it’s no act, he’s really suffering. 

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                             (sighing)
                        It’s alright.

                                 EDDIE 
                        I shouldn’t have come here. 

           She’s concerned by the emotion in his voice.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Are you okay?

           He starts crying in earnest now.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m scared. 

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Why? What happened, Eddie? Jesus, 
                        what’s wrong?

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know. I just...I should 
                        have been there. For you. For you 
                        and the baby.

           She sighs with relief -- that’s all this is about?

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Yes, you should’ve. But if I wanted 
                        dependable, I wouldn’t have married 
                        a musician, would I?

                                 EDDIE
                        I want to be a good husband. A good 
                        father. Really, I do. 
                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        And you will be. There’s a long 
                        road ahead. Plenty of chances to 
                        make up for one little mistake.

           Eddie sobs. He wipes the tears with the back of his hand. 
           Tries to control his voice.

                                 EDDIE
                        I love you so much.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        I love you, too, honey. And Eddie 
                        Junior, he’s gonna love you just as 
                        much as I do. 

           Eddie unpacks this.

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you saying...

                                 CHARLENE
                        That’s right.
                             (then)
                        It’s a boy.

           Eddie smiles through his tears.

                                 CHARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Now you go and write me that love 
                        song, Eddie Vesco.

           MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           Still raw with emotion, Eddie walks into the room with a 
           solemn air. Possum Jack is already there waiting, perched 
           atop the piano.

           Eddie gives him a distracted nod as he picks up the tape 
           recorder and mic. Positions them near the piano.

           Possum Jack watches, intrigued. There’s something different 
           about Eddie tonight.

           Eddie sits at the piano bench.

                                 EDDIE
                        Let’s get to work.

           Possum Jack nods, gets in position facing Eddie.

           Eddie tries to clear his head. He takes a deep breath. Plays 
           a chord. Possum Jack sways from side-to-side. 
           Eddie plays the chord again. The room darkens. 

           He plays the chord a third time. Possum Jack’s mouth springs 
           wide. His body goes rigid. 

           Then Eddie’s song is eclipsed on our soundtrack by the most 
           dreamy, heartfelt, achingly beautiful piece of CLASSICAL 
           MUSIC you’ve ever heard.

           [note: The classical piece will play over the following 
           sequence.]

           INNER WALL - NEST - NIGHT

           Possum Jill has her eyes squeezed shut, her mouth hanging 
           open as she pants. She’s in labor. 

           We move down her body, until we see the first jellybean-
           sized, pink larval BABY emerge from her birth canal. 

           INTERCUT EDDIE MAKING A SONG/POSSUM JILL GIVING BIRTH

           The blind jellybean baby writhes with a swimming motion up 
           the forest of hairs making up its mother’s abdomen. Another 
           baby emerges behind it. And another. And another.

           -- Eddie leans back at the piano, eyes closed, swooning.

           The next baby emerges already dead, and falls motionless to 
           the floor of the nest. Many more live babies come out, and 
           more dead babies too, until she has given birth to twenty 
           possum babies.

           -- Eddie sings, putting everything into it.

           Guided by instinct alone, the sixteen survivors make the 
           arduous journey up Possum Jill’s belly until they reach...

           INT. POSSUM JILL’S POUCH

           Like the transformed music room, it’s a cavernous space 
           walled in by skin and hair.

           In this pouch are thirteen teats -- twelve in a perimeter 
           circle and one in the middle. 

           -- CLOSE ON: A reel on the tape recorder. It too is circular, 
           with a hub at its center.
           One by one the jellybean possum babies latch onto the 
           available teats. Clinging to them for literal life, placing 
           their tiny mouths around them and suckling.

           Finally there is only one unoccupied nipple left. 

           The remaining four jellybean possum babies struggle towards 
           this last prize, their only chance for survival. 

           -- Sweat pours down Eddie’s face as he reaches the unheard 
           song’s crescendo.

           As the last notes of the classical piece ring out, the possum 
           babies jockey for position, a life-or-death game of musical 
           chairs. 

           Then the music stops. 

           INT. INNER WALL - NEST

           Exhausted, Possum Jill rolls onto her side.

           INT. POSSUM JILL - POUCH

           As she turns over, one lucky jellybean possum baby secures 
           his mouth to the final, thirteenth teat.

           The other three, having less purchase, lose their grips and 
           tumble down the walls of the pouch... 

           INT. INNER WALL - NEST

           ...out of the pouch opening...

           ...through the forest of Possum Jill’s abdomen hair...

           ...and to the floor of the nest.

           Mouths opening and closing, tiny pink hands groping at 
           nothing, they land next to their fallen brethren and blindly 
           wriggle and squirm in the dirt where they will shortly die.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie hits STOP on the tape recorder. He sways on the bench, 
           eyes closed, rapturous. What a goddamn song he’s just made.

           Possum Jack’s eyes dart back and forth in his head. He raises 
           his snout -- SNIFFS. Grows agitated.
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Deliverance.

           Eddie opens one eye.

                                 EDDIE
                        Huh?

           Possum Jack leaps from the piano...

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Deliverance has come.

           ...and waddles toward the hole in the wall.

           Eddie closes his eyes again. At peace.

                                 EDDIE
                        Indeed it has, possum.
                             (then)
                        Indeed it has.

           Then a scraggly white whisker some six inches long suddenly 
           juts from the skin above his upper lip. 

           His eyes partially open, as if sensing the change, but then 
           droop and close again as Eddie sinks back into his bliss. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

           The sun rises on another glorious day.

           We move across the front yard, in through an open window...

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...past the living room where Eddie is crashed out on the 
           couch...

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           ...down the hallway...

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...past the tape recorder sitting on the piano bench, past 
           the piano, past the drum kit and into the hole in the wall...
           INNER WALL - TUNNEL

           ...through the winding tunnel maze and finally to the...

           INNER WALL - NEST

           ...where Possum Jill lies on her side, stomach bulging and 
           wriggling as her tiny babies -- which in their more mature 
           state we will refer to as JOEYS -- suckle inside her pouch.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        I love them.
                             (blinks away a tear)
                        I love my Joeys so much.

           Nearby, Possum Jack picks up one of the dead jellybean 
           corpses and shoves it into his mouth. Chews.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        How many boys, you think?

                                 POSSUM JILL 
                        Five, maybe six? Who cares? They’re 
                        all beautiful. I want every one of 
                        them to grow up strong and healthy 
                        and happy.

           Possum Jack nods along, shoveling the dead jellybean possum 
           babies into his mouth like peanuts from a snack dish.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                             (mouth full)
                        I’m sure they will.

           Possum Jill’s expression turns solemn.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        I wish I shared your optimism.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        What do you mean?

           She shakes her head, hesitant to elaborate. But then...

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        It’s just New Patron. I know he’s 
                        trying. I know you’re both trying. 
                        But that man -- he can’t tell the 
                        difference between a raccoon that’s 
                        been dead three hours and coyote 
                        that got killed a month ago. 
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        His nose is weaker than ours.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        There you go. Defending him.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’m not defending him, I’m saying 
                        there are things patrons are good 
                        at, and things that they aren’t.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Okay -- you know what they’re 
                        really good at? Killing. Patrons 
                        can kill just about anything, can’t 
                        they? They’re killing machines.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Thanks for putting that thought in 
                        my head. As if it wasn’t hard 
                        enough facing him every night.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        These Joeys can’t survive on what 
                        he’s providing now. Fresh meat is 
                        what they need. Patrons are natural 
                        born killers. 
                             (then)
                        Make him kill something for us.

           Possum Jack ponders. Eddie isn’t gonna like this.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - SUNSET

           Eddie holds a rotten snake carcass, its blackened skin dry 
           and flaking, almost no meat left on the bones.

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Not tonight. But going forward.

                                 EDDIE
                        Absolutely not!

           Possum Jack is confused.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        But you’re good at it.
                                 EDDIE
                        You’re just assuming, man. 
                        Stereotyping. I told you before I’m 
                        no killer. Otherwise I would’ve 
                        killed you first time we met.

           Possum Jack swallows hard at the thought. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Eddie Vesco loves animals. Didn’t 
                        you read my Rolling Stone profile? 
                        I’m a vegetarian. I don’t fish, I 
                        don’t hunt -- hell, I don’t even 
                        own a gun. 

           Possum Jack glances over his shoulder. Sees Possum Jill 
           glaring at him, adamant. Knows there’s no backing down. He 
           summons all his resolve.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’m afraid this is non-negotiable.

                                 EDDIE
                        How do you suggest I get my hands 
                        on a live animal then, mister non-
                        negotiable? Steal a goat from a 
                        farm or some shit? I ain’t going 
                        and laying out a bunch of traps, 
                        I’ll tell you that much. That it is 
                        time consuming proposition and time 
                        is one thing Eddie Vesco does not 
                        have. 

           Possum Jack thinks on it. Eddie paces, upset.

                                 POSSUM
                        What’s an animal shelter?

                                 EDDIE
                        What?

                                 POSSUM
                        You said you volunteered at an 
                        animal shelter. What is it?

                                 EDDIE
                             (annoyed)
                        It’s this place where they take in 
                        pets. Strays and such. Cats, dogs. 
                        They take care of them until 
                        someone comes along and...

           Eddie is hit with a dark realization.
           INT./EXT. TRUCK - DAY (MOVING)

           A troubled Eddie pulls his truck to stop. Kills the engine. 
           He dons sunglasses and a ball cap. His disguise.

           He checks his reflection in the rearview mirror. Two long 
           crooked whiskers jut from his upper lip. He d plucks them 
           out, wincing in pain.

           Then he takes a deep breath and exits the vehicle.

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY

           Eddie enters. Downbeat, sick at what he’s there to do. He 
           RINGS a bell on the counter top.

           A moment later, shelter worker LUCINDA (20s) approaches.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Hey there, what can I do for you?

                                 EDDIE
                        I’d like to adopt an animal.

                                 LUCINDA
                        What are you looking for? Dog? Cat?

                                 EDDIE
                        I couldn’t do a dog.

                                 LUCINDA
                        So a cat then?

                                 EDDIE
                             (sighs)
                        Cat will have to do.

           Weird answer. She scrutinizes him a beat.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Aright. Come on back.

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - KENNELS AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Lucinda guides him toward a cage filled with kittens.

                                 LUCINDA
                        We just got this litter in just 
                        last week. Cutest little things you 
                        ever did see.
           Eddie watches the fluffy kittens frolic inside the cage. 
           Tears well in his eyes.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        You want to hold one?

                                 EDDIE
                        No! 

           She’s taken aback. Eddie struggles to control his tone.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. What I meant was, I’m 
                        looking for a grown animal. 
                             (then)
                        Actually, give me the oldest cat 
                        you’ve got. A death row cat. 
                        Whatever poor sonofabitch you’re 
                        planning on putting down next, 
                        that’s the cat for me.

           Lucinda eyes him. Odd request, but okay. She walks him 
           further down the row. Points to a mangy old, one-eyed cat.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Her name is Hecubus.

           The cat HISSES.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        But honestly? You don’t want her. 
                        She’s got stage three kidney 
                        disease. On top of which, she’s 
                        just plain old nasty.

                                 EDDIE
                        She’s perfect.

           Lucinda shrugs, opens the cage. The cat hisses again as she 
           picks it up. She’s about to hand it over, but stops.

           Lucinda looks Eddie up and down, suspicious. Her scrutiny 
           makes him increasingly uneasy. 

                                 LUCINDA
                        Oh my God.

           Eddie is freaked now. She knows. She knows everything.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        You’re Eddie Vesco!

           Eddie is flooded with relief. 
                                 EDDIE
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 LUCINDA
                        I love your music! And I heard you 
                        were a real friend of animals, but 
                        I thought that was just for show. 
                        But no, here you are, doing a good 
                        thing with no cameras around or 
                        anything.

           Eddie strains to smile.

                                 EDDIE
                        Here I am.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Can I get a picture?

                                 EDDIE
                        Well, thing is...

                        Just for me. Won’t post it 
                        anywhere, except on that bulletin 
                        board over there. Promise.

                                 EDDIE
                        I suppose if --

           But she’s already whipped out her phone and snuggled up next 
           to him, cat held in between them. The cat HISSES as...

           CLICK!

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           The half-devoured corpse of Hecubus lays on the floor.

           We see Eddie from behind as he bobs his head, listening to 
           playback of his latest tune. Possum Jack also listens. 

                                 EDDIE
                        This one’s a classic. Like 
                        something Waylon or Willie or even 
                        Hank himself might’ve written back 
                        in the day.

           Eddie catches his reflection in the window. 
           He has a full set of long scraggly whiskers. His cheeks are 
           covered in a downy white fur -- the same kind growing from 
           the top of Otis’s head. His ears are covered in hairs -- also 
           like Otis’s -- and jut out possum-like from his skull.

           Eddie stares in horror. Then he turns to Possum Jack.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening to me?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        It’s part of the itch.

                                 EDDIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        When you get the itch, you can make 
                        songs. But making songs changes a 
                        patron.

                                 EDDIE
                        Changes how?

           Possum Jack hesitates. Reluctant to answer.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        You become a Legend. Like me.

           Eddie unpacks it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you saying I’m gonna turn into 
                        a goddamn possum?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Not just any possum. A Legend. But 
                        only if you can endure the changes. 
                        Most find it too...burdensome.

                                 EDDIE
                        Meaning what exactly?

           Possum Jack looks away. Unable to meet his gaze.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                             (quietly)
                        They kill themselves.

           This hangs in the air a moment. Then Eddie seizes Possum Jack 
           by the scruff of the neck and hoists him off the piano so 
           they are face-to-face.
                                 EDDIE
                        How come you never saw fit to tell 
                        me this before now?

           Possum Jack is terrified. His eyelids flutter. He’s starting 
           to lose consciousness. He mumbles as he begins to nod off.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        ...there’s a way to stop...

           Eddie gently puts him down, tries to calm him.

                                 EDDIE
                        Don’t go passing out. I’m sorry. 
                        I’m not gonna hurt you. You okay? 
                        You good? Need water or anything?

           Possum Jack feebly shakes his head.  

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You were saying there’s a way I can 
                        stop this thing?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Yes. 

                                 EDDIE
                        How?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Old Patron took a medicine.

                                 EDDIE
                        What kind of medicine?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Medicine he put in his arm.

           Eddie puzzles through it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Are you talking about heroin?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        It helped slow the changes.

                                 EDDIE
                        That shit never helped nobody.

           Eddie scratches his chin as he ponders. The hair on his hands 
           has all grown back now. His nails are more clawlike, longer 
           than ever. 
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        So I’m either going to turn into a 
                        possum, kill myself, or become a 
                        junkie and probably die of a heroin 
                        overdose?

           Possum Jack reluctantly nods.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        But think of the songs.

           Eddie looses an ironic laugh.

                                 EDDIE
                        Sure. The songs.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT (MOVING)

           Eddie motors up a narrow dirt road, radio hissing STATIC. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           Eddie pulls the truck over. Thick forest on one side. Old 
           railroad trestle bridge on the other.  

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Carrying a flashlight, Eddie crashes through underbrush and 
           trees as he heads down the embankment toward the river. 
           Nearby an owl HOOTS, startling him.

           He stumbles, nearly falling. Rights himself. Continues.

           EXT. RIVER BANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie lurches down the side of the river until he has reached 
           the base of the trestle bridge.

           He approaches the place where he dumped Otis’s corpse, he 
           calls out as if to soothe his own nerves.

                                 EDDIE
                        Sorry to disturb your place of 
                        rest, Otis. Turns out maybe you 
                        wasn’t such a dumbass after all, 
                        shooting that shit into your veins. 
                        Anyway, you don’t have no use for 
                        that stuff anymore, so I’m sure you 
                        won’t mind if I... 
           He shines the flashlight at the base of the bridge where he 
           left Otis’s body... 

           But Otis is gone.

           So is the the ligature, heroin baggie, spoon, hypodermic 
           needle. Eddie shines his flashlight this way and that. 

           Nothing.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Critter must’ve dragged him off.

           Eddie nods vigorously as if trying to convince himself. But 
           even he doesn’t buy it. He stares at the empty space, brain 
           squirming like a toad.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAWN

           Eddie shaves the downy fur from his face. His eyes are wild, 
           bloodshot. He’s been awake all night. 

           His phone BUZZES. He checks the caller ID. Puts it in speaker 
           mode and answers as he continues shaving.

                                 EDDIE
                        About time you called back. Where 
                        you been the last four hours?

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        It’s six in the morning, Eddie. 
                        What’s going on?

                                 EDDIE
                        Recording songs, Randy. Making 
                        gold. This album is going to be a 
                        masterpiece. All killer, no filler.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah? How many hits, you think?

                                 EDDIE
                        Five, maybe six. Who cares? They’re 
                        all beautiful.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Guess your furry little friend 
                        really inspired you, huh? 

           Eddie stops shaving. His blood runs cold.
                                 EDDIE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        That new cat you got. Picture was 
                        all over the internet.

           Eddie sighs, relieved.

                                 EDDIE
                        Listen, I need you to do me a 
                        favor. It’s gonna sound a little 
                        out of the ordinary, but don’t go 
                        getting your panties in a bunch. 

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Sure. Name it.

                                 EDDIE
                        I need you to bring me some heroin.

           There’s a long silence on the other end.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Eddie...

                                 EDDIE
                        It’s not what you think.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        When I took you on as a client, you 
                        assured me that you’d left all that 
                        stuff behind.

                                 EDDIE
                        This is different. It’s not for 
                        getting high. It’s...medicinal. 

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Come on, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Like a preventative treatment. I 
                        swear. I don’t need much. Just 
                        enough to get me through these last 
                        few songs. That’s it. After that, 
                        I’ll never touch the stuff again. 
                        Scout’s honor.

           Another long silence on the other end.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Have you talked to anyone else 
                        about this?
                                 EDDIE
                        No, sir.

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        Well, don’t. I’m gonna come up and 
                        see you, okay? I’ll be there as 
                        soon as I can. You just sit tight. 
                        Stay where you are and don’t do 
                        anything crazy.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re coming now?

                                 RANDY (ON PHONE)
                        I’ll be there as soon as I can.

                                 EDDIE
                        You bring that heroin, Randy.

           But Randy has already hung up. Eddie scowls. Then he hears a 
           RUSTLING behind the wall. Stops.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - INNER WALL - NEST

           CLOSE ON: Possum Jill’s pouch. It’s partially opened now, and 
           inside we catch the odd glimpse of a tail, a tiny foot, a 
           torso now covered in hair. The Joeys are maturing.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Possum Jill is in tears. 

           We hear Possum Jack come RUSTLING through the tunnel. He 
           enters. Takes in the scene. He’s almost afraid to ask...

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        What’s wrong?

           Possum Jill turns her face to him.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        That cat was diseased. Two of the 
                        Joeys are sick.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Really? I don’t think --

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        They’re going to die, Jack. I’ve 
                        been through this before. I know 
                        the signs. 
                             (sniffs back tears)
                        We need to do something.
           Possum Jack turns away. Balls his fists. Frustration 
           mounting. 

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear me, Jack? We need --

           He whirls on her.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Stop with the ‘we’ already. We both 
                        know who we really means.

           Possum Jill recoils as if slapped. He turns back around. 
           Refusing to meet her gaze, he scratches absentmindedly at the 
           walls. Her expression darkens. 

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Fine. You. 

           Joey tails snake out of Possum Jill’s pouch opening, writhing 
           faster as she becomes more agitated. 

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        You need to give me the kind of 
                        support you promised when you 
                        dragged me this godforsaken place.
                             (then)
                        You need to provide human flesh.

           Possum Jack stops scratching.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        There’s no other way. It’s the only 
                        food that provides the nutrients 
                        these sick Joeys need now.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        And they’ll get it. We’ve been 
                        through this before. New Patron is 
                        changing. I told him about the 
                        medicine.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Behind the drum kit, Eddie is on his hands and knees near the 
           hole in the wall. Listening.

                                 POSSUM JACK (O.S.)
                        He can’t endure. One way or 
                        another, he’s gonna die soon. Then 
                        I’ll chew off his limbs. Right away 
                        this time, no waiting.

                        The limbs, the head, I’ll drag them 
                        all piece-by-piece back into the 
                        nest before someone can come along 
                        and take New Patron away.  

           Eddie is shocked. Angry at the betrayal.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - INNER WALL - NEST - CONTINUOUS

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        We don’t have time.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        You don’t know that.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        A mother knows.
                             (then)
                        You have to act now.

           Possum Jack turns away, angry, frustrated.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie silently fumes. Wheels turn in his mind. He settles on 
           a course of action. Slowly stands.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY

           Eddie carries a hammer and some wooden planks. He scans the 
           front porch. Then he spots it -- a little hole where the 
           exterior wall meets the ground. A hole just big enough for a 
           possum to fit through.

           WHAM! He nails a plank in place over the hole. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

           He places another plank over a hole near the front door.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - ROOF - SUNSET

           WHAM! He nails a plank over a hole in the roof near the 
           chimney. He wipes the sweat from his brow. Watches the sun 
           drop over the horizon. 
           INT. FARMHOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie strolls in. CLOSES the door behind him.

           Possum Jack is already sitting atop the piano.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        There was no offering today.

                                 EDDIE
                        Sorry. Had some chores around the 
                        house needed seeing to.

           Eddie removes a bottle of lighter fluid from his pocket. 
           Approaches the piano.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        But our agreement --

                                 EDDIE
                        You ever heard of Jerry Lee Lewis?

           Possum Jack shakes his head. Eddie SQUIRTS some lighter fluid 
           on the piano. Possum Jack SNIFFS, not knowing what to make of 
           the substance.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        He was a wild one, ol’ Jerry Lee. 
                        Used to call him The Killer. Most 
                        folks know him for marrying his 
                        thirteen year old cousin. Not the 
                        most savvy career move.

           Eddie casually squirts more lighter fluid on the top of the 
           piano as he circles.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        But he sure could play the piano. 
                        Didn’t so much tickle the ivories 
                        as beat them into submission. He’d 
                        play with his fists, his elbows, 
                        his feet. Sometimes he’d even play 
                        when the piano was...like this.

           Eddie produces a zippo lighter. Flicks it. The lighter fluid 
           atop the piano instantly ignites. Possum Jack SQUEALS, turns 
           to flee...but finds himself quickly encircled by flames.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        What are you doing? Stop!

                                 EDDIE
                        I blocked all the exits. There’s no 
                        way out. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        I could turn you, your wife and 
                        babies into a family-sized bucket 
                        of barbecued possum right now if 
                        that’s what I wanted.

           Possum Jack is scared witless, eyelids fluttering as he 
           struggles to stay conscious. The flames leap higher. 

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Make it stop! Please!

                                 EDDIE
                        You think you’re gonna trick me 
                        into killing myself? Gonna chew off 
                        my limbs? Feed me to your babies? 
                        You think you’re a killer, like 
                        Jerry Lee Lewis?

           POSSUM JACK’S POV: Eddie stops circling the piano. He leans 
           in closer, eye level to Possum Jack, his angry face lit up by 
           the flames in a hellish vision.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You got another thing coming, Jack.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Eddie starts circling the piano again. The fire is spreading, 
           closing in on Possum Jack.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what’s gonna happen. We're 
                        going back to the original terms of 
                        the contract. You're gonna eat 
                        whatever the hell I leave for you. 
                        In exchange, you're gonna give me 
                        two more songs. And then you and me 
                        are done forever. Agreed?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Yes! Fine! Yes!

                                 EDDIE
                        You sure? Don’t need to consult 
                        your missus?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’m sure! Make it stop! Please!

           Eddie crosses. Grabs a fire extinguisher leaning against the 
           stack of amplifiers. He walks back over, points it at the 
           piano. Possum Jack sees the strange contraption and freaks.
                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        No! What is that thing? I said I 
                        agreed! Don’t shoot me! Don’t 
                        shoot! 

                                 EDDIE
                        We’ll see who fucking endures.

           Eddie DISCHARGES the fire extinguisher.

           The piano is lost in a cloud of chemical haze. When it 
           clears, the fire is out and Possum Jack lies unconscious on 
           the piano top. Stiff body curled, mouth opened, green fluid 
           pooled beneath his ass.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You look plum tuckered out. Take 
                        the night off. We’ll pick up where 
                        we left off tomorrow.

           Eddie smiles as he turns and walks out the door. 

           Possum Jill watches from the hole in the wall. She barely 
           blinks when Eddie SLAMS the music room door, so focused is 
           her anger.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A sleek black Tesla rolls to a stop. Randy exits the vehicle. 
           He runs a finger across the hood of the car, annoyed at the 
           dust picked up from the road.

           He takes in the farmhouse, unimpressed, then approaches.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy KNOCKS on the door. There’s no answer.

                                 RANDY
                        Eddie, you in there?

           Still no answer. He tries to knob. The door is unlocked. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The smell hits Randy the second he walks in.

                                 RANDY
                        Eddie? 

           No answer. He continues to the...
           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The bad smell intensifies.

                                 RANDY
                        Eddie? Where you at?

           Randy suddenly trips over something. He stumbles, throws his 
           hands up against the wall to keep from tumbling.

           Then he turns and looks at what he tripped over.

           It’s Eddie. His body curled, mouth hanging open. Muscles 
           rigor mortis stiff, face covered in scratches. He looks dead.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Christ, Eddie.

           Randy leans in for a closer look. Tears well in his eyes.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Why? You had everything.

           Eddie’s eyes spring open. Frightened, Randy leaps back.

                                 EDDIE
                        You took your damn time.

           Randy puts a hand to his chest, tries to catch his breath.

                                 RANDY
                        My God. I thought you were dead for 
                        a second there.

           Eddie creakily gets to his feet. Scratches himself.

                                 EDDIE
                        You got my medicine?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m here to take you home.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m not going home.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s no good for you, being out 
                        here all by yourself. If it was, 
                        you wouldn’t be passed out on the 
                        hallway floor at two in the 
                        afternoon and -- 

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m nocturnal.
                                 RANDY
                        -- you wouldn’t be calling me in 
                        the middle of the night asking for 
                        heroin.
                             (then)
                        I spoke with Charlene. She’s as 
                        worried about you as I am. She 
                        wants you to come home, Eddie. So 
                        come back with me. It’s the best 
                        thing for you right now.

           Eddie considers. Then...

                                 EDDIE
                        No.
                             (then)
                        I signed a contract. And the 
                        thirteen songs I write here are 
                        going to keep my family fed for the 
                        rest of our lives. There’s only two 
                        left to record. I’m not going 
                        anywhere until they’re finished.

           Randy shakes his head, not liking it. But he knows it’s no 
           use trying to change Eddie’s mind once it’s made up.

                                 RANDY
                        They’re really that good, huh?

                                 EDDIE
                        Come listen for yourself.

           MUSIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As they enter, Randy looks like he’s gonna throw up from the 
           smell. He takes in the charred piano covered in bicarbonate 
           dust from the extinguisher. The flies BUZZING around.

                                 RANDY
                        Christ, what you been up to in 
                        here?

           Eddie approaches the recorder with a smile.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re about to find out.

           Then Eddie stops dead in his tracks. The recorder is missing 
           it’s tape reel -- the one with all the songs on it.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        No...
           Randy watches, concerned as Eddie whips his head this way and 
           that, desperately scanning the room. His eyes land on the 
           hole in the wall...just in time to see tail end of the tape 
           snake inside it. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You motherfucker!

           He charges across the room.

                                 RANDY
                        Eddie, what’s wrong?

                                 EDDIE
                        Jack and Jill. 

                                 RANDY
                        What?

                                 EDDIE
                        They live in the walls. They stole 
                        my fucking songs. 

           There’s a CRASH as Eddie kicks the drum kit aside.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        They’re trying to kill me so they 
                        can eat me.

           Randy watches, alarmed, as Eddie goes down on his hands and 
           knees and yells at a hole in the wall.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Give me them songs back! 

           INNER WALL - NEST - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie’s words echo through the nest chamber, where a 
           traumatized Possum Jack lies recovering from his recent 
           fright, still covered in fire extinguisher dust.

           We race past him, out of the nest and into the...

           INNER WALL - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           ...past an empty tape reel and coils of unspooled tape. 
           Possum Jill stands a safe distance away from the hole, her 
           pouch bloated and full, Joeys squirming under her fur.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        You don’t, I’ll burn this place to 
                        the ground!
                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Even you aren’t that stupid. Do 
                        that, you lose the songs forever. 

           Eddie’s face fills the hole. Beet red and angry.

                                 EDDIE 
                        I’m warning you one last time, 
                        missy. Hand them over!

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        I don’t scare as readily as my 
                        husband, Mr. Vesco. You’ll get the 
                        tapes when we get what we asked 
                        for. A human offering. Until then, 
                        there’s nothing to discuss.

           She snatches up the tape, carrying it in her coiled tail and 
           dragging it away as she waddles toward the nest.

           Enraged, Eddie shoves his arm into the hole up to his elbow. 
           He tries to grab her, but she’s out of reach. 

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        Come back here, goddamnit!

           His hand just flops around, uselessly grabbing at air.

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie pulls his arm out of the hole, defeated. Tears in his 
           eyes. 

                                 RANDY
                        Come on, Eddie. Let’s get you home.

           Randy helps him to his feet. Eddie is nearly catatonic.

                                 EDDIE
                        I can’t leave those songs. 

                                 RANDY
                        Sure you can. And once you’re 
                        feeling better, we’ll book you a 
                        real studio. Memphis, Nashville, 
                        wherever you want. You can record 
                        new songs. Better songs.

                                 EDDIE
                        Those songs are my babies. 

           Randy puts his arm around Eddie.
                                 RANDY
                        You’re gonna have a real baby soon, 
                        Eddie. Think about that. 

           Randy gently guides him toward the door.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Think about Charlene. She needs you 
                        now. She needs you to be strong.

           Eddie blinks a tear away.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re a good man, Randy.

           Randy shrugs off the compliment.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        No, I want you to know it. You’re a 
                        damn good man.

                                 RANDY
                        Alright, Eddie. If you say so. Now 
                        let’s pack up your stuff and hit 
                        the road.

           Eddie stops walking.

                                 EDDIE
                        Can I bring my guitar?

                                 RANDY
                        Of course. Bring whatever you want.

           Eddie turns, crosses. Grabs a big, hollow-bodied Gibson. 

           Randy has his back to Eddie. His eyes alight on the mostly-
           devoured remnants of the dead cat in the corner. He then sees 
           various animal bones strewn around the room. Shudders.

           Then Eddie SMASHES the guitar into the back of his head!

           Randy stumbles forward, lurching, disoriented, not 
           understanding what’s happening. 

           WHAM! Eddie cracks him again with the guitar. The body 
           splinters. Randy goes down, lands face first, unconscious but 
           still breathing.

           Eddie snatches up a microphone cord. He leaps on Randy’s 
           prone body. Loops the cord around Randy’s neck. Pulls with 
           all his might, even as the tears roll down his face.
           Randy gasps and chokes, hands clawing at the cord. But it’s 
           no use -- Eddie’s grip is too strong.

           Randy’s face goes blue. His tongue protrudes.

           Veins bulge from Eddie’s forehead. He pulls tighter.

           At length, Randy stops struggling. Eddie releases the mic 
           cord. Randy’s head drops, HITS to the ground.

           Eddie slumps to a sitting position beside him, back against 
           the wall, posture identical to Otis’s when Eddie first saw 
           him in this room.

           Eddie buries his head in his hands and sobs.

           At length he stops. Wipes his face with his sleeve. Eddie 
           stands. Walks unsteadily to the door. He opens it. Stops at 
           the threshold. Calls back over his shoulder...

                                 EDDIE
                        See you at midnight.

           Then he turns. Two beady black eyes stare out from the hole.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        And you better have that tape.

           Eddie walks out and SLAMS the door closed behind him.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SUNSET

           Eddie drives Randy’s Tesla down that forgotten country road 
           we’ve seen before -- two tire-tracks cutting through weeds. 

           HARDCORE TECHNO blares on through the car’s speakers. Eddie 
           makes a face...

                                 EDDIE
                        Jesus, Randy.

           ...and switches the stereo off.

           He pulls over near the old railroad trestle bridge crossing a 
           deep river. Eddie puts it neutral. Gets out. 

           Eddie pushes the car toward the embankment, one hand reaching 
           inside to steer. As the car gains momentum, he lets go and 
           jumps aside.

           The ghosted car leaves the road, plunges...
           EXT. EMBANKMENT - CONTINUOUS

           ...crashes down through underbrush and trees...

           EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS

           ...and SPLASHES into the river.

           It gets dragged into the current. Slowly sinks as it moves 
           downstream.

           We see Eddie atop the embankment. Watching from above.

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie lingers a moment, then turns and walks away.

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Eddie drags himself down the shoulder of the road. Exhausted, 
           barely able to put one foot in front of the other.

           Pinpricks of light emerge in the distance. Headlights. They 
           grow closer, bigger, moving with demonic, otherworldly speed. 

           It’s that same massive, gleaming black semi-truck.

           The Grim Traveler.  

           Eddie stops walking, blinded by the headlights as they bear 
           down on him. The sound of the engine is DEAFENING. 

           He freezes. His lips curl back, his body grows rigid. His 
           eyelids start to flutter...

           ...but at the last possible second, he snaps out of it. Dives 
           to the side of the road...  

           ...just as the truck ROARS past him, the sound like a chorus 
           of dead animal souls, leaving him in a cloud of dust and 
           exhaust. 

           He rises to his hands and knees. The semi-truck is gone.

           Eddie dusts himself off. Starts back down the road. Up ahead, 
           he sees a familiar gas station.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh hell yeah.
           EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - NIGHT

           As Eddie approaches, the gas station lights go dead.

           He finds the front door is locked. He spots the same clerk 
           from before inside sweeping up. 

           Eddie POUNDS on the window to get his attention.

           The clerk sees Eddie, points at his own wrist. Eddie looks at 
           a sign on the door -- “OPEN 7AM - 11PM.” 

                                 EDDIE
                        Come on, man. I’m starving. Just 
                        want some food. I’ll be quick.

           The clerk ignores him, heads to the back office.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Asshole.

           Eddie starts to walk away, dejected. Then his nose twitches. 
           His eyes narrow. He follows the scent to the... 

           BACK OF THE GAS STATION

           ...where he finds a dumpster. 

           Licking his lips hungrily, he lifts the lid. Inside, flies 
           BUZZ like crazy. He swats them away. Inspects the trash.

           He’s excited to find a half-eaten sandwich -- the same 
           Bojangles chicken and biscuit sandwich we saw the clerk 
           eating days ago. The biscuit is moldy. The chicken rancid, 
           gray, writhing with maggots.

           Eddie devours the sandwich in two bites, maggots and all. 

           Satisfied, he SLAMS closed the dumpster lid.

           PRE-LAP: The grandfather clock CHIMES.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie kicks the door open. The grandfather clock continues 
           its midnight chime as Eddie enters.

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The clock keeps chiming. Eddie heads toward the music room.
           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie opens the door.

           Sees Possum waiting for him atop the piano.

           He looks to the tape recorder. Sees the reel has been put 
           back in place. The tape is scratched and wrinkled in places, 
           but not fatally so.

           Eddie rewinds the tape a bit. Hits PLAY. The sound is warbly, 
           some static here and there, but...

                                 EDDIE
                        Nothing Nashville can’t fix.

           He hits STOP. Fast forwards until he’s reached a blank spot 
           where he’ll record tonight. He stops the tape again.

           Eddie’s eyes then alight on Randy’s corpse lying on the floor 
           nearby. Half his face and the flesh of one hand have been 
           chewed off. Eddie doesn’t look grossed out by the sight. A 
           little sad maybe, but it is what it is.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I’m sorry.

                                 EDDIE
                             (shrugs)
                        You got your needs. I got mine. 
                        Story of the world.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        I didn’t mean for it to turn out 
                        like this.

                                 EDDIE
                        Always does though, doesn’t it? One 
                        way or another.

           Possum Jack nods in agreement. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        So we might as well sing our song. 
                        While we still...endure.

           Eddie eyes the instruments.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t know what to play tonight. 
                        Hell, any instrument I pick you 
                        make it sound great, so I guess it 
                        don’t matter.
                                 POSSUM JACK
                        It matters. It matters a good deal. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah? I tell you what. Why don’t 
                        you pick then?

                                 POSSUM JACK
                             (shocked)
                        Me?

                                 EDDIE
                        Go on.

           Possum Jack considers carefully, like it’s a great honor and 
           responsibility. Finally he chooses an acoustic guitar, the 
           oldest and most worn of all the instruments.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Good choice.

           Eddie picks up the guitar. Sits to play. Stops.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t really going to light you 
                        and your family on fire. You know 
                        that right?

           Possum Jack looks skeptical.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I just got a little crazy there for 
                        a minute. You were right. Making 
                        songs changes a person. Not just 
                        the itch and the fur and all that. 
                        But inside.
                             (then)
                        I guess I never did give Otis the 
                        credit as he deserved, now that I 
                        know how tough this songwriting 
                        thing can be. But I’m glad I got 
                        you on my team. I couldn’t do it 
                        without you. 
                             (smiles)
                        Hell, you’re a Legend.

           Possum Jack nods, humbled. Gracious.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        So you really used to be like me? A 
                        person.
                             (off his nod)
                        What’s it like being a possum? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, what happens next? What can 
                        I expect from here on out?

           Possum Jack grows wistful. Looks away.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Let’s focus on the music.

           His reaction troubles Eddie. Eddie studies Possum Jack a 
           moment, then...

                                 EDDIE
                        Whatever you say, boss.

           ...he picks the guitar back up. Strums a chord.

           FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           As the MUSIC starts from the other room, Eddie’s phone RINGS 
           on the coffee table.

           The music continues, a wordless, sweet COUNTRY WALTZ. 

           The phone rings and rings and then abruptly stops.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Eddie lies curled underneath the couch. 

           His phone RINGS from the coffee table.

           His whiskered face twitches. He begins to wake.

           The phone stops ringing. 

           Eddie crawls out from beneath the couch. He checks his phone. 
           Scowls. Puts it back down. Not gonna deal with this now.

           He crawls back under the couch. Closes his eyes.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - SUNSET

           Eddie walks barefooted down the hall. Blinks away sleep. 
           Scratches himself.

           He hears a RUSTLING from the music room. Stops outside the 
           door. Peeks through the keyhole.

           EDDIE’S POV: Faces covered in blood, Possum Jack and Possum 
           Jill eagerly feed on Randy, tearing flesh from his abdomen.
           Eddie licks his lips. His stomach GROWLS.

                                 EDDIE
                             (under his breath)
                        Lucky bastards.

           He turns away. Continues onward toward the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Eddie opens the fridge. Still just the Mountain Dew, the take-
           out container filled with nightcrawlers.

           His phone rings. It’s Charlene. Eddie frowns. Decides he 
           might as well face the music. He picks up.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hey there, sugar.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        What is going on with you? I’ve 
                        been trying to call you all day.

           Eddie grabs the takeout container. Lifts the lid. Looks at 
           the worms wriggling in the dirt.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh, just laying tracks.

                                 CHARLENE 
                        Is Randy there? 

                                 EDDIE (ON PHONE)
                        He was, but he’s gone now.

           Eddie scoops up a handful of worms and shoves them in his 
           mouth, dirt and all. Chews. Not bad.

                                 CHARLENE (ON PHONE)
                        Gone? Gone where? 

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know. He dropped by. 
                        Listened to a couple songs, said 
                        good work, keep it up. Then he 
                        moseyed on out.

           INT. MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlene paces the gorgeous living room. We just barely 
           glimpse another one of her paintings on the wall -- this one 
           features an old ramshackle farmhouse on fire. 
                                 CHARLENE 
                        Randy told me you asked him for 
                        drugs. He was supposed to call me 
                        when he got there. Eddie, I’m 
                        scared. I haven’t painted in days 
                        and this stress isn’t good for the 
                        baby.

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

                                 EDDIE
                             (mouth full)
                        I’m making music, Charlene. You 
                        have no idea how the songwriting 
                        process works. The kind of 
                        SSSSacrifices I’ve had to...

                                 CHARLENE 
                        What was that?

                                 EDDIE
                        What was what?

                                 CHARLENE 
                        Eddie, you’re hissing at me!

                                 EDDIE
                        I didn’t hiSSSSS! I don’t know what 
                        you’re talking about.

           He dumps the rest of the worms in his mouth. Angrily chews.

                                 CHARLENE 
                        I’m coming up there.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh no you ain’t. You -- Ow! Fuck! 

           The pain is electric. He drops the phone, hand shooting to 
           his mouth. It comes away bloody. What the hell?

           Eddie jams fingers in his mouth, feels around. 

           Then we see them -- his upper incisors. They’ve suddenly 
           grown three inches long and protrude rodentine and razor 
           sharp from his mouth. 

           They’ve also punched twin wounds clean through his lower lip.

           Eddie cups his hand to his mouth and bolts from the room.
           BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Eddie pulls back his lips. Shoves his scared face into the 
           mirror. Inspects his mouth.

           It’s worse than he thought. 

           The lower incisors have now grown, too. 

           Worse still, the rest of his mouth is crammed with tiny sharp 
           teeth. More than any human mouth could house.

           He rushes out of the room...

           MOMENTS LATER

           ...and returns with a hammer. His heart pounds as he opens 
           wide his mouth, pulls back the hammer.

           Eddie closes his eyes and lets fly.

           CRACK! He smacks himself in the mouth. His head jerks back 
           with the impact, blood splatters. He drops the hammer.

           One of the incisors now dangles loose from his jaw. He 
           reaches into his mouth. Pulls...Pulls...

           ...and finally YANKS it loose, unleashing a fresh wave of 
           pain. He drops the tooth to the floor, spits up more blood. 

           And that’s when he sees his feet...except they don’t look 
           like human feet anymore. They’re like hairy little hands. 
           Like possum feet.

           Eddie trembles. His bloody mouth goes wide. His eyelids 
           flutter.

           The phone RINGS from the other room. It’s jarring, impossibly 
           loud, more than he can take in his heightened state of fear.

           Eddie’s eyes close, his body stiffens, and he falls curled to 
           the floor, unconscious.

           The sun sets outside, leaving him in darkness.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Moonlight and shadows. 

           Crickets SCREECH like broken fiddles. 

           Owls HOOT bass notes.
           A CAR APPROACHES. 

           INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT (MOVING)

           A worried Charlene drives her BMW down a narrow, one-lane 
           dirt road lined by mossy forest on either side.

           The headlights illuminate a ramshackle farmhouse up ahead. 
           Eddie’s truck is there, too. 

           She pulls to a stop. Cuts the engine. Kills the lights. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlene approaches carrying a handbag. She takes in the 
           farmhouse. Sagging porch, peeling paint, weeds.

           She walks up the rickety porch stairs. Pulls open a CREAKY 
           screen door. Pushes the main door open.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Charlene enters and is immediately hit by the smell.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Eddie?

           She claps a hand over her nose and mouth. Looks to the living 
           room. He’s not there. Charlene continues into the...

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Charlene hears SKITTERING in the walls.  

                                 CHARLENE
                        Eddie? You here?

           Fear mounting, she approaches the music room door at the end 
           of the hall. She gathers her courage. Opens the door.

           MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Charlene enters and winces, the smell even worse here. Flies 
           BUZZ everywhere. 

                                 CHARLENE
                        Honey?
           No answer. Then she spots the tape recorder sitting on the 
           low table, a pair of headphones plugged into it.

           Cautiously she approaches. She hits REWIND on the tape 
           recorder. Hits STOP. She puts on the headphones. Hesitates. 
           Then hits PLAY.

           She listens. And starts to cry. We move in on her face as the 
           tears roll down her cheeks. 

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        What do you think?

           She startles. Rips off the headphones.

           Eddie stands in the doorway. The grandfather clock begins its 
           midnight CHIME from the other room.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        You like my songs?

           Charlene takes him in. Scratch marks. Strange white hairs all 
           over his face. Ears pointy and elongated. Mouth bloody, front 
           teeth missing.

           She is terrified.

                                 CHARLENE
                        What happened to you?

                                 EDDIE
                        Don’t you worry. 
                             (smiles)
                        I’m gonna be a Legend.

           He advances towards her. She backs away.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Where’s Randy?

           Eddie can’t help glancing toward the corner of the room. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Randy’s gone.

           She follows his gaze...and lands on Randy’s half-eaten 
           corpse, his face mostly chewed off. Charlene cups a hand to 
           her mouth in horror.

           The clock continues to chime.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        This ain’t what it looks like.
           He reaches out to her. She jumps back, evading his grasp. 

                                 CHARLENE
                        Don’t touch me!

                                 EDDIE
                        I had to do it. For the SSSSongs.

           Terrified she reaches into her handbag. The only weapon she 
           can come up with is a stainless steel palette knife. She 
           brandishes it as she backs away, hands shaking.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Stay away!

           He continues toward her. She slashes at the air between them.

                                 EDDIE
                        I wrote you a love song.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Stop!

                                 EDDIE
                        Just like you asked. 

           Charlene is sobbing now. Her whole body trembles. He reaches 
           for her again. She jabs at his hand, just missing. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be like that. You’re setting 
                        a bad example for the baby. 

                                 CHARLENE
                        Get back!

                                 EDDIE
                        This is all for you. 

                                 CHARLENE
                        ...n-n-n-no...

                                 EDDIE
                        For you and Eddie Junior.

                                 CHARLENE
                        ...no...

           He steps closer. Mad glint in his eye.

                                 EDDIE
                        I told you not to come here. You 
                        should have listened. But that’s 
                        okay. There’s a long road ahead. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                             (smiles)
                        Plenty of time to make up for one 
                        little miSSSSStake.

           Charlene backs against the piano, bumping into it. She hears 
           a SHUFFLING behind her.

           She whirls and finds herself face-to-face with Possum Jack, 
           sitting atop the piano, every bit as startled as she is. 
           Possum Jack widens his mouth and HISSES... 

           Charlene SCREAMS and jabs the palette knife at him out of 
           pure reflex.

           The blade plunges deep into his neck, cutting his HISS short, 
           spraying blood everywhere. She lets go of the palette knife.

           Eddie watches, wide-eyed as...

           Possum Jack stumbles across the piano top, knife handle 
           protruding from his throat, then tumbles down, bouncing off 
           the piano keys to strike an ATONAL CHORD...

           ...before falling to the ground, mortally wounded.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Eddie rushes to Possum Jack’s side, goes down on his hands 
           and knees. Blood pulses from Possum Jack’s neck. Eddie 
           regards Charlene. Tears of anger, sadness, hurt in his eyes.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        What have you done?

           Charlene hears a SCRATCHING sound. Turns to see Possum Jill 
           scramble out of the hole in the wall, her thirteen Joeys 
           clinging to her back, all of them staring right at her. 

           Possum Jill spots Possum Jack dead on the floor. She 
           unleashes an UNHOLY WAIL of shock and terror. 

           The Joeys join in, opening their mouths and in a SCREECHING 
           CHORUS of raw animal lament. 

           Charlene BOLTS from the room. 

           Eddie scrambles to his feet...

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Wait!
           ...and chases after her. He trips over a guitar stand. 
           Stumbles forward. Crashes into a teetering stack of 
           amplifiers. They tumble to the ground, blocking his path.

           He gets back to his feet. Clamors over the amps. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Charlene!

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie emerges into the hallway to find Charlene is already 
           halfway to the front door.

                                 EDDIE
                        Come back!

           He lumbers after her. She sprints to the end of the hall and 
           bursts through the front door.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

           Charlene races down the porch. Across the yard. She jumps in 
           her car just as Eddie emerges from the house.

                                 EDDIE
                        Charlene!

           INT. CHARLENE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Hands shaking, Charlene hits the car’s START button. The 
           engine RUMBLES to life. She puts it in reverse and FLOORS it 
           as Eddie staggers closer.

           Charlene cranks the wheel, shifts into DRIVE as the car 
           spins....

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...and the kicks up a whirlwind, leaving Eddie a ghostly 
           figure obscured in a fog of dust.

                                 EDDIE
                        ...Charlene...

           When the dust settles, she’s long gone. A distraught Eddie 
           listens as the car recedes unseen in the distance. 
           MUSIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Possum Jill stands over Possum Jack, in tears. She pats and 
           nuzzles him reassuringly, smeared with blood from his wound. 
           His breaths come in ragged GASPS.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        It’s okay. You’re going to be 
                        alright.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Not this time. I can hear the Grim 
                        Traveler approach.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        It’s only the wind. You’ll get 
                        better. You just need to rest.

           He coughs, SPLATTERING her face with droplets of blood.

                                 POSSUM JACK
                        Bring the Joeys closer.

           Possum Jill gestures. The Joeys gather around. 

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                             (to the Joeys)
                        Life is hard for our kind. But it 
                        is hard for all creatures. 
                        Everyone, even Legends, must one 
                        day walk the black path.

           Possum Jill weeps, beside herself.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        So be kind when you can. Sing your 
                        song while you still endure.

           The Joeys nod sadly. Possum Jack turns to Possum Jill.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        You’re a fine possum. I know it 
                        wasn’t always easy, being with 
                        someone like me. 

           Possum Jill shakes her head as if to dismiss the notion.

                                 POSSUM JACK (CONT’D)
                        I could ask for no better 
                        companion. I hope we will see each 
                        other again some day.
                             (then)
                        Goodbye, Jill.
           He closes his eyes. His body stiffens. His mouth goes wide.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                             (sobbing)
                        No. No, Jack. Don’t go.

           But he’s already gone.

           Eddie enters. He takes in Possum Jill and the thirteen Joeys 
           standing over the corpse of Possum Jack. He shudders. Possum 
           Jill turns. Gives him a look full of accusation. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I’m sorry.

           She and the Joeys just stare. Unnerved, he crosses. Grabs his 
           tape recorder. 

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Stop.

           He stops.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        Finish the songs.

                                 EDDIE
                        Nah, I think we’re done here.

           He starts back toward the door.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        There is still one song left. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Twelve songs, thirteen? It don’t 
                        make no difference.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        You’re wrong. And if you think your 
                        companion is going to take you 
                        back, you’re wrong there, too.

           Eddie stops. Turns. Regards her. 

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        She’s probably already on the phone 
                        to the police.

                                 EDDIE
                        Charlene wouldn’t do that.
                                 POSSUM JILL
                        You killed a man. You really think 
                        she’s going to let you anywhere 
                        near her Joey now? 

           Tears well in his eyes.

                                 EDDIE
                        Eddie. Not Joey. We’re naming the 
                        baby Eddie. 

           Possum Jill laughs darkly.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Look at yourself.

           He does. It’s not a pretty picture.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        There is no going back. We both 
                        lost something tonight. Don’t let 
                        it be for nothing.
                             (then)
                        Finish the songs.

                                 EDDIE
                        I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 
                             (off Jack)
                        He was the one with all the songs.

           Possum Jill gives him a sad smile. Steps closer to him.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Don’t you understand? Those songs 
                        were never his. They were always 
                        yours. They belong to you, and you 
                        alone. All my Jack did was reveal 
                        what was already there, deep inside 
                        of you.
                             (then)
                        He helped you become what you 
                        always were. He helped you sing 
                        your true self.

           Eddie shakes his head, not wanting to hear it.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        I am no Legend. I’m just an 
                        ordinary possum. But the Joeys 
                        inherited some of their father’s 
                        gift. There’s only one song left. 
                        Let us help you. 
                             (then)
                        Let us finish. 
           Eddie’s mind reels as he weighs his options. With so much 
           sacrificed already, what is there left to lose?

                                 EDDIE
                        What is it you want? That’s how 
                        this works right? You want 
                        something in exchange. You’re not 
                        eating me, I’ll tell you that much. 
                        That’s non-negotiable.

           The Joeys on her back CHATTER, titillated by the notion.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        I am no longer young. Jack was my 
                        final companion. These will be my 
                        final Joeys. Soon they will leave 
                        my back and wander off and make 
                        their way into the world and I will 
                        never see them again. When they 
                        have gone, I shall have no reason 
                        to endure. But I want to walk the 
                        black path knowing I did what’s 
                        best for them. That I gave them 
                        every chance to survive. To thrive. 
                        To share their gifts with the 
                        world. 
                             (then)
                        Let us finish. Together.

           LATER

           Possum Jack is draped under a pillowcase, his final resting 
           place festooned with animal bones, twigs, bits of orange 
           peel, guitar picks and junk food wrappers. 

           Eddie sits on the piano bench, tape recorder next to him. 
           Possum Jill faces him atop the piano, Joeys on her back.

           Eddie gives her a solemn nod. Hits the RECORD button.

                                 POSSUM JILL
                        Play a chord. Any chord.

           Eddie hits a minor chord. As the sound reverberates, the 
           Joeys climb down off Possum Jill. They fan out on either side 
           of her, facing Eddie. A choir. They begin to sway.

                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           He sounds the chord a second time. The room grows dark and 
           cavernous. The Joeys’ tails writhe in unison.
                                 POSSUM JILL (CONT’D)
                        Once more, with feeling.

           As the third chord sounds, the Joeys open their mouths, close 
           their eyes and go stiff.

           The song that bursts from Eddie is different this time. 

           The sweeping, lush ballad is no crude four track demo, it’s a 
           polished, full blown production with pedal steel guitars, 
           strings, multi-tracked vocals, background singers, layered 
           harmonies -- the works. 

                                 EDDIE
                             (singing)
                        I was locked up in Trousdale
                        Doing hard time
                        Scratching at the walls
                        Thinking on my crimes.

           Eddie glances up to see the room has become a prison cell. 
           Troubled, he quickly looks back down at the keyboard.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        When along come the warden
                        Whistlin’ a tune
                        ‘It’s your lucky day, son,
                        Got a cell mate for you.’

                        The man was scrawny and dirty
                        He was ugly as sin
                        But I gave him a smile
                        Said come right on in.

           Sensing a flicker of movement, Eddie looks over as Otis 
           enters the room behind him. He’s dressed in prison garb.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I asked him his name
                        But he just shook his head
                        Looked me in the eye
                        And this what he said...

           Eddie pounds the piano harder, building to the chorus. At the 
           back of the room, Otis mouths the words.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Come, sweet Joy
                        Don’t take too long
                        Just listen, you will hear me
                        Singing Possum’s song

           Eddie plays a turnaround, goes into the next verses.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        So I called him Possum
                        And Possum loved to sing
                        About sin and redemption
                        And all what’s between.

                        He would sing about loss
                        And he’d sing of regret
                        Songs of beauty and heartache
                        Gals he couldn’t forget.

           Otis smiles wistfully at the memory of the songs, the girls.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        He was locked up for killin’
                        The woman he loved
                        When I asked if he done it
                        He just kinda shrugged.

           Otis shakes his head, annoyed -- that’s not how it happened.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        He said we’re all sinners
                        In the eyes of the Lord
                        But I expect when I die
                        There won’t be no reward.

                                 OTIS
                        I never said that. I’m innocent!

                                 EDDIE
                        And he sang...
                        Come, sweet Joy
                        Don’t you take too long
                        Just listen, you will hear me
                        Singing Possum’s song.

           One by one, the Joeys begin to unfreeze. Their bodies move to 
           the music. Their tails languidly sway. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, they let me out of prison
                        One bright summer day
                        And I said goodbye to Possum
                        Wasn’t much more to say.

           Otis waves and disappears. Joeys crawl across the piano top 
           toward Eddie. A tear rolls down Possum Jill’s cheek. She 
           knows she is losing them.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I had no family waiting
                        No friends and no car
                        Just one hundred dollars
                        So I bought this guitar.

           The room becomes a Nashville street corner. Joeys gently leap 
           onto Eddie. Climb up his arms. Over his shoulders.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Hung my hat on the corner
                        Of Broadway and Third
                        And I strummed that guitar
                        And I sang Possum’s words.

           Passersby stop to listen. Among them, the gas station clerk. 
           Lucinda from the animal shelter. The Production Assistant. 
           Katie Cook. Cody Allan. Manager Randy. A not-yet-pregnant 
           Charlene. Joeys nuzzle Eddie’s neck. Climb into his hair.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        A crowd gathered round me
                        And they filled up my hat
                        With quarters and dollars
                        And a record contract.

           The room becomes the opulent bed room in Eddie’s mansion. The 
           painting of Eddie and Charlene now depicts Possum Jack and 
           Possum Jill. Charlene approaches from behind, puts her arms 
           around Eddie. Joeys start to climb on her, too.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I made a gold record
                        Got a house and a wife
                        Had a pool and a truck
                        And a pretty good life.
                        But things for Possum
                        They turned out all wrong
                        He was jealous and angry
                        Said I’d stolen his songs.

           Otis enters the mansion living room. Disgusted, envious. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        When he got out of prison
                        Possum paid me a call
                        Said he’d tell the whole world
                        The truth of it all.

           The room transforms to the music room the way it was the 
           night Eddie first came to the farmhouse. Charlene still 
           embraces Eddie, but now she is pregnant. Otis is slumped 
           against the wall, chewing his fingernails.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I laughed in his face
                        Said you can’t do me no harm
                        That same night Possum died
                        With a needle in his arm
                        Singing…

           The room becomes the river side, corpse Otis slumped against 
           the column under the bridge. His hat blows off, tumbles away.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Come, sweet Joy
                        Don’t you take too long
                        If you listen, you will hear me
                        Singing Possum’s song.

           The room is just the room now. A baby’s hand presses out 
           against Charlene’s belly, the imprint visible through her 
           skin. Except the baby’s hand has claws, like a possum’s paw.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        The night Possum passed
                        The songs they died too
                        No more words would come
                        And I knew I was through.

                        The money ran out
                        And so did the wife...
                        Lost my house and my truck
                        And my pretty good life.

           Charlene sobs as she vanishes.

           The room becomes another prison cell. This one smaller, 
           filthy, filled with flies and animal carcasses and the 
           corpses of Randy and Otis and Possum Jack. Beady eyes stare 
           out from a hole in the wall.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Now they got me in Bledsoe
                        Doing hard time
                        Scratching at the walls
                        Thinking on my crimes...

           The song slows and the instruments fall away, leaving only 
           Eddie’s voice. The room goes totally dark save for a lone 
           spotlight on Eddie.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        And Possum’s old songs 
                        Are my only true friends
                        So I just sit and sing
                        While I wait for the end
                        Singing...
           And now the instruments return. The lights come up and Joeys 
           crawl into the opening of Eddie’s shirt collar. Into his 
           sleeves. Up his pant leg. His clothes bulge and wriggle as 
           the Joeys move beneath them.

           Eddie closes his eyes as he belts out the final chorus.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Come, sweet Death
                        Don’t you take too long
                        Just listen you will hear me
                        Singing Possum’s song.

           Possum Jill blinks away another tear. Then she sadly turns 
           away. Her children are on their own now. She climbs down off 
           the piano. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        ...Singing Possum’s song
                        ...Singing...
                        ...Possum’s...
                        ...song...

           The tune ends with an eerie, rising crescendo that builds and 
           builds and then suddenly comes crashing down with a final, 
           THUNDEROUS PIANO CHORD.

           Eddie slumps against the piano, utterly spent.

           The tape recorder runs out of tape, the tail end FLAPPING 
           over and over against the take up reel.

           At length Eddie opens his eyes. Looks around.

           Possum Jill and the Joeys are gone. He’s all alone.

           PRE-LAP: A roaring FIRE.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           The farmhouse is engulfed in flames. Eddie’s truck is on 
           fire, too. 

           Light flickers across Eddie’s whiskered face as he watches 
           smoke rise into the black sky.

           Eddie hears SIRENS approach in the distance. He turns and 
           walks into the mossy forest, tape recorder under his arm.
           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Eddie walks down the center of the road, tape recorder still 
           under his arm. He senses something behind him. Turns.

           Pinpricks of light emerge in the distance. Headlights. They 
           grow closer, bigger. The massive, gleaming black semi-truck -- 
           The Grim Traveler -- bears down on him.  

           Eddie is blinded by the headlights. The sound of the engine 
           is DEAFENING as the truck ROARS towards him. 

           He doesn’t even try to get out of the way this time. His lips 
           curl back. His body starts to grows rigid. He closes his 
           eyes. Waits for impact.

           Instead then there’s a sudden RUSH of wind and a screaming 
           HISS of hydraulic brakes. 

           Eddie opens his eyes. 

           The truck has come to a sudden halt inches from his face. 
           Steam rises from the hood. The engine GROWLS as it idles.

           Then the passenger door slowly swings open.

           Eddie hesitates. 

           Then he approaches the monstrous black cab. He can’t make out 
           the driver inside, but he can hear ancient country music 
           quietly playing on the stereo -- The Carter Family’s eerie 
           “Bury Me Under the Weeping Willow Tree” circa 1927. 

           Summoning his courage, Eddie climbs inside. The door closes 
           all on its own. The RUMBLING of the engine merges with...

           PRE-LAP: Audience APPLAUSE.

           INT. TV STUDIO - GREEN ROOM - DAY

           Eddie sits alone on a sofa, listening to the applause in the 
           nearby studio. He wears a baggy, loose fitting coat and a 
           cowboy hat pulled low over his ears.

           His face is covered in a downy white fur that resembles the 
           beginnings of a beard if you don’t look to closely. His once 
           blue eyes are now black and beady. 

           He bites his nails. Skittish, nervous.

           The door opens. The same Production Assistant we saw earlier 
           stands on the other side.
                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        Okay, they’re ready for you.

           Eddie stands.

           BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Production Assistant escorts him down the hallway. 

           He moves slowly, hunched over. Almost waddling. 

           Unseen by him, the Production Assistant stiffens and recoils. 
           Eddie Vesco smells awful.

           Over the PA system, we hear show co-host Katie Cook.

                                 KATIE COOK (V.O.)(O.S.)
                        Now put your hands together and 
                        welcome back the one and only Eddie 
                        Vesco! 

           The Production Assistant parts a curtain. Eddies hesitates, 
           eyelids fluttering. He summons his resolve, and passes 
           through it...

           INT. TV STUDIO - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           ...and strolls onstage to massive APPLAUSE. He’s back on the 
           set of “CMT Hot Twenty.” The lights are bright as hell.

           Eddie doesn’t acknowledge the audience. Doesn’t shake hands 
           with the hosts. He sits in his chair so fast its like the 
           music just stopped in a game of musical chairs.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Welcome back.

                                 EDDIE
                        Same to you. 

           The audience chuckles. It unnerves him.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        You look like you’ve gone full 
                        Grizzly Adams on us.

           Eddie is puzzled. Doesn’t get it.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Only thing beats a man who cleans 
                        up good is one who dirties down 
                        better. Am I right, ladies?
           CAT CALLS and WHISTLES in the audience startle Eddie.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        Easy, now. Eddie Vesco is a happily 
                        married man. 

           Eddie flinches at mention of his marriage.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Now last time you were on the show, 
                        you offered to share something very 
                        special with our audience, isn’t 
                        that right?

           Eddie nods, bites his nails. The hosts exchange looks.

                                 CODY ALLAN
                        Why don’t you remind everyone what 
                        that was.

                                 EDDIE
                             (mumbles)
                        A song.

           They wait for him to elaborate. He doesn’t.

                                 KATIE COOK
                        As I recall, you were going away to 
                        record demos for your next album. 
                        And you promised to preview one 
                        these songs exclusively for us here 
                        at CMT Hot Twenty.  

           The audience APPLAUDS. Eddie looks and sees several POLICE 
           enter at the back of the auditorium. He glances to the side, 
           sees more police waiting in the wings. 

                                 KATIE COOK (CONT’D)
                        You want to tell us a little about 
                        this new song of yours?

           Eddie grows thoughtful, feeling the weight of the moment.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yes. Yes, I would, ma’am.

           The audience quiets. He speaks haltingly, the effort showing.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        This is a special song. Last song 
                        we ever recorded. Number thirteen. 
                             (beat)
                        This song iSSSSS from the heart. 
           He starts to choke up. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        This song is who I am.

           The hosts exchange another round of looks. Folks in the 
           audience look uneasy at the naked emotion on display. 

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Does it have a name?

                                 EDDIE
                        I call it ‘Possum’s Song.’

                                 KATIE COOK
                        Well, alright. Let’s hear it!

           A pregnant silence. Then the song comes over the PA. 

           It begins sweetly enough -- it’s a rougher, less produced 
           version the ballad we heard earlier. The audience seems to be 
           into it though, swaying, bobbing their heads.

           But then the vocals start. 

           And instead of Eddie’s honeyed baritone telling that 
           heartbreaking story we heard earlier...

           ...there’s just a series of SNARLS and HISSES and SCREECHES, 
           and terrified ANIMAL SOUNDS.

           The hosts are stunned. 

           The audience is stunned. 

           Eddie is stunned.

           Then Eddie looks down. Something stirs beneath his coat. 
           Several somethings. The coat bulges as these somethings 
           writhe and squirm, looking for a way out.

           A coat button near Eddie’s abdomen POPS OFF. 

           The audience GASPS, horrified as...

           Through the pouch-like opening in Eddie’s coat, one by one 
           out crawl the thirteen Joeys. 

           They clamor across his body. Down his legs. To the studio 
           floor. The scrabble across the stage, toward the audience.

           Cody Allan screams! 

           Security guards rush Katie Cook offstage.
           Pandemonium erupts in the audience. Folks scramble for the 
           exits as the horrid hissing and screeching of the song 
           continues. 

           Eddie looks out on the audience, troubled by their reaction 
           to his beautiful song. And then he spots him. Standing 
           absolutely still amongst the chaos.

           Otis. 

           Alive and smiling and tipping his greasy ball cap. 

           Police clamor down the aisles toward the stage. 

           Something flops out of the back of Eddie’s pants -- a long 
           possum tail, pink, hairless and grotesque. 

           Eddie’s eyelids flutter and then close and his body stiffens 
           and he falls curled to the floor and we...

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
