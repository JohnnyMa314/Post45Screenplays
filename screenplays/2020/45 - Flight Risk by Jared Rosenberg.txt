           INT. CESSNA 206 - DAY

           A cramped, analog six-seater, powered by a single propeller. 
           Three rows of two seats, including the pilot’s. Roughly the 
           size and layout of your standard minivan.

           The second-row passenger door opens. Light shines in.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Get in.

           WINSTON pokes his head in. Late 20s/30s. Wiry. Thick plastic 
           glasses. Immaculately groomed. Crisply pressed clothes.

           He looks around the cabin, horrified at the cracked leather 
           seats and stained carpet.

                                 WINSTON
                        What - this? What is this?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        The charter, Winston. Get in.

           Winston reluctantly shimmies into the middle row of seats, a 
           coat draped over his arms.

                                 WINSTON
                        It’s just, you say you chartered a 
                        private plane, I’m thinking 
                        Gulfstream, you know? Learjet. Real 
                        Jay-Z shit. Not “Antiques 
                        Roadshow.”

           The woman - MADOLYN HARRIS - climbs in after Winston. 
           30s/40s, no nonsense, and already weary of Winston’s shtick.

                                 MADOLYN
                        That’s a jet. I never said “jet.” I 
                        said we got a private plane, and 
                        that’s what this is.

                                 WINSTON
                        This isn’t a plane. This is a kite 
                        with seat belts.

           No smile from Madolyn.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Arms.

           Winston raises his arms so that Madolyn can buckle him in, 
           because... He’s HANDCUFFED. Feet are shackled too.
                                 WINSTON
                        It’s some bullshit, is all.

           He sniffs the seat. Grimaces. Madolyn sighs as she tightens 
           his seat belt.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Well, Winston, what do you want me 
                        to say? Next time, hide out in 
                        Miami.

           She shackles his hands to his feet with a THIRD SET of 
           HANDCUFFS. It’s not uncomfortable, but he has very limited 
           range of motion and cannot reach his seat belt.

                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        Miami, maybe you get a jet. But you 
                        go full Unabomber on me, drag me 
                        all the way out to bum-fuck Alaska, 
                        our options get a little more 
                        limited.

           She climbs forward into the co-pilot’s seat, and we glimpse a 
           GUN, a TASER, and a BADGE clipped to her belt.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I doubt we could even land a jet 
                        out here.

                                 WINSTON
                            (mumbles)
                        ...You can’t go off the grid in 
                        Miami...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah, and a lot of good that did 
                        you.

           She spots a FIGURINE mounted to the top of the instrument 
           panel: a GRIZZLY BEAR standing on its hind legs, and wearing 
           a GRASS SKIRT like a hula dancer.

           Madolyn cringes, and digs out a SATELLITE PHONE. Dials.

           A FEMALE VOICE answers. Supervisory Deputy CAROLINE VAN SANT. 
           40s, confident.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Van Sant.

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s Madolyn.
                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I was starting to get worried.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Don’t be. We’re just about good to 
                        go. 

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Is he cooperating?

                                 MADOLYN
                        If I say no, can I tase him?

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey-!

                                 MADOLYN
                        Seriously, Caroline, thank you for 
                        putting me in the field again. I 
                        know you had pushback.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Don’t thank me yet, I just got off 
                        the phone with the D.A.: Judge 
                        Ziegler’s been replaced.

           Madolyn frowns. Replaced? But her train of thought is broken 
           by:

                                 WINSTON
                        Is that your boss? Is she hot? She 
                        sounds hot-

                                 MADOLYN
                            (covering the phone)
                        Winston, I swear to god-

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hello?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah, uh... replaced with who?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Falco.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Falco?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I know. And true to form, he’s not 
                        letting us push the trial date 
                        again.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Shit. 

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Look, it’s going to be fine. I’ve 
                        got a team standing by to meet you 
                        in Anchorage. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Understood. We should be there in 
                        ninety minutes or so.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Good. Moretti’s lawyers are trying 
                        to run out the clock on us, but 
                        I’ve done the math: you’ll have to 
                        fly all night, but we can still 
                        make New York by morning, okay? 
                        Just get going.

                                 MADOLYN
                            (”fuck.”)
                        Yeah.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Call me from Anchorage. And 
                        Madolyn? Good luck.

           Madolyn hangs up. Checks her watch. Fuming. 

           In the back, Winston clears his throat.

                                 WINSTON
                        So... am I free to go? Or...

           Thunk. The pilot’s door opens and DARYL BOOTH climbs into the 
           pilot’s seat beside Madolyn. He’s 40s. Rough-hewn and rugged, 
           with a ratty baseball cap and an easy, backwoods swagger.

                                 DARYL
                        Deputy Harris? 

           He offers a calloused hand.

                                 DARYL
                        Daryl Booth. Welcome aboard.

           They shake. Daryl offers an awkward nod to Winston.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We’re in a bit of rush, Mister 
                        Booth.
                                 DARYL
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Daryl starts performing his pre-flight checklist. He notices 
           Madolyn buckling her shoulder straps in the copilot’s seat.

                                 DARYL
                        You, uh-- you sure you don’t want 
                        to ride back there with him?

           Madolyn glances back at Winston. He smiles pleasantly.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Absolutely not.

                                 WINSTON
                        Well you don’t have to be mean...

                                 DARYL
                        I only meant -- shouldn’t, uh, 
                        someone be watching him?

                                 MADOLYN
                        He’s restrained, Mr. Booth. He’s 
                        not going anywhere. Trust me.

                                 DARYL
                        Okay, hey -- you’re the boss.

           He flips a few more switches. Auxiliary power. Running 
           lights.

                                 DARYL
                        I just -- I never flew a fugitive 
                        before.

                                 WINSTON
                        Witness.

                                 DARYL
                        What?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Shut up, Winston.

                                 WINSTON
                        I’m a cooperating government 
                        witness. Not a fugitive.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston!
                                 WINSTON
                        I’m just saying: technically, we’re 
                        all on the same side here.

           Madolyn glares back at him. Winston shrugs. What?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Not. Another. Word.

           Beat.

           Daryl looks from Winston to Madolyn. Turns back to his 
           checklist.

                                 DARYL
                        Right... well, we’re looking at 
                        moderate clouds and- 

                                 MADOLYN
                        And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t 
                        address the prisoner.

                                 DARYL
                        ...Light wind. 
                            (beat)
                        Yes, ma’am. 
                            (beat)
                        Sorry, never flown a U.S. Marshal 
                        before, neither.

           He flips the final few switches.

                                 DARYL
                        Did fly Marshall Faulk once. That 
                        was cool.

           VROOM. He thumbs the ignition, and the plane’s single 
           propeller SPUTTERS to life.

           The plane RATTLES. Madolyn takes a steadying breath.

           Daryl dons his RADIO HEADSET. Keys his transmitter.

                                 DARYL
                        Radio tower Bethel, Skyhawk two-oh-
                        six delta. Ready for departure.

           A moment of radio static. Madolyn checks her watch.

                                 DARYL
                        Roger that, tower. Skyhawk two-oh-
                        six delta, cleared for take-off, 
                        runway one-six-four.
           He opens the throttle, and the plane rolls forward, picking 
           up speed.

           Daryl pulls back on the yoke, and the Cessna lifts 
           effortlessly in the air. Gliding up over the Alaskan 
           wilderness.

           The Cessna is no commercial airliner: you feel every little 
           vibration, jostle, and air pocket. The very rivets rattle.

           Atop the instrument panel, the HULA GRIZZLY dances and sways.

           Madolyn leans over to Daryl, shouting over the drone of the 
           propeller.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Is it always-?

           Daryl shakes his head and taps his headset’s EARCUPS. He 
           points to a SECOND radio headset by Madolyn’s knee. Use that.

           Madolyn puts on the headset. The hum of the prop falls away, 
           and is replaced by the ISLAND RHYTHMS of “Changes in 
           Altitude, Changes in Latitude” crackling through the headset.

                                 DARYL
                        You like Buffet?

           Madolyn just glares. Daryl kills the music.

                                 DARYL
                        Not a Parrot Head, huh?
                            (off her look)
                        Yeah, I know. But up here, you’ve 
                        got to bring the beach to you.

           He points to the hula grizzly, swaying on the dash.

                                 DARYL
                        See? She gets it.

           Madolyn rolls her eyes. A gust of wind JOSTLES the plane.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Is it always this bumpy?

                                 DARYL
                        Bit of a cross-wind is all. It 
                        should even out once we hit three 
                        thousand feet.

           Madolyn nods. Turns and looks out the window. Without the 
           music and engine drone, it’s suddenly quiet and peaceful. 
           Outside, the view is stunningly beautiful.

           Daryl breaks out a pack of nicotine gum. Pops one in his 
           mouth. Offers the pack to Madolyn.

                                 DARYL
                        You a smoker?

           She shakes her head.

                                 DARYL
                        Yeah, it ain’t the same.

           They fly in silence for a beat, taking in the stunning beauty 
           of the Alaskan wilderness.

                                 DARYL
                        So what’d he do?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Huh?

                                 DARYL
                            (nods at Winston)
                        The twig in the back seat. You said 
                        he’s a witness?

           Madolyn looks away. Doesn’t answer.

                                 DARYL
                        Okay. Forget I asked.
                            (beat)
                        You got to understand: my usual 
                        haul is a drunk fishing party, or a 
                        bunch of suits looking to 
                        experience “true nature.”

           He turns back to the yoke, a little hurt.

           Madolyn stares out the window for a beat. Relents. Fine, I’ll 
           throw the guy a bone. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        You been flying long?

                                 DARYL
                            (just happy to talk)
                        Damn near all my life. My daddy was 
                        a crop duster. Round Texas mostly. 
                        Then he skipped out on the bankman, 
                        and we moved to Florida. Flew 
                        puddle jumpers through the Keys.

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        I came up here doing summer 
                        charters maybe - fifteen - years 
                        ago? Never left.

           Madolyn stares out the window: virgin wilderness as far as 
           the eye can see.

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 DARYL
                        That it is.

           He BANKS the plane. Madolyn steadies herself on the 
           instrument panel as the WORLD TILTS.

           Daryl smiles, chewing his gum.

                                 DARYL
                        You’ll get used to it.

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna soars over jagged peaks and dense forests. 

           Not a soul in sight.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           In the back seat, Winston works his jaw, attempting to pop 
           his ears. He absentmindedly fiddles with his restraints.

           UP FRONT

           Madolyn stares out at the endless wilderness. Lost in 
           thought.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        Ah, shit.

           She looks over: Daryl taps the GPS mounted in the instrument 
           panel.

                                 DARYL
                        Come on...

           The GPS screen is blank.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Everything okay?
                                 DARYL
                        Yup, fine. Nothing to worry about.
                            (off her look)
                        This piece of shit keeps shorting 
                        out on me.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We have no GPS?

                                 DARYL
                        It’s no big deal. Really. This shit 
                        happens twice a week.

           Madolyn hesitates, not loving this new development.

                                 DARYL
                        Seriously, I fly this route all the 
                        time. Seventy-five minutes from 
                        now, we’ll be on the ground, and 
                        you and the twig will be on your 
                        way to Seattle, I promise.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You don’t think we should turn 
                        back?

                                 DARYL
                        No! God no.
                            (off her look)
                        Hey, it’s your call, I get paid 
                        either way. But there’s some 
                        weather moving in from the north, 
                        so if we head back, it’ll probably 
                        ground us for a few hours.

           Fuck. Madolyn checks her watch.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Seventy-five minutes?

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           It’s LOUD without headsets, and Winston can’t hear anything 
           being said up front.

           He sees Madolyn check her watch and nod to Daryl.

           On Winston, watching, fiddling with his restraints...

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           The plane flies deeper into the wilderness.
           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           Daryl glances at Madolyn: anxiously drumming her fingers 
           against her knee. He frowns. Takes pity.

                                 DARYL
                        So, how long you been with the 
                        Marshals?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hmm? Oh, uh, seven... almost eight 
                        years.

                                 DARYL
                        Must be a lot of traveling.

           Madolyn shrugs.

                                 DARYL
                        You like it?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I like quiet.

           Daryl grins. Chomps his gum. He BANKS the plane again.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston fidgets. Bored without an audience.

           As the plane tilts, a piece of PAPER slides into view, 
           peeking out from beneath the pilot’s chair.

           Winston double takes: wait... what does that say..?

           He reaches for it, but the shackles are too constricting.

           He stretches out his foot. Awkwardly contorting to slide the 
           paper out from underneath the pilot’s seat.

           It’s a printed CARD. The letters on the bottom read: 

                        “MUST BE DISPLAYED AT ALL TIMES.”

           Winston cranes his neck to read it... it’s an Alaska State 
           Charter License for “Daryl Booth.”

           He shimmies the paper out a little further. Eyes widening...

           ...The picture of the MAN on the license looks nothing like 
           the man currently piloting the plane. Not even close.
                                 WINSTON
                        Oh, fuck.

           Winston reels. Mind spinning...

           UP FRONT

           A thought occurs to Daryl. He turns to Madolyn, who’s lost in 
           thought.

                                 DARYL
                        Why is he in chains?

                                 MADOLYN
                        What?

                                 DARYL
                        The twig. If he’s a witness, how 
                        come he’s all chained up?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Because he’s a flight risk.

                                 WINSTON (MOS)
                        Deputy Harris..? Deputy Harris..!

           But Madolyn can’t hear Winston with the noise-cancelling 
           headset on. And she can’t see him trying to talk to her over 
           her shoulder.

                                 DARYL
                        Oh. I thought he said you two were 
                        on the same side. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        He’s a liar.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston scrambles. How to get Madolyn’s attention? 

           He tries to kick her seat, but he’s sitting behind the pilot, 
           and the shackles prevent him from reaching it.

           He stretches, straining against the seatbelt... but can 
           barely tap against Madolyn’s seat.

                                 WINSTON
                        Come on... look at me.

           He tries again. And again... but Madolyn doesn’t notice. 
           UP FRONT

           Madolyn watches the HULA GRIZZLY sway back and forth as, 
           behind her, Winston attempts to get her attention, unnoticed.

                                 DARYL
                            (re: the hula grizzly)
                        Ain’t she great?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Dancing for your entertainment?

                                 DARYL
                        Hey! C’mon now, she’s resilient.
                            (off Madolyn’s look)
                        Yeah, I know: look at me with the 
                        ten-dollar words, right? Don’t tell 
                        nobody. But the fact is, she just 
                        keeps dancing through all the bumps 
                        and turns and turbulence. Nothing 
                        phases her. And if you can’t get on 
                        board with that, then, well...
                            (beat)
                        I don’t care, it’s my plane.

           The bear sways. Madolyn smiles small in spite of herself.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston sweats. Panic rising. Mind racing. He looks at the 
           BUTTON on his flannel shirt.

           He grabs it between his teeth, yanking at the thread, and 
           bites the button off.

           Keeping it in his teeth, he aims at Madolyn and SPITS.

           The button arcs. Bounces off the instrument panel in front of 
           her. Madolyn spins around.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What was that?

                                 WINSTON
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What?

           She removes an earcup.

                                 WINSTON
                        I said I-
           He glances at “Daryl.” Feels Daryl’s eyes watching him in the 
           rearview mirror.

                                 WINSTON
                        I... dropped something. Down by my 
                        foot.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You’ll deal.

           She turns away--

                                 WINSTON
                        Wait-wait-wait! I don’t feel well.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I don’t care, Winston. Suck it up.

                                 WINSTON
                        I’m serious. I feel bad. I- I have 
                        a bad feeling.

           He glances at Daryl. Madolyn’s eyes flare.

                                 WINSTON
                        Maybe we should turn back.

           Madolyn hesitates. Sees the fear in his eyes. Is it genuine? 
           Or is she being played?

           Winston blinks. The slightest of nods.

           Beat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Take some deep breaths, Winston. 
                        You’ll be fine.

           She turns back to the front seat. A sideways glance at Daryl.

                                 DARYL
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Nothing. He says he feels sick.

                                 DARYL
                        Not in my plane-!

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s fine. He’ll be fine.
                            (beat)
                        What’s our E.T.A?
                                 DARYL
                        An hour...ish? Soon.

           He grins reassuringly. Pops in a fresh piece of nicotine gum.

           Madolyn nods. Looks out at the vast wilderness around them.

                                 MADOLYN
                        When are we going to see 
                        civilization again?

                                 DARYL
                        Oof. Round these parts? Not ‘til 
                        final approach.

           Madolyn nods and drums her fingers against her leg. Traces 
           the outline of her holster.

           She looks at the broken GPS again. And at Daryl: relaxed and 
           confident at the controls. 

           She studies his hands: strong and calloused, gripping the 
           yoke. The hands of a threat? Or simply an Alaskan bush pilot?

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...How did you know about Seattle?

                                 DARYL
                        What?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Earlier. You said you’d have us on 
                        our way to Seattle before we knew 
                        it. How’d you know that’s where 
                        we’re headed?

                                 DARYL
                        Shit, where else can you go? You 
                        ain’t no Alaskan, I can tell you 
                        that. So ain’t no way you’re 
                        staying in Anchorage. No offense.

           He smiles at her. On Madolyn: Okay... maybe that checks out.

           A gust of wind JOLTS the plane. 

           Madolyn casually surveys the cabin, which suddenly seems way 
           more claustrophobic and vulnerable. Every screw and rivet 
           seems to RATTLE as Daryl continues to ramble:

                                 DARYL
                            (rambling)
                        ...In fact, if I had to guess, I’d 
                        say you’ve got that Yankee blood. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        Not much of an accent, but you 
                        remind me of this gal I used to--

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey, can I radio ATC on these?

           She points to the radio headset.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I need to check in.

                                 DARYL
                        Already?

                                 MADOLYN
                            (a shrug)
                        Protocol.

                                 DARYL
                        Yeah alright. Sure.

           He fiddles with the radio dials.

                                 DARYL
                        Radio tower Bethel, Skyhawk two-oh-
                        six delta.

           Static.

                                 DARYL
                        Come in, ATC Bethel. This is 
                        Skyhawk two-oh-six delta, over.

           On Madolyn: Come on...

           IN THE BACK

           Winston bounces his knee, shackles jangling. Trying to keep 
           it together.

           He rubs his sweaty palms against one another as --

           UP FRONT

           Daryl fiddles with the dials some more.

                                 DARYL
                        Radio tower Bethel, this is Skyhawk 
                        two-oh-six delta. Come in.

           More static.
           On Madolyn: C’mon-c’mon-c’mon...

                                 DARYL
                        Radio tower Bethel!

           Static. Daryl gives up. Sits back and shakes his head.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Nothing?

                                 DARYL
                        Probably just the mountains 
                        blocking the signal. Should be fine 
                        in another few minutes.

           Madolyn nods. Glances back at Winston. Silent alarm bells 
           going off inside her head. 

           Think! 

           Her fingers trace the holster strapped to her leg.

           Think-think-think--

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        Whoa!

           Madolyn jolts.

                                 DARYL
                        Look-it.

           He points: a stunning WATERFALL cascades over a dramatic 
           cliff.

           Daryl beams.

                                 DARYL
                        It’s something else out here, ain’t 
                        it?

           Madolyn nods. Heart in her throat.

           Daryl banks the plane, throwing Madolyn off balance again.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           On Winston: scared, as the sky begins to DARKEN outside his 
           window.
           EXT. ALASKAN SKIES - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna enters into THICK CLOUDS, a lonely, dark spec in 
           the middle of a vast GRAY VOID.

           It’s impossible to tell up from down. They could be hurtling 
           straight for a mountainside for all we know.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           Daryl flicks on the autopilot. Madolyn strains to see through 
           the endless gray void. 

                                 DARYL
                        Kinda spooky, huh? Local pilots 
                        call this “Eskimo soup.”

           Madolyn’s eyes light up, realizing:

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...The flying community up here 
                        must be a pretty small group.

           Daryl shrugs.

                                 MADOLYN
                        So you must know the pilot who flew 
                        me up here last week. Uh... Jani- 
                        Janikowski?

           Daryl grins.

                                 DARYL
                        Janikowski. Sure. Great guy. Man, 
                        one time, up in Nome, he and I got 
                        our hands on some nitrous and a 
                        welding torch and... well, like I 
                        said, great guy.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah. Seemed like it.

           She discreetly UNBUCKLES her seatbelt.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Except she’s a woman.

           But Daryl just smiles and shakes his head. Unfazed.

                                 DARYL
                        If you say so.

           He winks. 
           Beat. 

           WHAM! They SPRING on each other at the EXACT SAME TIME. A 
           furious, cramped, messy struggle.

           Madolyn goes for her gun, but Daryl GRABS her wrist. A 
           desperate flurry of PUNCHES and BLOCKS, with zero room to 
           maneuver. 

           It’s like fighting in an elevator. Or a coffin.

           Headsets go flying. Errant switches are flipped. Warning 
           alarms BEEP and BLARE. 

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston SHOUTS and struggles in vain as --

           DARYL

           -- Pulls a KNIFE hidden behind a false panel in his door.

                                 WINSTON
                        Knife! Knife!

           Winston struggles against his restraints as --

           -- Daryl SLASHES at Madolyn with the knife.

           Madolyn blocks it. Knocks it free. It tumbles beneath the 
           seat.

           She goes for her taser as - 

           - Daryl JERKS the yoke.

           The plane banks. DIVES.

           Winston screams. The engine whines. Alarms BLARE.

           They BURST through the cloud layer. The forest below rushes 
           up to meet them.

           Madolyn’s thrown. Tries to recover --

           THWACK!

           Daryl’s fist SLAMS into her. She reels, stunned, and -- 
           crack! -- a SECOND PUNCH knocks her out cold.

           She slumps against her door.
                                 DARYL
                            (panting)
                        Jesus fucking Christ.

           [Note: for clarity, we’re going to continue to refer to this 
           character as Daryl.]

           He flicks some switches and levels out the plane. The alarms 
           cut out.

           Daryl checks his lip for blood and smooths back his hair, 
           glancing over at Madolyn.

                                 DARYL
                        Shit.

           He catches his breath and starts climbing back into the 
           clouds.

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston struggles desperately - futilely - against his 
           restraints. The skin around his wrists tears and chafes.

                                 WINSTON
                            (under his breath)
                        Oh shit. Oh shit-shit-shit-!

                                 DARYL
                        How you doing back there, Winston?

           Daryl finds Winston in the rearview. His eyes clear and cold. 
           Dangerous. Winston freezes.

                                 DARYL
                        Mister Moretti sends his regards.

                                 WINSTON
                        I haven’t told them anything, man. 
                        I haven’t-

                                 DARYL
                        Winston. Winston, stop. Stop-stop-
                        stop.
                            (gentle, earnest)
                        I know, man. I know. You haven’t 
                        said shit.

                                 WINSTON
                        That’s right.
                                 DARYL
                        Yeah. 
                            (beat)
                        And now you never will.

           Winston sags back, his chest panic-heaving, on the verge of 
           tears.

                                 WINSTON
                            (blurting)
                        I can pay you!

           Daryl scoffs.

                                 DARYL
                        Aw, c’mon, brother. Have a little 
                        self-respect.

                                 WINSTON
                        I mean it. A- a million dollars. In 
                        crypto --

           Daryl starts laughing.

                                 WINSTON (CONT'D)
                        -- Untraceable. Just let me go.

                                 DARYL
                        Do I look like the kind of guy that 
                        deals in “crypto?”

                                 WINSTON
                        Cash then! Fuck! What does it 
                        matter? I’m talking about a million 
                        fucking dollars, man!

           He sniffs, all tears and flop sweat. Desperate.

           Outside: the bleak clouds envelope the plane again as it 
           continues to climb.

           Daryl glances over at Madolyn: still out cold in the co-
           pilot’s seat.

                                 DARYL
                        And you got all that just 
                        squirreled away, huh?

                                 WINSTON
                        I was Moretti’s accountant. So 
                        yeah, I skimmed.

                                 DARYL
                        A million dollars?
                                 WINSTON
                        Do you have any idea how much money 
                        I hid for that man? He sure 
                        doesn’t. 

           IN THE COPILOT'S SEAT

           Madolyn’s closed eye twitches... hard to tell if she’s awake 
           or not...

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Winston leans forward, imploring:

                                 WINSTON
                        Besides, you wouldn’t believe how 
                        many people got a taste. This one 
                        guy in Sankaty got twenty-five 
                        grand a month, for years!
                            (beat)
                        All you have to do is let me walk 
                        away.

                                 DARYL
                        That’s it, huh?

           Daryl mulls it over, less than convinced.

                                 WINSTON
                        Look, what’s your plan? Fly to some 
                        deserted airstrip and leave us for 
                        the wolves?

                                 DARYL
                        Something like that.

                                 WINSTON
                        So who’s going to know, man? I’ll 
                        disappear. You get to say you did 
                        your job, and get a million extra 
                        dollars to show for it.

           Daryl sucks his teeth, thinking. He flips some switches on 
           the instrument panel. Makes some adjustments.

                                 DARYL
                        You know what the difference 
                        between you and me is, twig?

                                 WINSTON
                        A million dollars-?
                                 DARYL
                        Principles. And a man without ‘em -- 
                        even a rich one -- ain’t no man at 
                        all. 
                            (beat)
                        He’s a rat. And I ain’t no rat.

                                 WINSTON
                        Don’t be stupid-

           WHAP! Daryl whips around and STRIKES like a coiled snake, 
           POPPING Winston once in the jaw.

                                 WINSTON
                        Ah, fuck!

           Shackled as he is, Winston can’t even defend himself. He 
           cowers as best he can, bleeding from a split lip.

           IN THE COPILOT’S SEAT

           Madolyn’s eyes blink open - barely - but she remains frozen 
           as she gets her bearings.

           DARYL

           Flexes his fist. Nods at Madolyn.

                                 DARYL
                        She was right: you talk too much.

           He finishes his climb and levels off the plane. He flicks the 
           autopilot back on and unbuckles his seatbelt.

                                 DARYL
                        Okay then...

           He pulls a pair of stashed ZIP-CUFFS from his hidden door 
           panel. 

           Winston starts thrashing about in the back, shouting at 
           Madolyn:

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey! Hey! Wake up! 

                                 DARYL
                        Quiet.

                                 WINSTON
                        Wake-up-wake-up-WAKE-UP-!
           Daryl leans over Madolyn with the zip-cuffs. Grabs her arm - 

           ZZZZZTTTT!!

           Madolyn springs to life. JAMS her taser into Daryl’s neck.

           He jolts. THRASHES about. 

           His hand accidentally switches the AUTOPILOT OFF. His foot 
           hits the rudder pedals, sending the plane into a FLAT TURN.

           The compass on the instrument panel spins as the plane starts 
           to circle.

           But Madolyn holds firm. Daryl’s mouth foams. Gurgles. His 
           face a mix of surprise and fury...

           ...And then his eyes roll back and he passes out ONTO THE 
           YOKE.

           The plane starts to DIVE.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Shit!

           Madolyn yanks him back and grabs her own yoke to keep the 
           plane steady.

           Too much. The plane PITCHES steeply UPWARDS. The STALL 
           WARNING light FLASHES. An alarm BEEPS incessantly. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        God damnit, come on.

           She eases off, awkwardly trying to steer with one hand, while 
           the other keeps Daryl’s limp body off the controls.

           The plane BUMPS and WEAVES unsteadily. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Ah shit...

           She wrestles the controls -- no idea what she’s doing -- and 
           barely manages to keep it steady.

           Finally, she spots the “autopilot” switch. Flicks it. The 
           plane instantly levels out and the ride becomes smoother. 

           Tentatively, she loosens her grip on the yokes and hesitantly 
           pulls her hands away... 

           The plane continues to fly straight. 

           Phew.
           She watches the yokes vibrate back and forth as the plane’s 
           gyroscope makes its own micro-adjustments to keep it steady.

           Madolyn breathes a sigh of relief, and notices an alarm is 
           still BEEPING.

           She finds the flashing “Stall Warning” light. Hits it. The 
           beeping stops. 

           Madolyn pushes sweat-slicked hair off her face. Catches her 
           breath.

           And now, finally with a moment to breathe, a wave of reality 
           washes over Madolyn, as she starts to realize the enormity of 
           her situation. Oh. Fuck...

           Madolyn looks at Winston: stricken and overwhelmed.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Are you okay?

           But Winston’s panicking. Hyperventilating. In-out-in-out-in-
           out...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston!

                                 WINSTON
                        There’s no. Air. In here.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yes there is. You’re fine.

           In-out-in-out-in-out...

                                 WINSTON
                        You gotta- you gotta let me out of 
                        these.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I can’t do that, Winston. You know 
                        that.

                                 WINSTON
                        There’s no air in here!

           In-out-in-out-in-out...

           On Madolyn: Is this a trick?

                                 WINSTON
                        Let me out. Let me out-!
                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey-!

           Whap! Madolyn GRABS Winston and SHOVES him - hard - back into 
           his seat. He snaps out of it. Looks at her.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Are. You. O. Kay?

           He blinks. Shell-shocked. Glasses askew.

                                 WINSTON
                        ...I pissed myself.

           On Madolyn: Great.

           She casts a wary eye on Daryl: unconscious and slumped over 
           in the pilot’s seat.

                                 WINSTON
                        Is he-?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Unconscious. For now.

           She surveys the cockpit. Assessing. Training kicking in.

           Control the situation.

           She slides the ZIP-CUFFS from Daryl’s limp hand and secures 
           one loop around Daryl’s right wrist.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We need to move him into the back 
                        before he wakes up.

                                 WINSTON
                        Fuck that! Shoot him!
                            (off her look)
                        He was going to fly us into the 
                        wilderness and murder us.

                                 MADOLYN
                        No one’s killing anybody. Besides, 
                        we might need him.

           Winston scoffs.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Oh, do you know how to fly a plane?

                                 WINSTON
                        We can’t trust him.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah, no kidding.

           She pauses: Daryl’s left wrist is on the far side of the 
           plane, down below the seat, hidden from view.

           To grab it, Madolyn must reach across him. Crap.

           She checks his face: he sure seems unconscious....

           She raises her taser, just in case. Ready, set...

           She reaches over. Grabs his left wrist... 

           It’s stuck.

           Madolyn glances at Daryl: head lolling to the side.

           She tugs on his arm... and AGAIN.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Come on...

           The arm slips free, and she quickly loops it through the zip-
           cuff. 

           On Daryl: slack-jawed and drooling. Madolyn and Winston 
           breath a sigh of relief.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay...

           She holsters her taser. Grabs Daryl by the collar and 
           pulls... but he barely budges.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Christ.

           She sits back, panting. Not only is Daryl a big guy, but she 
           has no leverage in the cramped cockpit.

           She looks at Winston. At his shackles.

           He smiles.

                                 MADOLYN
                        God damn it.

           EXT. ALASKAN SKIES - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna continues its slow, casual circle through the 
           clouds.
           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           The FUEL GUAGE creeps lower. Unnoticed as --

           -- Madolyn unlocks Winston’s center shackles. His hands and 
           feet are still chained, but he can move around now.

                                 MADOLYN
                        No sudden movements.

           Winston stretches.

                                 WINSTON
                        Me? This isn’t my fault, you know. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Just pull.

           Together, they heave Daryl into the second row.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hold up.

           She takes a second set of ZIP-CUFFS from the door and loops 
           them around Daryl’s feet.

           Winston groans under Daryl’s dead weight.

                                 WINSTON
                        Jesus Christ. Hurry.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Shh. Hang on.

           She pats Daryl down.

                                 WINSTON
                        What? What are you doing?

           Madolyn pulls a KNIFE from Daryl’s hidden ankle sheath. Looks 
           at Winston: see?

                                 WINSTON
                        Yeah, okay, great. Now can we 
                        please move him?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Just a sec.

                                 WINSTON
                        He’s going to wake up!

           She rummages through his pockets. Pulls out a pack of 
           nicotine gum. Tosses it aside.
           She finds his wallet. Checks it: the REAL Daryl Booth’s 
           license... Credit cards...

                                 WINSTON
                        Come on... C’mon-c’mon-c’mon-

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston. I swear, if you don’t 
                        shut... up.

           She falters as she opens a folded SLIP OF PAPER from inside 
           the wallet.

                                 WINSTON
                        ...What?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Nothing.

           She folds up the paper.

                                 WINSTON
                        Fuck you, “nothing.” Show me.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Quiet. Lift him.

                                 WINSTON
                        Not until you show me.
                            (off her look)
                        Show me-show-me-show-me-

                                 MADOLYN
                        Jesus! Here!

           She holds up the paper: PICTURES of them both, complete with 
           details, home addresses, identifying features, etc.

                                 WINSTON
                        That’s my mother’s house...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Forget it. Ready?

           But Winston’s spiraling. 

                                 WINSTON
                        How does he-? No one knows that 
                        address...

           Madolyn snaps her fingers.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey! Winston. Focus. We can’t solve 
                        anything until we get help, and we 
                        can’t get help until we get him in 
                        the back. Okay? 
                            (Winston nods)
                        So one, two...

           They HEAVE Daryl back into the third row. Catch their breath.

           Madolyn hands Winston the pair of shackles she had removed. 
           Winston deflates at the sight of them.

                                 WINSTON
                        Come on...

                                 MADOLYN
                        For him. Cuff his hands to that 
                        handhold there.

           Winston does, flinching, fully expecting Daryl to spring 
           awake at any moment.

           But Daryl’s head just droops to the side, held upright by his 
           arms that are cuffed to the ceiling handhold.

           UP FRONT

           Madolyn climbs over into the pilot’s seat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay...

           She scans the instrument panel: a dizzying array of analogue 
           SWITCHES and DIALS. Shit...

                                 WINSTON
                        Okay, so... what’s the plan?

           Winston catches Madolyn’s eye in the rearview: she’s at a 
           total loss. He sinks back into his seat, spiraling.

                                 WINSTON
                        Oh, god...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Listen-

                                 WINSTON
                        We’re fucked. We’re so fucked-
                                 MADOLYN
                        Listen to me! I’m going to figure 
                        this out, okay? I’m going to get on 
                        the radio, and we’re going to get 
                        help. We’re going to fix this. Then 
                        we’re going to get you to New York 
                        so you can testify. Okay?

           Winston nods: wide-eyed and rattled to the core.

                                 WINSTON
                        Okay... but where are we?

           Off Madolyn...

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Jagged peaks and dense forest as far as the eye can see. 

           The Cessna flies above it. A lonely, tiny dot against an 
           immense and desolate wilderness.

           Shit.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           Madolyn surveys the old analog controls, no clue where to 
           even begin: “Vert. Spd” -- “Cyl Head Temp” -- “Fuel Flow” -- 

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey...

           Madolyn ignores him. -- “Turn Indicator” -- “Fuel Mix” --

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey!

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hang on--

                                 WINSTON
                        You’re bleeding.

           What?

           Madolyn looks down, follows Winston’s nod: BLOOD seeps 
           through the side of her torso.

           She pulls up her shirt to reveal a nasty KNIFE WOUND. 
           Superficial, but bloody nonetheless. Looks like Daryl got her 
           after all...
           She puts pressure on it.

                                 WINSTON
                        First aid kit.

           Madolyn follows his nod: a MED-KIT is strapped to the back of 
           the co-pilot’s seat.

           She reaches for it. Winces. Now that she’s aware of the 
           wound, the pain hits her all at once.

                                 WINSTON
                        I can get it. Unlock me.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Not a chance.

                                 WINSTON
                        Jesus, come on-

           Madolyn reaches again, gritting her teeth through the pain. 
           She pulls the med-kit free.

                                 WINSTON
                        Seriously? What do you think I’m 
                        going to do, attack the pilot?

           Madolyn shoots him a look. Rummages through the med-kit. 
           Pulls out gauze and bandages.

           The plane is JOSTLED by a gust of wind, causing her to drop 
           the supplies.

           Madolyn collects herself and gingerly inspects the wound. 

           Winston grimaces and looks away.

                                 MADOLYN
                            (re: Winston’s reaction)
                        Really?

                                 WINSTON
                        What? I’m not great with blood.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Shocker.

           She winces as she dresses the wound.

                                 WINSTON
                        At least let me ride up front with 
                        you.
                            (no response)
                        I can help.
           She finishes wrapping herself up. Sits back with a sigh.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How did you know about Daryl?

           Winston nods at the paper on the floor.

           UNDERNEATH THE SEAT

           We see Madolyn’s hand reach down and grab the paper, just 
           missing DARYL’S DROPPED KNIFE, which remains out of sight.

           BACK UP IN THE COCKPIT

           Madolyn examines the charter license with the REAL DARYL 
           BOOTH.

                                 WINSTON
                        I’m just trying to keep us alive.

           Madolyn nods. As a “thank you,” she gingerly reaches back and 
           unlocks Winston’s seatbelt (he’s still shackled). Nods at the 
           co-pilot’s seat. Come on up.

                                 MADOLYN
                        If you piss yourself again, I’m 
                        sending you back.

           He awkwardly shimmies himself up into the co-pilot’s seat. 
           Madolyn buckles him in. Places a headset on his head.

           She puts on her own headset. Keys the radio.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Uh, hello? Is anyone receiving me?

           Static. She fiddles with the dials, changing the frequency.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Can anyone hear me? Mayday. Mayday. 
                        Mayday.

           Static. 

                                 WINSTON
                        Someone will be looking for us 
                        though, right? I mean, when we 
                        don’t show up.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We’re showing up.
                                 WINSTON
                        Yeah, of course. But if we don’t... 
                        I mean, they know our route and 
                        all.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m not sure we were on our route.

                                 WINSTON
                        What?

           Madolyn nods at Daryl: still unconscious in the back.

                                 MADOLYN
                        There’s no way he was taking us to 
                        Anchorage.

                                 WINSTON
                        Okay, but there’s got to be like an 
                        emergency beacon or --

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston. The GPS. The radio... He 
                        didn’t want us to be found.

           Winston’s face falls. Madolyn turns back to the radio and 
           scans through more frequencies.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Can anyone hear me? Mayday. Mayday. 
                        Mayday.

           Static.

                                 WINSTON
                        We’re going to crash.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Quiet, no we’re not.
                            (into radio)
                        Anybody. Please. I’m in a plane and 
                        I- I need help.
                            (beat)
                        Help.

           Nothing. She hangs her head.

           Long beat.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                            (static-y)
                        ...ay.. gan..?

           Madolyn JOLTS.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Yes! Hello? I’m here, I’m- can you 
                        hear me?

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                            (clearer)
                        Yeah, I -ead you. Say again?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Help. I need help-

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        This is an aviation frequency.

                                 MADOLYN
                        No, I know. I’m in a plane--

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        You don’t sound like a pilot...

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m not, I-
                            (stay calm)
                        My pilot, he... he’s incapacitated. 
                        Unconscious. I don’t know how to 
                        fly, or where I am.

           A static-filled beat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Hello?

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        Are you shitting me?

           Winston shakes his head.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What? No! No, I’m not shitting you. 
                        Give me some fucking help. Please.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay. Shit. Alright, uh, --rst 
                        things first: you got an auto--lot?

           Autopilot? She checks the switch.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yes. Yes, it’s on.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, that’ll maintain your course 
                        and altitude, so just keep your 
                        hands off them yokes for now.
           Winston nervously looks back at Daryl: still out cold.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        What’s your altitude? Should be a 
                        big gauge, right in front?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Uh, three- three thousand feet.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                            (static-y)
                        Okay, you’re a little low, but 
                        we’re -ot goin- to wor- y about 
                        that yet. What’s your location?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Uh, somewhere between Bethel and 
                        Anchorage? I don’t know, all I see 
                        is clouds.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        What’s the GPS say?

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s broken.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        Say again?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I don’t -- it’s not working. Look, 
                        I think we may have drifted pretty 
                        far off course here.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, well, I can’t be too far away 
                        if I can -ead you. Can you see any  
                        -andma-ks? Mount---s, a river..?

                                 MADOLYN
                        You’re breaking up a little. Say 
                        again?

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        -are prob--ly just barel- in range. 
                        Alright? So I need to find out -ich 
                        way to turn. What landmarks do you 
                        see? Mountains? Rivers? Lakes?

           Madolyn squints: nothing but clouds.

           Winston nods to the left: they can just make out the shadowy 
           forms of a small range of mountains in the distance.
                                 MADOLYN
                        There are mountains to my left -- 
                        uh, west. Mountains to the west.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        A --t of mou-----s?

                                 MADOLYN
                        You’re breaking up again.

                                 PILOT (RADIO/OVER)
                        I-       --nt  -ane--

           Madolyn looks to Winston. He shakes his head, frustrated.

                                 MADOLYN
                        No, I didn’t get that. Hello? 
                            (static)
                        God damn it, c’mon... Hello!?

           Nothing but static.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hello!?

           But the pilot is gone. Madolyn SLAPS the bulkhead.

                                 MADOLYN
                        God DAMN it! 

           She seethes. Glances back at Daryl: still out cold. Winston 
           sinks back into his seat, absorbing the emotional blow.

           Madolyn fiddles with the radio some more.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Can anyone hear me? Mayday. Mayday. 
                        Mayday.

           Static.

                                 WINSTON
                        He’ll at least call it in, right?

           Madolyn nods. Falters. Turns to him.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Wait, what did you say?

                                 WINSTON
                        That other pilot. He’ll at least 
                        call in our situation, right?

           She straightens, inspired.
                                 WINSTON
                        ...What?

           Madolyn smiles. Could it be? She digs out her SAT PHONE. 
           Dials.

                                 WINSTON
                        Out here?

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s a satellite phone. Doesn’t use 
                        cell towers.
                            (it’s ringing)
                        Come on...

                        Madolyn?

                                 MADOLYN
                            (pure relief)
                        Caroline! Oh, thank God. Listen-

                        Surely you’re not in Anchorage 
                        already.

                                 MADOLYN
                        No, I’m still in the air. We’ve 
                        been compromised--

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I can barely hear you.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Compromised! We’ve been 
                        compromised.

           Beat.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I don’t understand. What happened?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I have no idea, I don’t -- the 
                        pilot wasn’t who he said he was. 
                        He’s one of Moretti’s.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Jesus.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I caught him in a lie and he tried 
                        to knife me.
                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Are you hurt?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m fine. He’s unconscious and 
                        restrained in the back.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        And the witness?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston? He’s fine --

                                 WINSTON
                        ...So not true...

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I don’t understand, who’s flying 
                        the plane?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I am!

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        What--?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Listen, Caroline, we don’t know 
                        where we are, okay? We can’t raise 
                        anyone on the radio, and I’m flying 
                        this plane, and I don’t know what 
                        I’m doing-- 

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                            (”Holy shit”)
                        Oookay... Okay, we just need to 
                        stay calm--

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m calm!

           Madolyn hears MURMURING in the background on the other end of 
           the line.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Who else is with you?
                            (beat)
                        Caroline!

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yes! I’m here. So is Trey, 
                        Franklin, Collins... anyone I can 
                        grab. Hang on--
           Madolyn hears Van Sant murmur to people in the background.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        All right, so just to be clear, 
                        you’re flying the plane?

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s on autopilot. We’re just sort 
                        of cruising in a straight line. And 
                        I think he sabotaged our 
                        navigation.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Okay. Okay, here’s the plan: we’re 
                        going to get in touch with ATC and 
                        the military, and get search and 
                        rescue up.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I need someone to help me fly this 
                        thing.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yep, we’ll find a pilot who can 
                        walk you through it, all right? Sit 
                        tight-

                                 MADOLYN
                        Caroline.
                            (beat)
                        How did this happen?

           A strained beat.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        We’ll look into it.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We need to compile a list of anyone 
                        with knowledge of the op and-

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Mads. I’m on it, okay? Sit tight, 
                        I’ll call you back.

           The line disconnects. They fly in silence for a beat.

                                 WINSTON
                        Well?

           Madolyn’s lost in thought.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey!
           She looks at him. On Winston: what’s the plan?

                                 MADOLYN
                        They’re on it. They’re-- they’re 
                        finding us a pilot.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        You all need a pilot?

           IN THE BACK SEAT

           Daryl groans and shakes his head, groggy.

                                 DARYL
                        Goddamn, that taser’s no joke.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Tell me how to fly this thing.

                                 DARYL
                        Mmm... no.

           He spits old blood out of his mouth.

                                 DARYL
                        Fuck, I think I bit my tongue.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Who told you we were moving Winston 
                        today, huh? Where’s the real Daryl 
                        Booth?

                                 DARYL
                        Tell you what: come on back here, 
                        I’ll tell you all about it.

           Click. Madolyn pulls her GUN on Daryl. Daryl smirks.

                                 DARYL
                        Careful now, you’re awful close.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Makes it hard to miss.

                                 DARYL
                        Also makes it more than likely that 
                        the bullet will pass clean through 
                        my body, and into the wall behind 
                        me. 
                            (beat)
                        Where the fuel tank is.

           Madolyn’s eye’s flare, but she keeps the gun steady.
                                 DARYL
                        Now I know you ain’t much for 
                        planes, but surely you know a thing 
                        or two about how bullets work...

           On Madolyn: God damn it. She lowers the gun.

                                 WINSTON
                        He’s lying.

                                 DARYL
                        I’m not. And anyway, twig, are you 
                        willing to bet your life on it?

           Winston glares. Daryl shrugs.

                                 DARYL
                        Yeah. Quite the pickle, ain’t it?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay... I’ll make you a deal: you 
                        tell me how to fly this thing, and 
                        I’ll let you go to prison in peace.

           Daryl sucks his teeth. Shakes his head.

                                 DARYL
                        Eh. Pass. Option B?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’ll put it out there that you 
                        turned on Moretti. And you can go 
                        to prison looking over your 
                        shoulder for the rest of what will 
                        be a very short life.

                                 DARYL
                        Moretti will never believe that.

           On Madolyn: you sure about that? She shrugs.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Maybe not. But rumors are rumors, 
                        and aging mobsters hate to look 
                        like they’re losing control.

           Daryl frowns, mulling it over.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Come on, you really want to die out 
                        here? At least tell me your real 
                        name.

           Daryl doesn’t answer. Madolyn’s SAT PHONE buzzes.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Too late.

           She turns away. Answers the phone.

                                 MADOLYN
                        This is Harris.

           An incongruously bright, SUNNY VOICE crackles through:

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hey there, Deputy Harris. My name’s 
                        Hasan. I’m a pilot and an air 
                        traffic controller here in 
                        Anchorage, and I understand you’re 
                        in a bit of a situation today.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You could say that.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Well, not to worry, we’re going to 
                        get you sorted out. The good news 
                        is that the manifest says you’re in 
                        a Cessna 206, which is pretty easy 
                        to operate.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You don’t say.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yes, ma’am. As aircraft go, it’s 
                        pretty plane and simple.
                            (crickets, clears throat)
                        ...Just a little pilot humor to 
                        keep things light. Okay, first off, 
                        I’m going to need you to read me 
                        some vitals. Let’s start with 
                        airspeed...

           They start going through the instrument panel. Winston casts 
           a fearful glance out the window as --

           IN THE BACK  

           -- Daryl discreetly tests his bindings.

           EXT. ALASKAN SKIES - CONTINUOUS

           The plane soars on.
           INT. CESSNA 206 - MINUTES LATER

           Madolyn grips the yoke.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        ...Okay, so when you’re ready, 
                        you’re just going to ease that yoke 
                        to the right, nice and gentle like.

           Madolyn does. The plane BANKS. Winston steadies himself on 
           the bulkhead, unnerved as the WORLD TILTS.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay. We’re turning.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Stellar. So keep an eye on your 
                        altitude, make sure you’re holding 
                        steady. Now there should be a 
                        compass mounted to the center 
                        bulkhead.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I see it.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        When you hit southwest, just level 
                        out.

           A moment later, the compass turns to SOUTHWEST.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay, leveling...

           The plane evens out.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Stupendous. Now, do me a favor, and 
                        engage that autopilot switch again.

           She does.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Done.

                        And you’re good to go! Keep an eye 
                        out for the coastline. When you hit 
                        it, we’ll bank left and follow it 
                        south towards Anchorage. 

           Madolyn nods, relieved.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Thank you.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        You got it. If you’re wondering, I 
                        accept tips. Preferably tequila.

           Madolyn smiles small in spite of herself.

                                 MADOLYN

                        I’m going to hop off now to save 
                        your battery. But call this number 
                        when you spot the coastline, okay?
                        Good luck.

           The line disconnects.

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - DAY

           The Cessna flies over miles of desolate wilderness.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - LATER

           Daryl discreetly works to loosen the leather HANDHOLD he’s 
           cuffed to. He sings to himself as he casually searches the 
           cockpit.

                                 DARYL
                            (singing)
                        I took off for a weekend last month
                        Just to try and recall the whole
                           year.
                        All of the faces, and all of the 
                           places,
                        Wonderin’ where they all  
                           disapp...eared.

           Daryl double takes: the KNIFE he dropped earlier peeks out 
           from beneath Madolyn’s seat. 

           Its BLADE GLEAMS in a passing sunbeam.

           On Daryl: the hint of a smile. He notices Winston eyeing him 
           warily from the front, and starts singing again. Relaxed as 
           can be.
                                 DARYL
                        I didn’t ponder the question too    
                           long,
                        I was hungry and went out for a
                           bite...

           He continues singing to himself as --

           UP FRONT

           The SAT PHONE is now jerry-rigged to the instrument panel 
           with medical tape for easy viewing, and the aux cord from 
           Daryl’s music player connects the sat phone to the headsets.

           Winston turns away from Daryl, uneasy. He fiddles with the 
           BINOCULARS found in his door panel.

                                 WINSTON
                            (nodding at Daryl)
                        How’d he know about my mother’s 
                        address, huh?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Why don’t you ask him?

                                 WINSTON
                        I’m serious. I was careful. No one 
                        knew that address.
                            (beat)
                        It had to be you guys.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You think Moretti had people in the 
                        Marshals’ office?

                                 WINSTON
                        He has people everywhere. Why do 
                        you think I ran to the end of the 
                        Earth?

           On Madolyn, wondering if he’s right...

           The phone BUZZES: “Van Sant calling...” 

           As she goes to answer:

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey. I mean it. I told that address 
                        to the D.A. when we were talking 
                        about witness protection. That’s 
                        it.
           Madolyn stares at the phone’s screen. BUZZ-BUZZ... BUZZ-
           BUZZ... She answers.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Caroline?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                            (jumping right in)
                        Okay, so we’re coordinating with 
                        the military to get search and 
                        rescue up. Shouldn’t be long now.

           Madolyn hears MURMURING in the background.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                            (to someone in the room 
                              with her)
                        I don’t care, keep trying.
                            (back to Madolyn)
                        I’m told you’re a little small for 
                        radar, particularly with all the 
                        mountains, so I’m trying to get 
                        them to scramble some fighters. Get 
                        some extra eyeballs out there.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay. Well, we’re headed for the 
                        coast, so maybe have them sweep 
                        that first.
                            (no response)
                        Caroline?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yeah. Look, there’s something else: 
                            (beat)
                        Anchorage PD just found Daryl Booth 
                        in his apartment. A single gunshot 
                        wound to the head. 

           Madolyn nods. Not unexpected, but still... a blow. She eyes 
           “Daryl” in the back seat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Someone talked.
                            (beat)
                        Who knew about this op?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I mean -- we had to arrange 
                        transpo, interface with the FAA, 
                        coordinate local law enforcement...
                                 MADOLYN
                        They knew we were moving someone, 
                        but they didn’t know who, right? I 
                        mean, who actually knew about 
                        Winston?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Uh, the D.A.? The Director, 
                        obviously. The A.G., the Deputy 
                        A.G...

                                 MADOLYN
                            (to herself)
                        And you.

           She blinks. Wheels turning.

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl watches Madolyn talk with Van Sant. His eyes drop to 
           the KNIFE, still hidden beneath Madolyn’s chair. 

           He searches for a plan, and spots a jagged line of MOUNTAINS 
           approaching. Bingo.

                                 DARYL
                        Too low.

           Madolyn and Winston ignore him.

                                 DARYL
                            (louder)
                        Hey! You’re low.

           Nothing. He WHISTLES sharply. Madolyn glances at him in the 
           rearview.

           Daryl nods at the mountains up ahead.

                                 DARYL
                        You’re too low to clear those 
                        mountains. You need to pull up.

           UP FRONT

           Madolyn’s still on the phone with Van Sant.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Look, there’s no telling who else 
                        might have unauthorized access to--
                                 MADOLYN
                        I need to call you back.

           She hangs up. Turns to Winston. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        What’d he say?

                                 DARYL
                        You’re too low!

                                 WINSTON
                        He said we’re too low.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah, I got it, I...We’re higher 
                        than those mountains, right?

           On Winston: You’re asking me? Madolyn frowns. The mountains 
           approach.

                                 DARYL
                        Hey! Believe it or not, I am a 
                        pilot, and I’m telling you: you 
                        need to pull up.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Oh, now you want to help?

                                 DARYL
                        Look, you got me: I’d rather not 
                        crash, all right? Pull up.

                                 WINSTON
                        Oh, Christ...

                                 MADOLYN
                        My pilot said we’re fine at six 
                        thousand feet.

                                 DARYL
                        Well he wouldn’t if he could see 
                        that wall of granite coming at you. 
                        Give it some more throttle, and 
                        pull. Up.

                                 WINSTON
                        Maybe we should go higher. 
                            (more urgent)
                        Hey. Go higher.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m calling Hasan.
           The mountains grow closer as --

           IN THE BACK

           -- Daryl starts thrashing about, panicked.

                                 DARYL
                        Hey! There’s no time for that. 
                        You’re too low. You’re-- Pull up. 
                        Pull up! Pull up! Pull up-!

                                 WINSTON
                        Jesus, just do it!

           On Madolyn: fuck it, fine. She pulls back on the yoke.

           The plane climbs, engine whining. And as it does...

           THE KNIFE

           ...Slides back towards Daryl, unnoticed by Madolyn and 
           Winston.

           But it stops after a foot -- caught on the seat in front of 
           him -- not close enough for Daryl to reach.

                                 DARYL
                        Keep going... a little more.

           He kicks the seat in front of him, jostling the knife free.

           The plane climbs higher.

           The knife slides closer.

           The mountains grow nearer... and pass beneath them with 
           HUNDREDS of feet to spare.

           Madolyn levels off. Glances back at Daryl.

           Daryl shrugs.

                                 DARYL
                        Looked low to me.

           Madolyn rolls her eyes. Turns back to the controls as --

           DARYL

           -- Clamps down on the KNIFE with his boot, sliding towards 
           him as he keeps one eye on the cockpit. 
           UP FRONT

           Winston’s face lights up.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey... hey! The coast.

           Madolyn squints. On the horizon: a glittering SILVER LINE 
           sparkles.

                                 WINSTON
                        That’s the coast!

           He beams, excited. Relief spreads across Madolyn’s face. Good 
           news. Finally. She picks up the phone. Dials.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hasan? Yeah. Yeah, we see it...

           As the PACIFIC OCEAN comes into view, she starts banking 
           left, following the coast to the south.

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl tries to raise the knife up by pinching it between his 
           boots, but it’s no use. He’s got no dexterity with his boots, 
           and can’t maneuver in the cramped space.

           He frowns. Shit. 

           Time for a new plan.

           EXT. ALASKAN COASTLINE - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna soars south over the dramatic coastline.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - MINUTES LATER

           In the cockpit, Madolyn is still on the phone with Hasan.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Great, keep me posted.

           She hangs up the phone. Cautiously pleased. Turns to Winston:

                                 MADOLYN
                        They’re narrowing the search 
                        window.

           Winston smiles. Relief creeping in. Daring to hope...
                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        Don’t get too excited.

           Madolyn finds Daryl in the rearview. Can’t help herself:

                                 MADOLYN
                        You should have taken me up on that 
                        offer.

                                 DARYL
                        I ain’t worried.

           Madolyn rolls her eyes.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Spoken like a true killer.

           Daryl shrugs.

                                 DARYL
                        You would know.

           Winston perks up, concerned.

                                 WINSTON
                        What?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Ignore him.

           But she’s a little unnerved too.

                                 WINSTON
                        No, what does that mean?

                                 DARYL
                        It means, twig, that I ain’t the 
                        one you should be worried about.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Ignore him, Winston.
                            (to Daryl, a challenge)
                        He doesn’t know what he’s talking 
                        about.

                                 DARYL
                        I know you killed your last 
                        prisoner.

           Beat.

           Madolyn falters. Thrown.

           Winston sees on her face that it’s true.
                                 WINSTON
                        ...What..?

           Daryl grins.

                                 DARYL
                        Ah, shit. Was that supposed to be a 
                        secret?
                            (beat)
                        Whoops.

           Madolyn seethes for a beat.

           Then -- yep, screw it. -- She unbuckles her seatbelt.

                                 WINSTON
                        Whoa-whoa -- What are you doing?

           Madolyn ignores him, and makes her way back towards Daryl, 
           who is only too happy to see her.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How do you know that?

           Daryl just grins. Shrugs. Coy.

           Whap! Madolyn CLOCKS him in the face.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How do you know that!?

                                 DARYL
                        It’s true, ain’t it?

           He whistles, faux-impressed.

                                 DARYL
                        And now this whole fiasco. Yikes--

           Whap! Madolyn HITS him again. Moving closer each time she 
           does.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How do you know!?

           Daryl winks. Madolyn lays into him as --

           UP FRONT

           -- Winston strains to see what’s happening.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey! Hey, maybe come back up here.
           IN THE BACK

           Madolyn ignores Winston. Steps back, looming over Daryl as he 
           smirks at her through a bloody lip.

                                 DARYL
                        It feels good to let it out, right? 
                        I get it. I’ve been there, too. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about--

                                 DARYL
                        Of course I do. You can tell 
                        yourself you’re different, but 
                        we’re the same, you and me.

           Madolyn seethes.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Forget it.

           She turns back for the cockpit --

                                 DARYL
                        Do you still see her face?

           She hesitates.

                                 DARYL
                        When you close your eyes. Do you 
                        hear her scream-?

           Bam! Madolyn pivots back. Hammering into Daryl. It’s messy. 
           Brutal. Awkward.

                                 WINSTON
                        Whoa-hey-don’t-!

           Too late. Daryl KICKS out her leg and she FALLS onto him. For 
           a moment, they’re wrapped up like boxers, struggling.

           Then Madolyn pulls herself free. Panting.

           She checks to make sure her weapons are still safely 
           holstered: all good.

           Daryl groans. Bruised and bloody.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I hope Moretti does come for you.

           She turns and heads back to the cockpit.
           On Daryl: cowed.

           But as Madolyn moves away, the hint of a SMILE curls at the 
           corner of his bloody mouth.

           His hand uncurls to reveal: MADOLYN’S SUNGLASSES. He had 
           snatched them from atop her head during the beating.

           That had been his plan all along...

           UP IN THE COCKPIT

           Madolyn drops into the pilot’s seat and re-buckles her 
           harness, fuming.

           She winces. Checks her bandage, which has come loose in the 
           fight. 

           Stupid...

           But she’s not the only one upset: Winston glowers at her.

                                 WINSTON
                        What the fuck was that?

           Madolyn ignores him, fixing her bandage.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey! You killed somebody?

           Still nothing. Winston nods at Daryl.

                                 WINSTON
                        Okay, fine. I’ll just ask him-!

                                 MADOLYN
                            (snapping)
                        It wasn’t like that, all right?

           On Winston: Well..?

           Madolyn sighs. Relents.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Two years ago, we caught this young 
                        woman. Maria. She‘d been on the run 
                        for weeks, and the D.A. convinced 
                        her to turn against her former 
                        boyfriend-slash-cartel boss, so we 
                        were holed up in this shitty hotel 
                        until she could testify...

           She falters at the memory. Rubs her neck. Haunted.
                                 MADOLYN
                        We had been in the room for three 
                        straight days, and she just -- she 
                        wanted to take a shower. 
                        Unsupervised. She wanted... a 
                        moment of privacy. Dignity. It was 
                        against protocol, but... I let her.

           Winston listens, rapt, brow furrowed.

                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        So I shackled her to the tub, and 
                        stepped outside.
                            (beat)
                        And a sicario smashed a Molotov 
                        cocktail through the window. I 
                        turned back to find the hallway 
                        filled with heat and smoke and--

           She falters. Blinks back a tear. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        And I ran. But Maria, with the 
                        shackles, she... she couldn’t get 
                        out. And the boyfriend walked.

           On Madolyn: lost in her memory.

                                 WINSTON
                        And they put you on a desk?

                                 MADOLYN
                        They said they didn’t trust me in 
                        the field.

                                 WINSTON
                        Until now. With me.

           Madolyn looks at him: a moment of unspoken understanding.

           Buzz-buzz... Buzz-buzz... 

           The sat phone vibrates: “Van Sant calling...”

           Off Madolyn...

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl carefully pops out a LENS from the sunglasses. 

           Then, placing the lens between his thumbs, he CRACKS it in 
           two.
           Keeping one eye on the cockpit, he starts SAWING at the 
           handhold stitching with the jagged edge of the lens...

           UP FRONT

           Madolyn answers the sat phone.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Caroline?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Good news: the D.A. informed Judge 
                        Falco of the situation, and he’s 
                        agreed to push the trial. Even he 
                        can’t ignore something like this.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah. Great.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        What’s wrong?

           Madolyn trades looks with Winston: how much to say?

                                 MADOLYN
                        The leak isn’t from the D.A.’s 
                        office. Or from the F.B.I. It’s us, 
                        Caroline. It’s the Marshals.

                                 VAN SANT
                        How do you know?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Our pilot friend knows my work 
                        history. My personal work history.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        You’re kidding. How?

           She sounds surprised, but Madolyn isn’t buying it.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Maybe we should bring the Director 
                        in on this.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Absolutely. As soon as we get you 
                        down.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How ‘bout now?
                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Look, the situation is -- fluid -- 
                        at best. We need to get you safely 
                        on the ground, and into the hands 
                        of my team.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Your team.

           She glances over at Winston. Wary.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        You can trust them. I vetted them 
                        myself.

                                 MADOLYN
                        You did, huh?
                            (beat)
                        What does Coleridge think?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        This is my op--

                                 MADOLYN
                        You don’t trust the Director?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hey! I didn’t say that. I’m saying 
                        that if the leak is in our office -- 
                        as you say it is -- then we need to 
                        be careful. We can’t be sure who to 
                        trust.

           On Madolyn: that sinking feeling that her suspicions are 
           being confirmed.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Except you. And your team.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Mads, come on, it’s me. Hell, I’m 
                        the one who fought to get you back 
                        in the field.

           On Madolyn: ever more suspicious.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...That’s right, you did...

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl discreetly SAWS through the handhold’s stitching. Slow 
           and steady, one thread at a time. Unnoticed as -- 
           UP FRONT

           Madolyn spirals on the phone.

                                 MADOLYN
                            (amazed)
                        All this time, I’m thinking you’re 
                        doing me a favor, putting me up for 
                        this op...

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Listen, I get it: you’re under an 
                        enormous amount of stress right 
                        now. But don’t--

                                 MADOLYN
                            (blurting)
                        How much is Moretti paying you?

           Beat.

           Van Sant scoffs.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Jesus. Do you hear yourself? I’m 
                        not the leak, all right? I’m the 
                        only friend you have in this 
                        office!

                                 MADOLYN
                        Well, “friend,” let’s see what 
                        Coleridge has to say about that.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Alright, hang on, let’s just-- 
                        let’s just talk--

           Click. Madolyn HANGS UP on Van Sant, reeling.

                                 WINSTON
                        What’s going on?

           Madolyn shakes her head, unsure. Wheels turning.

           Immediately, the phone BUZZES AGAIN: “Van Sant calling...”

           Madolyn hits “Ignore.” The phone BUZZES again. She hits 
           “Block #.”

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl spots Madolyn glancing back at him. He discreetly palms 
           the sunglass shard and smiles at her.
                                 DARYL
                        How’s it going up there?

           She glances away, in no mood to engage.

                                 DARYL
                        Not great, huh? You want to talk 
                        about it?

           But Madolyn seems determined to ignore him. Good.

           His mission accomplished, Daryl resumes sawing in peace as --

           UP FRONT 

           -- The phone BUZZES again: “Hasan calling...” Madolyn 
           hesitates. Answers.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hello?

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Agent Harris? What, uh, what 
                        exactly is going on? I’ve got 
                        Deputy Van Sant calling, saying--

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’ve got to call you back.

           Click. 

                                 MADOLYN
                            (thinking)
                        Come on... uh...

           She dials a new phone number from memory. It’s ringing...

                                 MADOLYN
                        C’mon-c’mon-c’mon...

                                 RECEPTIONIST (PHONE/OVER)
                        U.S. Marshals’ office.

                                 MADOLYN
                        This is Deputy Harris. I need you 
                        to put me through to the Director.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (PHONE/OVER)
                        I’m sorry, I’m afraid I can’t--

                                 MADOLYN
                        Look, uh... 
                            (trying to remember)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        Janine, right? It’s an emergency. 
                        Tell him it’s Deputy Madolyn Harris 
                        calling, and that it’s an 
                        emergency. He’ll know.

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Director Coleridge isn’t here 
                        today, ma’am. If you’d like, I can 
                        put you through to your Supervisory 
                        Deputy--

                                 MADOLYN
                        No! No, just-- listen to me, 
                        Janine: I need to talk to the 
                        Director. Right now.

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I’m sorry, but--

                                 MADOLYN
                        People will die if you don’t get 
                        him on the line.

                                 WINSTON
                            (quiet)
                        Oh, Christ...

           Beat.

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        ...Let me- uh, let me see what I 
                        can do. --

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- Thank you. --

                                 JANINE
                        -- Uh, please- please hold.

           She puts Madolyn on hold. 

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna soars over the vast wilderness.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           Daryl grits his teeth as he saws through the stitching. 
           Nearly free...

           He freezes as Winston looks back at him, the shard hidden in 
           his palm again.
                                 DARYL
                        Hiiii Winston.
                            (a smile)
                        Talk to your mother lately?

           Winston’s about to reply when:

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey. Ignore him.

           Daryl winks. Winston bites his tongue, fuming, and turns to 
           face forward again.

                                 DARYL
                            (quiet)
                        Yeah, twig. Ignore me.

           On Daryl: a dangerous gleam in his eye.

           UP IN THE COCKPIT

           The grizzly bear dances atop the dashboard.

           Winston scans the horizon with the binoculars.

           There’s a BEEP on the phone: Janine is back. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Janine?

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yes, ma’am. I’ve managed to get a 
                        hold of Director Coleridge. I’m 
                        going to patch you through to his 
                        beach house, okay?

                                 MADOLYN
                            (relieved)
                        Uh- Yes, please. Thank you.

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        One moment.

           A PATERNAL VOICE (50s/60s) crackles through the headset:

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Coleridge here.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Sir, it’s Harris.
                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I’ve been briefed, deputy. Where’s 
                        Van Sant?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Uh, well, sir... there’s a leak.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Say again?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Moretti has a mole in the Marshals’ 
                        office. I can prove it. And I 
                        believe that it’s Caro-- that it’s 
                        deputy Van Sant.
                            (beat)
                        Hello?

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        She went out on a limb for you, 
                        Harris.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I know, sir. I realize that. And 
                        that was no accident, I-
                            (beat)
                        I believe that, given my prior 
                        history, she expected me to fail 
                        again.

           Coleridge thinks it over. Madolyn can feel Winston glance at 
           her, but he quickly turns back to the binoculars.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Where is Van Sant now?

                                 MADOLYN
                        In the New York office. 

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Okay, let me make some calls --

                                 MADOLYN
                        She has a team waiting to meet us. 
                        She needs to be contained and --

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- I understand, deputy. Believe 
                        me, I’ll shut her down. From now 
                        on, call me directly. I’m at my 
                        house in Sankaty.

           Madolyn falters. Sankaty? Where has she heard that before..?
                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Deputy?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I will. Thank you.

           Coleridge hangs up. Madolyn chews her lip, thinking. 
           Something gnawing at her... 

                                 WINSTON
                        Well? We good?

           Madolyn nods, lost in thought. There’s just something she 
           can’t quite... place.

           Wait... 

           Madolyn turns to Winston.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey, the payoff you told Daryl 
                        about -- 

                                 WINSTON
                        You heard that? Look, I was just 
                        bluffing, I don’t--

                                 MADOLYN
                        No, the twenty-five grand a month. 
                        Where’d you say that was going?
                            (Winston hesitates)
                        Where’d you say it was going?

                                 WINSTON
                        ...Sankaty.

           Madolyn sits back. It can’t be...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Are you sure? I thought those 
                        payoffs were offshore. Untraceable.

                                 WINSTON
                        The accounts were, sure. But a few 
                        years back, I’m down in Florida, 
                        and Hurricane Michael hits. So the 
                        payments were a couple days late. 
                        No big deal, except for one greedy - 
                        stupid - bastard who sent a 
                        transfer request from an IP address 
                        in Sankaty, Massachusetts. 

           Madolyn reels, putting the pieces together.
                                 WINSTON
                        Why?

           Madolyn doesn’t answer. Her mind spins.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Holy shit.

           She sits back, stunned. Can’t quite believe it. The hint of 
           an amazed smile creeps across her face...

           ...But it quickly melts into a horrified realization. 

           Oh, fuck.

           Madolyn picks up the sat phone and unblocks Van Sant’s 
           number. Dials.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Come on... c’mon-c’mon-c’mon--

           A moment of ringing, then:

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        For god’s sake, Madolyn, you can’t 
                        just--!

                                 MADOLYN
                        It’s Coleridge. He’s the leak.

           That’s a huge statement, and Van Sant’s quiet for a beat.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I- what?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Get out of the office. Right now.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hang on-- 

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- There’s no time! --

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- You just accused me, I mean, are 
                        you sure?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston handled his payoffs.

           For the moment, any resentment or animosity between them is 
           forgotten in the face of this revelation. 
                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        ...Holy shit...!

                                 MADOLYN
                        You didn’t know?

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        I- I had my suspicions, sure. 
                        Someone in his office, maybe. But 
                        not the director himself. And 
                        certainly nothing I could prove.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Well Winston can.

           Madolyn can practically hear Van Sant’s brain scrambling:

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Okay... Okay, we have to move fast.  
                        I’ll call the D.A. and--

           Madolyn winces, a pang of guilt for this next part:

                                 MADOLYN
                        Caroline. Caroline, listen to me: I- 
                        I called him --

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- What? --

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- I’m sorry, I should have trusted 
                        you. --

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- What did you tell him?

                                 MADOLYN
                        That there’s a leak. That I think 
                        it’s you.

                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Shit-!

                                 MADOLYN
                        He’s coming for you. You have to 
                        leave. Now.

                                 VAN SANT
                        God damn it!

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m sorry.
                                 VAN SANT (PHONE/OVER)
                        Okay, just -- focus on landing 
                        safely, all right? We need Winston 
                        alive to testify. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Caroline-

                                 VAN SANT
                        I know, I’m headed out as we speak. 
                        It’s going to be fine, Mads. I’ll 
                        call you from the D.A.’s office.

           She hangs up. Madolyn reels. Takes a calming breath, trying 
           to reassure herself as --

           IN THE BACK

           -- Daryl saws through the leather handhold. Only a few 
           threads to go...

           UP FRONT

           Winston scans the horizon through the binoculars. His eyes 
           narrow, spying something...

                                 WINSTON
                        ...Hey...  
                            (beat)
                        ...Hey..!

           Madolyn’s lost in thought.

                                 WINSTON
                        Deputy Harris!

           Madolyn jolts.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What Winston?

                                 WINSTON
                        You see that? What is that?

           He squints: up ahead, a SHAPE breaks up the shoreline with 
           clean lines and angles. Clearly man-made. Madolyn’s eyes go 
           wide.

           They fly closer: it’s a SHIPWRECK. The rusted-out hull of a 
           large, commercial fishing vessel.
                          WINSTON
                                                         MADOLYN
                 (excited)
                                              -- Yeah, yeah I see it.
           ...Oh, shit! That’s--

           Madolyn dials. A moment later...

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Deputy Harris? What is going on? 
                        Deputy Van Sant keeps--

                                 MADOLYN
                        We see a shipwreck. On the coast. 
                        Looks like maybe a fishing boat? 
                        We’re about to pass right by it.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                            (pivoting)
                        Okay! Okay, great. We can work with 
                        that. Uh, can you see a name on it?

                                 MADOLYN
                        We’re too high.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        If you want to descend, keep your 
                        tilt at five percent or less, and 
                        make sure you stay above a thousand 
                        feet, okay?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Uh, yeah. Copy.

           She initiates the drop. The plane glides lower. Winston 
           cranes his neck, peering through the binoculars.

           The shipwreck is coming up pretty fast...

                                 MADOLYN
                        You see anything?

           The plane BUMPS and RATTLES as it cuts through the coastal 
           wind. 

                                 MADOLYN
                            (urgent)
                        Winston.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hold it steady!

           Winston squints through the binoculars. They’re passing it 
           by...
                                 WINSTON
                            (to himself)
                        C’mon-c’mon-c’mon...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston, we need the name.
                            (beat)
                        Winston!

                                 WINSTON
                        Yeah! Yeah, it’s, uh- “Dancer...”
                            (beat)
                        The Fair Dancer!

                                 MADOLYN
                        “The Fair Dancer.” You’re sure?

           Winston nods as -- VROOM! -- they speed past the wreck.

                                 MADOLYN
                            (to Hasan, frantic)
                        The Fair Dancer. It’s called The 
                        Fair Dancer.

           On the call, Madolyn can hear muffled voices in the 
           background.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        The Fair Dancer, got it. We’re 
                        running it past the Coast Guard 
                        now.

           Madolyn and Winston look at each other: relieved, and for the 
           first time, hopeful.

           As they wait for confirmation:

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        So that was just plane exciting, 
                        huh?
                            (crickets)
                        No? Did that one fly over your 
                        head? 
                            (serious)
                        Not the time. Got it. Stand by.

           IN THE BACK  

           Daryl works the leather strap loose. Just a few more threads 
           to go...
           UP IN THE COCKPIT

           Madolyn climbs back to 5000 feet and levels off as Hasan’s 
           voice crackles through the headsets:

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        You guys still with me?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah. Yeah, we’re here.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        So great news: the Coast Guard ID’d 
                        the wreck. We’ve got a pretty good 
                        fix on your location. 

                                 MADOLYN
                            (a smile)
                        Yeah?

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        If you’d be so kind as to turn left 
                        to heading one-one-zero. That 
                        should put you into Anchorage in 
                        thirty-five, forty minutes.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Copy. Turning to one-one-zero.

           The plane banks. 

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Stellar. Hold that bearing. I’ll 
                        call back in ten minutes or so, and 
                        we can talk landings.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Sounds good. Thank you.

           Hasan hangs up. Madolyn and Winston trade looks: a glimmer of 
           hope. Winston cracks a tentative smile.

                                 WINSTON
                        ...We’re going to get out of 
                        this...

           Madolyn nods. The hint of a smile.

                                 WINSTON
                        We’re going to get out of this!

           Winston laughs. A small, feeble release of tension--

           Whoosh.
           There’s a flash of movement, and Winston GASPS.

           Madolyn looks over: the missing KNIFE is BURIED in Winston’s 
           GUT. Before she can react --

           WHAM!

           -- Daryl’s behind her seat, his arms crossed around her 
           windpipe, STRANGLING HER.

           Winston cries out -- first in shock, then in pain.

           Madolyn chokes. Coughs. Struggles. Her arm FLAILS wildly and 
           sends the SAT PHONE flying.

           But Daryl holds firm, arms straining. Madolyn goes for the 
           yoke --

                                 DARYL
                        No.

           He YANKS her away. Redoubles his grip.

           Madolyn’s veins pop. Her eyes roll.

                                 DARYL
                        God damn it, c’mon...

           The plane bumps and jostles. The engine whines. 

           Madolyn turns purple, fading.

           The seconds tick away. This is it... 

           Daryl leans in close.

                                 DARYL
                        Hey, you want to know my real name?

           Madolyn’s eyes roll as --

           WINSTON

           -- Grits his teeth. Grips the knife in his belly and pulls it 
           free with a SCREAM.

           He awkwardly SLASHES at Daryl’s arm.

                                 DARYL
                        Ah, fuck!

           Daryl flinches. Recoils. Releases Madolyn.
           She falls forward, GASPING and choking as --

           -- Daryl SLUGS Winston. And AGAIN.

           MADOLYN

           Draws her pistol, but Daryl KNOCKS her arm aside --

           BAM!

           -- The gun FIRES right by his ear. The shot is wide, punching 
           through the seat.

           Daryl SCREAMS, but the only sound we hear is an INTENSE 
           RINGING as --

           -- BLOOD POURS from Daryl’s ruptured eardrum.

           The ringing continues as Madolyn and Daryl WRESTLE over the 
           gun. Clawing at each other. Vicious. Desperate. Messy.

           The gun FIRES again - silently, this time - its muzzle flash 
           blinding.

           The bullet punches clean through a rear window. Wide again.

           UP FRONT

           Winston moans. Grips his head like it might explode as --

           MADOLYN

           -- Finally manages to wrestle the gun away, holding Daryl at 
           gunpoint. He hesitates, sizing her up. Is she really going to 
           shoot him?

                                 MADOLYN
                            (sounding very far away)
                        Don’t do it.

           Too late. Daryl LUNGES as --

           BAM!

           -- Madolyn adjusts her aim and SHOOTS DARYL in the shoulder.

           The force of the bullet SPINS him around and KNOCKS him back 
           behind the seats.

           He staggers to his knees in shock. Stumbles forward, eyes 
           blazing --
           And then he wobbles. Coughs. Surprised. Blood SPURTS from his 
           shoulder, and his blood pressure plummets.

           He rocks once... his eyes roll... then he collapses back 
           behind the seats and doesn’t move.

           And all at once, sound comes CRASHING back.

           Beat.

           ON MADOLYN

           Blood splattered. Ears ringing. The smoking gun in her 
           trembling hand.

           She coughs, utterly rattled.

           She eyes Daryl: He’s not moving. Blood runs down his sleeve 
           and drips from his fingertips.

           Finally, Madolyn forces herself to turn away. She flies to 
           the controls, scanning: altitude... airspeed... autopilot... 
           everything’s holding steady. Phew.

                                 WINSTON (O.S.)
                        ...Oh, god... oh, shit-shit-shit...

                                 MADOLYN
                            (hoarse)
                        Winston!

           She turns to him, assessing: his bloodstained hands are 
           clamped over his gut. BLOOD courses through his fingers and 
           runs down his shackles.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Shit.

           He wheezes. Wounded chest heaving. Panicked. A FRESH CUT 
           above his eye bleeds.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay, okay, let me see.

           Winston holds firm. Eyes clamped shut in pain.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston, you have to let me see.

           She gently pries open his hands and peeks underneath: BLOOD 
           PUMPS from a clean STAB WOUND in his abdomen.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Oooookay. It’s fine.

           (It’s not.)

                                 MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to be fine. Just keep 
                        pressure on it.

                                 WINSTON
                        Don’t- don’t do that. It’s not 
                        fine.

                                 MADOLYN
                        It is! It--

           She rifles through the med-kit.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Where the hell is the gauze..?

                                 WINSTON
                        It’s not fine. It’s- AH!

           He winces, recoiling as Madolyn slaps a LARGE BANDAGE on the 
           wound and tears off tape.

                                 WINSTON
                        Oh, god, I don’t-- I feel sick --

                                 MADOLYN
                            (overlapping)
                        -- You’re okay. --

                                 WINSTON
                        -- I’m gonna throw up. --

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- No you’re not. Breathe. --

                                 WINSTON
                        -- I can’t, I- I- Ah! It fucking 
                        hurts!

                                 MADOLYN
                        I know. I know. Hang in there.

                                 WINSTON
                        Give me the morphine. I saw 
                        morphine in the first aid kit. I 
                        want it.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I can’t, I’m sorry.
                                 WINSTON
                        Come on, please!

                                 MADOLYN
                        You’ve lost a lot of blood. I can’t 
                        risk slowing your heart rate--

           Winston YELLS in agony.

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- I’m sorry.

                                 WINSTON
                        Am I dying--?

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- No --

                                 WINSTON
                        -- Don’t- don’t lie to me.
                            (a flash of pain)
                        Ah! Oh, god--

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey!

           She grabs him. Forces his attention.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Listen to me: you are not dying. I 
                        will get you out of this. Okay? But 
                        you’ve got to breathe. Just --
                            (deep breath)
                        -- breathe.

           Winston does. And again. Slowly calming down.

           After a beat:

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay?

           Winston nods, focused on his breathing.

           Madolyn gently dabs at the cut above his eye with some gauze.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Thank you, by the way.

           She picks up Daryl’s bloodied knife and tucks it safely away 
           in her door pocket.
                                 MADOLYN
                            (off his look)
                        You saved me.

           Winston closes his eyes and nods through the pain.

                                 WINSTON
                        I did tell you to shoot him when 
                        you had the chance.

           Madolyn frowns. Glances at Daryl: crumpled on the floor. She 
           grabs the knife...

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           The plane soars over the wilderness.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl lies on the floor... HOGTIED with seatbelt Madolyn has 
           cut loose. His gunshot wound roughly patched.

           His head lolls to the side, unconscious. Madolyn surveys him, 
           gingerly rubbing her bruised throat.

           She picks up the fallen SAT PHONE. It’s off: the battery 
           popped out when it fell. She tapes it back together.

           A quick glance back at Daryl: he hasn’t moved.

           The phone powers up again and -- BUZZ-BUZZ -- immediately 
           starts RINGING: “Hasan calling...”

           She answers.

                                 MADOLYN
                        H- hello?

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        There you are. Hey, do me a favor 
                        and don’t let it ring so long next 
                        time, all right? You gave us all 
                        quite a scare down here.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston, uh -- Winston’s been 
                        stabbed.

           Beat.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Say again?
                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston. He- Booth -- or whatever 
                        his name is -- I don’t know, he got 
                        free and stabbed him and I --
                            (realizing)
                        I shot him.
                            (beat)
                        Hello?

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yeah. Uh, copy. Stand by.

           The line goes quiet. Madolyn looks at her bloodstained hands: 
           they’re trembling. She wipes them on her shirt and grips the 
           yoke to steady them.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Deputy? Still there?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yes! Yes, I’m here--

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        I couldn’t reach deputy Van Sant. 
                        Uh, what’s the status of the 
                        witness?

           Madolyn looks over at Winston: torn between keeping his hopes 
           up and being honest.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Dire.

           Madolyn can hear murmured discussion in the background.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        And the pilot?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Restrained. And bleeding out. 

           Silence on the line.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Listen, I’ve patched what I could 
                        but we’re going to need some real 
                        medical attention here.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Copy. Tarmac EMS is on standby.

                                 MADOLYN
                        How far away are we?
                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Maybe twenty-five minutes.

           Madolyn looks over at Winston: eyes screwed shut in pain, and 
           looking pretty pale...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Is there anything faster?
                            (Hasan hesitates)
                        Hasan.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Technically, we can increase your 
                        speed --

                                 MADOLYN
                        -- Great. --

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        -- But it’ll burn through the rest 
                        of your fuel.

           Shit. Madolyn glances at Winston. Nods.

                                 MADOLYN
                        We have no choice.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Deputy...

                                 MADOLYN
                        If Winston 
                            (”dies”)
                        ...doesn’t testify, Moretti walks. 
                        Coleridge walks.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Understand: landing will be more 
                        difficult-

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m not losing him, all right? 

           Beat.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Push the throttle all the way in, 
                        and then open up the red handle 
                        marked “fuel mix.”

                                 MADOLYN
                        Thank you.
           Madolyn opens the throttle. The engine REVS. She wipes 
           smeared blood from the speedometer, and watches the needle 
           climb.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay... approaching one-sixty.

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                        Keep an eye on that fuel. I’ll call 
                        you back in a few minutes with the 
                        landing procedure.

           He hangs up. Madolyn looks to Winston: breathing through the 
           pain.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hang on, Winston. Not long now.

           They speed up as -- 

           IN THE BACK

           -- Daryl lies in a pool of blood. His EYE TWITCHES...

           He COUGHS. Gurgles. 

           But more speed means a louder engine drone, and Madolyn and 
           Winston can’t hear him. 

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

           The plane speeds along as --

           UP IN THE COCKPIT

           Madolyn tries calling Van Sant... voicemail.

           She hangs up. Looks over at Winston: pale and drenched in a 
           cold sweat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston? How you doing?

           But Winston is barely listening. His face changes: a moment 
           of clarity.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston?

                                 WINSTON
                        ...I don’t want to die.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Whoa, hey -- You’re not. You’re 
                        going to be fine, okay? Here --

           She digs out a KEY and UNLOCKS Winston’s shackles.

                                 WINSTON
                            (a weak smile)
                        Uh oh... You’re in trouble now.

           A feeble chuckle. Madolyn smiles. Winston’s laugh sputters 
           into a COUGH.

           The cough grows more forceful, then... he coughs up BLOOD. 
           Splattering his shirt and the instrument panel.

           It’s dark blood. Almost black. Yikes.

           They both stare at it, sobered.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hang in there.

           She turns back to the controls, rattled. Winston touches the 
           DARK BLOOD. Examines it on his fingertips.

                                 WINSTON
                        ...I’m sorry.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 WINSTON
                        No, this...
                            (clears throat)
                        This is my fault.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 WINSTON
                        We wouldn’t be here if -- I 
                        could’ve done anything, you know? 
                        Could’ve finished college. Found a 
                        good job... But...
                            (beat)
                        I wanted that easy money.

           He rubs his wrists.

                                 WINSTON
                        I’d hear - things - about Moretti 
                        and think “that’s not my fault?” 
                        You know? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 WINSTON (CONT'D)
                                 WINSTON (CONT'D)
                        “I just push numbers around a 
                        screen.” But then... here we are, 
                        and --

           He meets Madolyn’s eye.

                                 WINSTON
                        I’m sorry.

           Madolyn nods. Solemn. Winston stifles another cough. Focused 
           now.

                                 WINSTON
                        You still have that paper, right? 
                        The one with our pictures on it?
                            (Madolyn nods)
                        That’s my mother’s address.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I know. Listen, don’t worry--

                                 WINSTON
                        Will you go see her?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Me?

                                 WINSTON
                        If I don’t-- you know... 
                            (clears throat)
                        Tell her. Tell her that I did good 
                        for once. That I- that I did the 
                        right thing.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey, c’mon...

                                 WINSTON
                        Please?

           Beat. Madolyn nods.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’ll tell her, Winston.

           Winston smiles, comforted. Turns and looks out his window at 
           the thick clouds passing by. Ghostly.

                                 WINSTON
                            (quiet)
                        I did the right thing.

           Madolyn watches him for a beat. She picks up the sat phone 
           and dials Van Sant.
           ...It immediately goes to VOICEMAIL. Again? 

           Madolyn frowns. Dials a new number. After a beat:

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                            (shaken)
                        U- U.S. Marshals.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Janine. It’s Madolyn again. Listen, 
                        I’m trying to reach Caroline Van 
                        Sant...

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Oh. Uh...

                                 MADOLYN
                        Janine?

                                 JANINE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Yes. One- one moment.

           Beat. A familiar PATERNAL VOICE crackles through:

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Harris?

           Madolyn’s blood goes cold.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Director Coleridge?

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I’ll take it from here, Janine, 
                        thanks.

           There’s a click as Janine jumps off the call. 

           Madolyn spins: what is happening..? Colridge sighs.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I’m afraid it looks like you were 
                        right about deputy Van Sant.

           On Madolyn: sinking into a pool of dread. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        No. I- What-? What do you mean?

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        There was a car crash. She was t-
                        boned leaving the office. 

           Madolyn hangs her head. Squeezes back a tear. 
                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        The other driver fled. One of 
                        Moretti’s, I’m guessing. I’m headed 
                        there now.

           Madolyn bites her knuckles to keep from screaming. Winston 
           sags, reading her face.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Deputy?

           Madolyn’s guilt and grief turn to a cold rage. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...How?

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        They must have been waiting--

                                 MADOLYN
                        No. How could you know all this 
                        already?

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        I not sure what you’re--

                                 MADOLYN
                        I know it was you.

           Beat.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Excuse me?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I can prove it. Twenty-five grand a 
                        month, right? 

           Silence on the line.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Check your records: you got sloppy.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Oh, you want to compare records, 
                        deputy Harris? No one is going to 
                        believe--

                                 MADOLYN
                        A jury will.

           Beat.

           The phone beeps: “Hasan calling...”
                                 MADOLYN
                        My pilot’s calling.

                                 DIRECTOR COLERIDGE (PHONE/OVER)
                        Hang on-

                                 MADOLYN
                        Don’t worry, sir. I’ll see you in 
                        New York.

           Click. Madolyn switches lines. All fury-fueled determination.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hasan?

                                 HASAN (PHONE/OVER)
                            (impossibly bright)
                        Guess who we’ve got on radar..!
                            (beat)
                        You’re eleven miles out and looking 
                        good, Deputy. Hey do me a favor: 
                        hang up, and tune your radio to 
                        frequency one-two-one dot five-zero-
                        zero... 

           Madolyn does. Hasan’s voice echoes through the radio:

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Handsome, confident, ATC 
                        controller, looking for intrepid 
                        pilot. Over.

           Madolyn keys the radio.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m no pilot.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Are you sure? You’re great at 
                        winging it.
                            (more serious)
                        Alright, Deputy. You’re ten miles 
                        out. Ready to bring it in?

           Madolyn shifts in her seat. Focused.

           IN THE BACK

           Daryl’s eyes blink open. Roll about. Disoriented.

           He takes in his bleeding shoulder. Lets out an anguished 
           YELL.
                                 DARYL
                            (seething)
                        Why didn’t you kill me?

           Madolyn glances at him in the rearview. Looks away.

                                 DARYL
                        Hey! Why didn’t you kill me?

                                 MADOLYN
                        Because I’m not like you.

           On Daryl: enraged. He struggles against his bindings...

           EXT. ALASKAN SKIES - CONTINUOUS

           The Cessna is enveloped in thick clouds.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Descend to two thousand feet. Keep 
                        your angle of attack at five 
                        percent.

           The plane starts to DESCEND, passing through the clouds.

           INT. CESSNA 206 - CONTINUOUS

           The grizzly bear dances and sways.

           UP IN THE COCKPIT

           The outskirts of ANCHORAGE appear through the clouds.

           A few miles up ahead: Madolyn can see the bright, rectangular 
           lights of the RUNWAY.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hey, I see it... I- ha! I can see 
                        the runway.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Solid copy, we’ve got visual on our 
                        end. Glide path looks good.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Passing fifteen-hundred feet. 
                        Airspeed’s at... seventy knots.

           Static.
                                 MADOLYN
                        Hasan?

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                            (concerned, distracted)
                        Uh, yeah, I’m here. Listen, Deputy, 
                        there’s a bit of crosswind that has 
                        kicked up below a thousand feet. I 
                        recommend we try a couple of 
                        practice runs.

           Madolyn glances over at Winston: his head slumps against his 
           chest.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston?

           She presses her fingers to his neck. Keys her radio.

                                 MADOLYN
                        There’s no time, I can barely feel 
                        a pulse.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Still, I really think--

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hasan. We have to land now.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Do you think he’s going to make it?

           Madolyn’s thrown. Doesn’t answer.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        What I’m saying is: your chances of 
                        a successful landing dramatically 
                        improve with some practice runs. 
                        Particularly with this crosswind. 
                        And if you think he’s not going to 
                        make it anyway... 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Hasan.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        I’m just trying to save the ones we 
                        can.
                            (beat)
                        But you’re the pilot in command. 
                        It’s your call.

           Madolyn considers Winston: weak and pale. She looks at the 
           grizzly bear - dancing away in its hula skirt.
           On Madolyn: resolved.

                                 MADOLYN
                        He’s going to make it. I’m landing 
                        now.

           Beat.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, you are cleared to land. Line 
                        up your nose with a spot on the 
                        near edge of the runway, and cut 
                        your throttle back to fifty 
                        percent.

                                 MADOLYN
                        ...Throttle to fifty...

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Altitude?

                                 MADOLYN
                        One thousand feet.

           Up ahead: the runway grows closer.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Flaps to full.

           Madolyn flicks the Flaps switch.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Flaps... to full.

           She turns to Winston, slumped in his seat.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston? Hey, can you hear me? Hang 
                        on, okay? We’re almost there.
                            (to herself)
                        Almost there.

           WHAM! Daryl -- still tied -- heaves himself upright. Eyes 
           rolling. Half-crazed. He HURLS himself at the cockpit.

           Madolyn SHOUTS. Flinches as --

           -- Daryl LUNGES, straining to shake his bindings in the last 
           desperate attempt to prevent the landing.

                                 DARYL
                        I ain’t. Going. To no. Prison.

           The plane rocks. Weaves.
                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, even out, you’re drifting.

           Madolyn ignores Hasan. Struggling to fend off Daryl. 

           CLOSE ON the altimeter: 800 feet...

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Deputy, you copy? You need to even 
                        out.

           She punches Daryl. Once. Twice. Throws him off and goes for 
           her gun.

           On Daryl: panting. Bleeding. Staring down the barrel of her 
           gun.

                                 DARYL
                        Do it. 
                            (beat)
                        Do it-!

           But Madolyn won’t pull the trigger. She shakes her head.

           Daryl LUNGES --

           Whap! Madolyn CLOCKS him in the face with the butt of the 
           gun.

           Daryl collapses back. Nose broken, groaning. Exhausted.

           Click. Madolyn looks over: Winston weakly offers up the 
           handcuffs he had been wearing.

                                 WINSTON
                        Send Mister Moretti my regards.

           Madolyn snaps the cuffs on Daryl. Securing him to handhold. 

                                 DARYL
                        ...Please...

                                 MADOLYN
                        We’re landing. You should brace 
                        yourself.

           She turns back to the controls.

           600 feet...

           Up ahead: the RUNWAY stretches out before her. 

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Deputy Harris! Still up?
                                 MADOLYN
                        Yes! Yes, I’m here. I--

           Thwump! A GUST of wind knocks the plane left.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Engage the pedals. Right rudder.
                            (beat)
                        Right rudder.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I am--

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        You need to turn into the wind.

                                 MADOLYN
                        I am!

           The plane’s ROCKED by another gust.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, better... hold that line. 
                        Five hundred feet.

           The runway drifts closer.

           Madolyn’s sweat-and-blood-slicked hand SLIPS on the yoke. She 
           re-doubles her grip.

           CLOSE ON the altimeter: 400 feet... 350... 

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, now cut the throttle and kill 
                        the engine.

                                 MADOLYN
                        What?

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        We need to minimize the risk of 
                        fire upon landing.

                                 MADOLYN
                        But-

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Right now. Or we’re going to have 
                        to wave off and do it again.
                            (beat)
                        Deputy-

           Madolyn YANKS the fuel knob. The engine CHOKES. Sputters... 
           and dies.
           It’s suddenly quiet and peaceful, with only a slight 
           whistling of wind.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Pull up on the yoke slightly.

           Madolyn does. They’re gliding forward. The runway rushes up 
           to meet them.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        One hundred feet... seventy-five...

           The Hula Grizzly sways away on the dash.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        Okay, last thing: you need to kill 
                        the master switch. It’s the big red 
                        one to the left of the yoke. But 
                        when you do, you’ll lose radio. You 
                        got this, okay? Good luck. 

                                 MADOLYN
                        Wait, that’s it? No more jokes?

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        I felt like they weren’t landing.

           Madolyn smiles.

                                 HASAN (RADIO/OVER)
                        I’ll see you on the ground.

           She kills the MASTER SWITCH. 

           Shunk. All electrical systems, lights, and gauges shut off. 
           Only the altimeter and airspeed still work.

           Truly alone now.

           The wind whistles by.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Okay, Winston, ready?

           She reaches over and checks Winston’s seatbelt.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Twenty feet... Ten...

           On Madolyn: locked in. Blood and sweat dripping off her brow.

                                 MADOLYN
                            (a whisper)
                        ...Touchdown.
           BAM!

           The plane is ROCKED as it touches down.

           It BOUNCES once...

           LANDS HARD. 

           Papers, charts, headsets go flying. Daryl flails in the 
           backseat.

           Madolyn and Winston are JOLTED. Safety glass cracks.

           Rubber tires SCREECH against the asphalt as the plane careens 
           down the runway.

           CRACK. A wheel BREAKS OFF. SPARKS FLY.

           Madolyn braces herself as --

           -- A WINGTIP catches the ground and CRACKS OFF. The plane 
           skids across the runway.

           Madolyn grits her teeth. Hanging on for dear life.

           And then it’s over. The plane skids to a stop. Enveloped in a 
           cloud of SMOKE and DUST.

           And for a moment, everything’s quiet.

           Madolyn blinks. Looks around as the dust settles. Is this 
           real? 

           SIRENS sound in the distance.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Winston..? Winston!

           Winston grunts. Nods. The smallest signs of life.

                                 WINSTON
                        ...You promised we wouldn’t 
                        crash...

           Madolyn smiles.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Yeah? Well... for a kite with 
                        seatbelts, that wasn’t too bad.

           She unstraps her seatbelt, utterly exhausted.

           Behind her, Daryl groans, beaten.
           The sirens grow louder and louder as emergency vehicles race 
           towards them. Off-screen, but we can hear them closing in.

           A moment later, the RED and YELLOW EMERGENCY LIGHTS grow 
           brighter, flashing off their faces and lighting up the cabin.

           The doors are wrenched open. Sunlight and fresh air flood in. 

           It’s suddenly a FLURRY of activity as OFF-SCREEN RESCUE 
           WORKERS descend upon the wreck.

                                 RESCUE WORKER 1 (O.S.)
                        Ma’am? Ma’am! Are you hurt?

                                 RESCUE WORKER 2 (O.S.)
                        Can you move?

                                 MADOLYN
                        I’m fine, I’m--
                            (realizing)
                        I’m okay.

           Madolyn points to Winston.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Take him first.

           ARMS clad in a fireman’s yellow sleeves reach in and cut 
           Winston loose.

                                 MADOLYN
                        Careful. He’s got a stab wound in 
                        the abdomen, and he’s lost a lot of 
                        blood-

           The EMS workers carefully pull Winston from the wreck. He 
           waves feebly to her as he disappears out the plane door.

           In the back: ROUGH HANDS drag a despondent Daryl from the 
           plane. Madolyn pays him no attention.

           On Madolyn: alone now, reality sinking in as she finally lets 
           her guard down -- Grief. Stress. Relief. Adrenaline. Elation 
           at simply being alive. -- all washing over her in a WAVE of 
           emotion.

                                 FIREFIGHTER (O.S.)
                        Ma’am?

           Madolyn blinks. Notices a firefighter’s outstretched HAND.

           She nods, still processing.
           She takes a final look about the cabin: blood-splattered and 
           broken.

           In the foreground, the HULA GRIZZLY finally comes to a stop. 

           Madolyn gives it a push, restarting its dance, and climbs out 
           into the world.

           As the grizzly dances...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                     The end.
