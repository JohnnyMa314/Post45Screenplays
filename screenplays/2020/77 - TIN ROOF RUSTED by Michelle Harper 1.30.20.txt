           SUPER: For all the Nikki and Kates.

           FADE IN:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Chaos unfolds as CHILDREN enjoy an indoor recess. 

           NIKKI (5, blonde) picks up a doll. She holds it maybe two 
           seconds before it’s ripped away by JESSICA (5, brat).

                                 JESSICA
                        Hey! I was playing with that!

           Nikki moves on, goes for a Lego bin. Reaches down to grab 
           a few, stands, and is greeted much too closely by TREVOR 
           (5, glasses, frog-faced), who also holds Legos.

           Trevor blankly stares at her, mouth agape. Slowly 
           blinking. Snot runs down his nose. He does the impossible 
           and sneezes with his eyes open. Legos aren’t worth this. 

           Nikki sits at a dollhouse and plays by herself. KATE (5, 
           brunette) meekly walks up.

                                 KATE
                        Could I play with you?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yeah...

                                 KATE
                                 (grabs doll)
                        I’m Kate.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m Nikki.

           They smile. HOLD ON their bright, beaming little faces...

           INT. SMALL BEDROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

           A sweaty ADULT NIKKI (28) gyrates. REVEAL she’s getting 
           railed from behind by DANNY (late 30s, lovable slacker, 
           Chris Pratt before he got ripped).

                                 DANNY
                        Ohhh Nikki--
                                 NIKKI
                        Pull my hair.

           Danny moves his hands, but it’s unclear where to--

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Ow! No, the hair on my head.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (6) writes a note with her finest gel pen. Smoothly 
           passes it to Trevor (6), who passes it to Kate (6). She 
           opens it: “Trevor has a booger falling out of his nose!” 
           Kate looks at Trevor. He sure does.

           INT. LUXURIOUS MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

           An absolutely radiant ADULT KATE (28) lies in bed while 
           her husband MIKE (30s) softly kisses her.

                                 KATE
                        I love you so much.

                                 MIKE
                        I love you too, Kate.

           INT. NIKKI’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (7) and Kate (7) play “house.” Nikki puts a baby 
           doll under her shirt, pretends to breastfeed.

                                 KATE
                        Ew! What are you doing?!

                                 NIKKI
                        This is how they do it!

                                 KATE
                        That’s gross.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

           Nikki, exhausted, guzzles down water. Danny comes out of 
           the bathroom, exhausted for a different reason.

                                 DANNY
                        Whew!--

                                 NIKKI
                        --That was pretty intense!--
                                 DANNY
                        --I just took the fattest shit!

           INT. NIKKI’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (8) and Kate (8) choreograph a routine to Britney 
           Spears’ “OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN.” 

           Kate shyly dances. Nikki thrusts and whips around like a 
           stripper behind on rent.

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

           Kate and Mike cuddle in bed.

                                 MIKE
                        Can I get you anything? Do you 
                        need water? Is there a certain 
                        position you should be lying in?

                                 KATE
                        Mike, I’m fine. Just relax, it’ll 
                        happen when it’s supposed to.

           INT. KATE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (9) and Kate (9) examine a book called YOUR 
           CHANGING BODY. They see a diagram of a grown woman. Nikki 
           points to the pubes and laughs. Kate winces.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           Nikki wakes up to Danny’s phone alarm playing “SMELL YO DICK.”

                                 RISKAY (ON PHONE)
                        Why you coming home / five in the 
                        morn’ / Something’s going on / can 
                        I smell yo dick?

                                 NIKKI
                        Danny. 

           Nikki nudges him. No movement. She rips the covers off, 
           exposing his bare ass. Still nothing. She rolls him over, 
           pushing him off the bed. He hits the floor with a THUD.

                                 DANNY
                        What’s up?
           INT. NIKKI’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (10) and Kate (10) flip through a phonebook.

                                 NIKKI (INTO PHONE)
                        Is Brandon there?...
                                 (girly giggle)
                        Brandon? Hi. I just wanted to tell 
                        you that...Kate Stevens likes you!

           Nikki laughs hysterically. Kate punches her repeatedly.

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           Kate and Mike nuzzle each other like a couple of dorks. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Kate (11) hides her face in her locker. Nikki (11) 
           reassures her.

                                 KATE
                        They don’t look that bad, right?

                                 NIKKI
                        No! I think they look cute!

           Kate turns around, REVEALING a mouthful of horrible 
           braces. Jessica (11) and her COOL CRONIES walk by.

                                 JESSICA
                        Looking good, Kate.

           Jessica and the Cronies snicker. Kate turns bright red, 
           hides her face back in her locker.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hey, Jessica? I can see your 
                        sausage nips through that shirt. 
                        Get a bra, sweetie.

           Jessica looks down and quickly covers her nipples before 
           hurrying off. Nikki gives Kate a comforting smile.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           Nikki opens her underwear drawer to find...nothing. Back 
           up plan -- picks out a pair of underwear that sits on top 
           of her overflowing hamper. 
                                 NIKKI
                                 (turns it inside out)
                        The ol’ inside out trick...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (12) writes a note for “K8.” Passes it to Trevor 
           (12), who passes it to Kate (12). She opens it, sees: 
           “Trevor has a boner right now!” Kate looks at Trevor. He 
           sure does.

           INT. KATE’S WALK-IN CLOSET - DAY - PRESENT

           Kate struggles to pick an outfit. Too many options. 

           INT. KATE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (13) and Kate (13) apply heavy eyeliner, tease 
           their hair, and take overly confident “sexy” pictures. A 
           good 70 poses. Post them to Myspace.

           INT. NIKKI’S BATHROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           Nikki tries to flush the toilet. The bowl fills higher 
           and higher with water.

                                 NIKKI
                        Danny!!!

           Nikki (14) and Kate (14), back-to-back, awkwardly slow 
           dance with TWO BOYS (14). 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (whispers too loudly)
                        I think Jason and I are gonna go 
                        to second base tonight.

                                 KATE
                        You haven’t been to first base yet.

                                 NIKKI
                        I always forget what the bases 
                        are. Anyway, I wanna get fingered.
           INT. KATE’S BATHROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           At their respective sides of the “his and hers” sink, 
           Mike flosses while Kate lightly dabs on eye cream.

           INT. NIKKI’S JUNKY CAR - MOVING - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (15) and Kate (15) drive around, sing along to Gwen 
           Stefani’s “HOLLABACK GIRL.” It’s cringe-worthy.

           Nikki, lost in a moment of passion, nearly hits another 
           car. SWERVES out of the way just in time.

           INT. NIKKI’S KITCHEN - DAY - PRESENT

           along/impersonating James Blunt’s “YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL.”

           Kate cheerily greets NEIGHBORS, MAILMAN, etc. as she

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (17) and Kate (17) take the SATs. Nikki passes a 
           note to Kate: “Trevor’s not even gonna get into a state 
           school.” Kate looks at Trevor (18) who’s asleep, drooling 
           on top of his test. He sure won’t.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY - PRESENT

           Nikki crams her way into a packed subway car. No open 
           seats. Slyly puts a scarf under her shirt. Leans back, 
           holds onto her “stomach,” sighs loudly. A MAN (40s) 
           offers her his seat. She happily takes it.

           INT. NIKKI’S JUNKY CAR - MOVING - FLASHBACK

           Nikki (18) and Kate (18) sing off-key to Taylor Swift’s 
           “LOVE STORY.” They might be the whitest girls ever.
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - PRESENT

           Kate teaches LITTLE KIDS arithmetic. She’s the kind of 
           teacher every kid wishes was their mom.

           INT. UPSCALE RETAIL STORE - DAY - PRESENT

           Nikki, frantic and disheveled, chucks her purse behind 
           the counter. A FEMALE CUSTOMER approaches.

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        Excuse me, is there still a sale 
                        on the cashmere sweaters?

                                 NIKKI
                        Sorry, I don’t work here.

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        Why are you standing behind the 
                        counter?

                                 NIKKI
                        I...dropped something back here...
                                 (”looking”)
                        Now where did that go...

           Female Customer leaves with a “hmph.” 

           JESSIE (22, bright-eyed) sidles up next to Nikki.

                                 JESSIE
                        Did you just tell that woman you 
                        don’t work here?

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s like, give me a goddamn 
                        second, I just walked in the door. 

                                 JESSIE
                        You know we opened awhile ago.

                                 NIKKI
                        I think I know when my own store 
                        opens, Jessie.
                                 (checks watch)
                        Shit I really am late.

           LATER

           As Nikki folds clothes, Kate enters, sneaks up from 
           behind, and slaps her on the butt. 
           Without missing a beat, they THRUST their groins together 
           and GRUNT -- like the sound a 12-year-old boy might make 
           the first time he jerks off. This is their “hello.”

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming in. I would’ve 
                        called in sick, but I thought four 
                        times in one month might be 
                        pushing it. 

           Jessie hears this, shakes her head.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        So?! What’s the big news?

                                 KATE
                        Mike and I are...

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh my God. You guys are finally 
                        getting a pool! Fuck yes! I’ve 
                        been asking for that for years! 
                        This is so exciting. Now I can buy 
                        that inflatable gorilla floaty! 
                        Maybe we--

                                 KATE
                        No...

                                 NIKKI
                        What then?

                                 KATE
                        Mike and I are...trying!!!

                                 NIKKI
                        ...Trying what? 

                                 KATE
                        To get pregnant!

                                 NIKKI
                        Ugh gross, don’t talk like that. 
                        “Trying” makes it seem like he 
                        doesn’t know where to put it.

                                 KATE
                        We’ve actually been trying for 
                        awhile now. My doctor says my 
                        uterine lining is really thick and 
                        my cervical mucus is very clear. 
                                 NIKKI
                        Don’t come into my store talking 
                        about your linings and your mucus! 
                        You’re gonna scare the customers!

           REVEAL zero customers around.

                        Is that all you have to say? I 
                        tell you that we’re trying to get 
                        pregnant and that’s your response?

                                 NIKKI
                        Why do married people always say 
                        that? “We’re” trying to get 
                        pregnant. Does Mike have a uterus 
                        I don’t know about? I always just 
                        assumed he was bloated.

                                 KATE
                        You know what I mean.

                                 NIKKI
                        If this is what you really want, 
                        then congratulations. I just think 
                        it’s a little fast is all.

                                 KATE
                        We’ve been married for nine years.

                                 NIKKI
                        But we’re too young!

                                 KATE
                        We’re not that young!

                        I’m sorry. You’re right. I’m happy 
                        for you guys.

                        The girls at work are going to 
                        freak out! Beth said when Brayden 
                        was born everything changed. Says 
                        she can’t even remember life 
                        before him.

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s extremely sad...

                                 KATE
                        I think it’s sweet!
                                 NIKKI
                        Of course his name is “Brayden.” A 
                        woman named Beth shouldn’t be 
                        allowed to name anything. Beth is 
                        a fat girl’s name. 

                                 KATE
                        Be nice.

           Nikki defiantly stops folding clothes.

                                 NIKKI
                        I hate when you tell me to be 
                        nice! I’m not a child! 

           Nikki finds a piece of candy in her pocket.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                                 (childlike)
                        Ooooh a Jolly Rancher!!!

                        Just be nice when you meet them.

                                 NIKKI
                        Do I have to? I bet I know exactly 
                        what they’re like.

                                 KATE
                        Really? What are they like?

                                 NIKKI
                        Beth’s probably the kind of person 
                        who doesn’t cuss. She’ll say like, 
                        “Cheese and rice!” instead of 
                        “Jesus Christ.”

           Kate subtly suppresses a smile.

                        Am I right?

                        And I bet one of them is a person 
                        who’s like, “I’m sooo weird, I 
                        love true crime shows about 
                        murder!” And it’s like, yeah 
                        bitch, we all love murder.

                        I would bet my life that one of 
                        them owns a shirt that says “Wine 
                        not?” with a picture of a giant 
                        glass of wine on it.

                        The dinner party. At my house.

                        Ugh do I have to go??

                                 KATE
                        Nikki, I told you about this weeks 
                        ago. You can’t back out now. Plus, 
                        Roger’s gonna be there.

                                 NIKKI
                        Roger?!? Why do people in the 
                        suburbs have such awful names?!

                        Like...him!

           Nikki points to a couple who’s just walked in. The 
           BOYFRIEND (30s) watches his GIRLFRIEND (30s) shop. He 
           holds his girlfriend’s bags, looking mildly suicidal. 
           Nikki waves to him, he gives a confused wave back.

                        I’m serious! You can’t keep seeing 
                        Danny.

                                 NIKKI
                        I barely ever see him!
                                 (off Kate’s look)
                        ...Usually we do doggie style.

                        Are you sure he’s not homeless? I 
                        ran into him in the hall once and 
                        he asked if I had any change. 

                                 NIKKI
                        He’s not homeless. I’m 85% sure.

                                 KATE
                        What does he do for work?

                                 NIKKI
                        He’s ummm...

                                 (very quiet)
                        A dog walker.

                                 KATE
                        Seriously?

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s not all he does! He’s like 
                        an entrepreneur. He sort of 
                        bounces around between different 
                        things.

                                 KATE
                        Let me guess--

                             KATE
           He has a podcast?
                                                         NIKKI
                                              I think he has a podcast...

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s not like I’m gonna marry him!

                                 KATE
                        That’s why you’re gonna come over 
                        and meet Roger! Someone you could 
                        marry! Someone who has a 401K. 
                        Someone who doesn’t high-five you 
                        after sex.

                                 NIKKI
                        That was only twice...

                        at least start thinking about it? 
                        Don’t you want a family?

                        I know, but we’re getting older. 
                        We need to start our own families.

           This bothers Nikki. Ouch.

                        can say you tried. Don’t you get 
                        sick of being alone? At least 
                        sometimes?

                                 NIKKI
                        No! Being single is awesome. I can 
                        go out whenever I want, hook up 
                        with whoever I want, do whatever I 
                        want. I honestly wouldn’t trade it 
                        for anything.

           QUICK CUTS OF NIKKI ALONE - VARIOUS
           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki dances in front of the mirror to “GOODBYE HORSES” 
           by Q Lazzarus. She’s seen Silence of the Lambs way too 
           many times. Her Buffalo Bill is pretty dead-on.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (low voice)
                        Would you fuck me? I’d fuck me.

           INT. NIKKI’S LIVING ROOM

           Nikki plays X-Box, screams into her headset.

                                 NIKKI (INTO HEADSET)
                        Fucking shoot him, you noob!!!!! 
                        Dude, Levi you’re such a pussy.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki, half naked, eats a burrito in bed. Some chicken 
           falls out landing on her boobs. She eats it, pecking at 
           it like a bird (no hands). Licks off some residual sauce.

           INT. NIKKI’S LIVING ROOM

           Nikki sort of watches The Great British Bake Off. Scrolls 
           through her phone. Yawns. REVEAL her looking through 
           PornHub, uninterested.

           INT. NIKKI’S LIVING ROOM

           Nikki clips her toenails. A clipping FLIES into her eye.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki scrolls through Instagram in bed. Squirms. Pulls a 
           piece of chicken (from earlier) out of her sheets.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki’s laptop open to a Netflix prompt that says “ARE 
           YOU STILL WATCHING?” She drools onto her keyboard.

           INT. NIKKI’S APARTMENT

           Nikki, face covered in green mask, greets a DELIVERY MAN. 
                                 NIKKI
                        You got here faster than I 
                        expected...

           INT. NIKKI’S LIVING ROOM

           Nikki lies on the couch, yet again scrolling through 
           Instagram. Gets a notification: “YOU’RE ALL CAUGHT UP.” 
           She puts her phone down. Thinks for a beat. Picks it up 
           again, dials.

                                 NIKKI (INTO PHONE)
                        What’s this Roger guy’s deal?

           INT. KATE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nikki’s let herself in. It’s not rude when she does it.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (holding bottle)
                        I brought a party favor! How grown 
                        up am I?

           Nikki and Kate do their groin-greeting.

                                 KATE
                        It’s a bottle of tequila. Red wine 
                        may have been a little more appro--

           Nikki’s already changed focus, picking at food laid out.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mike! I love your apron, where’d 
                        you get it!?!?

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks! Actually I got it on sale 
                        from... You’re making fun of me.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (meandering)
                        So what’s this guy like? Is he a 
                        nerd? If he’s one of Mike’s 
                        friends then he’s probably a nerd, 
                        right? But what kind of nerd? A 
                        harmless one like Mike? Or is he 
                        like a neckbeard-nerd? Has a 
                        Reddit account. Watches Anime. 
                        Cried when he saw the last 
                        Avengers. If he shows up wearing a 
                        graphic tee I’m fuckin’ out. And 
                        I’m taking my tequila with me.
           Kate and Mike shoot her a glance. Shut up. 

           REVEAL ROGER (30s, a square) standing behind Nikki.

                                 ROGER
                        She seems sweet!

           The doorbell DINGS.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nikki sips on a cocktail, hears Kate greeting guests.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        Girls!!!

                                 NIKKI
                        Lord help me.

           Roger enters.

                                 ROGER
                        What’s that?

                                 NIKKI
                        ...I like your tie!

           Kate ushers in her SUBURBAN SQUAD -- the “GIRLS” and 
           their HUSBANDS (who are so uninteresting they don’t even 
           merit character descriptions other than age).

                                 KATE
                        Nikki, this is everybody! Meet 
                        Heather and Terry --

           HEATHER (late 30s, tacky French manicure, so many charm 
           bracelets), and TERRY (late 30s) --

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        -- Trish and Gary --

           TRISH (late 40s, too much bronzer, not enough gym time) 
           and GARY (late 40s) --

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        -- and Beth and Barry!

           BETH (early 30s, rail-thin, makes Gwyneth Paltrow seem 
           down to earth), and BARRY (early 30s) --

                                 NIKKI
                        Wow, lot of “aries”!
                                 TRISH
                        You are a riot.

                                 BETH
                        It’s so nice to finally meet! 
                        Kate’s always telling us the 
                        funniest stories about you. 

                                 HEATHER
                        Is it true that in college you got 
                        drunk and shaved your head for 40 
                        dollars?! That’s hilarious!

                                 NIKKI
                        Well, 40 dollars was worth a lot 
                        more back then.

           They laugh in an “at you” way, rather than “with you.”

                                 HEATHER
                        You are so random! I love it!

           Nikki spots Mike entering with the last of the food.

                                 NIKKI
                        Thank God.

                                 KATE
                        Dig in, everyone!

                                 BETH
                        Katie, this all looks beautiful.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (quietly, to Kate)
                        Katie?

                                 KATE
                                 (ignores it)
                        Thank you! I hope it’s up to your 
                        standards. 
                                 (to Nikki)
                        Beth makes everything from 
                        scratch.

                                 NIKKI
                        Must make Pop Tarts a whole-day 
                        ordeal!

                                 BETH
                        We would never let Brayden have 
                        Pop Tarts. He’s not allowed to 
                        have sugar.
                                 KATE
                        You’re really gonna have to teach 
                        me more about clean eating.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (laughs)
                        I lived on Captain Crunch and hot 
                        dogs my whole childhood. And I 
                        turned out fine!

           The Girls seem to find this more offensive than funny.

                                 BETH
                        You’ll understand when you have 
                        your own kids.

                                 NIKKI
                        I guess...

                                 TRISH
                        You do want kids, don’t you hun?

                                 NIKKI
                        Sure, someday. Not in any rush. I 
                        think if I had one now I’d make 
                        Casey Anthony look like a saint.

           The Girls definitely find this more offensive than funny.

                                 HEATHER
                        Don’t wait too long. The older you 
                        get, the harder it’ll be. 

           Desperate to change the subject, Nikki looks to Kate for 
           help. Kate gestures to Roger. Talk to him.

                                 NIKKI
                        So, Roger. You live in the city?

                                 ROGER
                        God no! I don’t know how anybody 
                        does it. Trash everywhere. Too 
                        many people. Not enough space.

           Resounding agreement from the others.

                                 NIKKI
                        Right...

                                 ROGER
                        I’ve actually never left Long 
                        Island. In fact, I’m in escrow on 
                        a house ten minutes from here.
                                 NIKKI
                        Oooh “in escrow”! I love that 
                        term. Does anyone actually know 
                        what it means?

           Of course they know. All at the same time:

                                 ALL
                        It means that you’re in a 
                        contractual agreement to--/When 
                        you make an offer on a home and 
                        you write a check--/A third party 
                        will hold the payment while--

                                 NIKKI
                        OKAY! People do know what it 
                        means. Got it.

           Throats CLEAR. Silverware CLANKS. Then:

                                 HEATHER
                        Has anyone listened to that Ted 
                        Bundy podcast? I’m like a FREAK 
                        for liking it, but it’s so good!

           Nikki hides her smile behind her glass.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The men sit in a secluded circle as the girls play a 
           game. A piece of paper labeled “BIG BIRD” sticks to 
           Heather’s forehead.

                                 HEATHER
                        Wait, am I...Big Bird???
                                 (checks paper)
                        That is so random. Like who even 
                        thinks of that?!

                                 KATE
                                 (leaving)
                        Keep playing without me, I’m just 
                        gonna check on dessert!

                                 NIKKI
                        Me next!

           Nikki picks a piece of paper out of a bowl. Licks it, 
           slaps it to her forehead: “JENNIFER LAWRENCE.”

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Actor?
                                 HEATHER/TRISH/BETH
                        Yes.

                                 NIKKI
                        Actress?

                                 HEATHER/TRISH/BETH
                        Yes!

                                 NIKKI
                        Have they been in any franchises?

           They all look to each other. Who knows?

                                 TRISH
                        I’m so bad with these things, hun.

                                 HEATHER
                        What’s a franchise again? Is it 
                        like if it’s Batman?

                                 BETH
                        I don’t think she was in Batman. 
                        But I’ve only seen Lego Batman. 
                        Brayden loves that movie!

                                 HEATHER
                        Isn’t it adorable?! The kids watch 
                        that nonstop. There’s a Lego 
                        Batman bedspread at Target that 
                        I’ve been eyeing.

                                 BETH
                        Shut the front door. Babe, we need 
                        to get that for Brayden!

           Barry barely acknowledges her. Too busy fantasizing about 
           his old dreams of becoming a painter and moving to Italy.

                                 NIKKI
                        Ladies. Let’s focus. All I know so 
                        far is that it’s an actress who 
                        has not been in Batman?

                                 BETH
                        Right.

                                 TRISH
                        We think.

                                 NIKKI
                        Has she been in a Marvel movie?

           The ladies stare back blankly. Nothing.

                        Any of the Avengers, X-Men,

                                 BETH
                        Daredevil! She was definitely in 
                        Daredevil! Barry and I saw that on 
                        our first date.

                                 HEATHER/TRISH
                        Awwww!

           She looks to Barry, flirtatiously smiles. There’s no 
           fucking way he remembers that.

                                 (confused)
                        No...

                                 NIKKI
                        It has to be.

                                 HEATHER
                        You’re close! 

                                 TRISH
                        Maybe we don’t have the right 
                        Jennifer? Honey I haven’t seen a 
                        movie since 1999!

                                 BETH
                        It’s so true, if it’s not on 
                        Brayden’s Netflix cue then I 
                        probably haven’t seen it!

           They all laugh WAY too hard.

                        You guys don’t know who Jennifer 
                        Lawrence is?...

                                 TRISH
                        Who was the gal I was thinking of? 
                        She was real popular back in the 
                        day. Had--

                        Jennifer Love Huge-Tits.

           The girls look at her, aghast. 

                                 NIKKI (CONT’D)
                        I mean Hewitt.

                                 TRISH
                        You are so BAD!!!

                                 HEATHER
                        Did that really just happen? Did 
                        you really just say that. Like I 
                        cannot. Hahaha!

                                 BETH
                        I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that...

                                 KATE
                                 (returns)
                        More wine, girls?

                                 TRISH
                                 (”I’m bad”)
                        Wine.....not?

           Heather, Beth, and Trish SHRIEK with laughter. Nikki 
           literally JUMPS BACK, startled. 

           Kate tries to play damage control.

                                 KATE
                        Alright guys, you play too! Roger, 
                        why don’t you go next!

           Roger sticks “SAMANTHA JONES” onto his head.

                                 ROGER
                        Female?

                                 ALL
                        Yes.

                                 ROGER
                        Is she famous?

                                 KATE/MIKE/NIKKI
                        Kind of./No./Yes.
                                 ROGER
                        That’s not helpful.

                                 KATE
                        Ask another question.

                                 ROGER
                        Is she real?

                                 ALL
                        No!

                                 ROGER
                        She’s a...character?

                                 ALL
                        Yes!

                                 ROGER
                        Is she from a movie?

                                 KATE
                        Technically, but that’s not her 
                        main thing.

                                 ROGER
                        A TV show?

                                 ALL
                        Yes!

                                 ROGER
                        Shoot, I don’t have a TV.

           Nikki violently CHOKES on her drink.

                                 NIKKI
                        What?! You don’t what...?

                                 KATE
                        You can probably still get it! 
                        Most people know her without 
                        having seen the show.

                                 MIKE
                        He’s never gonna get it.

                                 KATE
                        Wait, Nik, do your impression. 
                        Maybe he’ll get it then.
                                 NIKKI
                                 (Kim Cattrall-like)
                        “Then I said, honey, better get to 
                        lickin.”

           Kate laughs, one of her favorite bits. No one else does. 

                                 ROGER
                        Are you some sort of...drag queen?

                                 NIKKI
                        No. “So there I am, his cock in my 
                        ass and his balls in my mouth, and 
                        I say, ‘This is what I call a 
                        Tuesday night!’”

           Still no one enjoys it but Kate.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t know any porn stars...

                                 NIKKI
                                 (fuming)
                        SAMANTHA JONES! 
                                 (rips the paper off)
                        IT WAS SAMANTHA JONES!!!

           A long, tense beat. This is not fun.

                                 MIKE
                        Do me next.

           Mike grabs a name, licks it, slaps it on. He widely 
           smiles with “HITLER” on his forehead.

                                 HEATHER
                        Stop. Who wrote that? Random!

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - LATER

           Nikki walks home, scarfing down pizza. Checks a text from 
           Kate: “That went well...” Nikki ignores it. Phone back in 
           pocket. Then, pulls it out again.

                                 NIKKI (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Nikki and Danny post-sex. He high-fives her, then puts on 
           his clothes. Nikki, still in bed, thinks.
                                 NIKKI
                        Have you ever seen Sex and the City?

                                 DANNY
                        Are you gonna ask me if I’m team 
                        Aidan or team Big? I swear if 
                        you’re not an Aidan fan...

           Nikki smiles. Is he, like...perfect?

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        I do a great Steve. 
                                 (spot on raspy voice)
                        “Miranda! I’m sorry I cheated on 
                        you in the movie! But I don’t 
                        consider that part of the canon, 
                        it doesn’t really count!”

           Nikki laughs and kisses him, pulling him back into bed. 
           Apparently Sex and the City knowledge is her Viagra.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Wait, I used my last condom--

           Nikki thinks, albeit too briefly.

                                 NIKKI
                        Fuck it, I’m on the pill.

           They go at it. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           SUPER: Four weeks later.

           INT. NIKKI’S STORE - DAY

           Jessie actually works while Nikki scrolls on her phone.

                                 JESSIE
                        Are you gonna do anything work-
                        related today?

                                 NIKKI
                        I already tried on a bunch of new 
                        shirts. I think they’re starting 
                        to run way too small though. My 
                        boobs didn’t fit into anything.

                                 JESSIE
                        That’s not really what I meant.
                                 NIKKI
                        No, seriously. Is it just me or 
                        have my tits gotten fucking huge?

           Nikki grabs onto her breasts, inspects them, just as an 
           OLD LADY walks by. Nikki smiles.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Hey, how’s it goin’?

           Old Lady darts out of the store.

           Jessie continues folding clothes. Then:

                                 JESSIE
                                 (repulsed)
                        Oh my God.

                                 NIKKI
                        What?

                                 JESSIE
                        Do you smell that?!

                                 NIKKI
                                 (over the top)
                        Yeah...What is that?! That’s so 
                        gross. Weird. I’d better go check 
                        it out, make sure we don’t have a 
                        sewage leak or something.

           Nikki, butt clenched, speed-walks to the back.

           INT. STORE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Nikki shuts the door behind her, releases a huge FART.

                                 NIKKI
                        Fuck, what did I eat?!

           INT. NIKKI’S STORE - LATER

           Nikki and Jessie ring up CUSTOMERS. 

                                 NIKKI
                        I need to leave after this. 

                                 JESSIE
                        What’s with you today?
                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t know! I have the worst 
                        cramps. And I’m fucking starving. 
                        I must be getting my period.

                                 JESSIE
                        Or you’re pregnant.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hahahahahaha...

           Beat. Nikki’s smile contorts into a terrified FROWN.

           INT. DRUG STORE

           Nikki grabs a pregnancy test. Almost knocks a MAN over as 
           she sprints to the checkout.

           INT. NIKKI’S BATHROOM

           Nikki paces back and forth, eyes glued to the pregnancy 
           test on the counter. Finally, she picks it up. 

           As she examines the results, the SCREEN SPLITS. Nikki on 
           the left; Kate, in her BATHROOM, on the right.

                                                          KATE
                            NIKKI
           WHAT THE FUCK!!!
                                              OH MY GOD!!!

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Kate and Nikki take their seats, both about to unleash.

                                 KATE
                                 (absolutely thrilled)
                        So--

                                 NIKKI
                                 (almost sickly)
                        So-- I really wanted to talk in 
                        person because--

                                 KATE
                        --It worked out great, I needed to 
                        talk to you in person too!

                                 NIKKI
                        --I... have some news.

                                 KATE
                        I do too!!!
                                 NIKKI
                        I’m--

                             KATE
                                                         NIKKI
           I’m pregnant!!!!!!!
                                              Pregnant.

                                 KATE
                        Wait. You’re...what? 

                                 NIKKI
                        Pregnant.

                                 KATE
                        What?!

                                 NIKKI
                        With child. Knocked up. Preggers. 
                        Bun in the oven. Tin roof rusted.

                                 KATE
                        “Tin roof rusted”?

                                 NIKKI
                        You know, like the end of “Love 
                        Shack.”

           Kate and Nikki excitedly gab, losing sight of the 
           conversation’s purpose.

                                 KATE
                        Ohhhh that’s what that means?!

                                 NIKKI
                        Yeah!

                                 KATE
                        I never knew that!

                                 NIKKI
                        Really?!

                                 KATE
                        That’s so funny-- 
                                 (shakes it off)
                        --Wait. How did this happen? 
                        Aren’t you on the pill?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes! I guess I haven’t always been 
                        as strict about taking it as I 
                        should be. Like taking it at the 
                        exact same time every day. But I 
                        always thought that was just a 
                        guideline!

                        Like flossing every day. Or 
                        waiting 30 minutes after you eat 
                        to swim. Or not parking in a 
                        handicap spot.

                                 KATE
                        You’re not supposed to park in a 
                        handicap spot.

                                 NIKKI
                        Well they should put giant signs 
                        up or something! Warn people of 
                        the consequences!!!

                                 KATE
                        They do.
                                 (beat)
                        What are you gonna--?

                                 NIKKI
                        I have no idea. Part of me thinks, 
                        this is scary, but the thought of 
                        me not having it, then regretting 
                        it later down the road is even 
                        scarier. And it’s like you said, 
                        we’re not 22 anymore.

                                 KATE
                        Right.

                                 NIKKI
                        And I can’t get that fucking 
                        Heather out of my head saying, 
                                 (mocking)
                        “Don’t wait too long, the older 
                        you get, the harder it’ll be.” No 
                        one asked you, Heather!!!

                                 KATE
                        She has a point...

                                 NIKKI
                        But then the other part of me 
                        thinks, what are you crazy?! 
                        You’re not ready to be a mom! You 
                        don’t separate your whites! You 
                        don’t use correct punctuation in 
                        texts! And you don’t even think 
                        Johnny Depp is that attractive!!!

                                 KATE
                        I don’t think those are official 
                        requirements.
                                 NIKKI
                                 (beat)
                        What do you think I should do?

                                 KATE
                        Honestly?

                                 NIKKI
                        Please.

                                 KATE
                        I think you could totally do it.

                                 NIKKI
                        Really?

                                 KATE
                        Yes! And by some crazy stroke of 
                        luck, I’d be right there beside 
                        you the entire time, doing it all 
                        too. It’s actually kind of 
                        perfect. We’ve done everything 
                        together since we were five. This 
                        is almost like...fate?

                                 NIKKI
                        It is kind of like fate...

                                 KATE
                        Obviously take some time to think 
                        it over. You don’t have to decide 
                        anything right now. Talk to the 
                        father-- wait. The father isn’t--

                             KATE
                                                         NIKKI
           Danny, is it--
                                              Danny.

           Beat.

                                 NIKKI
                        Wait, congratulations to you! I’m 
                        sorry. I didn’t mean to steal your 
                        thunder. Yay!

                                 KATE
                        Thank you!
                                 (beat)
                        Guess we should look at the menu.

           Silence as they “look.”

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        When do you think you’re gonna 
                        talk to him?
                                 NIKKI
                        I’m supposed to see him tonight.

                                 KATE
                        Mmm.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (beat)
                        This chicken looks good.

           At the exact same time:

                                                         NIKKI
                             KATE
           You should just go tell him 
           now.
                                              Maybe I should just tell 
                                              him now.

           Nikki leaves in a hurry.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR

           Nikki texts Danny: “Can you come over we need to talk.” 

           She waits for his reply, jittering like a crackhead. Her 
           phone lights up with his response: six DANCING DISCO MAN 
           EMOJIS.

           She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath. Opens her eyes 
           to see a HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN with her BABY. A wave of calm 
           washes over Nikki. She looks on, in awe. Has a moment. 

           INT. NIKKI’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Danny’s just been briefed.

                                 DANNY
                        We should get married.

                                 NIKKI
                        We’re not getting married!

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t want my kid to be a 
                        bastard!

                                 NIKKI
                        Then it’s a good thing we don’t 
                        live in Medieval times! Wait. Are 
                        you saying you want to...have it?

                                 DANNY
                        I think things like this happen 
                        for a reason.
                                 NIKKI
                        Uhh yeah. The reason being that we 
                        raw-dogged and you came inside me.

                                 DANNY
                        That’s true...But look, I’m all in 
                        if this is what you want. I know 
                        it’s your choice and I’ll support 
                        you either way, but...if I have 
                        any say, my say is yes.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hypothetically, if we did this, I 
                        think we’d have to set up some 
                        ground rules. Hypothetically.

                                 DANNY
                        Right. Agreed.

                                 NIKKI
                        We would be strictly co-parents. 

                                 DANNY
                        So we wouldn’t be dating anymore?

                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t think getting Popeye’s and 
                        having sex every other week is 
                        really dating. We can’t try to 
                        start a relationship at the same 
                        time as having a baby. That’s like 
                        being a virgin and trying anal for 
                        the first time. The steps are all 
                        out of order. So it would be no 
                        dating. No sex. No funny business. 
                        Hypothetically.

                                 DANNY
                        Hypothetically.

           Danny smiles at Nikki, waiting for her reaction. The 
           suspense killing him. Finally, Nikki smiles back.

           Danny BEAR HUGS her too hard, immediately recoils.

           MONTAGE

           INT. KATE’S LIVING ROOM

           Kate meticulously writes “OB/GYN Appt.” in her planner.
           INT. NIKKI’S KITCHEN

           Nikki scribbles “Pussy Doctor @ 2:00pm” on a sticky note. 
           Slaps it onto the refrigerator.

           INT. KATE’S OB/GYN - EXAM ROOM

           A DOCTOR shows Kate and Mike the sonogram. They kiss.

           INT. NIKKI’S OB/GYN - BATHROOM

           A NURSE hands a jittery Nikki a cup for her to pee in. 
           She does, the relief almost euphoric. She can’t stop. 
           Pees way too much. Makes a mess.

           INT. KATE’S KITCHEN

           Kate throws out “unhealthy” food. Basically everything.

           INT. NIKKI’S LIVING ROOM

           Danny rubs Nikki’s feet while she eats Pop Tarts. They’re 
           not even a fruity kind, it’s like S’mores or Fudge. 

           INT. COSTCO

           Mike and Kate buy prenatal vitamins in bulk.

           EXT. COSTCO - PARKING LOT

           Nikki spots an “EXPECTANT MOTHERS PARKING” space and gets 
           excited. She makes Danny take a photo of her next to it. 

           An OLDER MAN pulls into the HANDICAPPED spot next to it. 
           Nikki checks for his handicap parking verification, nods 
           in approval.

           INT. KATE’S LIVING ROOM

           Beth brings Kate a hefty stack of her old baby books.

           INT. BOOKSTORE

           Nikki and Danny browse the maternity section. Danny spots 
           a baby book he likes, looks to Nikki. She’s gone. 
           Finds her in the next aisle reading Leah Remini’s book, 
           TROUBLEMAKER: SURVIVING HOLLYWOOD AND SCIENTOLOGY.

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM

           Kate tries on a bra, it’s a bit too snug. Hooks it on the 
           middle loop instead. Perfect.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki’s boobs, engorged and filled with blue veins, 
           refuse to fit into her bra. She nearly exhausts herself 
           trying to make it work. Impossible.

           She puts a shirt on without a bra. Looks at herself in 
           the mirror. Her nipples have somehow gotten five shades 
           darker and five centimeters longer. 

           INT. CLASSROOM

           Kate accidentally lets out a tiny yawn while she teaches. 
           Shakes it off, moves on.

           INT. NIKKI’S STORE

           Nikki sleeps while standing at the counter. A CUSTOMER 
           looks on, worried. Nikki jolts awake. Customer jumps.

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM

           Kate easily slips into a pair of skinny jeans.

           EXT. STREET

           Nikki walks down the street, zipper of pants unzipped.

           INT. YOGA STUDIO

           A tiny BEAD OF SWEAT runs down the side of Kate’s face. 
           REVEAL she’s doing yoga.

           INT. BATHROOM

           Many SWEAT BEADS run down the side of Nikki’s face. 
           REVEAL she’s on the toilet, red-faced, struggling, 
           guzzling fiber supplements. She screams.
           END MONTAGE

           INT. DRUG STORE - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Nikki -- now showing a small baby bump -- puts down anti-
           gas medicine and laxatives on the counter. Avoids the 
           eyes of the CASHIER (60s, woman).

                                 CASHIER
                        Woo, girl! I do not envy you!

                                 NIKKI
                        Ha. No fun.

                                 CASHIER
                                 (loudly)
                        That is just the worst thing 
                        someone can have! I had me a bad 
                        case last night. I was sittin’ 
                        there on the toilet goin’ over 
                        everything I ate, trying to figure 
                        out what it coulda been. Like I 
                        was playing doodie detective with 
                        myself! Ha! Woo, that was bad. 
                        Never did figure it out...

           A LINE OF PEOPLE grows behind Nikki. The cashier’s lack 
           of urgency is astounding.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mmhmm.

                                 CASHIER
                        Gas alone is bad enough. But 
                        constipation on top of that too?! 
                        Woo, girl, you’re in for a rough 
                        night! That is one hell of a 
                        combo. I hope this stuff works, 
                        I’ll tell you that.

           Nikki puts her card in the chip reader as fast as she 
           possibly can. She pulls it out too fast, and the machine 
           makes that terrible BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

                        Try it again. Ain’t it funny how 
                        the body does that? It’s like you 
                        gotta go, but the booty says no!

           Nikki throws $20 down, takes her medicine and leaves.

                                 NIKKI
                        OKAY, THANK YOU MA’AM!
           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Kate and Nikki watch TV in bed. Kate eats baby carrots 
           while Nikki eats Doritos. The open medicine packages sit 
           on the nightstand.

                                 KATE
                        You feeling better now?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes, thank God. Why am I being 
                        punished like this? Did I hit a 
                        gypsy with my car in a past life?

                                 KATE
                        I’m so glad I haven’t had any of 
                        that. 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (so angry)
                        Really? Nothing?

                                 KATE
                        I cry at stupid stuff sometimes, 
                        but that’s really it.

                                 NIKKI
                        At least that hasn’t happened to me. 

           Kate flips through some channels.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                                 (choking up)
                        Change it. Not the Sprint 
                        commercial.

                                 KATE
                        What? Why?!

                                 NIKKI
                        Because that traitor Paul switched 
                        from Verizon to Sprint and 
                        betrayed them!!! No one has any 
                        loyalty these days.

                                 KATE
                        Okay, okay.
                                 (changes channel)
                        Oh no...
                                 (choking up)
                        See, this is the one that gets me.

                                 NIKKI
                        The KFC commercial?! 
                                 KATE
                        I just think about how Reba was 
                        the first woman to step into the 
                        role of the Colonel and I think 
                        it’s really moving! She really can 
                        do anything!

           Kate changes the channel. 

                                 NIKKI
                        If you have a girl, you should 
                        name her Reba. Little Baby Reba.

           They both laugh.

                                 KATE
                        Mike’s really hoping for a girl.

                                 NIKKI
                        Awww, really? What are you hoping?

                                 KATE
                        I don’t care either way. As long 
                        as it’s healthy I’ll be happy.

                                 NIKKI
                        Me too. Danny says he wants to be 
                        surprised, which I think might be 
                        kind of fun.

                                 KATE
                        That would be! 

                                 NIKKI
                        We should both do it! Have it be a 
                        total surprise!

                                 KATE
                        It would be nice to have people 
                        buy things for the baby that we 
                        actually need, instead of blue 
                        stuffed elephants or pink little 
                        bows that won’t stick onto the 
                        three hairs a baby has.

                                 NIKKI
                        Exactly! And you wouldn’t have to 
                        do one of those tacky gender 
                        reveals. 

                                 KATE
                        Those are awful.
                                 NIKKI
                        Let’s do it! Promise we’ll wait 
                        until we have them. 

                                 KATE
                                 (offers pinky finger)
                        Alright. Promise.

           Nikki locks her pinky finger with Kate’s, they kiss their 
           hands. An age-old tradition.

                                 NIKKI
                        I do think we should start talking 
                        about the shower. Where would be 
                        the best place to do it? I was--

                                 KATE
                        Actually, I’ve been meaning to 
                        talk to you about that. I think 
                        maybe I might just do my own. 

                                 NIKKI
                        You don’t wanna have it together?

                                 KATE
                        It might just be easier that way. 
                        Then you won’t have to deal with 
                        my whole family, and all of Mike’s 
                        side; he has tons of aunts and 
                        cousins and his sisters and, then 
                        there’s the girls--

                                 NIKKI
                        Can you quit calling them that?

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 NIKKI
                        “The girls.” It’s really annoying.

                                 KATE
                        Sorry...

           A tense silence. Then:

                                 NIKKI
                        You’re right, let’s just do our 
                        own showers. That’ll be easier.

                                 KATE
                        You sure? You’re not mad?
                                 NIKKI
                        No. We’re still gonna be shopping 
                        together for everything, and doing 
                        our registries together, right?

                                 KATE
                        Of course! 

                                 NIKKI
                        If we do that together, then I 
                        guess that’s all that matters.

           INT. HIGH-END BABY STORE - DAY - WEEKS LATER

           Nikki -- slightly larger now -- walks in and sees Kate -- 
           who has a small bump but is still petite. Nikki goes in 
           for their weird groin ritual.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (thrusting)
                        Ehhh...

                                 KATE
                                 (blocking her)
                        Not here -- no.

           REVEAL Beth, Heather, and Trish behind Kate, looking at 
           bibs. Trish sports the infamous “Wine Not?” shirt.

           Nikki pulls Kate into a SEPARATE AISLE.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        What are they doing here?!

                                 KATE
                        They wanted to come! To help us!

                                 NIKKI
                        This was supposed to be just us! 
                        We’re the pregnant ones!

                                 KATE
                        They’re all moms! They know what 
                        we need! They’ve done all of this 
                        already. Won’t it be helpful to 
                        have the experts with us?

                                 NIKKI
                                 (beat)
                        Fine. 

           Beth, Heather, and Trish spot Nikki, come over.
                                 BETH
                        Hey girl!

                                 NIKKI
                        Hey guys...

                                 TRISH
                                 (re: Nikki’s belly)
                        Congrats to you, hun!

                                 NIKKI
                        Thanks.

                                 BETH
                        You are so brave.

                                 NIKKI
                        I guess, I--

                                 HEATHER
                        No, you are. I cannot even imagine 
                        doing that all alone--

                                 NIKKI
                        --I’m not totally alone--

                                 HEATHER
                        I would literally kill myself.

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh. My.

                                 HEATHER
                        You’re like inspiring. I really 
                        look up to you!

                                 NIKKI
                        Thanks...
                                 (only to Kate)
                        Isn’t she older than me?...

           LATER

           Kate and Nikki, holding scanners, peruse various aisles 
           with Beth, Heather, and Trish.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (re: a mobile)
                        Kate, look at this. It’s so cute!

                                 KATE
                        It is!
           Nikki scans the barcode.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Girls, what do you think?

                                 HEATHER
                        What are those weird ducks? Like, 
                        what? They’re so random!

                                 BETH
                        Definitely not. There are too many 
                        small parts. Eventually they’ll 
                        fall off and be a choking hazard.
                                 (checks price)
                        Especially when it’s cheap.

           Nikki rechecks the price. It’s $90.

                                 KATE
                        What would we do without you?! 
                        Nikki, make sure to take that off 
                        your list.
                                 (moves on, re: crib)
                        This is the most beautiful thing 
                        I’ve ever seen.

           Beth, Heather, and Trish fall in love with it. Nikki 
           inspects it, checks the price.

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s 700 dollars.

                                 KATE
                        I know...I guess that is too much.

                                 BETH
                        Too much?! It’s your baby! You 
                        don’t want to sacrifice safety and 
                        style just to save a buck.

                             KATE
           That is true...
                                                         NIKKI
                                              It’s more than “a buck”...

                                 TRISH
                        Just do what we all do, hun. Put 
                        it on the credit card and throw 
                        out the statement before your 
                        husband can see it!!!

           The girls laugh WILDLY. Nikki cringes.

                                 BETH
                        Come on Katie, if you don’t get it 
                        I’ll be mad at you!
                                 KATE
                                 (thinks, too quickly)
                        Alright fine!

           The girls squeal with delight. They move on to the NEXT 
           AISLE. Nikki grabs Kate’s arm, holding her back.

                                 NIKKI
                        Are you really gonna buy that? 
                        Don’t feel pressured to get it 
                        because of them.

                                 KATE
                        I’m not pressured! I want it! Come 
                        on, let’s go see the strollers.

           As Kate walks off, Nikki looks around, checks to see if 
           anyone’s looking. Angrily knocks over a stuffed animal.

           INT. CAFE - LATER

           Beth, Heather, and Trish drink mimosas. Kate picks at a 
           grapefruit and avocado toast. Nikki shovels an oversized 
           stack of pancakes into her mouth.

                                 NIKKI
                        God I’m starving. How is it 
                        possible to be this hungry all of 
                        the fucking time?

                                 BETH
                        Oop! You actually shouldn’t curse 
                        around the baby.

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s...not here yet...

                        Their ears are fully formed in the 
                        womb at 16 weeks.

                        My appetite hasn’t changed much 
                        since being pregnant! 

           Nikki’s mouth hangs open a little bit, pancake falling 
           out onto plate. What...?

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           Nikki rolls her eyes into her pancakes.

                        I actually feel even better than I 
                        did before. Like I was born to be 
                        pregnant.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Nikki stands on the subway, holds onto a pole. Out of 
           nowhere, she vomits all over herself. PEOPLE jump back.

           Nikki, sweating and covered in acne, walks down the

                        biggest highlights. And of course 
                        when Mike and I saw the 3D 
                        ultrasound for the first time.

           CLOSE ON a terrifying 3D sonogram of the baby. It looks 
           like a monster right out of Guillermo del Toro’s personal 
           nightmares. Nikki jumps back and screams.

           Nikki tries desperately to talk about anything other than 
           her pregnancy.

                                 NIKKI
                        So! Have you guys seen that--

                        Have you -- sorry, Nikki, -- I was 
                        just gonna ask, Kate, have you had 
                        the same symptoms I had with my 
                        last pregnancy?...

           Beth, Heather, and Kate all giggle.

                                 HEATHER
                        Literally can’t believe we’re 
                        talking about this right now. This 
                        is not happening!

                        I’ve definitely had some 
                        experience with that symptom.

                                 TRISH
                        Really?...

                                 NIKKI
                        For sure! And at least you all had 
                        husbands. I’m on my own. And let 
                        me tell you, it’s not easy with 
                                 (re: stomach)
                        all this going on. I can’t come 
                        when I’m on my back, only when I’m 
                        on top or on my stomach, so it’s 
                        been a real challenge re-learning 
                        how to masturbate.

           Silence. The ladies scandalized.

                        So! Nik, have you figured out your 
                        birth plan yet?
                                 NIKKI

                        A little late for that question.

                                 KATE
                        No, your actual birth plan. Like 
                        all the details for your labor.

                        Like who’s going to be in the room 
                        with you? What do you want the 
                        atmosphere to be like?

                        playing? If so, start working on 
                        your playlist now. And you need to 
                        figure out if there will be a way 
                        to hook up your phone. You might 
                        need to bring a portable speaker.

                        Do you know if you’re going to

                        What are you gonna do about pain 
                        management? Do you want an 
                        epidural or are you planning an

                        You have to go all natural.

                                 HEATHER
                        You need to decide beforehand if 
                        you’ll let the doctors do an 
                        episiotomy. Some people would just 
                        rather tear naturally, but I 
                        recommend doing it.
                                 NIKKI
                        What’s...an 
                                 (can’t pronounce it)
                        episiotomy?

                                 KATE
                        It’s when they make a cut from the 
                        bottom of your vagina down through 
                        the perineum, to enlarge the 
                        opening.

                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t...understand...

                                 KATE
                        It’s like this--

           Kate cuts a small hole in her napkin. She holds it up 
           with her grapefruit, demonstrates. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        The grapefruit is the baby’s head.

           Kate tries to push the grapefruit through the small 
           napkin hole. Won’t fit.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        This space here is the perineum. 
                        And this here...is the anus.

           Kate picks a chocolate chip off of Nikki’s pancakes, 
           smushes it onto the napkin, indicating the butthole.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Now, if the baby is in an abnormal 
                        position, or it’s larger than 
                        expected, or the doctor thinks you 
                        might experience extensive vaginal 
                        tearing, they’ll make a small 
                        incision here, like this...

           Kate cuts from the bottom of the napkin-vagina-hole with 
           a knife, down to the chocolate-chip-butthole.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        See? And now baby has an easier 
                        time getting through!

           Kate pushes the grapefruit all the way through, and it 
           PLOPS onto Nikki’s plate. Nikki looks ill.

                        cleaned up first? Some people are

                        Circumcision is so cruel. We 
                        didn’t even consider it for 
                        Brayden.

                                 TRISH
                        Are you gonna breastfeed right 
                        away? If the baby has a hard time 
                        latching, will you bottle feed? Or 
                        would you just do formula?

                                 BETH
                        You should never do formula.

                                 HEATHER
                        Are you planning on using a doula? 

                                 NIKKI
                        -- I don’t even really understand 
                        what a doula is. Like a nurse?

           Their voices begin to FADE OUT as Nikki half-listens, 
           trying not to spiral.

                                 BETH
                        Their training is non-medical, it 
                        focuses more on emotional support 
                        for you and the baby. 

                                 KATE
                        Beth, you liked yours right? Mike 
                        and I have been--

           Nikki abruptly STANDS.

                                 NIKKI
                        I...have to go to the bathroom...

           She leaves.
                                 TRISH
                                 (beat)
                        ...do you think she’s going in 
                        there to masturbate?

           BY BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Nikki leaves the bathroom, Kate’s there waiting.

                                 KATE
                                 (comforting)
                        Hey. You alright?

                                 NIKKI
                        I just think all of this pregnancy 
                        and baby talk is driving me a 
                        little crazy. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m probably just tired. 

                                 KATE
                        Why don’t you go home and lie 
                        down? I’ll get your check.

                                 NIKKI
                        You sure?

                                 KATE
                        Positive.

           Nikki smiles, appreciates this small victory. Kate 
           quickly bumps her groin into Nikki’s. Nikki laughs.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER

           Nikki, still feeling shitty, rides the subway. Happy 
           Young Woman with her baby (same woman she saw on the 
           train before) sits down next to her.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (recognizes, smiles)
                        Your baby is adorable. I’ve 
                        actually seen you on the train 
                        before.

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN
                        She’s not mine. Just the Nanny.
                                 NIKKI
                        Oh.

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN
                        You couldn’t pay me to have one.

                                 NIKKI
                        She seems so sweet...

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN
                        That’s what I thought too. Thought 
                        all kids were sweet. Before she 
                        came along. I swear I think she 
                        might be the fucking anti-Christ.

           CLOSE ON the baby’s face. Could not look more angelic.

                                 NIKKI
                        But I’ve seen you with her 
                        before...you were smiling and 
                        playing with her...seemed to 
                        really love her.

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN
                        It’s all a front. If she suspects 
                        anything, she’ll get angry. Have 
                        to keep up appearances.

                                 NIKKI
                        Really?...

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN
                        It’s exhausting.
                                 (sighs)
                        Uh oh. I shouldn’t have said that. 
                        Here it comes.

           The baby WAILS so loud, everyone on the train flinches, 
           covers their ears. It’s a painful, ear-splitting scream. 
           The kind of scream that might turn you into a mad woman.

                                 HAPPY YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
                                 (to baby)
                        What do you want from me?!?! I’m 
                        SORRY, OKAY?! I’M SORRY!!!!

           A horrified Nikki gets off before her stop.

           EXT. STREET

           Nikki walks down the street, talking on the phone.
                                 NIKKI (INTO PHONE) 
                        This will just be a one time 
                        exception. I had a shitty day. 

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM

           Nikki and Danny in bed, post-sex.

           Danny reads a baby book. Nikki checks her phone -- a text 
           from Kate: “Sorry about today. Hang out tomorrow? Just me 
           and you? Nothing baby related. We can see a movie or 
           something!” Nikki smiles.

                                 DANNY
                                 (reading)
                        Woah! Did you know some babies can 
                        be born with teeth?!

           Nikki gives him a look. Get out.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Fine, fine, I’ll go home.

           INT. KATE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Nikki walks through the house looking for Kate.

                                 NIKKI
                        Kate? Kate?? Mike?

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Nikki looks to the backyard, scrunches her face. What the--

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER directs an elaborate 
           photoshoot complete with softboxes, reflectors, light 
           stands, etc. Beth calls out suggestions to Mike and Kate, 
           who pose in the garden.

                                 BETH
                        Yes, that’s perfect! Mike, put 
                        your hand on Kate’s belly. Kate, 
                        look up at Mike into his eyes. And 
                        smile. A soft smile. Like you just 
                        got a 40 percent off coupon for 
                        Ann Taylor. Perfect!

           Nikki walks closer. No one even notices.
                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        Mike, grab that rose from the 
                        garden. Put it in front of Kate’s 
                        nose. And both of you smell it. 
                        That’s beautiful. Now get on your 
                        knees and grab Kate’s belly with 
                        both hands. And talk to the baby.

                                 MIKE
                        What should I say?...

                                 NIKKI
                                 (finally interrupts)
                        Hi -- What’s going on here?

                                 KATE
                        Shoot, Nik, I thought we were 
                        seeing the movie in an hour.

                                 NIKKI
                        I came over a little early...what 
                        are you doing?

                                 BETH
                        We’re shooting Kate’s pregnancy 
                        announcement!

                                 NIKKI
                        Her pregnancy announcement?...

                                 BETH
                        Mmhmm!

                                 NIKKI
                        So you’re going to like...send 
                        these pictures out to people?

                                 BETH
                        Yep! And I think across the top it 
                        should say something cute like 
                        “Baby Andrews: Coming Soon.”

                                 KATE
                        I love that!

                                 BETH
                        Wouldn’t that be sweet?!?!

                                 KATE
                        Yes!!!

                                 NIKKI
                        I guess I’ll just wait inside?
                                 KATE
                        It shouldn’t take too much longer. 
                        I’ll be in soon!

           Nikki leaves. She turns back, about to say something, but 
           Beth’s already calling out new actions for Kate and Mike. 

                                 BETH
                        Can you both stand together back-
                        to-back, with your arms crossed? 
                        And look into each other’s eyes 
                        and smile.

           Mike and Kate do so. They look like the poster for a 
           terrible Disney sitcom. 

           INT. KATE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Nikki lies on Kate’s couch watching TV. Mike and Kate 
           finally come in through the back door.

                                 NIKKI
                        How do you feel, Fabio?

                                 MIKE
                        I think I blinked in every photo.

           Mike goes upstairs.

                                 NIKKI
                        And what about you? You feel like 
                        a model, Katie-Kat?

                                 KATE
                        Be nice.

                                 NIKKI
                        You don’t think it’s just a little 
                        corny? Or over the top?

                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 NIKKI
                        Alright...
                                 (beat)
                        I guess I just didn’t know this 
                        was a thing.

                                 KATE
                        Mmhm.
                                 NIKKI
                        You’re supposed to send out 
                        pregnancy announcements? 

                                 KATE
                        Some people do.

                                 NIKKI
                        Then maybe I should do one.

                                 KATE
                        Really?

                                 NIKKI
                        Why not? If it’s what people do.

                                 KATE
                        But, not people like you...

                                 NIKKI
                        What do you mean?

                                 KATE
                        You know.

                                 NIKKI
                        No.

                                 KATE
                        I don’t think you’re really 
                        supposed to advertise it in your 
                        situation. It’s not exactly 
                        something to be proud of.

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh.

                                 KATE
                        You might as well send out a 
                        postcard that says, “Oops! The 
                        condom broke!”

           This hurts Nikki, but Kate doesn’t seem to notice.

                                 NIKKI
                        Right.

                                 KATE
                        You buy the tickets already?

           Nikki, zoned out, thinks about what Kate’s just said. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        ...Nikki?
                                 NIKKI
                        Huh? Yeah, yep.
                                 (beat)
                        Actually. I’m not really feeling 
                        all that well. You think Mike 
                        would wanna take my ticket?

                                 KATE
                        Really? 

                                 NIKKI
                        Sorry to bail. Maybe we can do 
                        something later this week.

           Nikki quickly leaves, not wanting Kate to see her cry.

           INT. NIKKI’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Nikki finds Danny already in her apartment, baby-proofing 
           every and anything he can.

                                 NIKKI
                        My spare key was for emergencies.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey! How was the movie?

                                 NIKKI
                                 (flops onto couch)
                        I didn’t go.

                                 DANNY
                        Why not? Did she want to go to the 
                        AMC? I know you like Regal more, 
                        and I think you’re right, their 
                        nacho cheese is better. But AMC’s 
                        mozzarella sticks are--

                                 NIKKI
                        Danny. I just want to sit on the 
                        couch and do absolutely nothing.

                                 DANNY
                        Sure. Sorry.

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s okay.

                                 DANNY
                        You want me to rub your feet?

                                 NIKKI
                        Please.
           He comes to the couch, she swings her legs up onto him.

                                 DANNY
                        Did you know that your feet can 
                        grow up to a whole size when 
                        you’re pregnant?

                                 NIKKI
                        No talking.

                                 DANNY
                        Right, sorry.

           Quick beat, then Nikki unleashes, barreling past Danny 
           whenever he interjects--

                                 NIKKI
                        I just don’t understand her!

                                 DANNY
                        I thought we weren’t supposed to 
                        talk...

                                 NIKKI
                        She’s like become a totally 
                        different person.

                                 DANNY
                        Who?

                                 NIKKI
                        Kate!

                                 DANNY
                        Right.

                                 NIKKI
                        Like, a photoshoot? Really?

                                 DANNY
                                 (so confused)
                        Photoshoot?...

                                 NIKKI
                        Exactly!!! Thank you! It was so 
                        over the top. So gaudy. So not 
                        her! And then she acts like I’m 
                        not classy enough to have one of 
                        my own. It’s like listen, if I 
                        wanted to have my own goddamn 
                        pregnancy photoshoot and fancy 
                        goddamn baby announcement, I could 
                        have one! Right?
                                 DANNY
                        I thought you said it was gaudy.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (re: feet)
                        Get the heel more.
                                 (back to rant)
                        I mean is it just me, am I just 
                        CRAZY?!?!

                                 DANNY
                                 (scared)
                        No?

                                 NIKKI
                        Thank you!!!

                                 DANNY
                        I think you need to take your mind 
                        off this. Let’s go out.

                                 NIKKI
                        Out?

                                 DANNY
                        What’s something fun you haven’t 
                        done in a long time?

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. CROWDED DIVE BAR

           Nikki and Danny CLINK two glasses of beer. Nikki gulps 
           hers down, loudly burps. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Nonalcoholic beer tastes like 
                        shit, but it’s worth it seeing all 
                        the dirty looks I’m getting from 
                        these people.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t think it’s that bad.

                                 NIKKI
                        You could’ve ordered regular beer.

                                 DANNY
                        No, not if you can’t! Solidarity, 
                        sister.

                                 NIKKI
                        Please don’t call me sister.
                                 DANNY
                        You’re right, that’s weird.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (another long drink)
                        God I miss beer.

                                 DANNY
                        What else do you miss? 

                                 NIKKI
                        I miss being able to bend down. 
                        Now when I drop something it’s 
                        just gone forever.

                                 DANNY
                        That’s why I got you that arm 
                        extension claw thing!

                                 NIKKI
                        I know, that was sweet. I use it 
                        sometimes!

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. NIKKI’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Nikki sits on the toilet. Looks to the toilet paper roll 
           -- it’s completely gone. She uses the arm extender claw 
           to reach a new roll under the sink.

                                                              CUT BACK TO:

           INT. CROWDED DIVE BAR - SAME AS BEFORE

                                 NIKKI
                        You know what else I miss? My ass. 
                        I had a perfect ass. Do you 
                        remember it? Before all this
                                 (gestures to stomach)
                        happened? It was so good. So pert. 
                        So round...

                                 DANNY
                        You did have a great ass.

           Nikki starts to cry.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Do! Do! You do have a great ass!!! 
                        Still! I swear!
                                 NIKKI
                        Well it wouldn’t hurt you to say 
                        it every once in awhile!!!

           She wipes away her tears and finishes her beer. Gestures 
           to the BARTENDER for another.

                                 NIKKI (CONT’D)
                        You know what I miss the most?

                                 DANNY
                        Your ti--

                                 NIKKI
                        --Don’t say my tits.

                                 DANNY
                        No, I wasn’t going to. Go on.

                                 NIKKI
                        I miss just -- being treated like 
                        a person. It’s like now I’m only a 
                        vessel for this baby. Everything 
                        is about being pregnant. No one 
                        talks to me about anything other 
                        than that. I’m not just a woman. 
                        I’m a pregnant woman.

                                 DANNY
                        Alright. Tonight, no pregnancy 
                        talk. No pregnancy behavior. We’re 
                        just gonna act like you’re normal.
                                 (off her look)
                        You know what I mean.

                                 NIKKI
                        Deal.

           BY POOL TABLE

           They play pool -- her belly gets in the way. She tries 
           awkwardly to Tetris herself into the right position. She 
           finally does and makes the shot. They cheer.

           BY DARTBOARD

           They take turns throwing darts at the dartboard. Kate 
           makes a perfect bullseye. They throw their hands up and 
           scream, then kiss. Immediately awkward after, both look 
           away, pretend it didn’t happen.

           BY KARAOKE STAGE

           They sit at a table near the karaoke stage, watch others.
                                 DANNY
                        We should go next.

                                 NIKKI
                        Absolutely not.

                                 DANNY
                        Why?! It’ll be fun!

                                 NIKKI
                        I’ve never done karaoke sober.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve only done karaoke sober.

                                 NIKKI
                        What?!

                                 DANNY
                        I guess you don’t know this about 
                        me. I’m like, really good.

                                 NIKKI
                        At...karaoke?

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.

                                 NIKKI
                        No one’s really good at karaoke.

                                 DANNY
                        No, I am. I’ll show you.

           ON STAGE

           Nikki hesitantly takes the stage while Danny grabs two 
           mics from the KARAOKE MC (50s, tired).

                                 KARAOKE MC
                        The usual?

                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

           Danny joins Nikki on stage.

                                 NIKKI
                        Usual?!

           The opening chords of The B-52’s “LOVE SHACK” begin. 
           Nikki looks to Danny. No fucking way.
                                 DANNY
                        You ready?

           Danny is no more. A superstar alter ego completely takes 
           over. He SINGS ALONG in a perfect Fred Schneider sing-
           scream voice. Completely lights up the stage.

           The crowd LOVES it. So does Nikki.

           Nikki tries to keep up. Falls behind on most of the 
           words, is overshadowed not only by Danny’s singing but 
           his dancing -- moves so good, they must be choreographed.

           By the middle of the song, Nikki’s almost got it. But she 
           stops, clutches onto her stomach. 

                                 DANNY
                                 (stops)
                        What is it?! Are you okay?!

                                 NIKKI
                        The baby’s kicking. ON TEMPO!!!

           She pulls Danny’s hand to her stomach. Taps onto her 
           belly with the rhythm. They both SCREAM.

                                 DANNY
                                 (into mic)
                        MY BABY’S GOT RHYTHM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           As the rest of the song plays, they sing and dance like 
           there’s no goddamn tomorrow. The crowd CLAPS and GROOVES 
           along. Danny jumps into the audience at one point, 
           serenading various tables. Nikki air-guitars so hard she 
           almost throws out her back. 

           They finish up the song:

                                 DANNY
                        You’re WHAT?!

                                 NIKKI
                        TIIIIIIN ROOOOF--
                                 (points to belly)
                        RUSTED!

           Danny gestures for Nikki to take a bow. She does and they 
           hug. He kisses her on the cheek.

           FADE OUT as the crowd goes absolutely nuts.
           INT. HALLWAY/NIKKI’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Danny walks Nikki to her door.

                                 NIKKI
                        Thanks for tonight.

                                 DANNY
                        No problem.

                                 NIKKI
                        Do you wanna come in? Just for a 
                        little bit?

                                 DANNY
                        You sure that’s a good idea?

                                 NIKKI
                        We have self control. We can just 
                        watch TV or something.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Danny and Nikki sit on opposite ends of the couch, 
           silently watching TV. Beat. They both LUNGE at each other 
           and wildly make out.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Nikki and Danny lie in bed.

                                 NIKKI
                        That was the last time.

                                 DANNY
                        Totally.

           She reaches to the nightstand and grabs two books. Hands 
           him a baby book and takes the Leah Remini book for 
           herself. They both read. She takes a drink of her water, 
           wordlessly hands it to him. Like an old married couple.

           After a moment, engrossed in their respective books, they 
           GASP in unison, interested by something they just read.

           INT. NIKKI’S APARTMENT - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DAY

           The apartment’s moderately decorated with streamers and 
           balloons. Danny pins up a “BABY” sign in the LIVING ROOM.

           Nikki -- much larger now -- enters with groceries.
                                 NIKKI
                        It looks great in here!

                                 DANNY
                        Is this straight?

           It’s not.

                                 NIKKI
                        Sure!

           Danny (wearing an apron) goes to Nikki, takes her bags, 
           kisses her belly. Then quickly unpacks everything before 
           checking on a casserole. He’s basically Donna Reed.

                                 DANNY
                                 (spiraling)
                        Perfect. Thanks for getting more 
                        cups. That just needs to cool and 
                        then we should be good. What time 
                        is it? People might show up early. 
                        I wonder if I have time to rewash 
                        my hair. Does it look dirty?

                                 NIKKI
                        It looks like hair.

                                 DANNY
                        Shit. That’s what I was afraid of.

                                 NIKKI
                        Why are you freaking out? 
                        Everything came together.

                                 DANNY
                        I know, I’m just so nervous to 
                        meet your mom! I really hope she 
                        likes me.

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s why you’re nervous? Please. 
                        Just say a pleasant hello when she 
                        gets here, make dumb small talk 
                        for a few minutes, then leave.

                                 DANNY
                        Leave?! No I’m staying.

                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t think men are supposed to 
                        be at these things.
                                 DANNY
                        What kind of reverse sexism is 
                        that? It’s my baby too! Don’t you 
                        think I have the right to be at 
                        the shower for my own child? Don’t 
                        you think--

                                 NIKKI
                        Fine, stay, whatever!

           A KNOCK on the door.

                                 DANNY
                        I still need to get changed!!!

           Danny runs to Nikki’s BEDROOM. 

           Nikki opens the door to find Kate and PHOENIX (50s, long 
           gray hair tied into braids, many hemp bracelets).

                                 NIKKI
                        Hey! Ohh...?

                                 KATE
                        Nik, this is Phoenix, my doula. I 
                        told her it’d be alright if she 
                        tagged along. She brought a gift!

           Phoenix holds out a bracelet made of green gemstones as 
           Nikki welcomes them in.

                                 PHOENIX
                                 (breathy)
                        It’s unakite jasper. Are you 
                        familiar?

                                 NIKKI
                        Can’t say that I am, Phoenix.

                                 PHOENIX
                        It’s a very powerful crystal 
                        associated with the heart chakra. 
                        Energies from this stone radiate 
                        through the energy centers of your 
                        physical and emotional bodies, and 
                        great vibrational healing occurs. 
                        And when placed on the womb, it 
                        will help the parents form a 
                        spiritual connection with baby.

                                 NIKKI
                        Wow...and it’s green!

           Phoenix wanders off. 
                                 KATE
                        The place looks great!

                                 NIKKI
                        Really? Thanks. I was starting to 
                        regret not doing this somewhere 
                        else since it’s so tiny. But I 
                        guess it came together nicely. 

                                 KATE
                        For sure! There’s plenty of space. 
                        It’ll be cozy.

           LATER

           She should have done it somewhere else. WAY TOO MANY 
           PEOPLE crammed into the tiny apartment. Definitely 
           violating some fire codes.

           BY THE COUCH

           A GROUP OF WOMEN crowd around Phoenix as she reads palms.

                                 PHOENIX
                        And this line here represents the 
                        length of your cervix. Very 
                        impressive, Julie!

           The women OOH and AHH.

           BY THE WINDOW

           Nikki’s mom SANDY (60s, never not smoking), sits on the 
           fire escape with a cigarette. Danny -- dressed way too 
           formally, straddling the window, head crooked from trying 
           to fit -- eagerly chats her up.

                                 DANNY
                        As I was saying Mrs. Dawson, your 
                        daughter--

                                 SANDY
                        My daughter. Ha! You know what my 
                        daughter did when I had her? She 
                        tore my ass to shreds! Like it was 
                        nothing. Like a piece of paper. 
                        Right down the middle. I mean that 
                        literally. I’m not talking in 
                        metaphors here. Literally. Tore. 
                        My. Ass. Hole. Up.
                                 (long cigarette drag)
                        Was never the same after that...
           BY THE KITCHEN

           Nikki cools herself off in front of the refrigerator, 
           eats shredded cheese right out of the bag. 

                                 KATE
                        You doing okay?

                                 NIKKI
                        Do you think people are having 
                        fun? I hate being the hostess. 
                        There’s so much pressure.

           She eats an especially big handful of cheese.

                                 KATE
                        It’s fine! Maybe let’s just get 
                        the games started, I think people 
                        are getting a little antsy.

                                 NIKKI
                        Games? What do you mean? Like 
                        Scrabble?

                                 KATE
                        No...not like Scrabble. Like baby-
                        themed games. Did you not plan 
                        anything like that?

                                 NIKKI
                        No! I didn’t know I was supposed to!

                                 KATE
                        It’s fine, I’m sure people are 
                        just as happy socializing.

           A WOMAN ON COUCH yells over to Nikki.

                                 WOMAN ON COUCH
                        Hey Nik! What kind of baby games 
                        are we gonna play?

                                 NIKKI
                        Shit!

           Nikki urgently waves Danny over to her and Kate.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                                 (to Danny)
                        Everyone wants to play games!

                                 DANNY
                        What, like Scrabble?
                                 KATE
                        No, not Scrabble.

                                 NIKKI
                        They want like, baby themed ones. 
                        I didn’t think of anything like 
                        that!

                                 KATE
                        Let’s just ask if they have any 
                        suggestions of what we should do.

                                 NIKKI
                        You’re right, good idea.
                                 (to women)
                        Hey ladies...so, what kind of fun 
                        games were you all thinking we 
                        should play?

           JULIE (long cervix lady) looks disturbed.

                                 JULIE
                        You didn’t plan any?...

                                 NIKKI
                        No, Julie, I actually didn’t, 
                        guess I was a little preoccupied 
                        with growing a small person in my 
                        own insides. But does anyone have 
                        any suggestions??? Things you’ve 
                        done at other baby showers? 
                        Jessie, didn’t you go to your 
                        cousin’s baby shower a few months 
                        ago? What did you do there?

                                 JESSIE
                        It wasn’t exactly a “game,” more 
                        like an activity.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (desperate)
                        That’s okay! What was it?!

                                 JESSIE
                        The host bought a bunch of little 
                        plain white onesies and bibs, and 
                        got a ton of fabric paint and 
                        little arts and crafts accessories 
                        and we all decorated one, so the 
                        mom had like 20 really cute, 
                        unique onesies for the baby. They 
                        work as something the baby can 
                        wear, but then also make a really 
                        nice keepsake afterwards.
                                 ALL
                        Awwwww!!!

                                 NIKKI
                                 (infuriated)
                        But we can’t do that, because I 
                        didn’t buy supplies for that.

                                 JESSIE
                        I said it wasn’t a game.

                                 NIKKI
                        Alright, different suggestion! 
                        Aunt Denise. Go.

                        You know what was just darling? At 
                        Emily’s baby shower a few years 
                        ago, we had everyone bring their 
                        own baby picture. Then we had this 
                        big cork-board where we pinned 
                        them all up. And then everyone had 
                        to guess who was who. It was the 
                        cutest thing!

           The women absolutely love it. 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (even more enraged)
                        Did anyone happen to bring their 
                        own baby picture to this event, 
                        unsolicited?

           Crickets. Of course not.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Thanks anyway Aunt Denise!!!

                                 KATE
                        I’ve got it! “Diaper Derby.” It’s 
                        super fun and easy, and we have 
                        everything we need already.

                                 NIKKI
                        Thank God. How do we play?

                                 KATE
                        We just need a couple rolls of 
                        toilet paper. We’ll divide up into 
                        teams and whoever makes the 
                        fastest “diaper” on one of their 
                        teammates wins!
                                 NIKKI
                        Great! Danny, could you--

                                 DANNY
                        --On it!

           Danny’s already racing to the bathroom for toilet paper. 
           He checks, lifts up one measly roll that has barely 
           anything left.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Uh you have more somewhere, right?

                                 NIKKI
                        Ummm. Definitely. Check under the 
                        sink...

           Danny checks. He tries to discretely shake his head so no 
           one notices, but they all do.

                                 KATE
                        Baby-themed Pictionary it is!

           LATER

           Nikki finishes drawing on a small legal pad, holds it up.

                                 JULIE
                        Diaper?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes, Julie, yes!!! It is a diaper!
                                 (overly enthusiastic)
                        See this is fun, right? Danny, go!

                                 DANNY
                                 (grabs slip of paper)
                        Okay. Okay. This is a hard one but 
                        I think I can do it. Okay.

                                 NIKKI
                        Enough talking!

                                 DANNY
                        Okay!

           He starts drawing. It looks insane. Just garbage, there’s 
           no making out what it could possibly be. Holds it up. 

           Sandy, still smoking, shouts from the FIRE ESCAPE.

                                 SANDY
                        Vagina.
                                 DANNY
                        No.

                                 DANNY
                        No...

                                 SANDY
                        Hymen.

                                 DANNY
                        Nope.

                                 SANDY
                        Broken hymen.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mom. It’s baby related.

                                 SANDY
                        Baby breaking the hymen!

                                 DANNY
                        NO!!!!!

           Timer BUZZES.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        It was a pacifier, Sandy. Pacifier.

           Sandy shrugs, lights another one up.

           LATER

           Kate’s the last one out the door. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Do you think people had fun??

                                 KATE
                        Yes.

                                 NIKKI
                        Really?

                                 KATE
                        I think people would’ve stayed at 
                        least another hour or two if you 
                        hadn’t run out of toilet paper.
                                 (off Nikki’s groan)
                        Relax! This day wasn’t for them.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It was for 
                                 (to Nikki, her belly)
                        you guys.

                                 NIKKI
                        Thanks.

           They hug and Kate leaves. 

           Danny sits down on the couch, opens up his hands, waits 
           for Nikki’s feet. Then, there they are. He massages them.

                                 DANNY
                        That was...

                                 NIKKI
                        Awful.

                                 DANNY
                        Yep.

                                 NIKKI
                        Who knew you were supposed to do 
                        all that shit?!

                                 DANNY
                        Not me!

                                 NIKKI
                        My Aunt Denise actually asked me 
                        what the theme of the shower was. 
                        The theme is “I’m Having a Baby,” 
                        bitch.

                                 DANNY
                        People just go way too over the top 
                        with stuff like that these days.

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s ridiculous. What did they 
                        expect? For there to be a giant 
                        blown up photo of me for them to 
                        play “pin the baby on the mommy”?

           Danny and Nikki laugh. Can you even imagine?

           EXT. KATE AND MIKE’S BACKYARD - DAY

           CLOSE ON a giant blown up PHOTO OF KATE for people to 
           play “Pin the Baby on the Mommy.” 

           A table sits next to it with blindfolds and miniature 
           “babies” to be pinned on.
           CATERERS set up elegant white tables, prepare an 
           extensive buffet. 

           A “DIY Onesie” station, with paint, arts and crafts, just 
           like Jessie described. Large standing speakers throughout 
           the yard. A giant projector screen hangs down from the 
           back of the house.

           Nikki takes it all in, stunned. Kate greets her.

                                 NIKKI
                        What...is all this?

                                 KATE
                        Isn’t it beautiful?! The girls 
                        really did a great job.

                                 NIKKI
                        They did all of this?!

                                 KATE
                        They knew I was feeling stressed 
                        about everything and my mom needed 
                        help, so they offered to take 
                        over. 

                                 NIKKI
                        You didn’t tell me you were 
                        stressed. I could’ve helped.

                                 KATE
                        I know, but they’ve done it all 
                        before. They know what they’re 
                        doing. 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Right, and I don’t.

                                 KATE
                        You know what I mean.

                                 NIKKI
                        What is the screen for?

                                 KATE
                        I don’t know! It’s supposed to be 
                        some big surprise. I’ve been 
                        racking my brain but I can’t 
                        figure out what it could be.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m gonna go inside real quick and 
                        make a PB&J, I’m starving.
                                 KATE
                        We’re having coq au vin for lunch!

                                 NIKKI
                                 (already walking)
                        Don’t worry I’ll have that too!

           INT. KATE’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Beth, Heather, and Trish already there -- cleaning, 
           preparing, organizing, etc. -- like they own the place.

                                 TRISH
                        Hey hun!

                                 NIKKI
                        Didn’t know you were here already.

                                 BETH
                        We’ve been here since this 
                        morning. Debbie called me late 
                        last night and said Kate was in 
                        hysterics--

                                 NIKKI
                        Debbie?...

                                 HEATHER
                        Kate’s mom--

                                 NIKKI
                        --I know who she is. But. I’ve 
                        known her like thirty years and 
                        I’ve never used her first name.

                                 BETH
                        She called me and we talked for a 
                        few hours and I said, don’t you or 
                        Katie-Kat worry, we’ll be there 
                        first thing in the morning, and it 
                        will all be perfect. Just relax 
                        and remain calm.

                                 NIKKI
                        Those are the same thing.

                                 BETH
                        What’s that?

                                 NIKKI
                        Nothing -- she just, she could’ve 
                        called me.
                                 TRISH
                        I’m sure she would’ve, but she 
                        knows how busy you are with 
                        everything. Plus, we’ve already 
                        done this a few times before. 
                        Leave it to the pros!

           Nikki seethes.

                                 HEATHER
                        Do you need help finding 
                        something?

           Nikki goes to the cupboard, grabs peanut butter and a 
           loaf of bread.

                                 NIKKI
                        No, I’ve got it. Thanks.

           Nikki goes to the refrigerator, grabs jelly. Is about to 
           grab a plate from the cabinet when--

                                 HEATHER
                        Plates are in the second cabinet 
                        from the left--

                                 NIKKI
                        --I KNOW.

           Beth continues decorating a cake. She accidentally drops 
           some icing and makes a small, manageable mess.

                                 BETH
                        Cheese and rice!

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           Tons of WOMEN fill the backyard. All cheery and gabbing, 
           playing appropriate baby shower games. Nikki meets Sandy 
           at the side gate.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mom, you’re like an hour late.

           Sandy’s hands are occupied carrying a present, so she 
           talks with her cigarette flopping out of her mouth.

                                 SANDY
                        I got lost! All these goddamn 
                        streets look the goddamn same.

                                 NIKKI
                        I won’t argue with you there.
                                 SANDY
                                 (sees full spectacle)
                        Spit on my dick this is nice!

           The cigarette falls out of her mouth. Nikki stamps it out 
           with her foot.

                                 NIKKI
                        Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on.

           They make their way over to a table where Kate sits with 
           her mom DEBBIE, Beth, Heather, Trish, and a few OTHERS.

                                 SANDY
                        Kate, sweetie! Hey, Deb!

                                 NIKKI
                        Do you guys mind scooting down? To 
                        make a space for my mom.

                                 BETH
                        It’s actually assigned seating.

                                 NIKKI
                        What.

                                 BETH
                        There’s a chart in the front with 
                        all the names and corresponding 
                        seat numbers.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (quietly to Kate)
                        Kate, can’t my mom sit here? She 
                        doesn’t really know anybody.

                                 KATE
                        No, of course, we can make room. 
                        Scooch over, ladies.

                                 NIKKI
                        Thank you.

           As Sandy and Nikki take their seats, Sandy lights up 
           another cigarette. The women look on in horror. Some 
           dramatically cover their mouths, cough.

                                 BETH
                        Mrs. Dawson, you can’t smoke here.

                                 SANDY
                        We’re outside, ain’t we?
                                 BETH
                        Secondhand smoke is severely 
                        harmful not only to pregnant 
                        mothers, but to their unborn 
                        babies. The effects of secondhand 
                        smoke have been linked to 
                        miscarriage, premature birth, 
                        behavioral problems, and even 
                        Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

                                 SANDY
                        Really? They know so much these 
                        days! Back when I was pregnant 
                        with Nik here, I smoked every 
                        goddamn day.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (sotto)
                        We knew you weren’t supposed to do 
                        that back then too...

                                 SANDY
                        Look at her, she turned out fine!

                                 NIKKI
                        You know what, we’ll just stand 
                        over in the corner for now.

           CORNER OF BACKYARD

           Sandy smokes, Nikki chews on her fingernails.

                                 SANDY
                                 (re: fingernails)
                        That’s a nasty habit.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (re: her smoking)
                        Really.

                                 TRISH (O.S.)
                        Alright gals! Time for presents!!!

                                 SANDY
                        They’re really running the show.

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s ridiculous. It should’ve been 
                        me. This was supposed to be my 
                        shower too. 
           GIFT AREA

           Kate unwraps presents.

                                 HEATHER
                        I’ll get a notepad so I can write 
                        down who got you what!

           Kate fans herself with her hand.

                                 BETH
                                 (overreacting)
                        What’s wrong?!

                                 KATE
                        Just got a little hot that’s all.

                                 BETH
                                 (literally screaming)
                        FAN!!! We need a fan!!!

           Kate continues opening presents. Beth and a CATERER 
           disappear. They reemerge with a standing fan. They run an 
           extension cord from inside the house out to Kate. 

           It becomes a very distracting ordeal, but Kate continues 
           unwrapping as if everything is normal.

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh my God.

           LATER

           Heather picks up wrapping paper around Kate’s feet. 
           Nikki, jealous, rushes to do the same. Heather picks up 
           speed, grabbing every single piece in front of Nikki. 

           Nikki, frustrated and defeated, red in the face from 
           bending down, tries to stand back up, but can’t. TWO 
           WOMEN next to her have to help her.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m fine. Fine, thank you.

                                 BETH
                        Let’s get back to our seats, 
                        everyone! Now, if you’ll notice in 
                        the centerpieces of each table, 
                        there are pink roses and blue 
                        hydrangeas. 

           Beth grabs a remote control and turns on the projector. 
           The screen LIGHTS UP.
                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        This is where you all get to 
                        participate! If you think Kate’s 
                        baby is going to be a boy, grab a 
                        blue flower. If you think the baby 
                        is going to be a girl, you’ll grab 
                        a pink flower.

           A SONG begins to PLAY. 

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        If you think it’s a girl, raise 
                        your flower when the screen 
                        flashes “PINK.” And if you think 
                        it’s a boy, raise your flower when 
                        the screen flashes “BLUE.” And 
                        whatever color stays on the screen 
                        at the end of the song, wins!

           The women grab at the flowers. The screen rapidly changes 
           from “PINK” to “BLUE” back and forth.

                                 NIKKI
                        Wait, what the hell? I thought you 
                        weren’t doing a gender reveal? I 
                        thought we were waiting to find 
                        out together. 

                                 KATE
                        I didn’t know this was happening! 
                        But isn’t this so cute?! I can’t 
                        believe they did all this!

           Nikki, in shock, watches the following:

           Hands rapidly raise up and down.

           Sandy participates from the CORNER, still smoking.

           The screen flashes from “PINK” to “BLUE” to “PINK” to 
           “BLUE” to “PINK” to “BLUE”... 

           The song STOPS, and the screen flashes one more time to 
           “PINK” as all the pink roses are raised in the air. 
           Everyone SQUEALS in excitement.

           ANGLE ON the ROOF of Kate’s house, where PINK (the actual 
           fucking singer) JUMPS DOWN, harnessed in pink bungee 
           cords, does an aerial somersault, and gracefully lands on 
           the ground. She begins to SING.

           The caterers shoot pink rose petals from cannons.
           Everyone SCREAMS. It’s like the studio audience at an 
           Oprah giveaway. They’re losing their shit. 

           Kate joyfully cries. Beth, Heather, and Trish sprint over 
           to Kate, arms wide open. They all hug. 

                                 HEATHER
                        I’m so happy for you!!! A little 
                        girl! Our girls are gonna be best 
                        friends!!!

                                 KATE
                        Thank you so much, this is 
                        amazing. How did you do it?!

                                 BETH
                        It was nothing. Alecia’s an old 
                        family friend.

           Phoenix rushes to Pink’s side, tries to get a selfie.

           Nikki leaves.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Nikki stands on the sidewalk fuming. Trying not to cry. 
           Then, Kate comes out to find her.

                                 KATE
                        Nikki? What the hell? What are you 
                        doing?

                                 NIKKI
                        Waiting for my ride.
                                 (looks at phone)
                        Looks like my driver has “good 
                        conversation skills.” Perfect.

                                 KATE
                        You’re leaving?!?

                                 NIKKI
                        Nice baby shower. I had fun. 
                        Thanks for the invite.

                                 KATE
                        What is your problem?!

                                 NIKKI
                        My problem?!
                                 KATE
                        Yes. Your problem. I just found 
                        out I’m having a baby girl. You’re 
                        not even going to congratulate me?

                                 NIKKI
                        Congratulate you!? Why would I 
                        congratulate you? You promised me 
                        we wouldn’t find out the sex until 
                        we had the babies. We were 
                        supposed to do that together.

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry, but I didn’t plan any 
                        of that, the girls did. 

                                 NIKKI
                        THE GIRLS?! Ohhh, well if the 
                        GIRLS did it, then yes, 
                        congratulations! I didn’t realize 
                        it was the GIRLS!!!!

           By now the yelling has attracted a SMALL CROWD.

                                 KATE
                        Can you stop making a scene?!

                                 NIKKI
                        Of course, I wouldn’t want to ruin 
                        your perfect baby shower thrown by 
                        your perfect girls for your 
                        perfect pregnancy. A pregnancy 
                        where everyone tells you you’re 
                        glowing. Where you have no morning 
                        sickness and you take perfect, 
                        regular shits every day and don’t 
                        need any laxatives.

                                 KATE
                        So you’re mad that my pregnancy is 
                        going a lot better than yours? 
                        That’s really mature.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m mad because you’re not even 
                        you anymore!!! You’re a fucking 
                        mom snob!

                                 KATE
                        How am I a mom snob?!
                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t know, let me just think of 
                        one example, how about the fact 
                        that you won’t even do groin 
                        greetings with me anymore?! You 
                        don’t think “the girls” would 
                        approve?!

                                 KATE
                        HA!!! I won’t ram my crotch into 
                        yours? That makes me a snob? 
                        Because I stopped doing something 
                        that we made up when we were 
                        FIFTEEN years old?! You know what, 
                        fine. Here you go. Is this what 
                        you want? Is this better???

           Kate aggressively tries RAMMING HER PELVIS into Nikki’s 
           repeatedly, but it doesn’t work with their giant bellies. 

           Sandy and Deb finally break them up.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        You are so jealous.

                                 NIKKI
                        Jealous?! Of what? Of your boring-
                        ass friends?! With their husbands 
                        who all have no personalities and 
                        rhyming names. What are you gonna 
                        do, you gonna make Mike legally 
                        change his name to Larry so you 
                        can be part of their club?!

           Beth, Heather, and Trish look on.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, that’s right! I’m talking 
                        about you guys! You fucking suck. 
                        Beth -- really? You’re not gonna 
                        let your kid have any sugar? Don’t 
                        you know anything about 
                        parenting??? You’re gonna shelter 
                        that kid so hard he’s gonna grow 
                        up hating you and he’ll be doing 
                        coke off a stripper’s ass by the 
                        time his balls drop. Not to 
                        mention the fact that he’ll resent 
                        you for leaving him with an uncut 
                        dick and no woman will ever want 
                        to fuck him! And Heather? What is 
                        wrong with you? Not everything is 
                        “random.” Do you even know what 
                        that word means?

                        When you call EVERYTHING random, 
                        then that means NONE OF IT is!!! 
                        Get a new word!!! And Trish -- 
                                 (beat)
                        Actually, Trish you’re not that 
                        bad. I don’t really have a problem 
                        with you.

           Trish gives a satisfied smirk.

                                 KATE
                        If you’re gonna insult my friends, 
                        then please leave.

                                 NIKKI
                        You know I thought this was really 
                        going to be special. I’m pregnant 
                        at the same time as my best 
                        friend. We get to go through this 
                        miracle together, experience the 
                        ups and the downs together. You 
                        literally said it was fate! You 
                        threw fate in my face! 

                                 KATE
                        You are so immature! How can you 
                        think you’re ready to have a 
                        child?!

                                 NIKKI
                        I didn’t!!! You’re the one who 
                        told me to do this!

           As soon as the words leave Nikki’s mouth she regrets them.

                                 KATE
                        Told you to do this? Nikki, do you 
                        hear yourself? This isn’t like the 
                        time I told you to kiss Joey 
                        Coleman, the kid with the dead 
                        tooth. You can’t have a baby 
                        because I’m having one too and I 
                        “told you to.” 

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s not what I meant.

                                 KATE
                        You need to grow up, Nikki. And 
                        you need to do it fast. You’re 
                        about to be a mom.

           Kate leaves, the crowd of women follow. Nikki finally 
           lets go and cries. 
           Trish peeks around the corner, approaches Nikki.

                                 TRISH
                        So happy you could make it. Here’s 
                        your party favor.

           Trish hands her a treat bag and leaves.

           Nikki opens it: It’s a T-Shirt with Pink’s face on it 
           that says “Kate Andrews’ Baby Shower: Let’s Get This 
           Party Started!”

           Nikki cries even harder.

           INT. NIKKI’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Nikki lies in bed eating pickles while Danny’s ear is 
           glued to her stomach, listening to the baby.

                                 NIKKI
                        Maybe she’s right.

                                 DANNY
                        She’s not right! Pink’s best song 
                        was “Just Like a Pill.” Everybody 
                        knows that.

                                 NIKKI
                        No. Maybe she’s right about me not 
                        being ready to be a mom.

                                 DANNY
                        You’re gonna be an amazing mom!

                                 NIKKI
                        How do you know that?

                                 DANNY
                        I just do!

                                 NIKKI
                        I haven’t...I haven’t had that 
                        “moment” yet though. You know?

                                 DANNY
                        What moment?

                                 NIKKI
                        The moment where I really feel 
                        like I’m a mother. Where I feel 
                        connected to my baby. Some women 
                        get it the first time they see 
                        that positive pregnancy test.

                        Some women get it the first time 
                        they see their sonogram. Some 
                        women get it when they feel the 
                        baby kick for the first time. I 
                        still haven’t had it. What if I 
                        never have it? What if I keep 
                        waiting for it and waiting for it, 
                        and it never comes? I’ll just be 
                        this sad, desperate woman trying 
                        to be something she’s not.

                                 DANNY
                                 (beat)
                        Did you know that when you’re 
                        pregnant your heart literally 
                        grows in size?

                                 NIKKI
                        Now’s not the time for you to 
                        recite your pregnancy facts.

                                 DANNY
                        Hear me out. Your heart is 
                        actually growing, literally and 
                        figuratively. I think that your 
                        body and, spirit, or whatever, are 
                        getting bigger and bigger while 
                        you’re pregnant, right? And 
                        they’re preparing you so that the 
                        moment you have the baby you have 
                        the biggest heart you’ve ever had 
                        in your entire life. And when that 
                        little baby comes out, your heart 
                        is so big and you give it all the 
                        love you physically can. And 
                        that’s when you have that moment. 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (clearly moved)
                        That’s so dumb. 

                                 DANNY
                        Then why are you crying?

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m not. A bug flew into my eye.

                                 DANNY
                        Really? Did it fly into both eyes?

                                 NIKKI
                        It flew into the left one and then 
                        immediately flew back out and into 
                        the right one.
                                 DANNY
                        That’s weird, I’ve never seen bugs 
                        in your apartment.

                                 NIKKI
                        No I’ve actually been meaning to 
                        call an exterminator. Remind me to 
                        do that tomorrow.

           Danny smiles, snuggles up closer to her stomach.

           Kate lies on her couch reading Leah Remini’s book. She 
           hunches over in pain.

                                 KATE
                        Mike! Mike!!!

           Mike rushes in.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Something’s wrong.

           INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY

           Kate and Mike rush to the front desk, speak to a NURSE.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes hi, um, my wife, she’s in 
                        tremendous pain. Says it feels 
                        like -- what did you say it felt 
                        like, honey?
                                 KATE
                        LIKE AN ARMY OF RODENTS TRYING TO 
                        CLAW THEIR WAY OUT OF ME!!!

                                 MIKE
                        Yes. That. Army of rodents.

           Nurse comes to Kate’s side, helps her into a wheelchair.

                                 NURSE
                        Don’t worry, just try to relax and 
                        remain calm.

                                 KATE
                        “RELAX” AND “REMAIN CALM” ARE THE 
                        SAME THING!

                                 MIKE
                        She’s usually not this unpleasant.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM

           Kate squirms and winces in pain. A DOCTOR enters.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Kate, your blood tests indicate 
                        preeclampsia. We need to do an 
                        emergency C-section.

           Kate, terrified, looks to Mike for comfort.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s gonna be okay, babe. It will. 
                        What can I do? Do you want me to 
                        call the girls?

                                 KATE
                        No. Call Nikki.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

           Nikki waddles down the hallway as fast as she can. She 
           spots a wheelchair, sits in it. Danny pushes her and they

                        Mike!
           Just before the door closes, Mike waves. Nikki jumps up, 
           rushes to the door, but is stopped by the Nurse.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry, you can’t go in there.

                                 NIKKI
                        You have to let me in!

                        operating room.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mike is in there!

                                 NURSE
                        He’s the husband.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m...the...doula!!!

                                 NURSE
                                 (checking chart)
                        She does have a doula listed on 
                        here...

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes, yes, that’s me! Phoenix.

                                 NURSE
                        Come in, but hurry up.

           Nikki and the Nurse enter the O.R.

           A beat, and then the real Phoenix shows up.

                                 PHOENIX
                                 (to no one, everyone)
                        No! Am I too late?! I brought 
                        healing gemstones!

           INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM

           Mike comforts Kate, who lies on an operating table. 
           Doctor prepares for surgery.

                                 DOCTOR
                                 (to Nikki)
                        Who are you?

                            NIKKI
           I’m the doula.
                                                         NURSE
                                              She’s the doula.
                                 KATE
                        Hi.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hi.
                                 (in doula mode)
                        Now, just try to focus on your 
                        breathing.

                                 KATE
                        Right. In and out.

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes. In and out, that’s good.

                                 KATE
                        I’m so sorry. About the shower, 
                        about the gir--ladies. About 
                        everything. 

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s okay.

                                 KATE
                        I was just so scared. Weirdly I 
                        think I was more scared of 
                        everything than you were. Thought 
                        that if I hung out with other moms 
                        then maybe some of it would rub 
                        off and I’d know what I was doing. 
                        I didn’t need them though. I 
                        needed you.

           Nikki’s eyes well with tears. Everything she’s wanted to 
           hear for the past nine months.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m sorry too. You were right, I 
                        was jealous. I was jealous of the 
                        stupid “girls.” And thought since 
                        you were starting your own family 
                        you didn’t need me anymore.

                                 KATE
                        You’ll always be my family.

           Kate and Nikki smile at one another, hold hands.

                                 NIKKI
                        And it was driving me crazy that 
                        your pregnancy was going so much 
                        better than mine.
                                 KATE
                        I have a confession to make. I 
                        actually had pica...

                                 NIKKI
                        Like where you eat weird things?!

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. I was craving hair so badly. 
                        Couldn’t get enough. Cut a good 
                        chunk of my own off. Coughed up 
                        hairballs every day I ate so damn 
                        much of it.

           Nikki can’t believe it. Looks to Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s true. I had to hide all the 
                        combs.

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s the best thing I’ve ever 
                        heard.
                                 (beat)
                        I love you.

                                 KATE
                        I love you too.

           CLOSE ON the Nurse, confused. What kind of doula is she?

                                 NURSE
                        Phoenix?...

           No response.

                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        Phoenix???

           Still no response.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey Phoenix...

                                 NIKKI
                        That’s me, right! Yes?

                                 NURSE
                                 (looks at chart)
                        It says here you’re the one 
                        recording the birth. Now’s about 
                        that time.
                                 NIKKI
                        Right...yes.

           Nikki moves closer to the action, records on her phone, 
           looking through her fingers. Trying so hard not to look.

           A BABY CRIES. Mike and Kate kiss, embrace. Nikki gives 
           them both a thumb’s up, still hiding behind her fingers.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM - LATER

           Danny and Nikki enter Kate’s room to officially visit.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hiiii! Can we meet her?!

                                 KATE
                        Of course.
                                 (hands baby over)
                        Baby Alice, meet your Aunt Nikki.

           Nikki takes BABY ALICE in her arms. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Hi sweetie.

           Nikki gently rocks her back and forth. She’s a natural. 
           Alice gives a content little COO.

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Did you hear that?!?!

                                 KATE
                        She likes you!!!

                                 DANNY
                        She’s so freakin tiny. Look at 
                        her, she’s like the size of my 
                        freakin hand.

           He tries to compare her to his hand by putting his hand 
           over her entire face/body.

                                 KATE
                        You don’t need to do that.

           Nikki hands Baby Alice back to Kate.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hold on, I have to pee, but I want 
                        her back as soon as I’m done!

           Nikki heads for the bathroom and then--
                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

           A WET SPOT on the floor.

                                 NIKKI
                        I pissed myself! -- Wait but I 
                        still feel like I have to pee. 
                        That’s weird.

                                 KATE
                        Nik...

           Nikki GASPS. Danny runs out of the room.

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        Could we get some help in here?! 
                        We’re having a baby!

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m not due for another two weeks!

                                 KATE
                        Maybe the baby’s in a hurry to 
                        meet their best friend Alice.

           Nikki smiles. Just then a Nurse (same as before) enters 
           with a wheelchair.

                                 NURSE
                        Someone having a baby?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes, I am!

                                 NURSE
                        You! Remind me of your name so I 
                        can get your chart.

                                 NIKKI
                        Nicole Dawson.

                                 NURSE
                        I thought it was Phoenix?

                                 NIKKI
                        Phoenix is...my nickname.

                                 NURSE
                                 (beat)
                        You’re not a doula, are you?
                                 NIKKI
                        OF COURSE I’M NOT A DOULA!!!!!

                                 NURSE
                        Let’s get you a room.

           The Nurse begins to wheel her out.

                                 NIKKI
                        Wait! Can she come?!

                                 NURSE
                        Ma’am, this woman just went under 
                        extensive surgery. She can’t walk. 
                        She needs rest.

                                 KATE
                        No! I can come!

                                 NURSE
                        Ma’am, you shouldn’t get up.

                                 DANNY
                        I can wheel you, if you want.

           They all pathetically look at the Nurse. Please?

                                 NURSE
                        Fine. But be careful!

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

           The Nurse pushes Nikki while Danny pushes Kate. Nikki and 
           Kate hold hands.

           INT. NIKKI’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           The Doctor and Nurses prepare for labor. Nikki is in full 
           panic mode, breathing heavily.

           Danny stands to Nikki’s left, holding her hand, Kate sits 
           to Nikki’s right, in her wheelchair, coaching her.

                                 KATE
                        You’ve got this! You’re doing 
                        great!

                                 NIKKI
                        I need drugs. 
                                 DOCTOR
                        The baby’s crowning already. You 
                        need to start pushing.

                                 NIKKI
                        No drugs?! Why is this so rushed?! 
                        What is this, the last season of 
                        Lost?!

                                 DANNY
                        You can do this!

                                 NIKKI
                        No I can’t. FUCK THIS HURTS!!!!

                                 KATE
                        Just breathe. It’s gonna be over 
                        soon. Keep breathing.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (fully crying)
                        I don’t want to shit.

                                 KATE
                        You’re not gonna shit.

                                 NIKKI
                        Yes I am. I know I am. I’m gonna 
                        shit and they’re all gonna see it.

                                 KATE
                        Don’t worry about that. Just focus 
                        on the baby.

                                 NIKKI
                        I haven’t shit myself since tenth 
                        grade. I don’t want to ruin that 
                        streak.

                                 DANNY
                        Tenth?...

                                 NIKKI
                        Can you guys just knock me out? 
                        Give me some anesthesia or 
                        something, and you just take it 
                        from there, doc?

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s not really a possibility. 
                        You’re doing great, give me a big 
                        push in three, two, one, PUSH!

           Nikki WAILS IN PAIN as she pushes.
                                 NIKKI
                        Did I shit? I can’t tell if I 
                        shit. It feels like I might’ve.

                                 DOCTOR
                        No, you didn’t. Let’s rest for a 
                        few until the next push.

                                 NIKKI
                        I can’t do this, Kate. I can’t be 
                        a mom. I’m not ready for the 
                        haircut.

                                 KATE
                        What haircut?

                                 NIKKI
                        The short, spiky one. With the 
                        chunky highlights. I’m not ready 
                        for it. I still have a few more 
                        years of long hair. Don’t I??? 
                        Don’t I?!?!?

                                 KATE
                        Of course you do! You don’t ever 
                        have to get that haircut! I 
                        promise! Just breathe.

                                 NIKKI
                        My vagina’s never gonna be the 
                        same. It’s gonna be so fucked up. 
                        It’s gonna look like an Arby’s 
                        roast beef and cheddar sandwich.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, I love those beef and 
                        cheddars!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Let’s try to push again.

                                 NIKKI
                        Don’t shit, don’t shit, don’t 
                        shit, don’t shit.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Good job, we’re almost there.

                                 DANNY
                        You’re doing great, Nik. 

           More heavy breathing and pushing.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Here we go...

                                 DANNY
                        Can I see?!

           Danny starts to go towards the baby, then--

                                 NIKKI
                        NO!!! YOU STAY UP HERE!!!!!

                                 KATE
                        You got this. You’re so close.

                                 DANNY
                        So close! Almost there!

                                 DOCTOR
                        Push...

           Everything seems to GO SILENT. It’s just Nikki, pushing 
           as hard as she can. CLOSE ON Nikki as she gives one last 
           excruciating push. And then--

           A BABY cries. Nikki cries. Danny cries. Kate cries. 

           The Nurse places the Baby on Nikki’s chest.

                                 NURSE
                        It’s a girl.

           Nikki cries even harder.

           Danny kisses the top of Nikki’s head. Kate lays her head 
           on Nikki’s arm. A long, tender moment. 

                                 NIKKI
                                 (to Danny)
                        I think I just had “the moment.”

           Nikki and Danny smile. He kisses her and the Baby.

           Beat. Everything calms down. And then:

                                 NIKKI (CONT'D)
                        Did I shit?

           Kate wheels herself down to the foot of the bed to check.

                                 KATE
                        Oh yeah. Big time.
           INT. HOSPTIAL - HALLWAY

           Sandy celebrates with a cigar, tries handing more out to 
           STRANGERS. A NURSE nearly tackles her.

           INT. NIKKI’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Danny holds the Baby, totally in love. Nikki wakes up, 
           sees them, and smiles.

                                 NIKKI
                        You two look good together.

           Danny lifts his head REVEALING a tear-stained cheek. 

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
                        I can’t stop crying. She’s just so 
                        perfect.

                                 NIKKI
                        I know.

           Danny moves closer, sits on the side of Nikki’s bed. They 
           both stare at the baby, then press their foreheads 
           against one another, nuzzling.

           Nikki looks up into Danny’s eyes, wanting him to kiss 
           her. Danny slowly leans in, then stops.

                                 DANNY
                        What about what you said? That we 
                        can’t try to date and raise a baby 
                        at the same time? That it’s like 
                        doing anal before losing your 
                        virginity.

                                 NIKKI
                        Don’t say “anal” around the baby.

           She pulls him in, kisses him hard.

                                 DANNY
                                 (absolutely giddy)
                        You sure?

                                 NIKKI
                        Positive.

           Nikki takes the baby, while Danny snuggles up to them.

                                 DANNY
                        ...Move in with me.
                                 NIKKI
                        What?!

                                 DANNY
                        You two should move in with me. I 
                        want to be able to help out at 
                        three in the morning. I want to be 
                        there when she says her first 
                        word. I just want to be with the 
                        both of you every single second. 
                        If not, I’d miss you. And I don’t 
                        wanna miss a thing. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Are you serious? And are you aware 
                        that you’re quoting Aerosmith, or 
                        is it subconscious? 

                                 DANNY
                        I know what you’re thinking, I’ve 
                        thought about it too. Having our 
                        bedroom downstairs and the nursery 
                        upstairs is a little scary at 
                        first, but all the baby books say 
                        that it’s completely normal. And 
                        if it really bothers you after a 
                        while, we can move the master 
                        bedroom to the spare bedroom 
                        upstairs to be on the same floor.

                                 NIKKI
                        Upstairs?...

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah!

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m sorry, but I just assumed you 
                        shared a loft with like five other 
                        dudes. You have a two-level 
                        apartment?

                                 DANNY
                        Well it’s a brownstone. It’s 
                        actually four levels.

                                 NIKKI
                        What.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah!

                                 NIKKI
                        But...how?! You’re a dog walker!
                                 DANNY
                        Dog walker?

                                 NIKKI
                        Don’t you work for Wag?

                                 DANNY
                        No not Wag, Wogz! The company I 
                        own! Wigs for dogs!

                                 NIKKI
                        WHAT?! You own a dog wig 
                        company?!...that’s successful?!

                                 DANNY
                        Very. I shouldn’t tell you this, 
                        but Elon Musk just signed on as an 
                        investor. 
                                 (checks phone)
                        Actually, hang on one sec. I 
                        haven’t been responding to any 
                        work emails. Let me just get this.
                                 (typing and talking)
                        Love this one, but let’s make it 
                        slightly longer and more of a 
                        platinum blonde, less ashy. 
                        Approved with those updates.

           He shows Nikki a picture on his phone. A small, unamused 
           looking DOG WEARING A BLONDE WIG WITH BANGS.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Cute, right?

                                 NIKKI
                        I don’t even know what to say...

                                 DANNY
                        Say yes.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (beat)
                        Live in a brownstone with my rich 
                        boyfriend and be the queen of his 
                        dog wig empire?! Hell yes!!!
                                 (kisses him)
                        Hey wait. If you’re rich, why did 
                        we always hang out at my shitty 
                        apartment and not yours?!

                                 DANNY
                        Yours is walking distance to a 
                        Taco Bell.

                        The closest one to me is at least 
                        a 15 minute train ride.

           Nikki smiles at him, then at the baby. They kiss.

           INT. NIKKI’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           PAN around Nikki’s room -- flowers, balloons, cards, 
           Danny sleeping in a chair. Nikki wakes up.

           INT. KATE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           Nikki, now in Kate’s room, taps her awake.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Nikki pushes Kate down the hallway in her wheelchair.

           BY NURSERY

           Outside the nursery, Nikki and Kate watch over their 
           girls, nameplates marking ALICE ANDREWS and ANNIE DAWSON. 
           Both stare in awe, then:

                                 NIKKI
                        They really are perfect.

                                 KATE
                        I know.
                                 (beat)
                        I hope they’re just like us.

           Kate smiles at Nikki. Nikki smiles back. Just as the 
           MUSIC SWELLS --

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           BY NURSERY - SAME AS BEFORE

           Nikki and Kate smile at each other one more time.

           Nikki begins wheeling Kate back down the hallway. Kate 
           puts her hand on top of Nikki’s. They go farther down the 
           hallway, getting smaller and smaller. 

           Music FADES OUT as they talk.

                                 KATE
                        So. Did you look?

                                 NIKKI
                        Yep. It’s bad. 

                                 KATE
                        Not like a beautiful flower?

                                 NIKKI
                        Like a flower with way too many 
                        petals. Big, fat, loose petals.

                                 KATE
                        Oh no.
                                 NIKKI
                        Like a double cheeseburger, turned 
                        on its side. But the kind where 
                        they don’t pack it tight enough, 
                        and all the lettuce and cheese 
                        sort of hangs out.

                                 KATE
                        I get the idea.

                                 NIKKI
                        You know what it looks like? It 
                        looks like Predator’s mouth. 
                        Except without the teeth. At least 
                        less teeth.

                                 KATE
                        I really don’t need to hear anymore.

           FADE TO BLACK

           CHYRON: “ONE YEAR LATER”

           EXT. KATE AND MIKE’S BACKYARD - DAY

           Balloons, streamers, cake, and a CLOWN. All smiles and 
           laughs at the girls’ joint 1st birthday party.

           Alice and Annie sit in a combined two-seater. Danny and 
           Sandy play peek-a-boo while Mike puts party hats on them.

           Kate and Nikki carry out a cake and set it in front of 
           the girls. The crowd sings “Happy Birthday.”

           Mike, Danny, Kate, and Nikki all help blow out the 
           candles. Alice and Annie messily eat cake, getting it all 
           over themselves and all over each other. They giggle.

           “The Girls” approach, THEIR KIDS in tow.

                                 HEATHER
                        Hey birthday, girls!!! 

                                 TRISH
                        You two are just darling!

                                 KATE
                        So glad you could make it.
                                 BETH
                        Pretty soon the girls are gonna be 
                        old enough to have little 
                        playdates with Brayden!

           As Beth says this, Nikki protectingly steps in front of 
           the highchair.

                                 NIKKI
                                 (sotto)
                        Hopefully not too soon...

                                 HEATHER
                        I hope you two don’t mind, but we 
                        didn’t bring a present --

                            NIKKI
                                                          KATE
           What?...
                                              Oh please, don’t worry 
                                              about it.

                                 BETH
                        Instead, we’ve arranged a little 
                        surprise...

           Nikki and Kate look at each other at the exact moment. 
           “What now?”

           REVEAL Pink on the ROOF, mic in hand, harnessed up. She 
           braces for a JUMP.

           Nikki face-palms. Kate laughs.

           THE END.
