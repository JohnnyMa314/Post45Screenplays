           FADE IN

           EXT. ROUTE 40 - NIGHT

           A drab suburban highway dotted by pawn shops, tattoo parlors, 
           tarot readers, auto shops, a Masonic lodge, McDonald’s. 

           A place that used to be somewhere. 

           SUPER: 
           NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE
           NOVEMBER, 1987

           DIANE ELLIOT (40s) wearing only a light Members Only jacket, 
           walks along, cradling a foil-wrapped PLATE. Face set.

           She passes a SIGN: 
           ROUTE 40
           DELAWARE: HOME OF TAX-FREE SHOPPING

           She turns, sticks her THUMB out. Cars whizz by.

           It’s sleeting now, the heavens spitting on her. She breathes 
           on her ungloved fingers.

           She walks further. Turns, tries again. Finally:

           A DARK VAN slows, pulls onto the shoulder, near the woods.

           She runs over, hops in.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Plate on her lap, she rubs her hands together. Looks over.

                                 DIANE
                        Thank you. It’s fucking freezing.

           A MAN in the shadows, his face unknowable.

                                 MAN
                        How much?

           Deadened voice. An animal pretending to be human.
                                 DIANE
                        Oh... I don’t... I don’t do that no more. 
                        Just need a ride home. You know where 
                        Brookmont Farms is? 

                                 MAN
                        Yeah. 
                             (as he pulls out on the 
                              highway --)
                        Don’t usually pick up normies.

           He keeps assessing her. Like he’s deciding something. 

           Diane grows uneasy. Tries to make out his features. 

                                 DIANE
                        You live near here?

                                 MAN
                        Yeah. 

           Beat.

                                 DIANE
                        Been here my whole life. Sometimes I 
                        think I shoulda gotten out after high 
                        school, you know? Like maybe I could’ve 
                        done something more --

                                 MAN
                        Be better if you didn’t talk. 

                                 DIANE
                        Oh... ok. 
                             (beat, something outside)
                        That was the turn. 

                                 MAN
                        Ain’t going that way. 

           Diane’s worried now, clutching the plate. 

                                 DIANE
                        Look, if you wanted a quick one... I know 
                        that’s the price sometimes. 

           Long beat.

                                 MAN
                        Yeah. All right.

           He slows down, pulls over to the shoulder. Black woods sway 
           in the wind.  
           Diane, unsteady, puts the plate down on the floor. Head down, 
           she breathes. Readying herself. She didn’t want this. 

           Comes up, just as...

           The man swings a HAMMER at her...

           Diane screams, dodges it, as the hammer comes down on the 
           inside van door... 

           She covers her head, as lifts his hand again, fumbles for the 
           door handle...

           OUTSIDE

           She falls, stands, sprints into the woods.

           Footsteps behind her. HIM. 

                                 DIANE
                             (muttering)
                        No, no, no.... 

           The woods are too dark. Wet. Branches slash her face. She 
           tries to feel out in front of her. Can’t see. Can’t get 
           traction on the icy mud. 

           The footsteps gain on her.

           ... she slips, falls to the ground and...

           ... he’s on top of her now...

           She screams as he brings the HAMMER down on her -- one, two, 
           three times. 

           Until she’s silent.

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           SUPER: One hour earlier

           Further up Route 40. The classier end. 

           Looks like a World War II bomb shelter, by design. Holes in 
           the walls and piles of sand bags all around. To one side, a 
           replica CANNON. To the other, a replica DC-3 PLANE.    

           A sign out front: 
           AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT
           Fine steaks and spirits in a World War II atmosphere
           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Hectic night. WAIT STAFF flit about. SOUS-CHEFS chop and 
           mince, just barely missing their own fingers.

           CLOSE-UP on a WAITER (20s), TRAY hoisted above his head. 
           Sweat coursing down his face. Desperate. 

                                 WAITER
                        Pam?

           PAM SPINELLI (40s) turns, stance like a headmaster in an all-
           boys school. Red hair, red nails. Face like she means it. She 
           always means it.

           She dabs the waiter’s sweat. Adjusts his tie. Smiles at him.

                                 PAM
                        Good as new.

           Grateful, he backs through the swinging doors of the kitchen.

                                 BUSBOY (O.S.)
                        Pam? 

           She turns again. A BUSBOY (20s) holds out a clipboard.

                                 BUSBOY (cont'd)
                        For the flower delivery.

           As she signs -- 

                                 PAULIE (O.S.)
                        Maestro.

           PAULIE DUBOIS (50s), Head Chef, beefy and hairy, grins out 
           from behind a steaming grill. Mimes smoking a cigarette. 

                                 PAM
                        Five minutes.

           She makes her way through the kitchen.

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Diane dances back and forth at the back door. Breath visible. 

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        This isn’t a charity.

           Diane turns. Pam stands there, face serious. Foiled-wrapped 
           plate in hand. 
           Diane flutters her eyelashes, hands cupped upward. 

                                 DIANE
                             (terrible British accent)
                        Please sir, may I have some more?

           Pam laughs, demeanor breaking. Her goofy friend.

                                 DIANE/PAM
                             (singing terribly)
                        Food, glorious food!

                                 PAM
                             (re: handing over foiled-
                              wrapped plate)
                        Your favorite tonight, Oliver Twist. 

                                 DIANE
                             (taking it)
                        The meatloaf with the hot sauce? Pam, I 
                        love you.

                                 PAM
                        It’s nothing. 
                             (off Diane’s serious face)
                        What?

                                 DIANE
                        Been a shit year. If it weren’t for you, 
                        I’d be... dunno. Probably still hooking.

                                 PAM
                        Shh.

           Alarmed, Pam looks behind her: in the distance, a busy 
           kitchen. No one paying attention.

                                 DIANE
                        What do I care if they know?

                                 PAM
                        You should care. Keep that locked in. Or 
                        it might come back to bite you.

                                 DIANE
                        C’mon --

                                 PAM
                             (beat, noticing)
                        Where’s your car?

           LATER, INSIDE

           Pam shuts the door, leans against it. Haunted, faraway look. 
           She shakes it off. Back to work.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, MAIN DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Candlelight, understated War World II photos on the wall, 
           jazz music. Where people go to have a special evening.

           Pam circles the room, assessing. People dressed in their 
           finest. Cultured, rich people.

           Everything perfect except: a CLOTH NAPKIN on the floor. Pam 
           discreetly picks it up and stuffs it under arm.  

           Suddenly, LOUD VOICES at the front of the restaurant. 

                                 MARIA (O.S.)
                        ... I’m sorry, sir, but our dress code 
                        requires a dinner jacket.

           Pam, concerned, moves toward the entryway.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, HOST STAND - CONTINUOUS

           The hostess, MARIA (30s), meek and nervous, stands before a 
           PAUNCHY COUPLE who look straight out of Atlantic City: faces 
           too tan, hair too high, clothes too tight.

                                 MARIA
                        You’re welcome to borrow one we have --

                                 COUNCILMAN VAN DYKE
                        A used jacket? You have any idea who I 
                        am, honey? I’m Bruce Van Dyke. 

                                 MARIA
                             (realization, panic)
                        Councilman. I am so sorry --

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Jackets are required.  

           They turn to see: Pam, unswayed.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Pam Spinelli. Manager. 

           Her hand, out. He doesn’t take it.

                                 COUNCILMAN VAN DYKE
                        I’ve eaten in places you wouldn’t 
                        believe. With people who wipe their asses 
                        with twenty dollar bills --
                                 PAM
                         -- sir, please keep your voice down --

                                 VAN DYKE
                        -- I never once wore a jacket. Know why? 
                        Cause a fucking jacket doesn’t give you 
                        class.

                                 PAM 
                        You’re right. A jacket won’t help you.

           Shock wave through everyone. As he fumbles with his coat --  

                                 COUNCILMAN VAN DYKE
                        I can see right through the fancy clothes 
                        and fake hair, lady. You’re trash, plain 
                        and simple. Just a trashy Delaware cunt. 

           Maria’s eyes bulge. Pam gives nothing. Van Dyke and his lady 
           leave in a bluster. 

                                 MARIA
                        Pam, that was --

                                 PAM
                        Never get down on your knees for people 
                        like that. Ok?

           Maria swallows, nods. Ok.

           DOWN THE HALLWAY

           Pam catches her reflection in a VINTAGE MIRROR. Stops. Pushes 
           away a stray hair, lifts her chin. Trying for dignity. 

           The strand of hair falls again.  

           She breathes out. It hit harder than it was supposed to.

           INT. MISTER DONUT SHOP - SAME NIGHT  

           A mom-and-pop franchise donut shop. Retro-style bar stools at 
           the counter. 

           NIKKI SPINELLI (16), a frizzy ponytail growing out of the 
           back of her Mister Donut visor, picks through the sad, end-of-
           day donuts. Full name on a bright name tag: NICOLE.

           She inspects each donut through her GLASSES: mangled ones in 
           a WHITE BAG, decent ones in a BLACK BAG. A careful, studious 
           teenager. 

           A KNOCK on the glass window. Nikki looks up.
           A SUBURBAN DAD (30s) implores her. Please? He’s holding the 
           hand of a LITTLE GIRL (9).

                                 NIKKI
                             (loud)
                        We’re closed. 

           He makes a sad face. Pretty please? 

           A beat, and Nikki softens. She goes to unlock the door.

           EXT. MISTER DONUT SHOP - LATER

           Nikki sits in front of the dark, locked store. Waiting.

           EXT. ROUTE 40 - LATER

           Nikki huffs along the busy highway, a BLACK TRASH BAG at her 
           back. The cars whizz by, some of them too close for comfort.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE - LATER 

           Small townhome filled with warmth: wall art, photos of Pam 
           and Nikki throughout the years.

           Nikki plunks the bag down. It opens, revealing DONUTS. 

           She opens the fridge. On a plate of chicken and broccoli, a 
           note: “I’LL KNOW IF YOU EAT THE DONUTS FIRST. xo, Mom”

           Nikki smiles, closes the fridge. Notices a LIGHT blinking on 
           the ANSWERING MACHINE. Hits it. 

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                             (on answering machine)
                        Oh my god, Nikki. Did you have to walk 
                        home like some sort of trash bag Santa? 
                        My brother got detention again because 
                        he’s gonna wind up in prison -- 
                             (sound of a SMACK)
                        Ow! Fuck! I hate you. Not you, Nikki. I’m 
                        so sorry I didn’t pick you up. But! I got 
                        the details on the party. Call me? 

           Nikki takes a beat, deciding. Lifts the cradle of the PHONE. 

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK LOADING DOCK - LATER

           Pam steps out into the cool night air. Paulie sits on a 
           crate, holds out a freshly-lit cigarette.
                                 PAULIE
                        That was more than five minutes. 

           She takes the cigarette, drags on it. Hands it back to him.

                                 PAM
                        Don’t ask.  

                                 PAULIE
                        Wasn’t gonna. 

           Smiling. An old, easy friendship. But then Pam shifts, grows 
           nervous. Needs something.

                                 PAM
                        You talk to the partners yet?

           He hesitates, lifts the cigarette with two beefy fingers.

                                 PAULIE
                        Not yet.

                                 PAM
                        Paulie... 

                                 PAULIE
                        The new place isn’t open for another 
                        month or so. What’s your rush? 

                                 PAM
                        You said you would.

                                 PAULIE
                        You wanna get away from me that bad? 

                                 PAM
                        I love you, Paulie, but I need to get off 
                        the night shift. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Everybody wants the general manager job 
                        at a nice lunch place. Good money, good 
                        hours. You know these kids with fancy 
                        hospitality degrees are running 
                        restaurants straight outta school now?

                                 PAM
                        You saying they’re better than me? 

                                 PAULIE
                        No. I’m saying shit’s real competitive. 
                        Me recommending you for the job is... 
                        it’s my neck too, Pam.
           Pam sits down on a crate across from him. Squares to him. 

                                 PAM
                        Ten years, Paulie. I’ve given everything 
                        to this job. Ten years of missed homework 
                        and goodnight kisses and... 
                             (beat)
                        Nikki’s starting to look at colleges. In 
                        two years, she’ll be off. Not mine 
                        anymore. I look at these parents who go 
                        to normal jobs with normal hours who stop 
                        by soccer practice after school. And I 
                        think... I’m tired of living in the dark. 
                        Haven’t I worked hard enough to have what 
                        they have? 

           Paulie crushes the cigarette. Looks at her.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Haven’t I?   

           Her face, vulnerable. Really wanting to know. Before he can 
           answer, LAUGHTER in the distance. They look over to see --

           The TRUCK STOP along Route 40. A smiling WOMAN (20s) hoists 
           herself into a huge trailer truck. A sex worker. 

           Solemn beat.

                                 PAULIE
                        Imagine needing to do that. Such a shame.

           Pam straightens. Sniffs, almost haughty.

                                 PAM
                        The shame is that they don’t have any.

           INT. MILES’ UNMARKED CAR, GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

           SUPER: One week later

           Candy wrappers, empty soda cans, and balled-up paper strewn 
           across the front and back seats. 

           MILES STANTON (40s) sleeps, feet up on the dash, out to the 
           world. Drool trailing down his unshaven face. 

           The SCANNER crackles, alive.

                                 POLICE DISPATCHER
                             (over scanner)
                        Detective Stanton, please copy. 
           He stirs. Blinks awake. Reaches for the receiver, and -- 

           Turns down the volume. 

           Closes his eyes, gets comfy again. 

                                 POLICE DISPATCHER (cont'd)
                             (lower volume)
                        ... we have a 10-67. Victim found near 
                        Route 40. Please copy.

           Miles pops up, scrambles for the receiver. It drops. 

                                 MILES
                        Shit. 
                             (into receiver)
                        Detective Stanton, copy.

           EXT. WOODS ALONG ROUTE 40 - LATER   

           The outskirts of the woods, where the dry grasses of winter 
           have sprung up. 

           A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (30s) stands looking down, handkerchief 
           covering his nose and mouth. 

           FOOTSTEPS crunch behind him. Someone with a LIMP: MILES. 

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Two teenagers called it in. Trying to 
                        find a make-out spot. Imagine being horny 
                        as shit and then BAM! Seeing this. I 
                        mean, where are her... her...? Fuck.

           Disgusted, he puts the handkerchief back up to his mouth.

           Miles crouches down, pulls out a TAPE RECORDER. 

                                 MILES
                             (into recorder)
                        Wrists and ankles bound. Mouth duct 
                        taped. Blunt force trauma to the head. 
                        Ligature marks around the neck. 
                             (beat)
                        Areolas removed. 

           Miles squints, recorder off. Pulls out a pair of TWEEZERS, 
           reaches for something at her foot. Holds up a BLUE FIBER, 
           puzzled. Seals it in a BAGGIE. 
                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        How many dead hookers is this now? Three?
                             (snort)
                        Somebody doesn’t like paying.

           Distaste on Miles' face as he stands. Doesn’t like this guy.

                                 MILES
                        Don’t think this one was hooking.

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        How the hell you know that?

                                 MILES
                        Her underwear. 

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                             (stare, realization)
                        Granny panties. Damn. That’s good, Miles. 

           Another PATROL CAR pulls up as Miles moves around the body. 

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (cont'd)
                        So I gotta know. Were you in the FBI? I 
                        heard you were, but then Branson said you 
                        didn’t get in cause of your, ah...
                             (re: the limp)
                        Your thing there. Your foot.

           Smile on Miles’ face. The smile of the tolerant.

                                 MILES
                        My foot, yeah. When I interviewed with 
                        the FBI, they asked me if I could get my 
                        foot back. I said, “Gee, I’m not sure. I 
                        lost it.”

                                 HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Shit. Where’d you lose it? 

                                 MILES
                        Your mom’s house.

           The patrolman makes a face. They turn as CHIEF SUSAN LANLEY 
           (60s), marches up. The sharpness of a woman in a man’s world.  

                                 MILES/HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
                        Chief.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                             (to patrolman)
                        Fuck outta here.
                             (to Miles)
                        Well?
           The patrolman sulks away. 

                                 MILES
                             (re: the body)
                        This guy definitely has a signature.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        You sure it’s one guy? 

                                 MILES
                        You want it to be more than one guy? 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Fuck. 

                                 MILES
                        Don’t think this one was hooking, though.

                                 CHIEF LANGLEY
                        So he’s breaking pattern?

                                 MILES
                        Dunno. Maybe he thought she was. Or maybe 
                        his pattern is just... women. 

                                 CHIEF LANGLEY
                        Fuck. We’ll need a task force, a hotline, 
                        the whole thing. The cost on this... I 
                        mean Jesus Christ, Miles, we have a...

                                 MILES
                        Problem.

           They stare at each other.

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

           INT. OUR LADY OF FATIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY 

           Soaring skylight, Jesus on a cross. Incense in the air. 
           CHURCHGOERS in fine clothes file out. 

           INT. CHURCH CONFESSIONAL - CONTINUOUS

           Pam sits in the semi-dark, staring ahead. Hands fidgety. 

                                 PAM
                        It’s been a week since my last 
                        confession. Let’s see. I cursed. Smoked. 
                        Maybe ten times? But only half. So, five. 
                        Five whole cigarettes. 
                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        It was six last time. Growing purer by 
                        the week.

           A chuckle, said in jest. But Pam turns sharply, wounded.

                                 PRIEST (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Anything else?

                                 PAM
                        No. 

           She’s somewhere faraway now, her head buzzing.

           EXT. SPINELLI CAR, CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATER

           Nikki leans up against the car, uses a compact mirror to 
           apply PINK LIP GLOSS. 

           Pam marches across the parking lot, digging for car keys. 
           Stops when she sees Nikki.

                                 PAM
                        No.

                                 NIKKI
                        You said not in church. 

                                 PAM
                        Don’t be a smart ass. Wipe it off.

           With an eye roll, Nikki wipes her lips with her hand. As Pam 
           fumbles with the lock --

                                 PAM  (cont'd)
                        You have the rest of your life to impress 
                        boys if that’s what you want. 

                                 NIKKI
                        It’s not for boys --

                                 PAM
                        I got news for you. Boys think everything 
                        is for them. 

           Finally gets the door open. They get in.

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Sullen mood as they drive down Route 40. An argument brewing.
                                 NIKKI
                        ... just a few college kids. But mostly 
                        kids from my class. 

                                 PAM
                        Where is it? 

                                 NIKKI
                        A house on Chapel Street. 

                                 PAM
                        Whose house?

                                 NIKKI
                        Some kid’s. I dunno. Just a house.

                                 PAM
                        That’s where those frat houses are. It’s 
                        a frat party. 

                                 NIKKI
                        No, I don’t think --

                                 PAM
                             (decided)
                        No, you can’t go.

                                 NIKKI
                        But why? Bryce will be with me. 

                                 PAM
                        Because --

           Pam trails, distracted by something outside. They pass half a 
           dozen COP CARS, lights flickering. 

           Near the woods, a COVERED BODY. MILES, standing over it.

           Nikki’s staring, curious. Pam speeds up, determined.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Because the world’s not safe for girls. 
                        Not today, and not tomorrow. 

                                 NIKKI
                             (sullen, sarcastic)
                        What about the day after that?

           They glance at each other, equally exasperated.

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

           Snow begins to fall, blanketing the world in purity.
           Pam stands at the back door, holding a FOIL-WRAPPED PLATE in 
           her hand, waiting. Steps outside. Growing concerned.

           A WAITRESS (20s) peers around the corner.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Pam. Someone here for you.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, HOST STAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Maria makes nervous eyes at Pam as a man emerges from the 
           shadows: MILES. He flashes his badge.

                                 MILES
                        Detective Miles Stanton, state police.

           Maria tries to lean in without being too obvious.

                                 PAM
                        Pam Spinelli.
                             (as they shake)
                        The linens need folding, Maria.

           Maria sulks away. Pam steps sideways, discreet, blocking the 
           dining room from seeing Miles.

           Miles fishes in his coat pocket, distracted. Pulling out 
           papers by the handful -- receipts, notes. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        How can I --

                                 MILES
                             (searching pocket)
                        Just a minute. I’m checking businesses 
                        near the truck stop --
                             (found it)
                        Ok. You ever see this woman in here?

           He holds up a BOOKING PHOTO of Diane Elliot. Pam, shocked, 
           hides it quick.

                                 PAM
                        No. What did she do?

                                 MILES
                        Your staff see her? Maybe with someone?

                                 PAM
                        No. 

                                 MILES
                        You wanna... maybe ask?
                                 PAM
                        Is that a booking photo?

                                 MILES
                        Yes.

                                 PAM
                        Only certain types are allowed through 
                        these doors.

           He stuffs the photo back in his pocket, amused by her 
           snobbery. Pulls out a NOTEPAD, starts writing. 

                                 MILES
                        I see. So not cops, for example.

                                 PAM
                        Maybe if they shave. 

           He scratches his unshaven jaw with the pen. Intrigued. 
           Glances down at her empty ring finger. Back up.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                             (brusque)
                        Is there anything else, detective? We’re 
                        very busy this evening. 

                                 MILES
                        Of course. If you hear anything...
                             (handing her his card, 
                              pointed)
                        From any type.

           She watches him limp away. Curiosity gets the best of her -- 

                                 PAM
                        Detective. What did she do?

           He turns back. Thought she understood.  

                                 MILES
                        She was murdered. 

           Pam doesn’t move even after he’s gone.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Back up against the wall, eyes wild, Pam searches the dark 
           for answers. She lets out air. A muffled cry. Can’t help it.

                                 PAULIE (O.S.)
                        Pam.
           She turns, her face smooth, placid. Smiles. She’s just fine.

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                             (excited)
                        You gotta try this lobster whip. C’mon.

           She follows him back out the kitchen. Back to work. 

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, PARKING LOT - LATE NIGHT

           The stars are bright, clear. Cold. 

           Pam dusts her car of the light snow. She waves as another CAR 
           drives away. She’s alone in the parking lot.

           She unlocks her car door, opens it. Pauses before getting in. 
           Glances across the way, to the truck stop. 

           She closes the car door without getting in.  

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           TRUCKERS with large guts pass in and out of a STORE. 

           A COWBOY TRUCKER (60s) stops before going inside. Handlebar 
           mustache. Cowboy hat. Gentle air. He smiles, interested in --

           Pam. 

           She stands underneath an awning, shivering in the cold. Feels 
           his eyes on her. Looks over. 

           A beat as her face hardens. She shakes her head. Hard no.

           Cowboy trucker realizes his mistake. Touches his hat, polite. 
           Goes inside.

           Across the lot, a SEX WORKER climbs out of a truck. Pam makes 
           a move to go. Steps back, losing her nerve. 

                                 TALL SEX WORKER (O.S.)
                        Gotta smoke?

           Pam turns. Short skirt, kohl eyes, no more than 21, standing 
           behind her. Rummaging in her purse.

                                 TALL SEX WORKER (cont'd)
                        Swear to god I had a ciggie in here.
                             (gives Pam a once-over)
                        A real redhead, huh? Fancy. Men love 
                        redheads. Makes ‘em feel like they’re 
                        getting something special. 
                                 TALL SEX WORKER (cont'd)
                                 TALL SEX WORKER (cont'd)
                             (beat, found it)
                        Ah-ha! Knew it.

           The woman produces a cigarette from her purse, triumphant. 
           When she looks up, Pam’s rifling in her own purse. 

                                 PAM
                        How many dates do you have tonight? 
                        Seven, eight? And what does your daddy 
                        take? Sixty percent? Here.

           She frantically pulls a few ones, fives, a twenty. Not a lot. 
           Not enough. Extends everything in a messy stack. 

           The sex worker, confused, doesn’t take it. 

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        You a cop?

                                 PAM
                        No. I need to know what happened to my 
                        friend.

           The sex worker stares at Pam, cigarette hanging.

           EXT. HALFWAY MOTEL PARKING LOT - SAME NIGHT, LATER 

           A roach motel with stained curtains. Dilapidated and creepy. 

           KATIE (20s) stumbles out of a room as though shoved. The door 
           slams behind her. 

           Straps falling off her shoulders, skirt barely on. Shoeless. 
           She collects herself and turns around. Bangs on the door. 

                                 KATIE
                        Asshole! Gimme my shoes! 

           LIGHTS go on in adjacent rooms. CURTAINS lift, drop. 

                                 KATIE (cont'd)
                        I’ll find you, you shithead, and I’ll --

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Boyfriend?

           Katie turns. A MAN, standing in the shadows. Dead voice.

                                 KATIE
                        This asshole? He wishes. 
                                 MAN
                             (disappointed)
                        So you’re... a working girl. 

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah? 
                             (shouting, banging door)
                        And he owes me money!

                                 MAN
                             (beat)
                        How much?

                                 KATIE
                        Thirty bucks.

                                 MAN
                             (beat)
                        Come to the front desk. I’ll add it to 
                        his bill and cash you out. 

                                 KATIE
                        You work here?

           She’s trying to see him through the dark.

                                 MILES (PRELAP)
                        Cause of death is strangulation.

           INT. POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 

           Miles, now shaved, stands in front of about a DOZEN COPS. 
           Behind him, a whiteboard with PHOTOS of the three victims.

                                 MILES
                        First injury is blunt force trauma to the 
                        head. He waits for them to wake up, 
                        then... all the rest. 

                                 COP 1
                        Those are all premortem injuries? So he’s 
                        just...?

                                 MILES
                        Torturing them.  

           There’s a murmur around the room. Shock.

                                 COP 2
                        Fingerprints? Footprints?
                                 MILES
                             (head shake)
                        He’s careful. Which means he’ll do it 
                        again. Tomorrow. Tonight. Now. The longer 
                        we take, the better chance he has of 
                        getting away with it. All eyes are on us. 

                                 COP 1
                        Us?

           Something catches Miles’ eye in the hallway: Chief Langley, 
           walking a MAN WITH A WALRUS MUSTACHE into a room. 

           INT. POLICE STATION, CHIEF’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Miles stands in front of Chief Lanley and the man with the 
           mustache, AGENT PENDERGAST (60s). Midwestern vibe. Slow and 
           deliberate. Even the way he stretches out his hand to Miles.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Howdy. Richard Pendergast, FBI. 

                                 MILES 
                        Miles. 
                             (shaking his hand)
                        Susan?

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        We can’t do this on our own, Miles. 
                        Tracking this sick motherfucker, it takes 
                        people who can think like him.
                             (to Pendergast)
                        No offense. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Oh gosh. None taken. Public’ll want 
                        answers. Press’ll be up your -- pardon my 
                        language -- keisters. Not just local, 
                        either. 60 Minutes, 20/20. It’ll put 
                        Delaware on the map. 

                                 MILES
                        We’re already on the map.
                             (to Chief Lanley, with 
                              fire)
                        I can do this.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        I’m not letting this fucker mess up my 
                        pension because I was politely invited to 
                        “retire early.” You play nice, Miles, 
                        could be a promotion in it for you.
                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Gosh. Last thing I want is you thinking 
                        you’re getting benched here, detective. 
                        Man with your history, I’m sure you’ve 
                        cracked a nut or two. 
                             (looking up the hall)
                        Ah super. We’ll set up in here, fellas. 

           A DOZEN FBI AGENTS in dark suits march up the hall toward 
           Pendergast, who gestures to an empty room across the way. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                             (to Miles)
                        We’d love your help, detective.

           Put out, Miles can’t answer as he watches them file past. 

           INT. POLICE STATION, EVIDENCE LOCKER

           FBI AGENTS move in and out, pulling down NUMBERED BOXES as 
           Miles watches, all nervous energy. 

           As an AGENT passes, Miles pulls a BOX from his arms.

                                 MILES
                        Oops. Forgot to log this one. Good thing 
                        you guys are here now. 

           Beat. Not going to fight it, the agent moves on.

           Miles sets the box down. Looks around. No one paying 
           attention. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        My mistake.

           With a sleight of hand, he stuffs the BAGGIE OF BLUE FIBERS 
           from the box into his pocket. No one the wiser.

           He hands the box back to another passing AGENT.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Guess I’m more competent than I thought.

           INT. POLICE LAB - AFTERNOON

           CHUCK (30s), white coat, listens to a WALKMAN as he looks at 
           slides under a MICROSCOPE. He sits up, makes a notation, 
           grimaces, plays a little air guitar. 

           Miles walks up behind him. Pulls up one of the ears of the 
           walkman, yells:
                                 MILES
                        Chuck.

           Chuck jumps. Pulls off the walkman, heavy metal blasting. 

                                 CHUCK
                        Fuck me, Miles.

                                 MILES
                        Later. Listen --

                                 CHUCK
                        You shaved. You look weird as shit. 

                                 MILES
                        Thank you. Have something for you.

           Miles dangles the baggie with the BLUE FIBERS. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Need to know what these are.

                                 CHUCK
                             (taking the baggie)
                        Hm. Maybe from a sweater? Or a dog? 

                                 MILES
                        Sure. A blue dog.

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s called a hypothesis.

           Chuck pulls his headphones back on, middle fingers extended. 
           Miles stops him.

                                 MILES
                        No paperwork. Come to me and me only.

                                 CHUCK
                        I don’t know. Lanley said everything has 
                        to run through this FBI task force now --

                                 MILES
                        Did the FBI go to your birthday party? 

           Chuck considers Miles.

                                 CHUCK
                        You know how much I love secrets, Miles.

           Miles pats his shoulder. Thanks.
                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (PRELAP)
                        ... state police are now working with the 
                        FBI ‘round the clock to catch this guy --

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - AFTERNOON

           Pam pulls into the restaurant parking lot, NEWS STATION on 
           the radio. Parks. Cuts the engine.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Yes, caller, you’re live on 93.7 WSTW.

                                 FEMALE RADIO CALLER (O.S.)
                        Yeah, hi. I mean... Is it all women or 
                        just... you know, those women? ‘Cause I 
                        travel Route 40 all the time. I mean, how 
                        long before decent women get hurt? 

           Pam turns the radio off. Stares ahead at the cars and trucks 
           going by on Route 40. Innocuous yet terrifying.  

           She picks up Miles' CARD, sitting in the ashtray. Studies it.

           Suddenly: PAULIE bangs on her car window. She jumps.

                                 PAULIE
                             (through the glass)
                        Next week, maestro! 

           Pam rolls down the window.

                                 PAM
                        Jesus, Paulie. What? 

                                 PAULIE
                        The partners’ll be here. Next Tuesday! 
                        You want that job? Let’s show you off.

           It sinks in. She smiles up at him, excited. 

           He drums the top of the car, pleased with himself. Snow 
           sticks to his fingers.

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        Aw, c’mon. You gotta clear your car 
                        better than this. You need a man.  

           She’s out of the car now, locking it up. 

                                 PAM
                        That’s why? To clear snow? 
                                 PAULIE
                             (defensive)
                        We do other things.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR, TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Miles eats an oatmeal cream pie in the dark, watching the 
           truckers and sex workers. Loneliness on parade. 

           The TALL SEX WORKER approaches his car. 

           Miles smiles, nods at her. Encouraging. She hops in.

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        How you doing, baby?

                                 MILES
                        Oh, you know, just trying to avoid the 
                        screaming void. 

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        You need a pick-me-up? Twenty to start.

                                 MILES
                             (flashing badge)
                        How much for answers?

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        Shit. 

                                 MILES
                        Relax.

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        I don’t snitch.

                                 MILES
                        The dead women won’t mind.

           Her face darkens.

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        If I had something to say I’d say it. 

                                 MILES
                        Anybody acting weird?

           Beat. She peels down her jacket to reveal her shoulder, 
           covered in bite-mark bruises.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Jesus.
                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        Weird is my thing.

                                 MILES
                        They hurt you?

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        It don’t hurt if they pay.

           He notices: her hand on the door handle, ready to run.

                                 MILES
                        A murderer on the loose and men who do 
                        that to you and I’m the bad guy?

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        Always more than one bad guy.

           He sighs, reaches behind him. Fishes for something. Pulls out 
           a box that clinks and rattles.

                                 TALL SEX WORKER (cont'd)
                             (taking it)
                        What’s this?

           She pulls something out, holds it up: a PENKNIFE.

                                 MILES
                        Carry it. And make sure they all get one. 

           She steps out with the box. Before she slams the door --

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        Red-haired cop offered cash.

           Miles searches the truck stop, confused. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, OFFICE - NIGHT

           A GROUP of waiters and waitresses, mixed ethnicities and 
           ages, crowd around the TV. Eyes wide. Hushed fear in the air.

           On TV, a REPORTER near Route 40. Behind the reporter, FBI 
           AGENTS canvas the same wooded area where Diane was found. 

                                 TV REPORTER 
                        Diane Elliot had hitched before. But she 
                        couldn’t have known her last ride would 
                        be with the man that the police and FBI 
                        are now calling the Route 40 Killer... 

           They all turn as PAM enters. Fear on their faces. 
                                 WAITRESS
                        Our shifts end in the middle of the 
                        night, Pam.

                                 PAM
                        You’re safe.
                             (switching off TV)
                        And we have a job to do. 

           They begrudgingly disperse. When they’re all gone, Pam eyes 
           her COAT on the rack opposite.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - LATER

           Pam once again stands in the cold, waiting. 

           Finally, across the way, the door opens on a BLACK TRUCK. Out 
           hops a YOUNG SEX WORKER (20s), short skirt like all the rest.

           Pam walks across the lot, catches up to her. 

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Miles POV: Pam and the young sex worker talk. 

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Pam hugs herself in the cold, listening.

                                 YOUNG SEX WORKER
                        ... some nights you just need some place 
                        warm. That motel is friendly, so Katie 
                        said she was going. I didn’t think... I 
                        didn’t know...

           She struggles, starts to cry. Pam touches her arm.

                                 PAM
                        Thank you. 

           The sex worker gives a grateful smile, turns away. As Pam 
           watches her go -- 

           FLASH: Diane’s angry face, turning away, stepping out into 
           the night.

           Pam closes her eyes, pained.

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        There she is. 
           Pam turns. He’s leaning up against his car. Holds her gaze. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                             (opening passenger door)
                        My turn with my favorite redhead.

           Dread on her face.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Pam stares ahead. Miles stares at her.

                                 PAM
                        You shaved.

                                 MILES
                        You lied.
                             (beat)
                        I hear some redheaded cop is out here 
                        paying for info. You getting their 
                        thoughts on the Berlin Wall or what?

                                 PAM
                        She stopped by for food. Maybe once a 
                        week. 

                                 MILES
                        Diane Elliot? 

                                 PAM
                        Yes.

                                 MILES
                        Why?

                                 PAM
                        Leftovers go to a food kitchen every 
                        night. So I figured, it’s just one plate.

                                 MILES
                        So she was your friend? 

                                 PAM
                             (frozen beat)
                        Of course not. 

                                 MILES
                        Why didn’t you tell me this when I asked?

                                 PAM
                        You see the kind of place I work?

           He doesn’t want to, but he lets it go. 
                                 MILES
                        She say anything? 

                                 PAM
                             (looks away, beat)
                        No. 

                                 MILES
                        You know I could have you arrested? Lying 
                        to an officer. Impersonating an officer -- 

                                 PAM
                        -- I never said I was a cop --

                                 MILES
                        -- interfering in an investigation?

           She finally turns to him. Imploring. 

                                 PAM
                        I can help you. 

                                 MILES
                        Excuse me? 

                                 PAM
                        Let me talk to them. 

                                 MILES
                        No. No fucking way. Why?

                                 PAM
                        I was the last person to see her alive... 
                        and... 
                             (beat as she grapples)
                        I have a daughter. I work right over 
                        there. I have to do something.

                                 MILES
                        You have to do something? I’m doing 
                        something. 

                                 PAM
                        They won’t talk to you. You’re worse for 
                        business than gonorrhea. 

           Despite himself, he laugh-snorts. 

                                 MILES
                        And you?

                                 PAM
                        I’m a woman.
                                 MILES
                        That simple.

                                 PAM
                        Sometimes.

                                 MILES
                        Well I work alone, thanks.

                                 PAM
                        Just you and the entire FBI apparently? 

                                 MILES
                             (annoyed)
                        I didn’t ask for that. And I can’t use 
                        civilians, ok? It’s fucking dangerous. 
                        You have any idea what we’re not telling 
                        the press? He’s carving them up. Making 
                        sure they feel it, too. Been to war and

           From her angle, she can see the METAL BAR of his LEFT 
           PROSTHETIC FOOT. Her eyes rest on it.

                        was at the motel too. Heard a commotion,

                        peeling away from the parking lot. No

                        But I shaved.

           INT. MISTER DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

           Nikki’s on her nightly routine: picking through the end-of-
           day donuts while watching a TV in the corner.

           ON THE TV: a news program. News anchor, suited and formal.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ... the American Medical Association said 
                        today that doctors have an ethical 
                        obligation to treat people with AIDS...

           Nikki changes the channel to:

           A local-access program: “Delaware Roundtable.” MEN, sitting 
           at a table. Well-dressed, slick, soulless. 

                                 RIGHT-WING PUNDIT
                        ... these murders are punishment from 
                        God.

           Nikki stops. It has her full attention.

                                 RIGHT-WING PUNDIT (cont'd)
                        For lust, fornication. For inciting men’s 
                        baser instincts. What do they think is 
                        going to happen? If they lived a 
                        righteous life, Satan would not be 
                        meeting them on the road...

           She powers the TV off, thinking. Turns up the radio instead. 
           Resumes her donut inspection.

           The front door CHIMES. In saunters BRYCE (17), gay, floppy 
           hair, over everyone’s bullshit. He does a little spin. 

                                 NIKKI
                             (smiling)
                        Bryce-Bryce-Bo-Bice.

                                 BRYCE
                        You ready to leave this yeasty nightmare? 
                        My brother's already ten minutes late for 
                        wrestling practice.

                                 NIKKI
                        I haven’t counted out the till. That’s, 
                        like, twenty minutes at least. Just go. 

                                 BRYCE
                        You sure, Nikki Tikki Tavi? You hear 
                        Delaware has a murderer?
                                 NIKKI
                        Yeah. Of prostitutes.  

                                 BRYCE
                        Don’t undersell yourself, honey.

           “Touch Me” by Samantha Fox plays over the store. Bryce does a 
           sort of moonwalk out of the store.

                                 BRYCE (cont'd)
                             (singing)
                        “I wanna feel your body...”

           Nikki’s at the door now, shoving him out. Laughing.

                                 NIKKI
                        No you don’t.

           When the door’s almost closed --

                                 BRYCE
                        Wait. You ask your mom about the party?

                                 NIKKI
                             (beat)
                        I can’t go. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Shit, c’mon. There’ll be guys there. For 
                        both of us. 

                                 NIKKI
                        She wants me to be a spinster like her.

                                 BRYCE
                        Then blow her off. My old man says a 
                        million things and I’m just like, 
                        whatever, half the time.

                                 NIKKI
                        I can’t. With my mom, it’s like... 
                        disappointing God or something. 

           Bryce makes a sad face as he steps outside. She locks the 
           door, blowing a kiss at him through the glass. 

           EXT. ROUTE 40 - NIGHT, LATER

           Cars pass Nikki, her back stooped under the black donut bag.
           INT. POLICE STATION, RECORDS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           In a darkened room, Miles sifts through boxes of OLD FILES. 
           Several boxes open. He’s been there a while. 

           Pulls A FILE out, blows DUST off it. Opens it. Reads. 

           Closes the file and puts it back. Thinking. Rubs his face. 
           It’s late and he needs sleep.

           INT. PAM’S CAR, AIR COMMAND PARKING LOT - LATE NIGHT  

           Pam rubs her hands together, waiting for the car to heat up.  
           She waves goodbye as another CAR drives away. Car clock 
           reads: 2:15 a.m. 

           All alone now, she watches the twinkle of cars and trucks on 
           Route 40. Like diamonds. 

           She looks down: a TIRE IRON on the passenger seat. She picks 
           it up, gives it a little swing. Puts it down again.

           After a beat, she pulls out. 

           Route 40 is eerily empty, except one car coming toward her: 

           A BLUE VAN. 

           Too dark to see the driver along this unlit stretch of road. 
           Pam gets behind it.

           Doesn’t blink. Barely breathes. Unsure what she’s doing. Eyes 
           to the license plate. 

                                 PAM
                        XR4TL7. XR4TL7. XR4TL7.

           A YELLOW LIGHT, and the van goes through. Now a RED LIGHT. 
           Pam goes through it. 

           The van speeds up. Pam does too. 

           In the distance, the lights of the DELAWARE MEMORIAL BRIDGE 
           loom. If she keeps going, she’ll be in New Jersey.

           The van switches lanes. Pam does too.

           The van swerves into the next lane to get away. Slams to a 
           STOP in the middle of the empty highway.

           Pam pulls up along side the van. Stops. Looks over.  

           A WOMAN (50s), glares over at her, window down.
                                 WOMAN
                        The fuck are you doing? 

           The van speeds off. Pam takes a beat to recover.

           LATER

           A darkened stretch of road. Pam’s tired but wired. Blinking, 
           body taut. Hands clenching the wheel. 

           In a flash they go by: CRUSHED DONUTS spilled out all over 
           Route 40. 

           She slams the brakes. Steps out. 

                                 PAM
                        Nikki? 
                             (shouting)
                        Nikki!

           No answer from the dark woods. She gets back in, speeds off.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE, NIKKI’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pam runs up the stairs. Shoves open the bedroom door and lets 
           her eyes adjust to the dark. 

           The bed is empty, the sheets pulled back. 

                                 PAM
                        Nikki!

                                 NIKKI (O.S.)
                        Mom?

           Pam turns. Nikki holds a GLASS OF WATER in the doorway. Pam 
           nearly crushes her in an embrace, the water splashing.

                                 NIKKI (cont'd)
                        Mom?

                                 PAM
                        The donuts. On the road. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Oh. I slipped on the ice.    

                                 PAM
                        Where was Bryce?

                                 NIKKI
                        His brother had practice.
                                 PAM
                        You should’ve called me. 

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t want to bother you at 
                        work and it’s just a 20-minute walk--

                                 PAM
                        You take the car from now on.

                                 NIKKI
                        What? What about you?

                                 PAM
                        Paulie will drive me. 
                             (beat, fiercer)
                        You’re all I have. You hear me?  

                                 NIKKI
                        Ok. You ok, Mom?

           She’s not. Pam folds Nikki into an embrace again, protection 
           against the evils of the world.

           INT. POLICE STATION, SPARE OFFICE - DAY

           Agent Pendergast, several FBI AGENTS, and a FORENSICS EXPERT 
           (40s) stand in front of a table. On it sits a row of PLIERS, 
           marked A, B, C, etc. 

           Behind them sits Miles. Bored as hell.

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                             (touching each one)
                        ... you have your slip-joint, your water-
                        pumps, your linemans, and your needle-
                        nosed. This guy, he’s a big fan of the 
                        needle-nosed. But here’s where it gets 
                        real interesting. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Hoo boy.

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                        Most needle-nosed pliers aren’t serrated.

                                 FBI AGENT 1
                        At all?

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                        Not like the big guys. We’re talking 
                        barracuda to shark here.
                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Always had a thing for sharks. 
                        Fascinating creatures.

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                        Oh yeah? Me too. 

           They smile. Best friends now. Miles rolls his eyes.

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT (cont'd)
                        Anyway, the way the flesh is ripped off 
                        in this case, it’s leaving unique 
                        markings because --

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        -- his are more like sharks.

                                 FORENSICS EXPERT
                        His are more like sharks.

           They nod, simpatico. Miles snickers. Pendergast notices.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Detective Stanton? Thoughts?

           All eyes in the room on him.

                                 MILES
                        It’s a grain of sand in the Sahara. We 
                        need fingerprints. Blood. Until we have 
                        that, we have nothing.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        It’s about building a case --

                                 MILES
                        I know how to build a fucking case.

           Agent Pendergast, taken aback. Uncomfortable silence among 
           the other agents. Miles knows he was too sharp.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Look, it’s just --

                                 CHIEF LANLEY (O.S.)
                        Gentlemen. 

           She’s stands in the doorway, grim.
           EXT. DELAWARE CANAL MARINA - DAY 

           A HELICOPTER slices the air above the water. Half a dozen COP 
           CARS dot the ground near the bank. Hurried FBI agents rush to 
           and from open-door vans.

           At the water’s edge, under the dock, Chief Lanley, Miles, and 
           a MEDICAL EXAMINER (50s) hover over a gray CORPSE partially 
           submerged in water. 

                                 MEDICAL EXAMINER
                        Bloat stage. Been here one, two days? 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Miles?

                                 MILES
                        Duct taped, ligature marks, areolas 
                        removed... blah de fucking blah.
                             (beat)
                        She’s number four.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Fuck.

           She looks away, frustrated. Up at the helicopter.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                        Get that fucking thing outta here.

           The medical examiner jumps up, makes a hasty exit. 

           When no one’s looking, Miles picks a BLUE STRAND out from 
           between the victim’s LIPS. Quickly stuffs it in a baggie.  

           Agent Pendergast approaches, glancing at his notepad. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                             (holds a laminated 
                              Blockbuster card)
                        Dumped her wallet in the water. Name’s 
                        Katie Randolph. 

           Miles looks up sharply. Stands. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Three arrests for solicitation. Partial 
                        fingerprint in blood on her thigh. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        And?
                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        No matches. But. He did leave behind tire 
                        prints in the mud leading up to the dock. 
                        I have my guys checking --

                                 MILES
                             (blurting)
                        It’s a van. He drives a blue van. 

           They both turn to him.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Witness saw a woman named Katie get into 
                        a blue van two nights ago.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        You talked to this witness?

                                 MILES
                        No. But I got someone who’ll talk to her.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Who? I didn’t approve undercover work.

                                 MILES
                        Not undercover. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        A CI?

                                 MILES
                        No. Just... someone.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Who?

           He shakes his head. Can’t tell. Chief Lanley’s not pleased.  

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Detective, like I always tell my 
                        daughter, sharing is caring --

                                 MILES
                        I just did.

                                 FBI AGENT 1 (O.S.)
                        Sir --

           An agent (20s) rushes up, holds up a paper. 

                                 FBI AGENT 1 (cont'd)
                        Tire prints from a Ford E series van. 
                        Models from 1979 to 1983.
           They look at Miles. He pumps his fist. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        We’re releasing this.

                                 MILES
                        You’ll send him into hiding.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        More women will die if we say nothing. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        I actually agree with the detective here. 

                                 MILES
                        “Actually”?

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                             (ignoring)
                        You’re also putting a target on every 
                        poor sap with a blue van.  

                                 MILES
                        It’s the only thing we have right now.

           She doesn’t like being ganged up on. Looks between them.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Then get more. Three days, then we 
                        release it. 

           Behind them, PRESS VANS pull up. JOURNALISTS jump out. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                        How do they always fucking know...?

           Mile starts backing away.

                                 MILES
                        Clock’s ticking, I guess. Pardon moi. 

           When he’s out of earshot --  

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Gosh. He’s something.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Chip on his shoulder the size of a foot. 

           They’re swarmed by shouting JOURNALISTS.
           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

           Pam and Paulie jump out of Paulie’s TRUCK. As they walk --

                                 PAULIE
                        ... he’s charging more. So I says, you 
                        don’t think I don’t know how to change 
                        the timing belt in my own truck?

           She spot a familiar CAR across the parking lot. Behind the 
           wheel: MILES. He nods at her.  

           Shocked, she shakes her head. A warning.

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        I mean, I don’t, but I could learn --   

                                 PAM
                        Hey Paulie. 

           At the front door, Pam rifles through her purse for effect.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Think I dropped something in your truck.

                                 PAULIE
                        I can get it --

           He makes a move. She blocks him.

                                 PAM
                        It’s a tampon.

           Paulie recoils, hands her the keys.

           ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

           She storms up to Miles’ window, not happy.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        I told you not to --

                                 MILES
                        Katie’s dead. 

           Pam stills. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        And your lead was right. He drives a blue 
                        Ford van. 

           Pam takes a beat. He unwraps a Twinkie, takes a bite.
                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        What else you got? Think you can talk to 
                        the woman who saw Katie that night?

           Pam takes a beat to think. 

                                 PAM
                        I’ll find you. Don’t -- 

                                 MILES
                        Come into the restaurant. I know. 

           He watches her walk away, half admiring. She turns back. 

           A long glance between them before she goes inside.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT - EVENING

           The bewitching hour, halfway between light and dark. Not yet 
           open, the restaurant stands regal in its solitude.

           Pam lights a candle at each table. 

                                 PAULIE (O.S.)
                        Pam. Taste test.

           AT THE KITCHEN DOORWAY

           He dips a wooden spoon into her mouth. Waits as she tastes. 

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        What does it need?

                                 PAM
                        Duck fat?

                                 PAULIE
                             (looking around)
                        Duck fat, duck fat is... in the locker. 

           He puts the spoon down, wipes his hands on his apron. 

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        Was thinking. Let’s start with a tour 
                        here in the dining room. Little dog and 
                        pony show. Show the partners some of the 
                        new changes. Show ‘em what you built.

                                 PAM
                             (genuine, sentimental)
                        Thank you, Paulie.
                                 PAULIE
                        Ok. Duck fat.

           He leaves. After a beat, she glances at something just out of 
           view in the kitchen. Reaches, lifts it slowly. 

           A KNIFE in a SHEATH. No one around. She walks away with it.

           INT. MISTER DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

           Empty inside. Behind the counter, Nikki writes in a NOTEBOOK. 

                                 NIKKI
                             (reading what she wrote)
                        “As crime in Delaware steadily increases, 
                        one wonders what social forces are at 
                        play to account for this unsettling 
                        reality.”
                             (beat, crossing out)
                        Disturbing reality.  
                             (tired)
                        Fucked up reality.

           The door chimes. She looks up. 

           It’s the SUBURBAN DAD with his LITTLE GIRL again. Nikki takes 
           off her glasses, perks up.

           The little girl runs up to the case, excited and undecided. 

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Hey. Thanks for re-opening the other 
                        night. Really nice of you.  

                                 NIKKI
                        No problem.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                             (to daughter)
                        C’mon, honey. Let’s tell the pretty lady 
                        what we want. 

           Nikki blushes at the compliment, pleased.

           INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 

           A SHORT-HAIRED SEX WORKER pays for a bottle of VODKA. Leaves.

           From behind a rack of snack foods, Pam steps out. Follows.
           EXT. TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

           The sex worker marches across the parking lot. 

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        You saw Katie at the motel?

                                 SHORT-HAIRED SEX WORKER
                             (turning)
                        You FBI? You gotta tell me.

                                 PAM
                        No.

                                 SHORT-HAIRED SEX WORKER
                        You related to her?

                                 PAM
                        No. Just... someone who cares.

                                 SHORT-HAIRED SEX WORKER
                             (yeah right)
                        I got someone waiting.

           Pam follows her gaze an older, large-breasted FEMALE TRUCKER, 
           smoking outside her truck. 

                                 PAM
                        Regulars wait. Everyone knows that.

           The woman looks Pam up and down, reconsiders her. 

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

           They sit in a faraway corner of the truck stop parking lot. 

                                 PAM
                        Said it was six digits. Space in between 
                        the numbers. Couldn’t see the actual 
                        numbers though. 

           Miles hunts the dark, dissatisfied. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Now what?

                                 MILES
                        Now what what?

                                 PAM
                        Can’t you run six-digit license plates on 
                        blue Ford vans? 
                                 MILES
                        You know how many blue Ford vans there 
                        are in the tri-state area?
                             (off her head shake)

                        What am I looking for exactly? 

           Beat as she realizes he’s right. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        It’s about blood, fingerprints. Something 
                        that defines only him. Anyone say 
                        anything about blue fibers?

           He’s staring at her profile, gets lost for a second. 

                                 MILES
                        Your family know what you’re doing?

                                 MILES
                        That’s good, you know, to keep some 
                        things from her.

                        You asked now what. Those women are his 
                        targets, so we just gotta stay on ‘em. 

           Pam takes a beat. Debating. Then:

                                 PAM
                        What if they’re not his targets anymore?

                        Diane wasn’t hooking.

           Pam looks away. Miles reaches into the glovebox, pulls out a 
           napkin. Hands it to her. 

           She turns to face him, watery eyes in the moonlight.

                        here’s the thing: maybe he didn’t know 
                        that.

                                 PAM
                        No. Hooking is transactional. There are 
                        terms. Right up front. They would’ve 
                        talked... He would’ve known right away.

                        Maybe he thought she was some other kind 
                        of woman at first. That’s why he was at 
                        that motel and not on Route 40. He was on 
                        the hunt for something different. And 
                        maybe... maybe she was all he could get

           Pam slips in through the back door, leans against it. Small 
           smile on her face.

           The kitchen is quiet, food sizzling unattended on the grills. 
           She follows TV SOUNDS to --

           Nikki, working away at the kitchen table on her research

           Pam takes in her daughter’s hopeful face. The passage of

                        I just want to regular grow up.

           Chief Lanley studies him.

                        for a long time, but you’re getting 
                        dangerously close to my limit.

                                 MILES
                        You could stick up for me. Believe in me. 
                        Those are options.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Just promise me, Miles. You’re not 
                        putting this person in danger.

                                 MILES
                        Of course not.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

           Miles pulls up to the truck stop, his headlights shining on:

           Pam, waiting for him in the cold. 
                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        I would never do that.

           She smiles, gets into his car.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Past Route 40 now, further down, the road spotted by bars, 
           car garages, abandoned houses.  

                                 PAM
                        Where are we going?

                                 MILES
                        Testing your theory. Higher-end escorts 
                        go to this place.

           MOMENTS LATER

           He pulls into the parking lot of a ramshackle bar. Neon sign 
           of a finger pointing -- KUM-ON-IN BAR -- blinking.

           Once parked, he rummages around behind him, through papers 
           and garbage. Pulls out a BLACK WIRE.

                                 MILES  (cont'd)
                        You ever wear a wire before?

           She shakes her head.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Ok. You’re gonna go in there and make 
                        nice with some of the guys. Here.

           He starts attaching it to her shirt, their faces close --

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Just flirting, nothing serious. Make them 
                        believe they got a chance. I’ll be 
                        listening out here. If someone seems 
                        fishy, get them talking. They might let 
                        something slip. If they want to take you 
                        home, get in their car. 

                                 PAM
                             (alarmed)
                        Wait. I don’t know--

                                 MILES
                        They’ll never leave this parking lot. I 
                        promise.
                                 PAM
                        You sure?

                                 MILES
                        I won’t let anything happen to you. And 
                        anyway, I sure as hell can’t seduce them.

                                 PAM
                        I dunno. Maybe you could. 

           He smiles. Their heads, close together. They pull away. She 
           fumbles with the wire, her shirt. 

                                 MILES
                        Just stuff it down in your, uh... 

           She stuffs it into her bra. 

                                 PAM
                        What if there’s trouble?

                                 MILES
                        Code word. Kalamazoo. I’ll come running.

                                 PAM
                        Kalamazoo.

                                 MILES
                        The place in Michigan.

                                 PAM
                        I know where it is. How the hell do I 
                        work it in?

                                 MILES
                        “I’m from Kalamazoo. Where’re you from, 
                        big guy?” See? Easy.
                             (off her face)
                        You’re safe. I promise.

           Miles reaches around and pulls out a BLACK BOX, the receiver. 
           Twists the knobs. STATIC.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        I’ll keep this on. Same kind of batteries 
                        they use in the military. Lithium. Last 
                        forever. Go ahead. Say something.

           Suddenly HEADLIGHTS blind them, another car rolling into the 
           lot, parks across from them. Not a car, a van.

           A blue Ford van. Before the lights go out, the six-digit-with-
           a-space license plate blazes in the dark. 
           Neither of them move.

           A SUSPECT (30s) gets out. Thin, stringy hair, beady eyes. 
           Doesn’t look their way as he makes his way toward the bar.

                                 PAM
                             (whisper)
                        Kalamazoo. 

                                 MILES
                             (beat)
                        Ok. New plan. 

           INT. KUM-ON-IN BAR - LATER

           Rowdy bar. Rock music, pool tables. Grungy flirtation between 
           hard-up women and downtrodden men. 

           Pam sits at the bar, glass of SCOTCH in hand. Facing a pool 
           game. 

           The SUSPECT leans down over the felt. Glances up, catches 
           Pam’s eye. She smiles at him. 

           He hits, sends the WHITE BALL bouncing off the eight ball, 
           which slides directly into the hole opposite. Game shot.  

           Pam swivels back around. Side glance at Miles, down at the 
           far end of the bar, nursing a beer. Watching her closely. 

           A MUSCLY BARTENDER talks with a guy at the other end.

                                 SUSPECT (O.S.)
                             (to the bartender, loud)
                        You gonna talk all night or what?

           Pam turns. He slides into the seat next to her. Even grosser 
           up close. Stained teeth, greasy hair. 

                                 PAM
                             (smiling)
                        Hard to get his attention.

           The bartender, annoyed, finally steps over.

                                 SUSPECT
                             (to bartender)
                        Pabst.

                                 PAM
                        You know how to work a pool table. 
                                 SUSPECT
                        I work lots of things real good. 

                                 PAM
                        Oh, wow. Ok. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        I don’t like wasting time. Most precious 
                        resource we have.

                                 PAM
                        Cheers to that. What’s your name?

                                 SUSPECT
                        Later. When you’re ready to scream it.

           Pam takes a beat to adjust to his level. Nearly purrs:

                                 PAM
                        Why don’t we get outta here, then?

           He gets his beer, holds it up. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        Got some drinking to do first. Cheers to 
                        pretty women. 

           Clink. He chugs. Pam looks over at Miles. Help. 

           The suspect slams the beer down. Signals the bartender for 
           another. Belches.

                                 SUSPECT (cont'd)
                        You play pool?

                                 PAM
                        A little. Not as well as you. 

           Another beer comes. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        Challenge you to a game. 

                                 PAM
                        Oh, um --

           The suspect is suddenly shoved forward, beer spilling on him, 
           the bar. He turns.

           Miles stands behind him, fake shock on his face.
                                 MILES
                        Did I...? So sorry. Couldn’t get that 
                        guys’ attention way down there. Here, let 
                        me buy you another. 

                                 SUSPECT
                             (annoyed)
                        S’all right. 

                                 MILES
                        I insist. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        I’d rather you not, k? Guy buying another 
                        guy a beer is kinda fruity.

                                 MILES
                        Are you a vet?

                                 SUSPECT
                        Yeah?

                                 MILES
                        I could tell. Me too. 1st brigade, 5th 
                        infantry. Vietnam. Two tours. 

                                 SUSPECT
                             (glancing down)
                        That how you lost your foot?

                                 MILES
                        Oh that. No. Poker game. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        Tough luck.

                                 MILES
                        I won. The other guy’s just a torso.

           Pam stifles a laugh, drops it when the suspect turns back to 
           her. He slams cash down on the bar.

                                 SUSPECT
                        Let’s get the fuck outta here. 

           Pam gathers her things. The suspect walks out ahead of her.

           At the door, she turns back, fear in her eyes. 

           Miles nods at her, reassuring. 
           EXT. KUM-ON-IN BAR PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The suspect turns back to her as she lags behind.

                                 SUSPECT
                        That guy was fucking annoying. You 
                        coming?

                                 PAM
                             (all nerves)
                        Yeah.

           AT THE VAN

           He hops in on the driver side. She hesitates at the passenger 
           door. Looks backward toward the bar. 

           No Miles.

           The suspect opens the door for her. Long beat before she 
           climbs in. 

           INT. SUSPECT’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Pam stares straight ahead. The suspect starts the engine. It 
           kicks a little, then comes to life. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        My place ok? 

                                 PAM
                        Huh? Uh. Ok. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        Ain’t you gonna wear your seatbelt? 

           She pulls the seatbelt across her, zombie motion. One more 
           glance out the window.  

           The van pulls out, crunching on the ice. Pam touches her 
           chest lightly. The wire. 

           The van is at the entrance now. Waiting to turn back out onto 
           the main road. 

                                 PAM
                        So-- so where’re you from? Big guy?

           It’s decidedly unsexy. Fear has overtaken her mojo.

                                 SUSPECT
                        What?
           Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT in the driver’s side window, 
           blinding them. Miles stands there, flashing his badge.

                                 MILES
                        Out of the van! Now. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        What the fuck? No. Ain’t getting out ‘til 
                        you tell me --

           The door swings open. Miles grabs the suspect and SLAMS him 
           to the ground. Punches are thrown. Miles straddles him, 
           finally in control.  

                                 MILES
                        Did you have anything to do with the 
                        killings of Diane Elliot, Katie Randolph, 
                        Alice Pritchard, or Marie James? 

           The suspect wriggles, blood in his teeth.

                                 SUSPECT
                        The fuck? I don’t live here!

           Miles hauls him up, marches him to the back of the van. 
           Shines the MINI FLASHLIGHT on:

           The license plate. Black and gold, not blue and gold. 
           California. 

                                 MILES
                        Keys, now. 

                                 SUSPECT
                        Front right pocket.  

           Miles finds them. Inserts a key into the back. Swings the 
           doors open. A sparkling clean back.

           Miles looks up. Pam, standing in the dark, hugging herself.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - LATE NIGHT

           Pam and Miles sit in the car, staring out at:

                             (turning off receiver)
                        He’s not our guy. 

           The disappointment sits heavy between them. Miles gets out. 

           Pam watches as he uncuffs the suspect. Sore and angry, the 
           suspect jumps into his van, screeches away. 

           Miles stands in the parking lot a beat. Takes a tissue out of 
           his pocket, dabs his bloody nose. Gets back in the car. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Really thought it was him.

                                 PAM
                        I did too. 
                             (beat)
                        He almost drove away. 

                                 MILES
                        Wasn’t gonna let anything happen to you. 
                             (beat, off her face)
                        Would’ve had a whole team on him.

                                 PAM
                        You and the FBI.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah.

                                 PAM
                        Even though you work alone.

           Beat as regret crosses his face. He wants to convince her. 

                                 MILES
                             (firm)
                        I would have.

           She wants to believe him. The clock reads 2:37 am.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        You gotta get home, right? 

                                 PAM
                        I can... I can stay. Just a little while 
                        longer though. 
                                 MILES
                        Ok. Great.

           He’s pleased. So is she. He reaches behind his seat, musters 
           up a BLANKET. Gives it to her. 

           Pam covers herself. Tries to extend it to him, but -- 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        I’m ok. You get warm.

           She stares at his profile as he watches PEOPLE leaving the 
           bar.

                                 PAM
                        How did you become a detective? 

                                 MILES
                        Long story, but... mostly it involved 
                        spending lots of time alone as a kid 
                        reading Hardy Boys books. 

                                 PAM
                        Nancy Drew for me. 

                                 MILES
                        See? And here you are.

           They chuckle.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        How did you come to run a restaurant?

           Her smile fades as she remembers.

                                 PAM 
                        After my marriage ended, I knew I had to 
                        do right by my daughter. Even if it meant 
                        starting at the bottom.

                                 MILES
                        No dishonor in that.

                                 PAM
                             (softly)
                        Not in that, no.
                             (beat)
                        Speaking of, I can’t get away tomorrow. 

                                 MILES
                        No? 
                                 PAM
                        Restaurant partners coming in. Looking 
                        to... make a good impression. So I can 
                        get off the night shift.

                                 MILES
                        Good for you. Wednesday then? 

                                 PAM
                        Well I was thinking, just for tomorrow... 
                        you could... come into the restaurant. 
                        Have a real meal.

                                 MILES
                             (surprised)
                        Seriously?

                                 PAM
                        Yeah. They’ll be gone by dinner rush, so 
                        ... come in around 6 or so. I’ll hold a 
                        table.

           He rummages behind the seat, searching. Holds up a CLIP-ON 
           TIE to his neck. Wiggles his eyebrows. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                             (pained)
                        Fine. 

           He enjoys teasing her. Pam nestles down in the blanket, smile 
           on her face.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE, OUTSIDE PAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Nikki, in her Catholic school uniform, knocks on her mother’s 
           bedroom door. Quiet at first, then louder.

                                 NIKKI
                        Mom? Gotta go now, ok?

           She waits, listening. Shrugs. Pounds down the stairs.

           INT. MILES’ UNMARKED CAR, KUM-ON-IN BAR PARKING LOT - MORNING

           The clock reads 9:20 a.m.

           Pam and Miles, now both under the blanket, sleeping. 

           Pam rouses slowly. The light, blinding. Blinks, realizes. 
           Throws off the blanket in a panic. 
                                 PAM
                        Shit. Miles. 

           He stirs, adjusts to where he is. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        I need to go. Now.

           He sits up, starts the engine. She’s sick with worry.

           INT. OUR LADY OF FATIMA CATHOLIC SCHOOL - MORNING

           Pam runs through the empty hallways of the school, frantic. 

           Something catches her eye in the nearest CLASSROOM WINDOW. 
           She slowly walks to it, hoping not to be seen.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: NIKKI, hunched over her desk, 
           concentrating on a test with the rest of her CLASSMATES.

           Her good girl. Relief washes over Pam. Love. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - LATER

           Pam blasts through the back door, disheveled. She grabs a 
           hanging pan, smooths her hair. Checks her teeth.   

                                 PAULIE (O.S.)
                        The fuck, Pam?

           He’s standing there in a suit and tie. Arms up in disbelief.

                                 PAM
                        Sorry sorry sorry sorry.

                                 PAULIE
                        They’ve been here almost an hour. Those 
                        the clothes you wore yesterday? 

           She runs by him, not answering.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, MAIN DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The SIX PARTNERS, all men (40s-50s), follow Pam in a line 
           through the restaurant as she points out its finery.   

                                 PAM
                        ... and in 1986, we commissioned this 
                        piece from a local artist to best capture 
                        the Air Command experience.
           They all turn to the impressionist PAINTING: fine linens, 
           silverware, fresh spices in understated, refined colors. 

           MARK, one of the younger partners, smiles at her. 

                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        And what is the Air Command experience?

           Pam takes a beat. Almost glows with pride as she looks around 
           at the glory of the place she loves. 

                                 PAM
                        This place is... a dream. The best dream. 
                        People come here to forget about out 
                        there. They save up for months, work hard 
                        just for one special night. Because... we 
                        make them feel worthy. This is a kingdom 
                        and here, they wear crowns.

           They seem touched by her warmth and conviction.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Paulie and Pam whisper to one another.

                                 PAULIE
                        ... you saved it there in the ninth 
                        inning. 

                                 PAM
                        Did you ask them?

                                 PAULIE
                        I’m going to. Waiting for the right 
                        opening. Ok?

           He squeezes her hand, leaves. She leans up against the wall, 
           eyes closed. Relieved. Exhausted. 

           INT. POLICE LAB - AFTERNOON

           Miles, face bruised, marches straight to --

                                 MILES
                        Chuckles. 

           Miles looks around. FBI AGENTS in conversation at the 
           doorway. They slowly move off. He leans in, almost-whispers --

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Got my samples analyzed yet?
                                 CHUCK
                        Yeah, just in. And I --
                             (glancing up)
                        Whoa. What happened? You look like my 
                        grandma after her first face lift.

                                 MILES
                        Samples.

                                 CHUCK
                        Hold on. I was right, by the way. 

           Chuck shuffles through his papers. Slides drop. A mad 
           scientist. Finally holds up a PAPER: 

                                 CHUCK (cont'd)
                             (smug)
                        Nylon, acrylic, and polyester. 

                                 MILES
                        Why do you think I know what the hell 
                        you’re talking about?

                                 CHUCK
                        A carpet, Miles. A cheap, flammable 
                        carpet. The kind they sell everywhere. 
                        Like I said when you brought this in. 

                                 MILES
                        Shush a minute.

           Miles sits down, thinking. Realization.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        A carpet. In the back of his van.

                                 CHUCK
                        That’s why you’re the detective. 

           Miles thinks for a moment more, stands. 

                                 MILES
                        You said it was a dog, by the way.

                                 CHUCK
                        Science is a safe space for ideas, ok? 

           Miles pats Chuck’s shoulder. Sure. Leaves.
           INT. OUR LADY OF FATIMA CATHOLIC SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Nikki stands at her locker, pulling out books, when a COUPLE 
           down the hall catches her eye. A blonde CHEERLEADER and her 
           JOCK boyfriend. She spies with intense interest. 

           They flirt. The cheerleader’s top button, open on her 
           uniform. Laughing at everything he says. Hand lightly 
           touching his.  

           Nikki’s hand seems to float up to her school uniform. She 
           pops open the top button. 

           BRYCE suddenly sidles up to her. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Hey. I can get the car from my dipshit 
                        brother tomorrow. You need me to pick you 
                        up from Monsieur Beignet? 

                                 NIKKI
                        No, it’s ok. My mom gave me her car.

                                 BRYCE
                        Your mom gave you her car? Why? 

                                 NIKKI
                        Because she’s afraid of perverts.

                                 BRYCE
                        Joke’s on her. We’re all perverts.

                                 NIKKI
                        Not her. It’s a miracle she got laid once 
                        in her life.

                                 BRYCE
                        Wait. You’ve had the car for days without 
                        telling me? We have to do something. 

           EXT. WILMINGTON MARSHES - AFTERNOON

           Nikki and Bryce lie atop the hood of the car, reedy grasses 
           reaching nearly up to the windows. 

           In the distance, the twinkling lights of a factory that looks 
           like a city, aptly named Delaware City. 

           They pass a JOINT back and forth as Echo and the Bunnymen 
           plays over the stereo, drifting out through the open windows.

                                 NIKKI
                        What about Michael? 
           Bryce sits up on his elbow.

                                 BRYCE
                        Honey. He listens to Poison and drives an 
                        Iroc-Z. No.

                                 NIKKI
                        This guy comes into the donut shop. With 
                        his daughter. 

                                 BRYCE
                             (gasp)
                        A hot dad?

                                 NIKKI
                        I think he likes me? 
                             (doubtful, ugh)
                        I’m gonna die a virgin.

                                 BRYCE
                        No, you’re gonna meet a hunky pre-med at 
                        NYU who loves going down on you. 

                                 NIKKI
                             (laughing)
                        My hero.

                                 BRYCE
                        My mom knows I’m not. 

                                 NIKKI
                        A virgin?

                                 BRYCE
                        But she won’t outright ask me if I like 
                        boys. Like, she’s fine I’ve had sex, just 
                        doesn’t want to know with who. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Parents are weird.

                                 BRYCE
                        Truest words ever.  

                                 NIKKI
                        Library’s closing soon. I gotta go. 
                        Finish my paper.

                                 BRYCE
                        You’re seriously not finished?
                                 NIKKI
                        There’s something new every day. I can’t 
                        write about crime in Delaware and not, 
                        like, include him. 

                                 BRYCE
                        I heard he’s ripping off body parts. Like 
                        their nipples and shit.

           Quiet beat. They stare out at Delaware City.

                                 NIKKI
                        Destroying them piece by piece.
                             (beat)
                        You ever wonder?

                                 BRYCE
                        What?

                                 NIKKI
                        Why that’s sexual for some people. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Cruelty? Fuck. I don’t wanna know. 

           Nikki reaches over for his hand. He takes it. 

           They stare up at the early shine of the stars. 

           EXT. OLD NEW CASTLE LIBRARY - EVENING

           Nikki hauls her books, running toward the entrance. 

           The clock tower atop the library reads: 6:30 pm.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, MAIN DINING ROOM - EVENING

           A cozy corner nook. Candlelight, privacy. 

           Miles is waiting there. In a real tie. With slicked hair. 
           Looks good. Stands as --  

           Pam approaches, slides into the seat. In a good mood. Then 
           she gets a good look at him in the light.

                                 PAM
                        Oh my god, your face.

                                 MILES
                        I’m fine. Here.

           He slides over a ROSE. 
                                 PAM
                        What is this?

                                 MILES
                        You’re off the night shift, right?

                                 PAM
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 MILES
                        Congratulations.

                                 PAM
                        What if I’m not?

                                 MILES
                        Sympathy then. 

           She smiles, sniffs it. 

                                 PAM
                        Thank you.

           He looks around.

                                 MILES
                        Nice place.  

                                 PAM
                        Better than chips for dinner.

                                 MILES
                        Thanks. Know you got your standards. 

                                 PAM
                        Think you meet the standard. 

           He’s pleased. They stare a beat too long, look away. Then:

                                 MILES
                        Blue fibers are from a carpet. 

                                 PAM
                        A carpet?
                             (beat, thinking)
                        From the back of his van?

                                 MILES
                             (smiles)
                        That’s what I think. 

           Pam sits back, chewing on it. 
                                 PAM
                        The Carpet Mart. I could go over there 
                        tomorrow on my break. Check out their 
                        blue carpets.  

                                 MILES
                        I was thinking something else.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah? 

           He takes a beat, wondering how to say it.

           EXT. OLD NEW CASTLE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Nikki sits in front of a MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling 
           through an old NEWSPAPER dated November 20, 1968. 

           Scrolls past PHOTOS that catch her eye. Scrolls back up 
           again. Leans in. 

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        I’ll wire you up again. But this time, 
                        you’ll walk Route 40. 
                             (beat)
                        Like you used to. 

           Nikki blinks as she reads the headline: PROSTITUTION BUST 
           ALONG ROUTE 40 NETS RING, POLICE SAY

           There, on the page, several mugs shots, among them: a PHOTO 
           of a YOUNG DIANE ELLIOT. Next to it, a PHOTO of YOUNG PAM.

                                 NIKKI
                             (horror)
                        Mom? 

           Nikki collects her things and runs out of the library.

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, MAIN DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The candle light flickers across Pam’s frozen face. 

                                 PAM
                        What?

                                 MILES
                        Undercover work. Only you’ll look higher 
                        end, you know? So maybe he’ll... just 
                        like your theory.... Anyway, given your 
                        history, I thought... and I’d be 
                        listening in... 
                                 PAM
                        You’ve known this whole time?

           Beat. He knows he’s said something wrong.

                                 MILES
                        I’m a detective, Pam. 

           On Pam’s face, a silent scream. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Look. Your... past. It’s not a big deal.

                                 PAM
                        It is. It is a big deal.

                                 MILES
                        It isn’t to me.

           Her rage grows. She stands. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Where are you going?

                                 PAM
                        Get out.

                                 MILES
                        What? 

                                 PAM
                        Get out.

                                 MILES
                        What are you doing?

                                 PAM
                        My job. 

           She waits, stares ahead. He stands. Wants to say something. 
           Decides against it. Leaves.

           After he’s gone, she snuffs the candle out with her fingers.

           EXT. LIBRARY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Nikki stands, looking sick. Not getting in the car. 

           From her pocket, she absentmindedly pulls out a scrap of 
           PAPER, focuses on it. Decides something. 

           Gets in the car and peels away.
           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, KITCHEN

           Paulie stands in front of an open fridge. Red hair passes 
           behind him.

                                 PAULIE
                        Maestro. 
                             (lifting bottle of 
                              champagne)
                        Taste test?
                             (beat)
                        You ok?

           She’s out of it. Trying not to show it. 

                                 PAM
                             (touches stomach)
                        Little off tonight. You guys’ll be ok if 
                        I go home?

                                 PAULIE
                        Yeah, sure. Of course.

           He watches after her, puzzled.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Pam stares at herself in a mirror flecked by silver-black 
           patches. 

                                 PAM (V.O.)
                        Where’s your car?

           BEGIN FLASHBACK

           At the back of the restaurant, DIANE stands holding the foil-
           wrapped PLATE. She hesitates. 

                                 DIANE
                        I don’t have it. Just gonna hitch.

           Pam’s face falls. Disappointed.

                                 PAM
                        You said you were out. And now here you 
                        are again, walking --

                                 DIANE
                        I am out. Just don’t have my car.

                                 PAM
                        I’ve known you 20 years, Diane. Sometimes 
                        the truth is hard for you.
                                 DIANE
                        How many times do I gotta show you...? 

                                 PAM
                        How many times have I paid your bail? 
                        That many times. 

                                 DIANE
                             (beat, frustration)
                        I got into nursing school. 

                                 PAM
                             (happy)
                        Diane. That’s amazing --

                                 DIANE
                        So I sold my car.  

                                 PAM
                        If you needed money --

                                 DIANE
                        I gotta do this on my own, ok? 

           After a beat, Pam nods. 

                                 DIANE (cont'd)
                        Can I use the toilet? I really gotta go.

           Pam hesitates. For too long.

                                 DIANE (cont'd)
                        Ok. Ok. I see how it is. 

                                 PAM
                        Diane --

           But Diane’s upset, eyes growing teary.

                                 DIANE
                        One of these days, I’m gonna put on my 
                        best dress and waltz right through the 
                        front door of this place. I’m gonna get 
                        the best steak you got and the best 
                        bottle of wine and I’m gonna spend three 
                        hours eating it. And no one’s gonna stare 
                        at me sideways.

                                 PAM
                        Diane --

                                 DIANE
                        If you can do it, why can’t I?
           Diane turns away, stepping out into the night, when -- 

                                 PAM
                        Diane?

           But Diane’s gone.

           END FLASHBACK

           Pam squeezes her eyes shut. Can’t look at herself. 

           Hardens, opens her eyes. Takes off her jacket. Stares at her 
           body in the mirror. 

           Shoves her arm into her shirt. Lifts her RIGHT BREAST. Lifts 
           her LEFT BREAST. Cleavage now on full display.

           Tousles her hair. It goes from groomed to wild in an instant. 

           She pulls out RED LIPSTICK. Colors her lips. Stares at 
           herself. 

           Lifts the KNIFE out of her purse, slips it into her inside 
           pocket, careful. Zips up. 

           INT. TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

           Pam steps out of the bathroom into the harsh glare of 
           fluorescent lights. Shoulders back, she struts past the 
           bright displays. 

           Eyes follow her. 

           INT. FRAT HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Nikki comes in through the open screen door. It’s dark. Hair 
           band music blares throughout the house. Screechy. 

           Eyes turn to her. College kids with BEERS in hand. She smiles 
           meekly, unsure what to do.  

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                        Nikki! You came!

           He comes running toward, beer sloshing. Hugs her. She 
           relaxes. 

                                 BRYCE (cont'd)
                        I want you to meet Brad.

           He reaches into the dark and pulls forth BRAD (19), a geeky

                        Nikki, Brad. Brad, Nikki. You both love 
                        sad, British music. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hey. Need a beer?

           Nikki smiles. Freedom at last.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

           SIRENS blare down Route 40. 

           Pam waits in the cold, eyes watching. But different this 
           time. Not timid. Instead, pacing, hunting. 

           A few TRUCKERS eye her as they pass through the truck stop 
           doors. She eyes them back. 

           Women in short skirts climb into truck cabs, saunter across 
           the parking lot, slip money into their jackets.  

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER (O.S.)
                        Howdy.

           Here he is again. Silver mustache. Gentle air, warm smile.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER (cont'd)
                        Wanna apologize for the last time I seen 
                        you. Shouldn’t’a mistaken a lady for a... 
                        you know. I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        Speaking of, someone like you shouldn’t 
                        be out here. Lots of weirdos. I got 
                        stories. 

           Her face shifts. From guarded to interested. She sweetens up.

                                 PAM
                        You weren’t wrong about me.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - CONTINUOUS

           MARK THE PARTNER pumps gas into his Porsche, glancing around 
           absentmindedly. Until something catches his eye.

           MARK POV: A WHITE TRUCK parked furthest from the truck stop. 
           In the dark, out of the way of the street lamps. 

           The Cowboy Trucker gets in. Pam does too.

           Mark pauses. Then gets into his car, drives away.
           INT. COWBOY TRUCKER’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Soft country music flows from the radio. Cowboy hat off.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        ... Texas to New Jersey twice a month. 
                        Longer than my other routes. Messes with 
                        my sciatica, you know --

           Pam listens, her foot tapping. Nervous energy.

           He notices her leg. Chuckles.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER (cont'd)
                        Shit. Been alone so long I’m talking your 
                        damn ears off. You new? Been here a dozen 
                        times and --

                                 PAM
                        What do you like?

           He shifts. 

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        Well, you know. I’m old fashioned. 

                                 PAM
                        So everything, then?

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                             (nervous laugh)
                        Sure. 
                             (beat)
                        Gotta ask... do the drapes match the 
                        carpet? I love me some redheads.

           With her face shadowed, he can’t see her haunted eyes.

                                 PAM
                        Take off your clothes.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                             (smiling, here we go)
                        Ma’am.

           He turns away to lift off his shirt, pull off his pants. Just 
           in his underwear, he turns back to her.

           She points the KNIFE at him. He lifts his hands, shocked. 

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER (cont'd)
                        Only have a little cash. Just hauling 
                        manure. I can open the back and show you. 
                                 PAM
                        What weirdos? 

           Confusion on his face.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        Weirdos?

                                 PAM
                        Do you know him? 

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        I don’t understand.

                                 PAM
                        The dead women. Alice, Marie, Katie. 
                        Diane. It’s all over the news.

           He finally understands what she’s asking.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        No. No.

                                 PAM
                        You said weirdos. You a part of it?

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        No. I... I don’t live here. I don’t know 
                        who he is.

                                 PAM
                        Twice a month, you said? 

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        Yeah?

                                 PAM
                        I just saw you here last week. 

           Her hand is trembling. He slowly lowers his arms. 

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        I owe the government some money. So I 
                        took another haul back-to-back. I don’t 
                        know nothing, I swear. Don’t hang around 
                        types like that.   
                             (tears in his eyes)
                        I got a wife and kids... you gonna let me 
                        get home?

                                 PAM
                        That’s what they wanted too.
                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        I don’t... what do you want from me?
                             (beat)
                        I can’t pay for the sins of other men.

                                 PAM
                        Why not? We do.

           A beat as they stare at each other. Then:

           He LUNGES at her...

           ... and the knife slashes his ARM in the process, as...

           ... he pushes her arm back against the door...

           ... forcing the knife in her hand to drop....

           ... he grips her arms tightly, digging into her skin to hold 
           her still as...

           ... he leans down...

           ... and scoops up the knife.

           She’s panting. So is he. He waves the knife at her, arm 
           bleeding.

                                 COWBOY TRUCKER
                        I could fuck you up good for that. Get 
                        out!

           She scrambles for the door, leaps out. 

           The truck starts, pulls out. She watches as it blends into 
           traffic on Route 40. 

           After a beat, she looks up. SCREAMS into the black night sky. 
           Pent-up frustration and rage. 

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

           Lights, people, storefronts on Route 40. He drives by slowly, 
           eyes searching.  

           Stops at a LIGHT. Looks over to see: a REDHEAD, walking.

           He opens the car door, steps out. Through the dark:

                                 MILES
                        Pam!

           The woman turns. Not her. Another REDHEAD. 
           BEEP from a car behind him. The light is green now. 

           EXT. SPINELLI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pam trudges up the driveway. Stops. The car is missing. 

                                 PAM
                        Nikki.

           She runs into the house.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           All the lights off. She flicks them on. 

                                 PAM
                        Nikki! 

           No answer. She runs up the stairs. Beat. Back down again. 

           Picks up the phone, punches in 9... 1... and then: 

           Sees it. An indentation on the NOTEPAD next to the phone. 

           She grabs a pencil. Rubs it against the paper until it 
           reveals:

           293 South Chapel Street. Party.

           Panic settles into anger. 

           EXT. FRAT HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Pam hops out of a cab. Runs toward the house. 

           INT. FRAT HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           Nikki sits in a dark corner with Brad. Though the music is 
           loud, they’re having a tender, quiet moment.  

           He has his arm wrapped around her, nuzzling her face. His 
           hand, partway down her blouse. 

           Eyes closed, she’s enjoying it. Sinking deeper and deeper 
           into it, until...

           YANK! Pam has her by the arm. Beer drops. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Mom! 
           Pam pulls Nikki roughly through a crowd of sweaty, gawking 
           kids. Shoving them aside to pull her daughter out of the 
           house.

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - NIGHT

           They both breathe fire in the car. Nikki’s face to the 
           window. 

           Pam wants to yell, keeps looking over. Can’t collect her 
           thoughts.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 

           Once inside, Nikki tries to make a beeline for the stairs, 
           but Pam takes her arm.

                                 PAM
                        Listen to me. You think you know. But you 
                        don’t know. 

                                 NIKKI
                        I do know. Lots of things. 

                                 PAM
                        All of this is for you. No one sacrificed 
                        like this for me. You’re not gonna give 
                        it away to the first idiot frat boy who 
                        paws at you --

                                 NIKKI
                        I wanted to!

           Nikki’s ferocity quiets Pam. She tries another way. 

                                 PAM
                        Nicole. I used to be a girl who thought 
                        she was a woman, too. And I messed up.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m not you.

                                 PAM
                        I’m trying to save you from pain. 

                                 NIKKI
                        You sure it’s me you’re trying to save?

                             (suspicious)
                        What does that mean?
           But Nikki can’t bring herself to say it. Not right now.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        You’re grounded for a month. Two months. 

                                 NIKKI
                        What?

                                 PAM
                        School and work and nowhere else. You’re 
                        not going traipsing around when there’s a 
                        serial killer on the loose targeting 
                        women.

                                 NIKKI
                        Just women with no shame. Isn’t that what 
                        you always say? So who cares? 

           SMACK! Pam’s hand hovers in the air. Nikki holds her red 
           cheek, shocked. 

                                 PAM
                             (regret)
                        Nikki --

           But Nikki turns, runs up the stairs. Bedroom door slams. 

           Pam looks at her hand, horrified. 

           After a beat, she sits at the kitchen table. Lays her head 
           down on it. Defeated. 

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He watches a LIT WINDOW in Pam’s house. 

           The SCANNER crackles, low voices. Miles turns it up.

                        Following. 

           Miles sits up, holds his breath. Long beat.

                             (over scanner)
                        Negative. Negative. Black van. 

           Miles breathes out. Deflated. Or maybe relief. After a 
           moment, the light in Pam’s window goes out. 

           He starts the car. Drives away.
           INT. POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING

           A TV blares in Chief Lanley’s office. A SUBURBAN WOMAN (30s) 
           talking to a TV REPORTER (30s).

                        What’s the FBI doing? How many more

                        They say it’s just been hookers, but... 
                        that don’t make me feel any better.

           CLICK. Chief Lanley shuts the TV off. Looks to:

           Agent Pendergast, sitting in the chair opposite her, and 
           Miles, standing up against the wall.

           She doesn’t have to say a word. Her look withers them.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        My guys are on 24-hour rotations. We have 
                        a partial fingerprint, van type... we’re 
                        getting closer.

                        that word with me again.   

           Miles seems far away, not listening.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        With all due respect, Susan, my men and I

                        just pissed as shit on television. You 
                        wanna split hairs when the history of 
                        this thing is written? 

           No, he does not.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        What about the hotline?

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        That mess. I’ve got people reporting 
                        their lost cockatoos. 
                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                             (beat)
                        Miles. Hello? What happened to your face?

           Miles comes to. 

                                 MILES
                        Bowling accident.

           Chief Lanley’s not amused. Lets it go. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Your informant saying anything?
                             (off his head shake)
                        Wonderful. I’m releasing the info about 
                        the blue Ford van.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Oh geez, not a good idea --

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Public wants something? Let’s give it to 
                        them. Let him know that the entire 
                        fucking state of Delaware is hunting him 
                        like the animal he is. 

                                 MILES
                        Give us one more day.

           They turn to him.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        He’s following a script in his head. A 
                        kink he’s seen acted out. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        So?

                                 MILES
                        So we take the list of registered blue 
                        Ford vans and compare it against credit 
                        card purchases at sex shops. It’s a 
                        needle in a haystack, but --   

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        It’s a grain of sand in the Sahara.

           A knowing look passes between them. 

           Chief Lanley takes a beat to think. To Miles:

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Can you work with Agent Pendergast on 
                        this?
           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Pam sits at the kitchen table nursing a steaming cup of 
           coffee. Hasn’t slept at all. It shows on her face.

           Nikki comes bounding down the stairs in her uniform. Stops in 
           the kitchen doorway.

           They stare at one another. 

           Pam wants to make it right. Nikki wants to tear it all down. 

                                 PAM
                        Nikki --

           But Nikki takes the car keys and leaves. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND STAFF BATHROOM - LATER

           Pam studies purple BRUISES on her bare arms. Puts her 
           business jacket back on carefully. Winces. Breathes out. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT - MINUTES LATER

           Pam surveys the dining room, her usual routine. Except 
           tonight, there’s no joy in her face. 

           FIVE BUSINESS MEN laugh raucously over at one table. One of 
           them drops his NAPKIN, doesn’t notice.  

           Pam sees it but doesn’t move. Face blank. 

           Her eyes drift to the TABLE where she and Miles sat. A COUPLE 
           (50s) sits, reading from their menus. Smiling at each other. 

           Hopelessness on her face, watching them.

           A WAITRESS (20s) appears.

                                 WAITRESS 
                        Pam. Paulie’s asking for you. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK OFFICE - CONTINOUS

                                 PAM
                             (irritated)
                        What, Paulie--?

           But it’s not just Paulie. It’s MARK THE PARTNER too. 
                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        Hello, Pam.

           She looks between them. A slow smile. 

                                 PAM
                        Is this... about the general manager job?

                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        What general manager job?

           Confused, Pam looks to Paulie. He won’t meet her eyes.

           She’s suddenly afraid.

                                 MARK THE PARTNER (cont'd)
                        No, I’m here because of a curious thing, 
                        Pam. I was filling up at the truck stop 
                        the other night and saw you there. 

           The color drains from her face. 

                                 PAM
                        I was... running an errand.

                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        An errand that involved you climbing into 
                        an eighteen wheeler with a trucker when 
                        you told Paulie you were going home sick?

                                 PAM
                             (frozen beat)
                        It’s not what it looked like. 

                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        Then what was it? 

                                 PAM
                        I... can’t say.

                                 PAULIE
                        Pam, you’d better say.

           It’s a warning. He finally looks at her, pained.

                                 MARK THE PARTNER
                        Look, you said it yourself. This is a 
                        kingdom. And we can’t let the gatekeeper 
                        be... one of those types. 

           They wait for her to say something. But she can’t. 

           After a beat, Mark hands over her purse and coat.
                                 MARK THE PARTNER (cont'd)
                        Walk her out, Paulie. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a bustling night, like always. Pam walks in front, 
           Paulie behind. A death march through the restaurant. Passing:

           -- THE KITCHEN

           Waiters and waitresses smile and say hi, oblivious.

           -- THE DINING ROOM

           Light glints off the chandelier, sending sparkles everywhere. 
           People laugh, eat steaming plates of food. Glasses clink. 

           -- THE HOSTESS STATION

           Maria fumbles with a stack of menus for a LARGE, LOUD PARTY 
           of 7, sends an eye roll toward Pam. Can you believe them? 

           At the front entrance, Pam steps out. Turns. 

           Paulie’s face, pained. Hers too. He wipes his eyes.

                                 PAULIE
                        Maestro --

           She shakes her head. 

                                 PAM
                        You never asked them. 

           He stares at her a mournful moment. She turns, walks away.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Pam stands under a streetlamp. Staring out into the night. 

           Across the lot, the SEX WORKERS gather, lighting cigarettes 
           for each other. The TALL SEX WORKER spies Pam. Walks over.

           They stand in comfortable silence for a beat. 

                                 TALL SEX WORKER
                        You know when I first met you, I thought 
                        you was some fancy, uptight rich lady 
                        from Wilmington? Just goes to show.

                                 PAM
                             (empty)
                        Just goes to show.
           The sex worker extends a cigarette, smile on her face. 

           Pam hesitates, then takes it. Big drag, bigger blowout. 
           Relief. Or maybe resignation.

           Up the road, the steeple at Our Lady of Fatima shines. A 
           beacon in the dark. 

           INT. OUR LADY OF FATIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT

           Candles lit. Empty except one OLD WOMAN in the front pew. Pam 
           makes her way toward the back.

           INT. OUR LADY OF FATIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH, CONFESSIONAL - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Pam sits inside, waiting. After a beat, a RUSTLE. 

                                 PAM
                        Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It’s 
                        been... I don’t know anymore. I cursed. 
                        Smoked. Lied. Stole. I really messed up. 

           She stops, near tears.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        I come in here a lot. And every time, I 
                        want to tell you something. 
                             (beat)
                        Well here it is. I fucked men and I got 
                        fucked by men. For money. 

           She waits, dread on her face. The first time she’s said it 
           out loud. 

                                 PRIEST
                        And you feel... ashamed?

                                 PAM
                        I can’t tell anymore whether it’s the 
                        shame or the hiding it. 

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        The book of John tells us that cleansing 
                        comes through the blood of Jesus Christ --

                                 PAM
                        “Those without sin cast the first stone.” 
                        Isn’t that a verse? 

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        Yes?
                                 PAM
                        I felt those stones. But soon as I got 
                        out, I threw them anyway. What does God 
                        say about that?

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        Child...

           Pam looks over at the screen. Something not right. 

           OTHER SIDE OF CONFESSIONAL

           Pam pulls open his door. The priest peers out with a round, 
           unlined face. No older than his early 20s.

                                 PAM
                        I could be your mother.

           She leaves.

           EXT. ROUTE 40

           Pam walks on the road, not in the shoulder. Taking up space. 

           Cars BEEP as they pass her. She barely blinks. A bull 
           breathing out condensed air.

           She stops across from the KUM-ON-IN BAR, it’s finger-pointing 
           sign twisting in the wind. 

           INT. KUM-ON-IN BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Same dodgy men playing pool. Same roughed-up women missing 
           teeth. Same old. 

           Pam steps to the bar. The BARTENDER looks over, nods.

                                 PAM 
                        Can you call me a cab?

           INT. MISTER DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

           Nikki’s arranging the donuts in the case. Face, worn. Tired. 

           The door CHIMES open. It’s the SUBURBAN DAD with his LITTLE 
           GIRL again. He smiles when he sees her. 

           Nikki takes her glasses off, stuffs them underneath the 
           counter. Opens up the top button on her work uniform.
                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Us again.

                                 NIKKI
                        Hi.

           The little girl once again takes her place at the counter.

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Must be torture working here. Don’t know 
                        how you stay so fit.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’ll probably never eat donuts again 
                        after this. 

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Well. Good girls should indulge in 
                        something bad every now and again, don’t 
                        forget.

           He winks, goes back to watching his daughter. 

           Something in her sparks. Catches fire. She might burn down in 
           front of him. In a breathless moment, she places her hand 
           over his.

           He jumps back as though bitten. 

                                 SUBURBAN DAD (cont'd)
                        What are you doing? I- I’m married. And 
                        you’re a kid.

                                 NIKKI
                        I’m sorry, I thought --

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        I was just being nice. You shouldn’t do 
                        that. Not to grown men. You might... 
                        There’s a serial killer out there.
                             (to his daughter)
                        C’mon, honey.

                                 LITTLE GIRL 
                        But Daddy --

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        Now.

           They leave. 

           Mortified, Nikki looks at herself in the reflection of the 
           window. How could she ever think...?  
           On the verge of a scream that never comes, she puts her hands 
           on the donuts, squeezes them until they burst, rip, ooze.  

           After a beat, she settles. Goes to lock the front door.

           INT. HILTON LOBBY - NIGHT

           Regal lobby, heavy chandelier, romantic lighting. 

           Pam steps through the revolving doors. Looks around.

           INT. HILTON BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pam settles in at the bar in a velvet lounge. Mostly empty, 
           save a few REGULARS. 

           A BARTENDER (30s) places a napkin down. 

                                 PAM
                        Gibson?

           The bartender nods, steps away.  

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Strong stuff for a little lady.

           He’s two seats down. Dapper, fit for his age. 65, maybe even 
           70. Nice clothes, shiny watch, oiled shoes. 

                                 PAM
                        Been a day.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Sorry to hear that. Can I help? 

                                 PAM
                        Just wanna sit here and enjoy my drink. 
                        But thank you.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        You sure? 
                             (inches over a seat)
                        Got a cherry red Ferrari GTS sitting 
                        outside, bright as your hair. Might make 
                        you happy to go for a spin.

                                 PAM
                        Sounds nice, but no, thank you.  

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Listen, my wife died last year. I have a 
                        big, empty house up in Greenville --
                                 PAM
                        I’m sorry. I just wanna sit here.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        But --

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        C’mon, man. You heard her. Leave her 
                        alone.

           They turn. He’s at the other end of the bar. Handsome in a 
           normal way, 30s or early 40s. Clutching a beer.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                             (embarrassed)
                        Excuse me.

           He shuffles away without taking his drink. Pam looks over at 
           Steven appreciatively.

           The bartender slides her drink in front of her. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Some men. Geez.

                                 PAM
                        Thank you...?

                                 STEVEN
                        Steven.

                                 PAM
                        Pam.

           Air clink. 

           She sips the drink. It is strong. And good. Lets it sink in. 

           INT. JACK AND JILL SEX SHOP - NIGHT

           Miles stares at a row of S&M VIDEOS on the shelf. The Devil’s 
           Daughter. Babylon Whores. The Suffering of Miss Jean. 

           He turns. A row of DILDOS looks back at him. He sighs.

           Agent Pendergast is now beside him. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST 
                        Agents Miller and Villarosa are taking 
                        six in Wilmington, and Agents Finch, 
                        Williams, and Jackson are splitting the 
                        other...

                        Geez, ten. Delaware has... 
                             (counting)
                        ... seventeen sex shops?

                                 MILES
                        We’re bored here.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                             (re: videos)
                        You know, not everyone who likes this 
                        stuff is a deviant. 

                                 MILES
                        I know. Just so happens that the deviants 
                        like this shit too.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                             (faraway look)
                        If everyone’s into it, with safe words 
                        and such... the threat of punishment can 
                        be... stimulating. 

           Beat. A coy smile on Miles’ face.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Wait, no, I don’t --

                                 MILES
                        Nah. I like you better now, Spanky McGee. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Detective --

           But Miles leaves him there, down another aisle. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Well shit.

           INT. HILTON BAR - NIGHT

           Three empty glasses in front of Pam, and she’s feeling it. 
           Steven, now next to her. Playful, leaning into each other.

                                 PAM
                        ... ok, lemme start again.

                                 STEVEN
                        For the third time.

                                 PAM
                        Quiet.
                             (beat)
                        A flashlight, a knife, and... 
                                 PAM (cont'd)
                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        a photo of my daughter. If I’m stranded 
                        on an island, I wanna be able to see her. 

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s sweet. But you’re gonna die.

           She laughs. He has a certain boyish charm. 

                                 PAM
                        Ok, then what would you bring?

                                 STEVEN
                        Definitely a knife, for sure. A 
                        flashlight. And... copper wire. 

                                 PAM
                        Copper wire?

                                 STEVEN
                        You can do a lot with copper wire.

                                 PAM
                        Like what?

                                 STEVEN
                        Well it conducts, for one. You get the 
                        right materials, you can rig a battery. 

                                 PAM
                        Oh yeah?

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m an electrician.

                                 PAM
                        Good with your hands?

           He smiles, holds them up. She takes them in hers, feeling 
           them. No ring. His voice grows husky.

                                 STEVEN
                        You good with yours?

                                 PAM
                        Yes. 

           Beat. A turn in the conversation. 

                                 STEVEN
                        So listen, I don’t live far --

                                 PAM
                        Yes. 
           He smiles.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        I just have to be home by 2:30. For my 
                        daughter. 

                                 STEVEN
                             (doubtful, teasing)
                        Dunno. I like to take my time. 

           She smiles. They stand. 

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Nikki sits at the kitchen table, staring ahead. A glass of 
           water by her side. She clears her throat.  

                                 NIKKI
                             (practicing)
                        Mom, I know. I know what you did.
                             (no, not right)
                        I know who you really are. 

           She watches the door. Arms crossed. Ready. 

           LATER

           Head down on the table, she startles awake. Looks up at the 
           clock. It reads: 2:46 a.m.

           She peers out the window: a fresh coat of snow. No footsteps 
           leading up to the house. 

           OUTSIDE PAM’S ROOM

           She knocks softly.

                                 NIKKI (cont'd)
                        Mom?

           Opens the door. Pam’s bed, empty.

           BACK IN THE KITCHEN

           Nikki twists the phone cord in one hand, waiting. It rings 
           and rings. Nikki almost hangs up, when --

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Air Command, Maria speaking. 

                                 NIKKI
                        Maria? It’s Nikki.
                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Nikki? Honey, it’s so late. You ok? A 
                        huge party just left, otherwise no one 
                        woulda been here to answer -- 

                                 NIKKI
                        Is my Mom there?

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, but... she was let go earlier 
                        tonight. 

           Nikki grows still, shocked.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Is she ok? She’s been a little... weird 
                        lately. Coming and going a lot, really 
                        distracted --

                                 NIKKI
                             (quickly)
                        Thank you.

           Nikki hangs up the phone. Thinks a second, grabs car keys. 

           EXT. HILTON - CONTINUOUS

           The cold night sky is clear and bursting with stars.

           They walk across the parking lot. Pam’s happy. Drunk. Feeling 
           desired and desirous.  

                                 STEVEN 
                        Here we are. 

           She stops. 

           Covered in some old snow, but unmistakable... 

           ... a blue Ford van. 

           She finds him in the dark as he continues walking. His 
           slightly balding head, broad shoulders. Clear smile.

           Normal looking.

           Time seems to stop. 

           She glances down at the license plate: L29 778.

                                 STEVEN (cont'd)
                        You ok?
                                 PAM
                        A van. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Yeah?

           From somewhere within, she fights through the panic. Smiles.

                                 PAM
                        Why don’t we just... right here? 

           He catches on, looks around.

                                 STEVEN
                        What if someone hears?

                                 PAM
                        Isn’t that part of the fun?

                                 STEVEN
                        Let’s go somewhere quiet.

           Once he’s on the other side of the van, she scrambles for 
           something in her PURSE. 

           Lifts the KNIFE SHEATH out. Panicked beat as she forgets the 
           knife is gone.  

           Spies something black in her purse: the wire. She clutches it 
           with her fingers.

           Slowly makes her way to the front. Gets in.

           INT. STEVEN’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           They look at each other. 

                                 PAM 
                        I don’t usually do this.

                                 STEVEN  
                        Neither do I. You’re very special.
                             (beat)
                        Buckle up.

           INT. MILES’ UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Pendergast combs through a BOX OF RECEIPTS as Miles 
           drives. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        You know, he coulda used cash. 
                                 MILES
                             (annoyed)
                        I said it was a long shot. 
                             (beat, here it comes)
                        I had everything under control.

           Agent Pendergast stops rifling. Studies Miles.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Susan didn’t think so.

                                 MILES
                        Susan does what’s best for Susan --

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Maybe cause she can’t trust you to do 
                        what’s best. 

           Stung, Miles watches the road, jaw set.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Miles. Sorry. Listen, it’s just --

                                 MILES
                        Shut up.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Sorry?

                                 MILES
                        Shh.

           Somewhere in the car, LOW VOICES. Miles reaches around, 
           swerves a little. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST

           Miles holds up the WIRE RECEIVER. Turns the volume way up.  

                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        ... real quiet. You’ll like it. 

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Sounds nice.

                                 MILES
                        Pam?  

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Who?

           STATIC. The red light on the receiver dims.
                                 MILES
                        Fuck.

           He messes with the knob. Hits the side a few times. Voices 
           come in and out. One word at a time.

           Miles pulls the car over three lanes to the shoulder. BEEPS 
           follow them. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                             (muttering)
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. Where are you?

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        The informant? 

           Miles nods. Fear on his face.

           INT. STEVEN’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           She’s studying him, taking in as much as possible. He feels 
           her gaze, turns sharply. She smiles.  

                                 PAM
                        You from Delaware? 

                                 STEVEN
                        Yeah. You?

                                 PAM
                        From Kalamazoo, actually.

           INT. MILES’ UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He messes with the receiver. Just static. Hits the side.

                                 MILES
                        Fuck.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Here.

           He takes the receiver from Miles. Fishes in his pocket. Pulls 
           out a PAPER CLIP.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Works for the ol’ TV antenna at home. 

           He straightens out the paper clip, wraps it around the 
           antenna and extends it upward. Holds it up to the window.

           Static gives way to voices. Agent Pendergast smiles. See?
                                 STEVEN (O.S.)
                        ... a long way. How’d you get here from 
                        Kalamazoo?

           Horror on Miles’ face.

                                 MILES
                        Fuck. Where are you, Pam? 

           INT. STEVEN’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           He puts the blinker on. Turns left down a winding road. 

                                 PAM
                        Well, it’s a long story, but --

           They pass a sign: LUM’S POND

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Lum’s Pond. Isn’t it closed at night?

                                 STEVEN
                        I can pick a lock.
                             (smiling)
                        We’re gonna have so much fun together.

           Pam does her best to smile but the fear is palpable.

           INT. MILES' UNMARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Miles throws up a PORTABLE SIREN. 

                                 PENDERGAST (O.S.)
                             (into scanner)
                        10-18, we need all available backup to 
                        Lum’s Pond, address 1068 Howell School 
                        Road --

           The siren blares as they pull off into the night.

           EXT. LUM’S POND - CONTINUOUS

           Pam hops out. Moonlight reflects off the still water. No 
           sound in the dead of winter. Just silence in the trees. 

           He peeks around from the back.

                                 STEVEN
                        You coming? 

           She walks slowly. Her eyes search the road they came in on. 
           For Miles. For anybody. 

           A LIGHT at the back of the van. She moves toward it. 

           He’s pulled open the back doors. 

           She turns, peers in:

           Clean, empty. Except a blue carpet covering the bottom.

           Her face betrays nothing. Places her hand down. Rubs the 
           carpet. 

                                 PAM
                        Soft. This’ll work. 

           She stuffs her hand back in her pocket.

                                 STEVEN
                        Hop in.

           He steps close, almost on top of her. She takes a chance. 

                                 PAM
                        You should know I used to... do this for 
                        money. Long time ago. In case it matters.

           Something changes. A veil lifts, and his eyes go cold. Angry.

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        I’m sorry, I --

                                 STEVEN
                        You got airs about you, you know that?

           Deadened voice. An animal pretending to be human.

                                 PAM
                        It’s not what you wanted. 

           He turns. Turns back again. Agitated. Thinking. Deciding. No, 
           it’s not what he wanted.

                                 STEVEN
                        Proves my theory. You’re all the same. We 
                        act like there’s a line, but... there 
                        ain’t no line, is there?

           And it hits Pam as she studies his rage-filled face. How 
           wrong she was.  

                                 PAM
                        You’re right. There’s no line.
           He’s disgusted, angry. He leans into her, menacing.

                                 STEVEN
                        You’re all just black holes. You would 
                        drag me into the dark if I let you. But I 
                        won’t let you.

           A beat of heavy breathing. Then:

           Pam punches him, clean in the face. He steps back, shocked. 

           She turns and runs toward the woods.

           He’s not far behind, quick and lithe and angry. 

           A hill rises where the woods begin. She pushes, breathless, 
           as she ascends. She can’t help but slow, the ground mushy 
           with winter below her feet.

           He’s nearly on top of her now, reaches for her jacket.

           She goes down. He falls on tops of her, grabs her legs.

                                 PAM
                        No!

           She kicks him -- one, two, three times -- in the head until 
           she’s free from his grip and he’s rolling backward...

           Back down to the bottom.

           She’s in the woods now. Branches hitting her face. She 
           doesn’t slow. And doesn’t look back. 

           EXT. LUM’S POND - MINUTES LATER

           Steven, mud stains all over, bloodied lip, fumbles with his 
           keys in the dark. Cursing under his breath.  

           Hears something. Turns. Off in the distance, POLICE CARS and 
           FBI VANS turn onto the curved road. Coming his way. Fast.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Fuck.

           He hops in his van. With the lights off, he pulls away, 
           heading out of the park in the opposite direction. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Miles’s car slides to a stop nearly at the pond. Jumps out. 
                                 MILES
                             (into the dark)
                        Pam! PAM! 

           Cops and FBI agents spill out of their vehicles, doors 
           slamming and flashlights criss-crossing through the night. 

           Agent Pendergast stands with the car door open, looking down.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Tire prints. Fresh.

           CRUNCH. Miles steps on something in the dark. Picks it up: 
           the wire.  

                                 MILES
                        FUCK! What did I do? 
                             (shouting)
                        Pam!

           Miles takes off into the dark. FBI agents follow him. 

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - LATER

           Nikki’s parked at the truck stop parking lot. Her eyes shut.

                                 NIKKI
                        Please please please...

           She opens her eyes. A few SEX WORKERS moving in and out of 
           the truck stop. 

           None of them her mother. Nikki breathes out, relief. 

           But then: a worse fear settles on her face. 

           She peels away.

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - LATER

           Nikki drives slow on Route 40, searching the side of the 
           road. Cars BEEP to get around her.

           The trees sway in the wind, making it nearly impossible to 
           see.

           She finally pulls over to let other cars pass. 

                                 NIKKI
                        ... I won’t... I’ll never... I’m sorry. 
                        Just please. Please please please...
           A different kind of please. To anyone, anywhere. 

           She’s sobbing.

           She lifts her head, wipes her eyes. 

           But then there is someone. Running out of the woods. A 
           bundled shadow. Fighting to get home.

           Pam.

           Nikki jumps out of the car. 

                                 NIKKI (cont'd)
                             (screaming)
                        Mom --

           Pam turns, shocked. They run into each others’ arms.

                                 PAM
                        Nikki, what...? Are you ok? What are you 
                        doing out here? 

           Pam looks behind her, still worried.

                                 NIKKI
                        I thought... I thought maybe...
                             (tears)
                        Mom, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t. 

           She keeps repeating it. 

           Pam suddenly catches on. Horror on her face. Her worst fear 
           realized. 

           They embrace. Then fear morphs to something else: relief.

                                 PAM
                        I’ll explain everything. Just need to 
                        make a stop first.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SAME NIGHT  

           Miles marches through the hallways, Agent Pendergast and 
           other FBI AGENTS jogging to keep up. 

           He’s disheveled. Mud on his clothes. Barks at an OFFICER 
           (20s) behind the desk --

                                 MILES
                        Windover, Snyder, Reilly. Now. Wake them 
                        up.   
                                 DESK OFFICER
                        But, sir...

                                 MILES
                        Now. There’s another woman missing. 

           The desk officer snaps to, starts punching numbers into the 
           telephone.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        And put out an APB... Pam Spinelli. 
                        Redhead. 43. Five foot --  

           The desk officer puts the phone down. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DESK OFFICER
                        Pam Spinelli is waiting in your office. 

           Shocked, Miles runs. An FBI agent makes a move to follow, but 
           Agent Pendergast stops him. They hang back. 

           INT. POLICE STATION, SPARE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Miles bursts into the room. 

                                 MILES
                        Pam.

           She stands up from the chair behind his desk. He makes a move 
           to go to her, stops when he sees her face.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        I’m so sorry. I had the whole team on it. 
                        I wasn’t... I wasn’t gonna give up on 
                        you.

           She assesses him: the mud on his clothes, the leaves in his 
           hair. 

           He’s telling the truth. She looks at him anew. Hopeful. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Did he hurt you?

                                 PAM
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        You have a baggie?

           He pulls an EMPTY junk food wrapper out of his pocket. 
           Pam steps forward, gently dips her left hand in the empty 
           wrapper, pushing off as many BLUE FIBERS as she can. Rolls it 
           up. Hands back the wrapper. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Carpet fibers from the back of his Blue 
                        Ford van. L29 778. 

           He searches his coat pockets, pulls out a NOTEBOOK. 
           Scribbles. Looks up at her. Long beat. 

                                 MILES
                        I never meant to make you feel --

                                 PAM
                        Yes you did.

           He doesn’t fight it. She turns to go. Turns back. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Get this fucker. 

           Leaves. He stares after her. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Miles and Pendergast walk as fast as they can down the 
           hallway, huffing it, toward --

           CHIEF LANLEY’S OFFICE

                                 MILES 
                        Chief.

           She looks up. Not happy. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Sit down, Miles. Agent Pendergast.

           They do. Chief Lanley gives Miles a hard look.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                        A fucking civilian? Stealing evidence? 
                        You think I’m dumb?

           His face falls.

                                 MILES
                        No, ma’am. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        She could’ve been hurt. Or worse. You 
                        thought you’d bag this one on your own. 
                                 MILES
                        You called in the FBI over my head -- 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                             (exploding)
                        Who the fuck cares about your ego when 
                        women are dying? 

           He’s chastened. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        Susan, he’s right. It should’ve been him 
                        on lead and me and my guys --

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Shut the fuck up, both of you. 

           She assesses them, disgusted. 

                                 CHIEF LANLEY (cont'd)
                             (to Miles)
                        I knew you slept in your car. That you 
                        didn’t take calls if you thought they 
                        were beneath you. Everyone thought I was 
                        crazy for keeping you around. He’s a 
                        wunderkind, I’d say. Doesn’t matter about 
                        the foot cause his mind is brilliant. 
                             (beat)
                        I was wrong. Your mind was the problem 
                        all along. 

                                 MILES
                        Susan --

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Badge and gun, now. You’re suspended 
                        pending further review.

           Shocked beat. He grows riled, stands. No. Holds up the baggie 
           with the BLUE FIBERS. 

                                 MILES
                        His name is Steven Pennell. Agent 
                        Pendergast?

           Agent Pendergast pulls RECEIPTS out of his pocket, rifles 
           through them.

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST
                        He’s an electrician. Bought seven sets of 
                        needle-nose pliers at area hardware 
                        stores with markings that match those on 
                        the victims. A regular at Jack and Jill 
                        sex shop in Wilmington. 
                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (cont'd)
                        Videos he rented include --
                             (reading a receipt)
                        Savage Sadists, Helpless Harlots, 
                        Punished Pussies, Sexed to Death --

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                             (disgusted)
                        -- got it --

                                 MILES
                        Drives a blue Ford van with a six-digit 
                        license plate and a blue carpet in the 
                        back. Fibers from the carpet contain 
                        microscopic blood samples that match the 
                        blood from his victims.  

           He slaps the baggie down on her desk, finally breathing out.

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        You’re right. I’m an insecure fuckhead 
                        who needs to get his shit together. I’m 
                        sorry for putting you through it. Both of 
                        you. But me and Pam and Pendergast, we 
                        did this. Let us finish it. After that, 
                        you can do whatever you want with me.

           Chief Lanley chews her lip. Long beat.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        Can she ID him?

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Outside the window, the sun is coming up through a winter 
           haze, casting a gothic glow.  

           Pam and Nikki sit at the table, steaming cups of coffee in 
           front of them. 

           Tired, subdued. Long night. Long conversation. After a beat, 
           Nikki reaches out to Pam.

                                 NIKKI
                        They’ll get him now. I know they will. 
                        All because of you. It’ll be ok, Mom.

                                 PAM
                        I know. I have you.  

           Hand squeeze. The DOORBELL rings. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Probably the paper boy collecting? 
           She stands, digs in her purse. Nikki follows her to the door.

           AT THE DOOR 

           Miles stands on the stoop. 

                                 MILES
                        Hi, Pam.

           Behind him, FBI vans. Agent Pendergast and Chief Lanley on 
           either side of one. 

           EXT. LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD PARK - DAY 

           A neighborhood of ranch houses. Quiet. At the end of the 
           street, a small PARK with monkey bars and swings. 

           Pam and Miles sit on bench. Feet apart. Awkward silence. In 
           Miles’ hand, a WALKIE TALKIE.

           Across the street, going from house to house, a GIRL SCOUT 
           (8) with a bag of cookies. They watch her. 

           Miles turns twice, stops. Then:

                                 MILES
                        I wanna tell you about my foot. 

           Her body relaxes. She’s listening. 

                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        I’d been working a lot. And fighting with 
                        my wife. The FBI, it’s not a job, it’s a 
                        lifestyle. Anyway, I came home one night 
                        from some event, drunk, and my wife was 
                        standing in the kitchen with this guy. 
                        This old friend of hers. I’d met him 
                        before, just never spent any real time 
                        with him. He had just popped over, she 
                        said. To catch up. And then she... 
                        brushed a crumb off his cheek. With this 
                        easiness. An easiness we’d never had. And 
                        I just knew. They were together. Had been 
                        together. Maybe for years. And I just... 
                        I hadn’t been paying attention. I threw a 
                        punch. He left. But I couldn’t let him 
                        go. I jumped on my hog, followed him onto 
                        the Beltway. At some point he got off and 
                        I just kept going. 
                             (beat)
                        I was doing over a hundred when I hit a 
                        tree. Lost my foot. My job. My wife.
                             (beat)
                                 MILES (cont'd)
                                 MILES (cont'd)
                        Sometimes I hate living with the reminder 
                        of it. That everyone can see it. Then I 
                        think... fuck it. I’m human.

           A moment hangs between them.

           His walkie talkie CRACKLES. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (O.S.)
                             (over walkie talkie)
                        Van approaching. Need visual on suspect. 

           They sit up. 

           A BLUE VAN rounds a corner... 

           ... comes up the road, slowly...

           ... crunches through the snow, and...

           ... rolls into a driveway in front of a one-story HOUSE, 
           passenger side to them.  

           Beat. A door SLAMS on the driver’s side. 

           Miles and Pam wait. A lifetime in only a few seconds. And 
           then:

           STEVEN emerges carrying a TOOLKIT. Opens up the back. 

           A normal-looking man in a normal neighborhood.

           Pam squeezes Miles’ hand. Head nod. It’s him.

                                 MILES
                             (into walkie talkie)
                        Positive ID on suspect. 

           Miles glances at Pam. Gratefulness on his face. Smiles.

           She smiles back. 

                                 AGENT PENDERGAST (O.S.)
                             (over walkie talkie)
                        Go go go.

           Miles jumps up, sprinting. Pam watching.

                                 GIRL SCOUT (O.S.)
                        Hello. 

           Pam turns. 
                                 GIRL SCOUT (cont'd)
                        Do you wanna buy any cookies?

                                 PAM
                             (collecting herself)
                        Sure, honey. 

           Pam rifles through her purse. The little girl places her 
           COOKIE BAG on the ground. 

           There’s a COMMOTION behind them. Muffled shouting. They turn.

                                 GIRL SCOUT
                        Why are those men at my house?

           Horror as Pam realizes: the murderer’s daughter. She takes 
           the little girl’s right hand. Gentle. 

                                 PAM
                        Tell me about your badges, sweetheart.

           The little girl, confused, points to her sash.

                                 GIRL SCOUT
                        Um. This one is for Outdoor Adventurer, 
                        this one for Painting. And this one... 
                             (checking)
                        ... First Aid. This one --

           More muffled shouting. The little girl twists. Can’t see 
           what’s happening behind the blue van.

                                 GIRL SCOUT (cont'd)
                        Is my daddy ok?

           Pam takes her other hand. 

                                 PAM
                        Listen. 

           The little girl turns back, eyes like saucers. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        No matter what happens, you’ll be ok. You 
                        have the rest of your life. 

           The little girl looks up at her, earnest and wide-eyed.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY EVENING

           The PRESS is in a frenzy as Chief Lanley steps toward a 
           podium, flanked on either side by Miles and Agent Pendergast. 
           Dozens of FBI agents behind them.
           Bulbs flash. Reporters shout “Chief! Chief!”

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                             (into mike)
                        I can confirm that as of this afternoon, 
                        we have a male suspect in custody for the 
                        murders of the women along Route 40.

           FLASH! FLASH! of dozens of cameras. Reporters shouting. Chief 
           Lanley points to one.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Chief Lanley, can you confirm that you 
                        arrested a Steven Pennell this afternoon? 
                        Is he the Route 40 Killer?

           More reporters shouting. Chief Lanley, annoyed.

                                 CHIEF LANLEY
                        As I stated very clearly, I cannot 
                        confirm the name of the suspect until 
                        further notice. 
                             (beat)
                        But I want to say one thing to the people 
                        of Delaware this evening.

           INT. SPINELLI CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is parked at the truck stop, radio on. Through the 
           windshield, she can see into the truck stop. 

           INSIDE THE TRUCK STOP

           A TV hangs from a corner. People huddled around it, watching 
           Chief Lanley at the press conference. 

           Among them, the sex workers. Eyes glued. 

           BACK TO PAM

                                 CHIEF LANLEY(O.S.)
                             (on the radio/TV)
                        I know you’ve been scared these past few 
                        months. Looking over your shoulders. No 
                        one should live under a threat of 
                        violence. No one should wonder if they’ll 
                        be the next victim. Too many women live 
                        that way, wondering if today is their 
                        last. I will continue to fight to make 
                        sure justice is served. And tonight I can 
                        say to the people of Delaware, to the 
                        women of Delaware: sleep easy.  
           The sex workers look at each other. Smile. 

           Pam smiles too. A bittersweet, faraway look. 

           She starts the car. 

           INT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Paulie stands at the grill, flipping sizzling veggies in a  
           pan. Looks up.

                                 PAULIE
                        Seymour.

           Across the kitchen, a nervous, bookish SEYMOUR (20s), ultra 
           thin and wearing all black, looks up from his clipboard.   

                                 SEYMOUR
                        I ordered too many truffles, Paulie. 

                                 PAULIE
                        S’ok. We’ll do something with them. 
                        Smoke?

                                 SEYMOUR
                        I can’t believe this. The very notion of 
                        truffles is that you use un soupçon so as 
                        to not overwhelm the palette and now...   

           He drones on. Paulie tunes out, his face far away. 

           EXT. AIR COMMAND RESTAURANT, BACK LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

           Paulie steps out, sits down on his usual crate. Sighs. Pulls 
           a cigarette from out behind his ear. 

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Thought you were gonna quit. 

           She stands there, hesitant, a hopeful smile on her face. 

           His shock gives way to happiness. 

                                 PAULIE
                        It’s not smoking if we share.

                                 PAM
                        Oh yeah?

                                 PAULIE
                        Yeah.
           She sits opposite him. He lights the cigarette, passes it to 
           her. Old times. 

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        You doing ok?

                                 PAM
                        I am, thank you. You?

                        Good. Well. Good enough.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Pam. I didn’t want to lose 
                        you, and that’s the god’s honest truth. 
                        It was selfish, I know --

                                 PAM
                        It’s ok. I’m sorry too, Paulie. 

                                 PAULIE
                        It ain’t the same without you.

           They smoke in silence a beat.

                                 PAM
                        Paulie.

                                 PAULIE
                        Hm.

                                 PAM
                        Why do love your wife?

                                 PAULIE
                        Jesus. What a question. 
                             (thinks for a beat)
                        She has a nice ass. 

                                 PAM
                        C’mon. That’s not why you love her. 

                                 PAULIE
                        I mean, I can tell you when I feel it. 
                        It’s the small things. Like when I come 
                        home and she’s standing in the hallway. 
                        She turns around and smiles at me. 

                                 PAM
                        You love her cause she’s nice to you? 

                                 PAULIE
                        Fuck no, she’s not nice to me. It’s... 
                        that look.

                        That look that says, “I know you. I know 
                        all of you.” There’s nothing quite like 
                        that. 

           Pam smiles at the image.

                                 PAULIE (cont'd)
                        That’s what you come here for? To ask me 
                        about love?

                                 PAM
                        No.

                                 PAULIE
                             (beat)
                        You ever gonna tell me what happened?

           She takes a drag, hands the cigarette back. Reaches into her 
           pocket, pulls out --

           A NEW WÜSTHOF KNIFE. Hands it over to a surprised Paulie. 

                                 PAM
                        My friend... more like a sister. We 
                        worked together for a while. Over there. 

           Her eyes drift to the truck stop. Something different in her 
           eyes this time. No shame, no disgust. Just a wistful sadness.

           Paulie follows her line of sight. Shocked. Looks back at her. 

                                 PAM (cont'd)
                        Used to think that if I just worked hard 
                        enough, I’d earn the right to outrun my 
                        past. Then she was murdered. And I 
                        realized... you can’t outrun something 
                        that will always be part of you.

           She continues talking. He listens, astonished.

           INT. SPINELLI HOUSE - DAY

           Nikki paws through a pile of mail.

           SUPER: Six months later

           She fans out SHINY BROCHURES on the kitchen table: University 
           of Delaware, University of Pennsylvania, NYU.  

           Grabs a pen and a sticky note. Scribbles something on the 
           sticky. Satisfied, she takes her car keys and leaves.
           CLOSE-UP ON STICKY NOTE: “Mom, Look what arrived! Can’t wait 
           to chat. Going to Charcoal Pit with Bryce. Home by 4. Xo”

           INT. ARNER’S DINER - DAY

           Bustling old-time diner. A sign at the counter: 
           “ORDER OUR WORLD-FAMOUS, HOMEMADE PIES FOR YOUR EVENT. WE 
           WON’T TELL ON YOU!” 

           People in line. Waiting for a table. To buy pie. 

           Pam is the queen bee at the front: cashing out bills, talking 
           to customers, directing the waitstaff. A smile on her face. 
           In her element once again. 

           A COUPLE WITH A BABY stand in front of the line, waiting.

                        Stacy --

           A WAITRESS (20s) appears.

           Pam turns. He’s next in line. Hopeful face.

           MOMENTS LATER

           In a back booth, away from the noise. They stare at each 
           other a beat, Miles not sure how to begin.

                        you. And not cause you worked at some 
                        fancy place. You just... you make people
