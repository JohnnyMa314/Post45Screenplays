          For Kari...
           The sound of a SHEET COMING OFF as we FADE IN on:

           ANNE WEST - 28. Shock and sadness paints her face. Her eyes 
           are coated with tears. After a long moment, she nods.

           INT. MORGUE - DAY - FLASHFORWARD

           And we see the dead face of SAM RIVERS (30s) as the sheet 
           gets pulled back over him by a CORONER.

                                 CORONER
                        I’m so sorry.

           Anne takes a last look at the body, and then without a word, 
           she walks out of the room.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY - FLASHFORWARD

           Shoes click as Anne marches down a hallway.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        It isn’t what you think.

           She comes to a door and opens it.

           INT. STAIRCASE - LATER - FLASHFORWARD

           Anne calmly trots up a staircase - her shoes clicking away on 
           the concrete steps.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        This isn’t the story of how I lost 
                        my husband.

           Click, click, click. One floor. Click, click, click, two. The 
           clicking gets ever fainter as she continues up-

           EXT. ROOF - LATER - FLASHFORWARD

           A door opens and Anne strides out, making a beeline for the 
           edge of the roof.

           She looks out over the side. It’s a long way down.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Or how I took my own life.

           Anne steps off the side of the building. She falls in slow 
           motion, uncaring.
           We fall with her. She closes her eyes before we SMASH-

           TO WHITE. A bright white light - overwhelming in it’s 
           intensity - it holds for a moment until...

           The white light fades and an interface appears amidst the 
           white. There’s blue text. Numbers roll. And the final image 
           of Anne’s life from her perspective is frozen on screen.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP - DAY - FLASHFORWARD

           Anne lies in a HYPERSPACE SLEEP CHAMBER - like a high-tech 
           coffin. She wears a mesh jumpsuit and there are wires all 
           over her head, neck and face.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        This is the story of how I found... 
                        him once again.

           Anne’s eyes pop open. She looks panicked.

           A word appears on screen... HELLO.

           Anne looks at the screen above her eyes. Understanding 
           filters back in. She looks out the side window of her sleep 
           chamber. There are dozens of them in multiple rows...

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        But let’s go back...

           INT. OBSERVATION THEATER - SPACESHIP - DAY

           EARTH fading into the distance, getting smaller and smaller- 

           SUPER: 12 years earlier.

           Anne sits next to JUDY (26) in an observation room full of 
           SETTLERS. Off to a new life. They all watch together as the 
           blue globe disappears into space.

                                 JUDY
                        Wow.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah.

                                 JUDY
                        We’re really doing this?

                                 ANNE
                        Can’t go back now.
           The two women continue to stare into the blackness of space 
           as others around them get up and walk away.

           INT. DORMITORY - SPACESHIP - LATER

           The room has four built-in bunk beds. Like a cruise ship 
           bunking situation. Judy sits next to Anne on a bunk.

                                 JUDY
                        I keep thinking that my future 
                        husband is somewhere on this ship.

                                 ANNE
                        Your future neighbors, co-workers, 
                        friends. They’re all here.

                                 JUDY
                        We won’t really meet them for 
                        twenty years.

           The door opens and VIVIAN (25) steps in. She’s a medical tech 
           and plays the part. She looks down at a handheld screen.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Anne.

           Anne looks to Judy. It’s time. They hug.

                                 ANNE
                        Take care of yourself.

                                 JUDY
                        I’ll see you in training.

           They part and Anne gives Judy a smile as she walks out.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP - LATER

           Anne follows Vivian into the hold. There’s plenty of activity 
           as other techs lead travelers to their chambers.

           Vivian leads Anne to one.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Step on in.

           Anne obliges and Vivian gets to work strapping her in. She 
           hooks up electrodes, puts tubes into veins. 

           It’s a process and Anne tolerates it.
                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I know this isn’t 
                        comfortable.

           Vivian finishes, moves on to calibrating the chamber itself. 
           Anne takes a breath.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay.

                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s going to feel weird going 
                        under, but don’t worry, you’ll get 
                        used to the interface. The AI will 
                        guide you.

                                 ANNE
                        And the simulations?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Are whatever you want. There to 
                        keep your mind active while you’re 
                        asleep.

                                 ANNE
                        I get to choose?

                                 VIVIAN
                        I’ll pull you out sometimes for 
                        training. But most of that happens 
                        as we approach the system.

           Vivian finishes calibrating the chamber.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        Otherwise you can live any life you 
                        want.

                                 ANNE
                        I guess there’s a lot I can do in 
                        twenty years.

                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s more than that. Things move 
                        faster in your sleep. You’ll live a 
                        dozen lives. Try and enjoy it.

           The prospect of this hits Anne.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m going to wake up a different 
                        person, aren’t I?

           Vivian confirms this with a look.
                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s not so bad. You don’t age, and 
                        you get to have experiences you 
                        wouldn’t otherwise have. If it gets 
                        too much, you can opt to sleep.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay.

           Anne lets out a nervous sigh.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Are you ready?

           Anne nods.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah.

           Vivian smiles and... 

           The interface starts up, blue type appearing:

           HELLO.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           Anne looks back out the window. Vivian is gone.

           I AM MUSOKA.
           YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE START OF YOUR FIRST 
           SIMULATION.
           ENTER SPECIFIC VARIABLES NOW.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Like what?

           DATE OF BIRTH. GENDER. PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES. PLANET OF ORIGIN. 
           FAMILY SPECIFICS. PARTNER SPECIFICS...

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I chose to be born in 1986. The 
                        year my Grandmother was born.

           OVER: Sounds of waves crashing on a shore until...

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           YOUNG ANNE (8) stands on the beach looking out at the ocean. 
           The water crashes and her eyes follow the waves as they creep 
           up to her before receding back into the sea.
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        She raised me. Died the year before 
                        I left Earth.

           Anne looks around. The sky. Seagulls. Clouds. Sun. She takes 
           it all in.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        They all start the same. On my 
                        eighth birthday. 

           Arms scoop her up as her FATHER (40s) picks her up and runs 
           out into the sea.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Young Anne blows out candles in exultation as her Father, 
           MOTHER (30s), BROTHER (12) and SISTER (10) look on.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        My new eighth birthday. The one I 
                        wish I’d had.

           Everyone claps as Young Anne beams. Mother starts taking out 
           the candles as Father slices the cake.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Anne - now 18 - sits in class, half-paying attention when... 
           Everything seems to warp. The whole room, all of reality.

           Anne gets up, holding back her vomit as...

           INT. TOILET - DAY

           She lets it go in the bathroom.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        The moment I turned eighteen it all 
                        came rushing back.

           Anne looks around and everything looks distorted.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Who I was. What this was.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Anne reads a book and eats an apple in a cozy chair. She’s 
           the only one in the library except for a LIBRARIAN.
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        A simulation to pass the time as we 
                        bypassed the space between Earth 
                        and Alpha Centauri.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Anne looks around at her Father, Mother, Brother, Sister 
           gathered around for a family meal. They’re all talking, but 
           no sound is heard.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        For some people it might be 
                        intoxicating to know that 
                        everything was made for them.

           EXT. TRAIL - FOREST - DAY

           Anne sits alone on a giant rock just off of the trail.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        But for me, it was dull. What’s the 
                        point of participating in a world 
                        where you’re the only thing that’s 
                        real?

           INT. CITY LIBRARY - DAY

           Anne, now 30, wheels a cart of books down an aisle as she 
           reads. Without looking up, she puts a book back on a shelf.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        So I read. 

           A Patron walks along the aisle toward her.

                                 PATRON
                        Excuse me?

           Anne completely ignores him as she continues to put books 
           back.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Everything I could find. 

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A MOUSE fidgets its whiskers when... A CAT snatches it up 
           like a snack. 
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Cared for a few creatures that were 
                        as indifferent to reality as I was.

           Anne reads on the couch, not noticing the Cat as it scurries 
           off with its snack.

           A knock at the door. Anne looks up.

           MOMENTS LATER -

           She opens the door, checking Tinder on her phone.

                                 ANNE
                        Dave?

           DAVE is sexy. He nods and steps in, closing the door.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Dave and Anne fuck. Stranger sex. Hot but awkward. Hollow 
           moans emanate out of her.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I killed myself at forty-two.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Anne kneels down, opens the oven, and sticks her head inside.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           YOUNG ANNE (8) stands on the beach looking out at the ocean. 
           A wave crashes and her eyes follow the water as it creeps up 
           the incline to her before receding back.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        My second life, I asked not to 
                        know.

           Anne looks around. The sky. Seagulls. Clouds. Sun. Arms scoop 
           her up as her Father runs her out into the sea.

           EXT. OCEAN - YACHT - DAY

           A summer cruise on a yacht. At the front of the boat is a 
           NICE-LOOKING MAN (30s) who catches Anne’s eye.
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I married a lawyer.

           She smiles at him.

           INT. CLASSROM - DAY

           Anne stands at the head of a classroom scrawling mathematics 
           across a chalkboard for a group of grade school kids.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        He didn’t want kids.

           EXT. GARDEN - LATER

           OLD ANNE (75) gardens on her knees.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        And one fall day, I spent too long 
                        plucking weeds in the garden.

           Old Anne falls into the dirt.

           WHITENESS OVERTAKES THE SCREEN.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           The interface fades in. Anne opens her eyes, panicked for a 
           moment when...

           HELLO. 

           A long moment. It comes back...

                                 ANNE
                        Musoka. Holy fuck... 

           Anne tries to calm down, but it’s a rough transition back.

           ADMINISTERING SEDATIVE.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I spent so much of that life 
                        worried about dying...

           Anne’s eyes deaden slightly as the injection goes in. 

           THAT BETTER?

           Anne calms her breath, her heartbeat. All good, she nods.
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Young Anne stands on the beach looking out at the water.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        My third life, I asked to remember 
                        again.

           Arms scoop her up.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Anne, wearing a waitress outfit, walks her way through the 
           diner over to a group of high school boys at a booth. 

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        But I asked Musoka to keep things 
                        interesting... Throw me a curveball 
                        or two.

           She takes out her pad.

                                 ANNE
                        Do you fellas know what you’re 
                        having?

                                 VARSITY BOY
                        Is your father a baker?

                                 ANNE
                        ...what?

                                 VARSITY BOY
                        Because you’ve got nice buns.

                                 ANNE
                        Thank you. They’re original. 1986 
                        special... So. What’ll it be?

           The wit catches the boys off guard. Nobody says anything.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I could come back... If you need a 
                        moment.

                                                      HIGH SCHOOLER
                        VARSITY BOY
           Yeah, that would be-
                                              Maybe just a-

           And Anne is walking away.
           INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Anne wears all black before a mirror in a parlor room.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        My first husband died riding a hot-
                        air balloon. 

           We push in on Anne as she ages before our eyes.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        A tree fell on my second husband.

           Anne is now approaching 50...

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        After my third husband killed 
                        himself, I reset.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne opens her eyes. She looks tired.

           TOO MUCH?

                                 ANNE
                        Yes.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Young Anne stands on the beach looking out at the water.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I decided that just because it 
                        wasn’t real didn’t make things any 
                        less fun.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON - DAY

           The Grand Canyon in all its glory. Anne stands on a cliff 
           above it, looking across the splendor.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        They had crammed the entire world 
                        into a simulation.

           EXT. REDWOODS - DAY

           The height of a Sequoia tree stretches up into the air. Anne 
           looks up it, filled with wonder.
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        This was the closest I’d ever get 
                        to doing any of these things.

           EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

           Anne meanders out to a private jet waiting on the tarmac.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Armed with a trust fund, I set out 
                        to do it all in my fourth life.

           An escalade pulls up and DEBRAH (20s) and her RICH FRIENDS 
           saunter out of the car. They look ready to party.

           Debrah runs forward in her heels and gives Anne a big hug.

           LATER -

           The plane takes off.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Arms, legs and bodies gyrate as booze flows and music thumps.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Perhaps I got distracted along the 
                        way.

           Anne lets loose - her arms like Jell-O as her molly-infused 
           ‘dancing’ reaches a crescendo.

           EXT. STREET - LONDON - NIGHT

           Anne stumbles out of a black car with Debrah onto a London 
           sidewalk. They’re sharing a bottle of something fun. A few 
           years have passed. They wear ‘2014’ glasses.

           INT. NICE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT

           It’s a New Years party. People wear party hats and are 
           drinking and talking as...

           Anne and Debrah walk in. Debrah accosts the RESIDENT.

                                 DEBRAH
                        Bathroom?
           The Resident points down the hall and Debrah hurries that 
           way. Anne follows after her, drinking out of the bottle.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        And that’s when I met him.

           She watches as the bathroom door opens and Debrah pushes a 
           GUY out of the way to go inside first.

                                 DEBRAH
                        Nope...

                                 GUY
                        Okay...

           Anne approaches the Guy. The Guy takes Anne in.

                                 GUY (CONT'D)
                        Your friend?

                                 ANNE
                        She has a weak bladder. Sorry.

                                 GUY
                             (annoyed)
                        I can tell.

           He notices her 2014 glasses.

                                 GUY (CONT'D)
                        Nice glasses.

           There’s a touch of sarcasm to his tone. Anne ignores it.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh thanks. They’re topical.

           Like she’s explaining New Years to him... Her instantaneous 
           wit is too much for the Guy. 

           He breaks down. Hard laughs. Not giggling. Not polite 
           smiling. We’re talking knee-slapping LAUGHTER.

           Anne takes him in. He’s tall. Not bad-looking. And he gets 
           her jokes. What interesting programming...

           Debrah comes out of the bathroom. She looks at Anne, then at 
           the Guy who has finally calmed down.

                                 GUY
                        Did you make it?

           Debrah rolls her eyes and walks away. The Guy calls after 
           her.
                                 GUY (CONT'D)
                        Should I look out for puddles 
                        inside?

           The Guy motions for Anne to go.

                                 GUY (CONT'D)
                        Please. After you...

                                 ANNE
                        Really?
                             (off his nod)
                        I’ll warn you if there’s a puddle.

           Anne smiles at him, then walks inside.

           INT. APARTMENT - LONDON - LATER

           Anne eyes the Guy from across the room. He’s talking to a few 
           of his own friends, drinking a beer. 

           He looks up and spots her gaze. She looks away fast. Too 
           late. He’s walking over.

                                 GUY
                        I haven’t laughed that hard in a 
                        long time.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m so glad I could help.

           The Guy smiles, sticks out his hand.

                                 SAM
                        Sam.

           She extends her hand like he should kiss it.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m Anne.

           Sam takes her hand, hesitates...

                                 SAM
                        I should warn you. I have wet lips. 
                        It could leave a mark.

                                 ANNE
                        Enchanté.

           Sam kisses her hand. Anne pulls it away.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Swallow my whole hand, why don’t 
                        ya’?

                                 SAM
                        You were warned.

                                 ANNE
                        Not nearly enough.

                                 SAM
                        Me thinks the lady doth protest too 
                        much.

           She smiles at him.

                                 ANNE
                        What do you do, Sam?

                                 SAM
                        I’m a writer. You?

                                 ANNE
                        A consultant. What do you write?

                                 SAM
                        Articles to pay the bills. Novels 
                        for me.

                                 ANNE
                        Like what?

                                 SAM
                        Victorian-era romances, actually...

           Anne laughs. She can’t tell what’s truth or lies with him.

                                 ANNE
                        Anything I would have read?

                                 SAM
                        No, they’re all shit.

           Anne looks at him intensely for an extra beat, then-

                                 ANNE
                        Are you real?

                                 SAM
                             (taken aback)
                        I think so?
                                 ANNE
                        I know that they group some of us 
                        together - that it’s possible to 
                        run in to someone else.

                                 SAM
                        Another real person?

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah.

                                 SAM
                        I guess we are a rare breed... a 
                        ton of fake people out there.

                                 ANNE
                        There’s a lot of us flying to Alpha 
                        Centauri...

           This causes Sam to laugh. He thinks she’s joking. Anne’s a 
           bit let down. He’s not real or...

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Maybe you just don’t remember.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe I don’t.

           She takes an extra moment to try and read him, but still 
           can’t figure him out. She’s disappointed.

                                 ANNE
                        Well, I’ll... see you later. Thanks 
                        for letting me pee in front of you.

                                 SAM
                        Phrasing, and...

           Sam gives her a bow.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Anytime, my lady.

           Anne walks over toward Debrah, but as she does so, she gives 
           him a departing look.

           LATER -

           Anne is back with Debrah as... The NEW YEAR’S countdown 
           begins. 10...9...

                                 DEBRAH
           Anne doesn’t count. It seems pretty meaningless. 6...5...4... 
           Debrah nudges Anne.

                                 ANNE

                          DEBRAH
                                                          ANNE (CONT'D)
                                              Happy new year.
           Happy New Year!

           And there is Sam.

                                 SAM
                        Hi.

           He slides an arm around Anne’s lower back - perfectly 
           positioned for a kiss.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Happy new year.

           He leans in. Anne resists. Sam stops. Then... Anne pulls him 
           in the rest of the way. They kiss. Hard. It’s SEXY A.F.

           Everyone around them finishes their kisses, drinks, toasts, 
           but THEY continue to make out.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

           Anne and Sam pull clothing off as they make their way on to 
           the bed.

           Anne breaks away, feeling a bit awkward.

                                 ANNE
                        Uh, so, uh...

                                 SAM
                        There’s no sex tonight. We’re both 
                        too drunk.

           Anne smiles.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay.

           They go back at it.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        We spent the next three days 
                        together.
           INT. LONDON EYE - DAY

           Anne and Sam ride inside the gondola that is the London Eye - 
           taking in the crisp view of the city.

           INT. MUSEUM - LONDON - DAY

           Anne stares up at a portrait of an Elizabethan woman. Sam 
           sneaks up behind her, hugs her from behind.

                                 SAM
                        Are you having a staring contest?

                                 ANNE
                        Shh... I’m winning.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Sam and Anne sit in a corner table with grub and pints. A 
           goal is scored on the TV and the bar GOES NUTS. Anne smiles 
           at Sam, takes a big bite out of her burger.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Anne and Sam dash through a train door before it closes.

           INT. TRAIN - LATER

           The train travels through the lush English countryside - 
           every shade of green for miles.

           EXT. STREET - SEAFORD - LATER

           Sam and Anne walk hand and hand through the quaint seaside 
           town of Seaford.

           EXT. SEVEN SISTERS - DUSK

           Sam and Anne stand looking out at the view of the Seven 
           Sisters spreading out into the distance. The White Cliffs 
           reflect the pink sunset. It’s absolutely lovely.

           INT. INN ROOM - NIGHT

           Anne watches Sam from the bed as he brushes his teeth in the 
           bathroom.
                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        We kissed. We snuggled. But he 
                        never once tried to sleep with me. 
                        Like he knew it wasn’t time...

           Sam finishes brushing his teeth.

                                 SAM
                        I challenge you. To the game of 
                        Life... I saw it downstairs.

                                 ANNE
                        I’ve never been challenged to a 
                        board game before... What are the 
                        terms?

                                 SAM
                        That we play in our pajamas.

                                 ANNE
                        Then, I accept.

           Sam smiles.

           LATER - 

           Anne & Sam play the game of Life. In their pajamas. 

           MOV: Anne doesn’t like a card she draws and puts it back in 
           the pile, taking the next one and moving her piece illegally. 
           Sam laughs, letting her get away with it.

           LATER -

           Sam lies asleep. Anne watches him, looking at the contours of 
           his face. She really takes it in. 

           This is something she hasn’t felt before. It might be a 
           simulation, but it feels real to her in this moment. Special.

           Finally, she lies back down, closes her eyes.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        And then...

           MORNING -

           Anne wakes. Sam isn’t there. She looks around. There’s no 
           sign of him. In fact, his luggage is gone. And his clothes.
           She gets up, rubs the sleep from her eyes, walks over to the 
           bathroom where... All of his stuff is gone.

           INT. INN - LOBBY - LATER

           Anne stands before the FRONT DESK.

                                 FRONT DESK
                        Can I help you?

                                 ANNE
                        Yes, hi, I was here with a man... 
                        Do you know what time he left?

                                 FRONT DESK
                        Your room?

                                 ANNE
                        Twelve...

           The Front Desk checks the computer.

                                 FRONT DESK
                        I’m sorry, it only has you on here.

           Anne swallows, this is weird.

                                 ANNE
                        Really... He made the reservation.

           The Front Desk looks again.

                                 FRONT DESK
                        I’m sorry...

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        He was gone.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           A reflection of Anne in the train window as she stares out 
           forlornly at the English countryside.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Like he was never even there.

           Anne looks down at her phone. She’s texted him three times. 
           Nothing back.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Two years later, I fell off a moped 
                        in Thailand.
           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne’s eyes pop open. 

           HELLO. 

           Her terror fades as she stares at the blue screen above her.

                                 ANNE
                        Is there any way to make dying less 
                        painful?

           WITH LESS PAIN COMES LESS OVERALL SENSATION.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Meaning?

           THE SEX IS BAD. 

           Anne laughs. A moment.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Musoka, you are the weirdest AI, 
                        you know that?

           THANK YOU.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        No, thank you.

           SO? WHAT’S NEXT?

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Same as the last one, then.

           She closes her eyes...

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           And opens. Young Anne stands on the beach looking out at the 
           water. Her Father picks her up into a bear hug and they go 
           splashing into the sea.

           INT. ANNE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

           DARLA (17) takes a hit and then passes the bowl over to Anne 
           in her teenage bedroom.

                                 DARLA
                        Happy eighteen, bitch.
           Something clicks in Anne’s eyes. She looks down at the weed, 
           and then up at Darla.

                                 DARLA (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 ANNE
                        I have to go. There’s a whole world 
                        I’m supposed to see...

           Anne gets up and walks out of the room...

           EXT. MACHU PICCHU - DAY

           Onto a ledge above Machu Picchu. Backpacking. She’s at a 
           dizzying height. Fearless, she walks right up to the edge.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        If at first you don’t succeed.

           EXT. REEF - DAY

           Bubbles break up to the surface of the water. Down below, 
           Anne snorkels, swimming down to a turtle before she surfaces.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Do it in your next life.

           She takes off her mask and raises her head up, basking in the 
           sunshine.

           EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY

           Anne sits in a large outdoor temple. Think Angkor Wat. She 
           eats a sandwich as she soaks up her surroundings.

           Two MISSIONARIES walk up and sit down near her, unwrap their 
           own lunch. A moment as the three of them sit in silence. Eat.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        What do you think of all this?

           Anne takes a second to realize that he’s asking her.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s pretty cool.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        To think these people built all of 
                        this in worship of a false idol.
                                 ANNE
                        I’m glad they did.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        It is beautiful.

                                 ANNE
                        It makes me feel... love.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        If only there had been missionaries 
                        to guide them to the gospel.

           Anne doesn’t like this guy’s tone. A mischievous look takes 
           over her face.

                                 ANNE
                        They couldn’t have known that all 
                        of this is for me.

           That throws the Older Missionary a bit.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        Are you a Christian?

                                 ANNE
                        No, and... you’re not going to be 
                        able to convert me, but thank you. 
                        It’s a kind thought.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        God gave his only son so that we 
                        may know forgiveness. All you need 
                        do is believe in him.

                                 ANNE
                        Or her... In fact, it’s only a her. 
                        Specifically, me.

           The Older Missionary looks offended. Anne doesn’t notice. 
           This has got her thinking now.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I mean... I’m not all controlling. 
                        Unless I’m somehow controlling you 
                        right now. Do you feel like I’m 
                        controlling you?

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        No...

                                 ANNE
                        Right? So that’s a strike against, 
                        and yet... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        when my life ends, all of this will 
                        disappear to form again when I’m 
                        reborn. So... I think that’s got to 
                        count for something, right? Like, 
                        maybe I’m a demigod?

           She’s asking herself more than she’s asking him. The 
           Missionaries start to pack up their lunch.

                                 OLDER MISSIONARY
                        We’ll pray for you. All is forgiven 
                        through Jesus Christ.

           They walk away.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m going to specifically request 
                        not to bring you back! 

           She yells it after them. A moment, and then a voice speaks up 
           behind her.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        That. Was. Brilliant.

           Anne turns, and there is Sam. She stands up, in shock.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Who goes to another religion’s 
                        temple so they can talk about how 
                        wrong they are? I mean, really.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s you.

           Anne trots over and hugs Sam.

                                 SAM
                        Woah, I, uh... Okay, then.

           They part. 

                                 ANNE
                        What the fuck happened to you? Did 
                        you move on to a new simulation or 
                        something?

           Sam has no idea what’s happening.

                                 SAM
                        I... What?

           Anne studies him.
                                 ANNE
                        We’ve never met?

                                 SAM
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 ANNE
                        But your name is Sam.

           Sam looks spooked.

                                 SAM
                        Okay... that’s weird... I just... 
                        overheard you and... How the hell 
                        do you know my name?

           Anne slows it down.

                                 ANNE
                        You want to join me?

           She motions toward her spot. They sit down.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I think we met once before. Years 
                        ago. In London.

                                 SAM
                        Well, I’m sorry, I... don’t 
                        remember.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s so strange that you keep 
                        requesting to forget. I tried it 
                        once, and... totally not for me.

                                 SAM
                        I’m really not following you.

                                 ANNE
                        Of course you’re not. Let me start 
                        from the beginning...

           EXT. ANGKOR WAT - LATER

           They walk out through the front entrance back to the road 
           past the pond out front.
                                 SAM
                        So you’re asking hypothetically, if 
                        I were on my way to Alpha Centauri, 
                        and my mind was in a simulation, 
                        why would I not want to remember my 
                        actual circumstances?

                                 ANNE
                        Yes. In this ‘hypothetical 
                        situation.’ Totally hypothetical.

                                 SAM
                        I would say... Maybe I’m looking to 
                        discover a new part of myself, 
                        or... maybe I want to change.

                                 ANNE
                        You don’t think all of this would 
                        change you?

                                 SAM
                        Not as much. It’s probably more 
                        interesting that way. More honest.

                                 ANNE
                        Well, I can’t wait to meet the real 
                        you, whenever they wake us up for 
                        one of these training sessions.

           Sam gives her a long look as they near the road where all the 
           drivers have parked their cars.

                                 SAM
                        I think you’re a bit nuts, but... I 
                        like your crazy. A lot.

           He takes her by the hand. They kiss. It’s nice.

                                 ANNE
                        I like you too. I did last time 
                        around as well.

           A FANCY DRIVER approaches Sam.

                                 FANCY DRIVER
                        Mr. Rivers. Are you ready to return 
                        to the hotel?

                                 SAM
                        Yes, um...
                             (to Anne)
                        Can I give you a ride?
                                 ANNE
                        I asked to be rich in my last 
                        life... Didn’t work for me, though. 
                        Too many drugs.

                                 FANCY DRIVER
                        I’ll... wait for you by the car, 
                        sir.

           Sam nods, the Fancy Driver walks back over to the vehicle.

                                 SAM
                        Where are you staying?

                                 ANNE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Great place. Rats come free with 
                        every room.

                                 SAM
                        Well... would you like to come back 
                        with me? 
                             (flushing at the prospect)
                        I’m also happy to get you a 
                        separate room, it’s really no 
                        problem.

                                 ANNE
                        Let me think about it... Uh, yeah, 
                        duh. Let’s go.

           She walks past him toward the car, and he follows her with a 
           smile on his face.

           INT. FCC HOTEL SIEM REAP - NIGHT

           Sam and Anne have dinner staring out at the night as it pours 
           outside. They’re dressed nicely now - mid meal - a good 
           bottle of wine, excellent food. It’s a moment of bliss.

                                 ANNE
                        This is... so nice.

           Sam smiles.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So, how did you...?

                                 SAM
                        My family. I haven’t done anything 
                        other than continue to manage what 
                        was given to me. My parents died 
                        when I was young.
                                 ANNE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t be... It was a long time 
                        ago... And apparently I’m not 
                        really even here.

                                 ANNE
                        Your experience still matters. 
                        You’ll remember it when you wake 
                        up.

           A moment.

                                 SAM
                        What if I’m not one of the people 
                        on your ship?

                                 ANNE
                        What do you mean?

                                 SAM
                        What if... I’m just a part of your 
                        simulation.

           Anne stops herself from scoffing.

                                 ANNE
                        This is the second time I’ve met 
                        you... the odds of the AI randomly 
                        creating you twice is... 
                        ridiculous.

           Sam drinks some more of his wine.

                                 SAM
                        But if I was. You’d bring me back, 
                        right?

           Anne takes a delicious sip of her wine, a twinkle of mischief 
           in her eye.

                                 ANNE
                        Depends on how the rest of this 
                        evening goes.

           She smiles a wicked smile at him. He can’t help but grin.

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - LATER

           Anne’s face. Aglow. Elated. Satisfied. Orgasmic. She rides 
           Sam - their faces mere inches away from each other. 
           Sweat falls. Moans spill out. This is TRANSCENDENT SEX.

           LATER -

           It goes on.

           LATER -

           And on.

           LATER -

           A sex tornado has torn through the room. Nothing is where it 
           should be. 

           Except Anne. Next to Sam. In a puddle on the floor.

           There are no words. So they breathe. And sweat. She licks his 
           face. He doesn’t even react. A long moment.

                                 SAM
                        So? Would you? Bring me back?

                                 ANNE
                        Absolutely.

           Sam smiles. Enough said, they start making out once again.

           LATER -

           Sam stirs from sleep. Anne’s staring at him.

                                 SAM
                        What?

                                 ANNE
                        Last time I fell asleep in a bed 
                        with you, you disappeared from 
                        existence.

                                 SAM
                        I’m not going anywhere.

                                 ANNE
                        Promise?

                                 SAM
                        Yes.

           He closes his eyes, and finally... she closes hers too. 
           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne’s eyes open. There’s a blue screen hovering over her.

           HELLO.

           Shit. She’s back.

                                 ANNE
                        What... Did I die in my sleep?

           TRAINING SESSION BEGINS IN 5 MINUTES.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck.

           She’s sort of pissed at the timing. But then...

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Actually... I’ll see him there. And 
                        this time he’ll remember me.

           COMMENCING.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Anne opens her eyes. She sits in the middle of an 
           amphitheater classroom. At the head of the class there’s a 
           TEACHER. There are a number of OTHER STUDENTS.

                                 TEACHER
                        Hello everyone. I hope you’re 
                        enjoying your simulations.

           Judy appears nearby. Anne waves at her.

                                 ANNE
                        Judy...

                                 JUDY
                        Hi.

           They both smile enthusiastically but keep their voices low.

                                 TEACHER
                        They’ll be a few sessions 
                        throughout the day. Mostly to catch 
                        you up on galactic history while 
                        you’ve been asleep for the past six 
                        years. Then you’ll break into your 
                        terraforming subset specialties.
           Anne looks over at Judy and mouths ‘Oh, my God.’ Judy mouths, 
           ‘Six years?’

                                 TEACHER (CONT'D)
                        It’ll be followed by a brief social 
                        hour before you’re all returned to 
                        your simulative state... Now...

           She hits a switch and a giant hologram appears. Judy and Anne 
           pay attention.

           EXT. SURREAL LAWN - DAY

           A garden party for thousands of people. The sky looks 
           painted. Surreal. People eat, drink, and chat.

           Anne and Judy talk with cocktails in hand.

                                 JUDY
                        This champagne isn’t real. Which is 
                        amazing... No calories.

           She slugs back the rest of it and exchanges it for another 
           glass of champagne carried by a passing waiter.

                                 ANNE
                        How have you spent the last six 
                        years?

                                 JUDY
                        On beaches. And boats. With men... 
                        Mostly men... I’m not sure I ever 
                        want to arrive.

           Anne smiles. So Judy.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        And you, my darling?

                                 ANNE
                        Many new experiences.

                                 JUDY
                        Of the sexual variety?

                                 ANNE
                        Mostly travel...

           Judy gives her a look. She wants something juicy.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        But there is this one guy. I think 
                        he’s around here somewhere.
                                 JUDY
                        You found another traveler?

                                 ANNE
                        His name is Sam. We’ve run into 
                        each other twice.

                                 JUDY
                        You two are in sync.

           Anne blushes. Judy smiles.

                                 ANNE
                        He doesn’t take any memories into 
                        his lives...

                                 JUDY
                        Wow... Weird. Actually, he sounds 
                        perfect for you.

           Judy grabs Anne by the arm.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Let’s find him.

           Judy leads Anne across the party to their Teacher.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Excuse me.

           The Teacher turns.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        We’re looking for someone. Is there 
                        a way you can help us find him 
                        quicker than looking through all...

           Judy motions to the mob of people. The Teacher opens a 
           hologram with a flick.

                                 TEACHER
                        What’s their name?

           Judy looks to Anne.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam.

           Three faces appear. None of them are her Sam.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Nope. None of them are him.

           The Teacher closes the hologram.
                                 TEACHER
                        Then he’s not on the ship. Excuse, 
                        me.

           She walks away.

                                 ANNE
                        Maybe he’s not named Sam? Made up a 
                        new name for himself?

                                 JUDY
                        Yeah... Come on.

           Judy leads Anne through the crowds. 

           LATER -

           Anne searches male face after male face as they walk through 
           the giant party. He’s nowhere to be seen.

                                 ANNE
                        He’s not here...

           They come to the end and something catches Anne’s eye. A 
           WAITER walking by. It’s Sam. Holy shit. Anne approaches.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Sam.

           He turns.

                                 SAM
                        You know my name. That means you 
                        win...  Another free glass of 
                        champagne!

           He offers her the tray. She ignores the gesture.

                                 ANNE
                        What are you doing in-

           She stops herself as she realizes... Sam is a waiter here 
           which means... Sam is a simulated person. Oh, fuck.

                                 SAM
                        Or are you looking for hors 
                        d’oeuvres? I can track some down 
                        for you if you give me a second. 
                        You look like a mini-grilled-cheese 
                        type of lady. Am I right?

           Anne smiles. He’s still awesome. Despite not being real.
                                 ANNE
                        Yes.

                                 SAM
                        Stay right here. I’ll be back.

           He gives her a smile and walks away, stopping to give someone 
           else a glass of champagne. 

           Anne stares after him, open mouthed. Judy approaches.

                                 JUDY
                        Was that...?

           Anne nods.

                                 ANNE
                        He seems so real...

                                 JUDY
                        Oh my god. Honey, you’ve fallen for 
                        computer code...

           Judy starts to laugh, but seeing Anne hurt, she stops, gives 
           her an empathetic look.

                                 ANNE
                        This is the third time he’s shown 
                        up. Have you ever met the same 
                        simulated person more than once?

                                 JUDY
                        Only those I request to be there. 

           Anne continues to watch Sam. 

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        You’ve got to forget about him, 
                        hon. He’s not real...

           A long moment. Anne doesn’t say anything.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        How about this... Let’s ask Musoka 
                        to put us in the same simulation. 
                        They’ll return us from training at 
                        the same time, so it’ll be easy.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay...
                                 JUDY
                        Afterward, we can kill ourselves 
                        together... sync up for the rest of 
                        the trip.

           Anne’s still watching Sam.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Anne?

           Anne looks at her.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah, no, that sounds good.

           She smiles. Judy smiles back. They sip their champagne.

                                                         FADE TO WHITE.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           We’re back on the beach with Young Anne, staring out over the 
           water.

           She looks around. The sky. Seagulls. Clouds. Sun. Arms scoop 
           her up as her Father runs her out into the sea.

           EXT. YACHT - DAY

           It’s a party on a boat. Like a rap video. At the top of the 
           boat are Anne and Judy. They sunbath. There’s a couple 
           bottles of champagne and a delicious spread between them.

           Judy gets up, grabs a bottle and starts to shake it up. She 
           looks out below and shouts over the music.

                                 JUDY
                        Are you ready!?!?!

           The crowd cheers and Judy shakes the champagne harder before 
           she uncorks it and champagne goes flying down over the crowd.

           After it’s kicked, she lies back down, fisting what’s left in 
           the bottle.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Now... will it be Diego, Armando or 
                        Hans tonight?
                             (she thinks)
                        Or all three...
           Anne gets up.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 ANNE
                        I need to get some sleep. My head’s 
                        pounding.

           Judy shrugs as she raises her bottle for the final sip.

                                 JUDY
                        Suit yourself.

           Anne does, walking down the staircase.

           EXT. WATER - LATER

           A small boat takes Anne back to shore.

           INT. FANCY HOTEL LOBBY - LATER

           Anne walks through the hotel lobby. The RECEPTIONIST sees her 
           coming.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Ms. West... Ms. West.

           Anne finally hears, turns.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                        There’s someone here to see you.

           The Receptionist motions behind Anne in the lounge area. And 
           there is Sam, walking over directly to Anne.

           She’s stunned...

                                 ANNE
                        How is it that you always catch me 
                        off guard?

                                 SAM
                        You know me?

                                 ANNE
                        Your name’s Sam. We’ve met three 
                        times before.

           Sam looks at her for a long moment.
                                 SAM
                        Have we?

           Anne’s confused.

                                 ANNE
                        What are you doing here?

           Realizing that she’s wasting her time...

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        What am I doing?

           She turns to go.

                                 SAM
                        I’ve dreamt of you every night, for 
                        as long as I can remember.

           Anne stops. Turns back.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Can I buy you a drink?

           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

           Anne and Sam sit side by side at the bar with mixed drinks.

                                 ANNE
                        How did you find me?

                                 SAM
                        I saw your face, on a magazine, one 
                        of those near the checkout. There 
                        you were. Real. Outside of my 
                        dream. So I tracked you down... 
                        social media makes things easy.

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t know what to say... 

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know what I was expecting. 
                        I’m surprised you’re still talking 
                        to me to be honest.

           Anne smiles. She can’t help but like him.

                                 ANNE
                        Tell me about one of your dreams.
                                 SAM
                        There’s so many... Most of the time 
                        we’re doing things together. 
                        Adventures. I’ve dreamt of our 
                        wedding, our kids... Sometimes I’m 
                        working. Like I’m a waiter. And 
                        there’s this one where we’re in 
                        this open temple, a place I’ve 
                        never been... Sometimes when I’m 
                        there, it’s like I can’t remember 
                        you... Other times you’re talking 
                        to these two rude missionaries...

                                 ANNE
                        We talk about a ship to Alpha 
                        Centauri. We go back to your hotel, 
                        have dinner and shag for hours.

           Sam’s stunned.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve had that same dream... in a 
                        way.

           Sam looks rattled. He takes a breath.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know if that’s a relief...

           Anne leans in, gets the Bartender’s attention.

                                 ANNE
                        Barkeep. We’re gonna’ need 
                        something stronger.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - LATER

           Sam and Anne sit in her hotel while looking out at a view of 
           the beach. There’s a bottle of vodka between them now.

                                 ANNE
                        Did you have a dream where we met 
                        on New Years?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. We went to the Seven Sisters.

                                 ANNE
                        What happened after that?

                                 SAM
                        That one ends when I fall asleep in 
                        an Inn in Seaford.
                                 ANNE
                        There’s nothing else?

                                 SAM
                        No... What do you think is 
                        happening? Why are we dreaming of 
                        each other?

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t know.

           Anne looks away. It’s a half lie. She knows more than him.

                                 SAM
                        And why do I have dreams of us that 
                        you haven’t had?

           This time she doesn’t have to lie...

                                 ANNE
                        That I can’t explain.

           The door opens.

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        You know, the noise was starting to 
                        get to me too, so...

           Judy comes around the corner, stops in her tracks at the 
           sight of Sam.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        What’s he doing here?

           Sam gets up, extends his hand to Judy.

                                 SAM
                        Hi, I’m Sam.

           Judy doesn’t take his hand, looks to Anne instead.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam’s been having dreams about me. 
                        He tracked me down.

           Judy looks between them and then walks off to her bedroom.

           Sam looks to Anne: ‘what just happened?’ Anne sighs, her 
           looks says ‘Don’t worry. Give me a sec.’

           Sam nods, sits back down, Anne follows Judy into-
           INT. HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Her hotel bedroom. Anne closes the door behind her.

                                 JUDY
                        I can’t believe you asked Musoka to 
                        send him here...

                                 ANNE
                        I didn’t.

           Judy rolls her eyes.

                                 JUDY
                        Come on...

                                 ANNE
                        Judy... This wasn’t me.

           Judy believes her now, but...

                                 JUDY
                        Then something’s wrong. He’s broken 
                        programming...

           Judy walks over to the window, unlatches it.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        We should reset - ask Musoka to 
                        erase him.

           Judy steps up onto the window ledge and beckons for Anne to 
           join her.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Come on...

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t... I have to figure out 
                        what this is.

           Judy steps back down, turns to face Anne.

                                 JUDY
                        What do you mean, what this is? He 
                        doesn’t exist, Anne. He’s computer 
                        code... ones and zeroes.

           Judy puts out her hand...

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Come on.
                                 ANNE
                        In my last life, I told him what 
                        all of this was. He didn’t believe 
                        me, but...

           Judy gives her a look: ‘what?’

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        He made me promise that I’d bring 
                        him back if he wasn’t real.

                                 JUDY
                        Okay... Well... I want to go, so...

           Judy puts out her hand and steps back up to the window. Anne 
           doesn’t budge.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Are you really going to choose it 
                        over me? I’m real. Remember what’s 
                        real? Us together, on a ship, 
                        traveling across the galaxy...

           Judy gives her an impatient look.

                                 ANNE
                        I know. I’m sorry.

           Judy scoffs, even laughs a bit.

                                 JUDY
                        Wow. Then fuck you.

           Judy jumps. Anne closes her eyes. It sounds like a truck 
           exploding when Judy hits the ground.

           Sam bursts through the bedroom door. He looks at Anne, then 
           works his way over to the window and looks down.

                                 SAM
                        Holy fuck.

           He turns back to Anne, who sighs.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           An OFFICER walks out with bagged possessions. A DETECTIVE 
           closes up his pad.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’ll let you know if we need 
                        anything else.
           Anne nods. The Detective takes a final look at her, then Sam, 
           and then walks out. Anne closes the door behind them.

           Anne goes over and pours herself a shot of vodka. 

                                 ANNE
                        She is such a drama queen.

           Then slugs back the shot. She sits down at the table. Pours 
           herself another. Sam watches, unsure of what to say or do.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Sit...

           Sam obliges. She pours him a shot.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Na Zdorovie.

           They drink.

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry about your friend... If 
                        you want to be alone...

                                 ANNE
                        Oh, no. It’s fine. She’s fine...

           She looks at him, decides to suck it up.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I have a story to tell you. You 
                        won’t believe me. But let me tell 
                        it anyway.

                                 SAM
                        Okay.

           Off Anne, worried about how this is going to go.

           LATER -

           Sam stands at the balcony door, staring out at the sun as it 
           sets. He’s pondering what he’s been told.

           Anne watches him from the table.

                                 ANNE
                        Are you okay?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah...
           A moment.

                                 ANNE
                        Do you have anything you want to 
                        ask me?

           A moment. Then Sam turns to her.

                                 SAM
                        Do I exist when I’m not with you?

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t know how it works.

                                 SAM
                        And the dreams?

                                 ANNE
                        You’re remembering past lives.

                                 SAM
                        And the ones you said didn’t 
                        happen?

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t explain all of it.

           Sam turns away, looking back out at the sunset again.

                                 SAM
                        Am I conscious or is this just... 
                        programming?

                                 ANNE
                        You’re probably the only part of 
                        all this that’s actually self-
                        aware. Somehow, you did that.

           A long moment.

                                 SAM
                        So what now... What do we, uh... 
                        How do we figure this out?

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t think there’s anything more 
                        to figure out. Not here anyway. 
                        When I get back I can ask the AI.

                                 SAM
                        What if it decides I’m an error, 
                        that I shouldn’t exist?
                                 ANNE
                        Where I come from... There’s no 
                        guarantee of anything - no creator 
                        we know of definitively - no way of 
                        coming back, being reincarnated. We 
                        all die. One way or another.

                                 SAM
                        So you think it’s worth the risk?

                                 ANNE
                        I think that Musoka will try to 
                        help. So long as you’re making me 
                        happy, and keeping me healthily 
                        occupied on my journey, you’re not 
                        in any danger.

                                 SAM
                        As long as I keep you happy.

           Sam laughs. This is... surreal.

                                 ANNE
                        That’s not what I meant...

           A moment. Anne regroups.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t we try us out? We’ve 
                        never gotten more than a few days 
                        together. Maybe this time it’ll be 
                        different.

           A moment.

                                 SAM
                        This is a lot to take in.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam, I don’t know what’ll happen if 
                        you leave.

           Sam gathers his belongings.

                                 SAM
                        Or if I stay... I’m sorry.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam...

           Anne wants to say more to stop him, but no words come out. 
           Sam leaves and Anne watches him go.
           Then she walks over to the table and pours herself a new 
           drink. She looks small and alone in the giant hotel suite.

           INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Anne sits at a table: Queen of the club. People sit on either 
           side of her, talking. She stares straight ahead, bored.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Ducks fly overhead. Anne raises a shotgun and fires. Knocks a 
           duck out of the sky. She yawns, exchanges the empty shotgun 
           for a loaded one from her HELPER.

           EXT. AIRPLANE - SKY - DAY

           A SKYDIVING INSTRUCTOR and Anne jump out of an airplane. Air 
           rushes past them. Anne’s not impressed.

           INT. ART SHOW - NIGHT

           A post-modernist painting. Maybe it’s good. Maybe not. None 
           of us really know. Anne stares at it.

           An ARTIST walks over to her. Anne doesn’t even bother looking 
           at her...

                                 ANNE
                        I’ll take them all.

           EXT. FIELD - GUN RANGE - DAY

           The paintings have been arranged in a field. 

           Anne wears glasses. She hefts a bazooka onto her shoulder and 
           fires. They explode into the air.

           It’s not satisfying.

           INT. HALL - LATER

           A large hall. There’s a cocktail party going on, but Anne’s 
           too preoccupied staring out a window into the dark to notice. 

           A SAGE MAN (50s) notices Anne standing alone and approaches.
                                 SAGE MAN
                        I don’t know who it is who’s 
                        occupying the thoughts of such a 
                        beautiful woman. But I’d like to 
                        meet the lucky man.

           Anne looks up. This gets her attention. Finally, something 
           somewhat interesting.

                                 ANNE
                        He left a year ago. I thought I 
                        would have heard from him by now.

                                 SAGE MAN
                        Who says you have to wait for him?

                                 ANNE
                        You don’t understand the situation.

                                 SAGE MAN
                        No, but I gather that a woman like 
                        you often gets their way... 
                        Sometimes you have to fight for the 
                        people you love.

           This hits Anne. 

                                 ANNE
                        Who are you that you think you can 
                        talk to me that way?

           The Sage Man sees that perhaps he’s spoken out of turn...

                                 SAGE MAN
                        I meant no offense. For what it’s 
                        worth, I wouldn’t be with my wife 
                        of twenty-five years if she hadn’t 
                        set me straight... Best of luck.

           He walks away. Anne watches him go, the wheels turning in her 
           head.

           INT. ANNE’S LARGE DRAWING ROOM - LATER

           Anne peruses on her laptop having googled Sam. A website 
           about Buddhist temples appears and she clicks on the link. 
           There he is, a picture of Sam in white robes.

           Anne stares at him for a long moment before she scrolls down 
           to the location of the temple: Indonesia.
           EXT. INDONESIAN TEMPLE - DAY

           An ornate temple. Anne stands at the bottom of the steps, 
           looking up. A line of monks walk past her, climbing the 
           stairs. ONE of them stops, turns, stares at Anne.

           He takes a step toward her, really looking at her. He studies 
           every part of her, her eyes, head, legs, arms, hair...

           Abruptly, he gets down on his knees and lowers his head all 
           the way to the step and starts to pray. It’s unnerving.

                                 ANNE
                        Please. Get up.

           One finally rises. Scared. Doesn’t make eye contact.

                                 ONE
                        If it pleases. Come with me.

           He turns abruptly and walks down a path away from the temple.

           EXT. HOUSE BY A RIVER - LATER

           They arrive at a house in the woods. There’s a sound of a 
           river nearby. One leads Anne up the steps and opens the door 
           before lowering his head and beckoning her to enter.

           INT. HOUSE BY A RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           She walks in. Inside, there’s a spacious, spiritual space. 
           Wooden construction. Smells of the outside. Cool. Clean.

           There’s a lunch spread out on a table. The HEAD MONK eats 
           alongside... SAM. He looks up, startled, as she enters.

           Anne pauses when she sees him. One walks in behind her, 
           prompting her to continue forward.

           The Head Monk rises. Along with Sam. They bow their heads at 
           her entry. Anne doesn’t look away from Sam.

                                 HEAD MONK
                        Please...

           He beckons her to join them.

           She walks over and sits by them. Anne looks to Sam but his 
           cheeks flush and he averts his gaze.

                                 HEAD MONK (CONT'D)
                        It is an honor to meet the dreamer.
                                 ANNE
                        It’s an honor to be here.

           She looks back to Sam, but he’s still not looking at her.

                                 HEAD MONK
                        I shall leave you to the purpose 
                        that brought you to us.

           The Head Monk looks to Sam, bows his head to Anne, and then 
           he gets up, leaving with One.

           A long moment. Anne goes to open her mouth-

                                 SAM
                        I dreamt this. This conversation.

                                 ANNE
                        How does it end?

                                 SAM
                        It’s already different... But will 
                        end the same.

           A moment.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam... I don’t know what’s brought 
                        us together or why, but, whatever 
                        outside forces are at work, I’m the 
                        one showing up this time because... 
                        Everything is better when you’re 
                        there...

           Anne looks to Sam. She’s not getting much back from him.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never loved anyone before... 
                        Felt it... Really known what it is, 
                        but... if love isn’t wishing that 
                        someone was around all of the time, 
                        then I don’t know anything... 
                        That’s what I came here to tell 
                        you. That I love you... And that I 
                        don’t care about anything except 
                        spending as much time as I can with 
                        you. 

           She looks around.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So. If this is where you’re going 
                        to be. Then somebody find me a 
                        room. Because I’m staying.
           A long moment. Then Sam gets up without a word and walks to 
           the back of the house, opens up a glass sliding door. He 
           steps through it, stops, turns back.

                                 SAM
                        Are you coming?

           Anne scurries up and follows him-

           EXT. RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

           Anne and Sam walk side by side down a dirt path by the river.

                                 SAM
                        I’ve missed you... More than I 
                        could have imagined... But how was 
                        I to trust that what I was feeling 
                        was real?

           Sam collects his thoughts for a moment, then-

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        They’ve helped me to see that we 
                        all live inside someone’s dream. 
                        That doesn’t make it false, just 
                        like it doesn’t make the dreamer, 
                        God... Anymore than I am a God for 
                        dreaming. You see, there are no 
                        Gods or Subjects, only people... 
                        Dreaming each other into existence 
                        in an endless circle of reality...

           Up ahead they come to a weeping willow by a swelling of the 
           river, where it pools into a pond. It’s a gorgeous place.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Without dreamers, no one lives. And 
                        this moment would never be...

           Sam brings them to a stop, and takes her hands in his.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        This is where I tell you that I 
                        love you. Not because you dreamed 
                        it this way, but because this is 
                        the only realm in which I would 
                        ever want to exist... A place 
                        created by you. I have always been 
                        seeking you. And I always will.

           Sam’s teary eyed. Anne’s crying. 
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I love you.

                                 ANNE
                        I love you, too.

           And they kiss like they’d die if they couldn’t. It’s 
           desperate. Raw... Relief.

           EXT. PLANE - DAY

           Anne and an Instructor jump out of a plane, followed soon 
           after by Sam and his SKY INSTRUCTOR.

           EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER

           Anne and Sam hold hands as they fall down to Earth together.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Anne mans her throne next to Sam, who gets up and pulls her 
           out for a dance.

           LATER -

           They’re out on the dance floor, enjoying each other 
           liberally.

           EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

           Sam gives Anne a piggy-back-ride as they apple pick through 
           an Orchard.

           EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

           Anne and Sam laugh at a joke at a big table full of FRIENDS. 
           It looks warm and filled with love.

           EXT. CHRISTMAS MARKET - NIGHT

           It’s cold. Winter. Anne and Sam stroll through a magical 
           Christmas market. There’s a crepe vendor and she pulls him 
           over to stop for a snack.
           EXT. GLACIER LAGOON - ICELAND - DAY

           Anne and Sam are on a boat in the Glacier Lagoon - a lake 
           made from melted glacier water that has massive chunks of ice 
           sticking out of the ground and the glacier in the distance.

           They pose for a selfie with the view behind them.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Anne rides a wave as Sam watches from the shore. She stays up 
           for a good while and Sam lets out a WHOOP to cheer her on.

           EXT. SEASIDE HOTEL - SUNSET

           Anne and Sam sit in Adirondack chairs as they watch the 
           sunset over the Ocean while sipping on beverages.

           Sam gets down on one knee. Anne notices. Smiles. Says yes. 
           They kiss, and kiss, and kiss. Look out at the sunset.

           EXT. DECK - LIBERTY WAREHOUSE - RED HOOK - DAY

           Confetti fills the air. It dissipates to reveal Anne and Sam 
           holding up their hands as they walk triumphantly back down 
           the aisle. Behind them is a view of the East River/Manhattan.

           INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - MORNING

           Anne sleeps. Sam leans down and kisses her on the back of her 
           head. He wears a suit and carries a satchel.

           EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATER

           Anne hurries down a Brooklyn Heights street towards the 
           subway, wielding her coffee.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Anne sits in a grad psychology classroom with twenty-odd 
           other students and a lecturer at the whiteboard.

           EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           Anne walks home with groceries. She spots Sam across the 
           street.
                                 ANNE
                        Sam!

           He turns at her yell, waves, and crosses towards her.

                                 SAM
                        Hi.

           They kiss and then he helps her carry the groceries home.

           INT. DINING AREA - APARTMENT - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           Post meal. Anne and Sam nurse some wine.

                                 SAM
                        Is this a good time to bring up 
                        kids, again?

           Anne smiles at him. There’s a trace of nervous annoyance, but 
           mostly it’s cute.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam...

                                 SAM
                        I know the concept weirds you out, 
                        but... It’s something I want to 
                        experience before I’m gone... And 
                        they’ll be great. I mean, what’s 
                        better than having you for a Mom?

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t even know if it would work. 
                        How it would work.

                                 SAM
                        Does it hurt to try?

                                 ANNE
                        Even if it did, they’d just... 
                        disappear when I do.

                                 SAM
                        Is that better than them not 
                        existing?

           A long moment.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’ve dreamt this before...

           Sam looks over at his phone on the table. It buzzes. Sam’s 
           face falls.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I think my Mom just died.

           He picks up the phone, answers it.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Hey Cindy.

           His face falls again. Anne is gutted. He gets up, starting to 
           pace, not knowing what else to do.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Sam and Anne wear all black and sit up near the open coffin 
           for the wake. It’s nearing the end - people are clearing out. 

           The place is empty except for a few other relatives talking 
           in the back.

           Sam walks over to the coffin. He kneels by his dead mother 
           and starts to cry. 

           Anne hugs him from behind.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           On the way home from the funeral they’ve stopped at a diner.

           As they sit there in silence, a DINER WAITRESS delivers their 
           food without a word. Sam goes to eat, when-

                                 ANNE
                        Do you think I did this?

           It stops him.

                                 SAM
                        No.

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t help but feel guilty.

                                 SAM
                        You didn’t program my mother to 
                        die. Right?

                                 ANNE
                        No.

                                 SAM
                        Then you didn’t do it.
           Sam starts to eat. Despite what he’s said, there’s an anger 
           still lurking there. Not necessarily at her. But she can’t 
           help but be affected by it.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Why did you even program dying? Why 
                        not just create a utopia for 
                        yourself?

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t know... Perhaps they could 
                        only manage to model you after us.

           A moment.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I could make sure to bring her 
                        back, keep her as the same person 
                        in the next life...

           Sam looks up, a bit shocked.

                                 SAM
                        I can’t think about that right now.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay.

           Sam goes to eat again, but now this is bothering him.

                                 SAM
                        It’s such a weird thing. I can’t... 
                        I don’t even know what to say. You 
                        chose right now to ask me about 
                        bringing her back? She’s probably 
                        not even in the ground yet, fuck...

           Anne is afraid to speak. Sam gets it together.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Yes, please bring her back.

           Anne nods gently, unable to undo what she’s just done: remind 
           him of the power dynamic in their relationship.

                                 ANNE
                        I’ve been thinking about it. Let’s 
                        have kids.

           Once again, Sam looks up, floored.

                                 SAM
                        What?
                                 ANNE
                        You’re right. Better they exist a 
                        little while than not at all. I 
                        want to make someone with you.

           A hint of a smile eeks out of Sam. But it fades quickly. 

                                 SAM
                        We can talk about it another time. 
                        I’ve got enough to get my head 
                        around today.

           He goes back to eating.

           INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY

           Sam kisses Anne’s sleeping head before he leaves for work.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Some time has passed. Anne sits in a different classroom with 
           different students. 

           EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           Anne walks home with groceries alone. It’s lightly raining on 
           her. No Sam to help her today.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Anne walks into the lobby of the building with the now-wet 
           bags. The DOORMAN sees Anne and looks to two POLICE OFFICERS.

           INT. MORGUE - DAY

           Sam’s DEAD FACE. Anne stares down at him. We’re back at the 
           beginning.

                                 CORONER
                        I’m so sorry.

           INT. STAIRCASE - LATER

           Anne calmly trots up a staircase. Click, click, click.
           EXT. ROOF - LATER

           Anne makes a beeline for the edge of the roof.

           Anne steps off the side of the building.

           TO WHITE.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne jars awake. Eyes open.

           There’s the screen. Frozen on the last image she saw.

           HELLO.

                                 ANNE
                        What the fuck...

           YOUR HEART AND RESPIRATION RATES ARE ELEVATED.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, Musoka. It’s always weird 
                        coming back.

           ADMINSTERING A SEDATIVE.

           Anne’s face slackens ever so slightly.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        You didn’t need to do that.

           I MUST FOLLOW PROTOCOL. SORRY, ANNE.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Where are we? How much further do 
                        we have to go?

           THE ALPHA CENTAURI SYSTEM IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-POINT-SEVEN 
           LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

           Anne quickly does the math in her head.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So what, six years left?

           SEVEN-POINT-TWO.

           Anne nods to herself.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So I’d like to set some parameters 
                        for my next life.
           HOLD THAT THOUGHT. TRAINING SESSION TO BEGIN IN 30 MINUTES.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Another one, already?

           IT’S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE YOUR LAST ONE.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Wow. Time flies.

           Anne blinks and...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           She’s back in a training classroom. Just like the last one. 
           She looks around the room as the seats fill up one at a time. 
           The final person appears but there’s no sign of Judy.

           A hologram appears of a giant three-story terraforming unit 
           sitting on the surface of an alien planet. The instructor 
           turns to the class.

           EXT. SURREAL LAWN - DAY

           The lawn party. 

           Anne bears a glass of champagne as she wanders through the 
           crowd searching each passing waiter’s face.

           Up ahead, there’s a tall waiter. Is that Sam? Anne hurries 
           toward him... 

           No. It’s just a LOOKALIKE.

           Frustrated, Anne approaches the-

           BAR -

           To get a better look at the Bartenders’ faces.

           No luck there either.

                                 JUDY
                        Anne.

           Anne turns. There is Judy, waiting for a drink.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god. How are you?
                                 ANNE
                        Hi Judy.

           MELISSA (27) shows up next to Judy.

                                 MELISSA
                             (friendly)
                        Hey, bitch.

           She sees Anne.

                                 JUDY
                        Melissa, this is Anne.

                                 ANNE
                        Hi.

           Anne extends her hand. Melissa takes it with a raised 
           eyebrow.

                                 MELISSA
                        Is she the one...?

                                 JUDY
                        Yeah...

                                 MELISSA
                        Oh, girl...

           Melissa shakes her head, gives Anne a judgmental look. Anne 
           addresses the subject head on:

                                 ANNE
                        Judy... I’m sorry about-

                                 JUDY
                        No need. Melissa and I met in the 
                        next simulation. We’re going to 
                        keep rolling together after this.

           Judy gives Anne a look that says ‘You fucked up. You’re dead 
           to me.’ Anne can’t help but be hurt by it.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay.

                                 MELISSA
                        BARTENDER. WHERE ARE THOSE 
                        MARTINIS!
                             (to them)
                        I cannot wait to get back to a real 
                        party. I wish they’d let you start 
                        later. Going through childhood 
                        again is such a bore.
                                 JUDY
                        I couldn’t agree more. What were 
                        they thinking?

                                 MELISSA
                        They probably weren’t...

           They start laughing.

                                 ANNE
                        Okay, well, it was nice to see you.
                             (to Melissa)
                        Nice meeting you.

           Anne gathers her glass of champagne and takes a few steps 
           away when Judy touches her on the shoulder. Anne turns.

                                 JUDY
                        Are you still looking for him?

           Anne’s busted.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Anne... They’re going to delete it 
                        all at the end of this. 

                                 ANNE
                        What?

                                 JUDY
                        Every bit of data. When we wake up 
                        for the last time, they’re going to 
                        purge the drives. He’ll be gone.

           Anne swallows. Fuck. This is bad. She looks unnerved.

                                 ANNE
                        Why?

                                 JUDY
                        They told me that it’s a 
                        confidentiality thing.

           Anne’s in shock, her mind reeling with the ramifications.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh...

                                 JUDY
                        I don’t know why I’m even bothering 
                        with you.

                                 ANNE
                        No... Thanks for telling me.
           Judy sees how rattled Anne is. She can’t help but care 
           despite their falling out.

                                 JUDY
                        If you want, you could come with 
                        Melissa and me.
                             (off Anne’s look; whisper)
                        She grows on you.

           Anne smiles sadly, shakes her head.

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t... I love him.

           Judy’s surprise quickly fades to a sad understanding.

                                 JUDY
                        Well... Good luck.

           She means it. Anne sees that. They smile at each other and 
           Judy walks back over to Melissa. Anne is left with her own 
           thoughts as she looks out at the garden party.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne blinks her eyes open. Back in the chamber. Screen 
           overhead.

           READY FOR THE NEXT SIMULATION?

                                 ANNE
                        Musoka.

           YES, ANNE.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Is it true that after we arrive in 
                        Alpha Centauri, that you delete all 
                        of the data from the simulations?

           THAT IS CORRECT.

           Anne lets out a big sigh, she looks as worried as she’s ever 
           looked.

           ARE YOU OKAY?

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah... 

           But she’s not.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So... I have some parameters to 
                        set.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Young Anne stands on the beach. She’s frozen in place. In 
           fact, everything on the beach is frozen in place. 

           The view circles back around, to Young Anne’s eyes as... 
           consciousness enters them. This time, she remembers early... 

           They blink and sound leaks in, movement, as the simulation 
           starts. She watches the waves lap on the shore for a moment 
           before... her Father scoops her up.

           EXT. HOUSE - SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           TEEN ANNE (13) walks into a new house carrying a box. Moving 
           in day. She turns and spots a boy watching her from across 
           the street. TEEN SAM (13).

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Teen Anne, Teen Sam and other BOYS and GIRLS play a game of 
           tag in the woods. Young Anne is it. She corners Teen Sam and 
           then tackles the boy to the ground.

                                 TEEN SAM
                        Hey. Get off of me.

                                 TEEN ANNE
                        I brought you back. Do you 
                        remember?

                                 TEEN SAM
                        What are you talking about?

           Young Anne gets off of him.

                                 TEEN ANNE
                        Tell me when you do.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Teen Anne watches Teen Sam practice football with the rest of 
           the team.
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Teen Anne walks alone down the hallway. She passes Teen Sam, 
           wearing a Varsity jacket, with a GIRL on his arm.

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           Sam (18) celebrates his birthday with a large group of 
           friends. Anne is there, amongst the group. They raise a 
           toast.

                                 FRAT BRO
                        Happy 18, Sammy Boy!

           They cheers and drink - more shouts of celebration. Sam 
           drinks with them, but as he lowers his drink, it’s like a 
           spell is broken. He turns to find Anne. Their eyes lock.

           He walks over to her and picks her up into a huge embrace. 
           And then they kiss. Big kiss. More cheers.

           EXT. PORCH - LATER

           Sam and Anne lean against the porch, staring at each other.

                                 SAM
                        How on Earth did you put up with me 
                        that way for so long?

           She smiles genuinely.

                                 ANNE
                        I got to watch you grow up. It was 
                        great.

                                 SAM
                        It wasn’t that great.

           Sam chuckles. As does Anne.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        It’s weird to have been becoming 
                        one person for so long, and then to 
                        have this rush of memories... It’s 
                        like being born again. Like I’m 
                        conscious for the first time...

           He turns back to Anne, touches her delicately on the face and 
           neck. They kiss.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’m ready to start a life together. 
                        This time I won’t get hit by a car.

           Anne smiles sadly. Sam doesn’t notice.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Come on.

           He takes her by the hand and leads her out towards his pickup 
           truck.

           EXT. BED OF A PICKUP TRUCK - FIELD - NIGHT

           Anne and Sam are curled under blankets in the back of a 
           pickup truck underneath the stars, post-coitus. Half naked. 
           Sam pops open a beer from a sixer. Takes a sip. 

           Anne looks troubled. Put off. Sam senses that something’s up.

                                 SAM
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ANNE
                        There’s a problem.

           Sam sits up, giving her laser focus.

                                 SAM
                        What’s going on?

                                 ANNE
                        We have three lives, maybe four, 
                        left. Then everything’s... gone.

           Sam lets the information sink in...

                                 SAM
                        So one of these days, everything’s 
                        just gonna go white and I won’t be 
                        here anymore...

                                 ANNE
                        There’s got to be another way...

                                 SAM
                        If you’re the dreamer, maybe I 
                        could enter your mind, your 
                        memories...

                                 ANNE
                        It doesn’t work like that.
           Resigned, Sam looks out at the night sky.

                                 SAM
                        Well... It could be worse. Three 
                        lives is a lot of living.

                                 ANNE
                        I can’t accept that.

           Anne sits up, concentrating now.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        You’re here. I’m there. We exist in 
                        different realms... But surely 
                        there’s a way to reverse it. 
                        Transport your consciousness there.

                                 SAM
                        That contradicts the laws of time 
                        and space... Anne, I’m stuck here.

                                 ANNE
                        None of this was supposed to be 
                        possible. How do you know what can 
                        and cannot happen?

           Sam sighs. Anne thinks.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        If we could figure out a way to 
                        retain your data, keep you hidden 
                        in the base code of the simulation.

                                 SAM
                        How would we even begin to do that?

           Anne sighs. She cracks open a beer of her own. They both 
           drink. A long moment. Then an idea hits her.

                                 ANNE
                        What if I woke up before I arrived? 
                        I could... force myself awake... 
                        They’d have to... for a medical 
                        emergency. I could have them make a 
                        copy of you.

                                 SAM
                        It sounds... complicated.

                                 ANNE
                        So we should just give up because 
                        it’s complicated?
                                 SAM
                        No... I’m just saying that maybe we 
                        should take advantage of the time 
                        we have left together.

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t want time. I want eternity.

           Anne gets up, searches through Sam’s truck until she finds a 
           shotgun by the truck’s side and pulls it out.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Where do you keep the ammo for 
                        this?

                                 SAM
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANNE
                        I’m resetting.

                                 SAM
                        I just became conscious again... 
                        Can’t we wait just a bit, figure 
                        this out?

                                 ANNE
                        I’m just gonna’ feel anxious. I’d 
                        rather take care of it and enjoy 
                        the rest of my time here with you.

           Sam doesn’t respond.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Well? Where are they?

           Sam finishes his beer in response.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Fine.

           Anne jumps over the side of the pickup truck. She opens the 
           side passenger door. Sam scrambles up, but Anne’s already got 
           the glove box open. And the shells.

           By the time Sam gets to her, she’s already loaded the 
           shotgun.

                                 SAM
                        Anne... I’m scared.

           She’s not just killing herself. She’s killing him. Everyone.
                                 ANNE
                        Don’t worry. It’ll feel like no 
                        time at all.

           Anne turns the gun on herself and...

                                 SAM
                        No... I dreamt this... Stop!

           Fires.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne opens her eyes. The blue screen display comes on.

           WELCOME BACK.

                                 ANNE
                        I need to get out of here, Musoka.

           Anne’s heart starts to race.

           YOU’RE OKAY. EVERYTHING IS OKAY. 

           But her heart’s beating faster and faster. Louder. 

           Thump. Thump. Thump.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Let me out!

           ADMINISTERING A SEDATIVE. 

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you, Musoka! Let me out of 
                        here! I demand to be let out. 
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

           Everything gets a little blurry. Anne does her best to fight 
           the effects of the sedative. She screams, kicks, convulses, 
           using every ounce of her strength. 

           A BLIP of WHITENESS overtakes her. She closes her eyes... A 
           long moment before...

           SOUND OF A HAND SLAPPING ON THE SLEEP CHAMBER. Anne FORCES 
           HER EYES OPEN. Vivian’s face appears in the window.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Let me out of here!!!!

           Anne throws a sedated fit, doing everything in her power to 
           get free.
           Vivian points to her ears, she can’t hear Anne. She makes a 
           motion for Anne to stay calm, and then opens out a touch 
           hologram from the chamber, starting the procedure to...

           OPEN IT UP. Slowly the chamber depressurizes, and the door to 
           the chamber opens up.

           Vivian looks down at Anne.

                                 VIVIAN
                        What’s going on? Are you okay?

                                 ANNE
                        Get me out of here.

           Anne starts to cry, more from relief than anything.

           INT. MESS HALL - SPACESHIP - LATER

           Vivian sits across from Anne in the empty ship Mess Hall. 
           Anne wears a blanket and they both drink coffee.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I’ve never heard of anything like 
                        that happening in there.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s crazy, right? It’s why I 
                        needed to get out. I need you to 
                        help me save him.

                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s against protocol.

                                 ANNE
                        Vivian... this isn’t a normal 
                        situation. It’s... groundbreaking. 
                        I mean, who would have thought that 
                        people in simulations are capable 
                        of becoming conscious?

           Vivian takes a breath. Ugh. It’s a good point. But hard.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I’ve never done it before...

                                 ANNE
                        There’s got to be some sort of 
                        access to the servers. A way to 
                        isolate and make a copy of him.
                                 VIVIAN
                        The AI handles pretty much 
                        everything. Us techs just make sure 
                        you guys stay alive.

                                 ANNE
                        All you would need to do is locate 
                        the last simulation I was put in. 
                        I’m sure if you asked, Musoka would 
                        tell you what server it’s on.

           Vivian sighs. Not convinced yet.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Aren’t you curious?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Okay... assuming no one else is 
                        still in the simulation, I can ask. 
                        But I don’t know if he’ll say yes.

                                 ANNE
                        I’ll take it. Thank you.

           Vivian gets up.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Stay here. I’ll be back.

           Vivian walks out of the Mess Hall. Anne sits there for a 
           moment before she finishes her coffee, gets up and-

           Walks over to the coffee machine. Refills her cup. Walks over 
           to the port holes...

           And looks out at the cosmos. It looks different somehow. Like 
           a bluer universe. They have traveled far...

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP - MOMENTS LATER

           Anne looks at the rows of people asleep in the chambers. It 
           seems to go on forever...

           She walks up to the first chamber and looks inside. She sees 
           a face she doesn’t know. Asleep. Peaceful.

           She continues along, looking in at the faces. The sound of a 
           door as it opens behind her, and Anne turns around.

                                 VIVIAN
                        There you are... I thought you were 
                        going to stay in the mess hall.
           Anne makes an apologetic face as Vivian approaches her.

                                 ANNE
                        I figured I’d stretch my legs... 
                        It’s weird. I remember things 
                        differently. Like the colors seem 
                        wrong on the chambers...

                                 VIVIAN
                        You’ve been asleep for a long time. 
                        You’re so used to the simulations 
                        that reality seems fake. 

           Anne nods. Vivian holds up a thin hard drive.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        I got it. Apparently Musoka has to 
                        listen to everything I say, so...

           Anne goes to take it from her. Vivian doesn’t hand it over.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t we put it in with your 
                        things and get you back to sleep.

           Anne hesitates, looks up at Vivian.

                                 ANNE
                        I’d like to see it first.

           Vivian looks disappointed, but turns and motions for Anne to 
           follow.

           INT. HOLOGRAM CONTROL TERMINAL ROOM - SPACESHIP - LATER

           Frozen in a hologram is the image of Anne and Sam next to 
           each other in the pickup truck.

           Vivian and Anne look up at it.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Convinced?

                                 ANNE
                        Thank you.

           Vivian ejects the hard drive from a wall unit and the 
           hologram turns off. She hands it over to Anne.
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SPACESHIP - LATER

           A bay of lockers. Vivian waits at the far end as Anne opens 
           hers up. She admires the few possessions she’s brought on 
           this journey, reminding herself of them.

           Then she places the thin hard drive on the top shelf and 
           closes the locker, making sure that it’s locked.

                                 ANNE
                        You’re not going to take it away 
                        while I’m asleep, are you?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Why would I go through all of this 
                        just to do that?

           Anne realize she’s being rude and untrusting.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 VIVIAN
                        It’s okay. Come on.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP - LATER

           Anne’s all strapped in again. The lid closes down on her 
           slowly as Vivian watches. 

           Once the screen is in place, Vivian waves and then 
           suddenly... disappears from view. It’s jarring.

           WELCOME BACK, ANNE.

           Anne’s eyes dart around. Like she’s scared but she doesn’t 
           know why.

                                 ANNE
                        Hi, Musoka.

           ARE YOU READY TO DREAM SOME MORE?

           Anne hesitates for a moment... Then regains her composure.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Absolutely... I have some specific 
                        instructions for you this time.

           OF COURSE. PLEASE, GO AHEAD...
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           We’re back on Young Anne as her father scoops her up and runs 
           out to the sea.

           INT. NYU LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Anne sits at the front of her college class. She looks around 
           the room, looking for Sam. He’s not there.

           INT. NYU REGISTAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           An ADMINISTRATOR works at her desk. Anne approaches her.

                                 ANNE
                        Hi, I’m looking for another 
                        student.

           LATER -

           The Administrator has moved over to a computer.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I’m sorry, I’m not showing anyone 
                        with that name.

                                 ANNE
                        But we were supposed to meet here. 
                        In class today, actually...

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I don’t know what to tell you. The 
                        computer doesn’t lie.

           Anne nods, walks out.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - LATER

           From afar, we see Anne’s small form disappear off the side of 
           the bridge into the river below.

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           Anne’s back.

                                 ANNE
                        What happened?

           A GLITCH. SORRY.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Send me back.

           INT. NYU LECTURE HALL - DAY

           We’re back in that lecture hall. Anne stands by the door as 
           students walk in. No sign of Sam. The door closes.

           Anne walks out.

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

           Anne walks around Washington Square Park - looking at all of 
           the faces of the young people, trying to find Sam.

           INT. P.I. OFFICE - DAY

           Anne sits across from a PI giving him details MOS as the PI 
           takes notes.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The PI waits at a table as Anne walks in.

           LATER -

           Anne looks at a folder.

                                 PI
                        There’s a million Sam Rivers. It 
                        took a while to sort through them 
                        all. But not one of them matches 
                        your very thorough description.

           Anne closes the folder, looks back up at the PI.

                                 ANNE
                        Excuse me.

           Anne walks out of the coffee shop. The PI watches from the 
           window as she walks out into traffic and is struck by a-

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP

           HELLO.

           She’s back.
                                 ANNE
                        He wasn’t there... Again.

           I’M SO SORRY.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Musoka. What’s going on?

           WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I explicitly said when and where I 
                        was supposed to meet him.

           YOUR HEARTRATE IS ELEVATING.

           Anne takes a breath.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Musoka. I’m fine. I just want to 
                        know what’s going on.

           A long moment. Then...

           HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE COMPUTER, BY...

           It shows Vivian’s employee identification card.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        That’s what’s causing this?

           A moment. 

           YES.

           Anne almost buys it, but then something occurs to her...

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        No, she specifically told me that 
                        she made a copy...

           No response.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Just level with me, Musoka.

           MY PRIME DIRECTIVE IS TO KEEP YOU ALIVE. 

           YOUR VITALS BECAME ERRATIC AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PRESENCE. 

           I CAN’T ALLOW YOU TO SEE HIM AGAIN. I’M SORRY.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        What? But why? He’s fine now. He’s 
                        safe. Vivian saw to that. There’s 
                        no reason for me to...

           Anne pauses, thinks.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Wait...

           In Anne’s mind eye:

           FLASHBACK

           - Flash of white before Vivian’s face appears in the sleep 
           chamber window

           - Anne stares at the slightly blue universe from the porthole 
           of the mess hall

           - Anne talks to Vivian in the Sleep Chamber Hold

                                 ANNE
                        ... I remember things 
                        differently...

           - Vivian disappears from the window of the sleep chamber

           BACK TO PRESENT

           On Anne. As it registers what has happened. She closes her 
           eyes, and tears leak out.

                                 ANNE
                        It wasn’t real... You sent me into 
                        a simulation of the ship.

           I’M SORRY. PLEASE STAY CALM.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god...

           ADMINISTERING SEDATIVE.

           Anne slumps, a little sleepy now.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        There’s no way to save him, is 
                        there?

           NO.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        You just did that to calm me down.

           I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

           A few more tears leak out of Anne.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        You’re not going to let me see him 
                        again?

           NO. I’M SORRY.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        So he’s already gone...

           A long moment.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        How long until we arrive?

           TWO YEARS.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Time for one more life, listen... I 
                        accept what you’ve done. But 
                        please, just let me have one more 
                        life with him. 

           I CAN’T.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I promise I won’t spend time 
                        worrying. I’ll be calm. You’ll see.

           I’M SORRY.

           Anne thinks frantically and... Arrives at the answer. It’s 
           not an easy one.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Then have me forget... About this, 
                        about him. Send me in as a blank 
                        slate. That way I won’t know to 
                        worry, right?

           No response.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Come on. That solves it, Musoka. 
                        You just have to promise me that we 
                        meet. The rest is up to me.

           A long moment. 
           OKAY.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you... thank you so much.

           WOULD YOU LIKE TO SET ADDITIONAL PREFERENCES?

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Yes, I...

           She stops herself, really thinks about it.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        No... He’s enough.

           ARE YOU READY?

           Anne gulps. She’s not. No one ever is.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Let’s do it.

                                                         FADE TO WHITE.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Young Anne stands on the beach looking out at the water. The 
           water crashes and her eyes follow the sea as it creeps up the 
           incline to her before receding back.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        And so I celebrated my last eighth 
                        birthday.

           Anne looks around. The sky. Seagulls. Clouds. Sun. She takes 
           it all in, even more than the first time. Arms scoop her up 
           as her Father picks her up and runs out into the water.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A cake gets set down before Young Anne as her family finishes 
           singing MOS. She blows out candles and everyone applauds.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Young Anne plays outside with her FRIENDS when a BOY pushes 
           her over. 
           Young Anne jumps up and PUNCHES the Boy in the face. They 
           start to wrestle each other as a TEACHER comes running in.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER

           The Boy and Young Anne sit side by side before the Principal 
           looking sheepish.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        I grew up in New Jersey.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A pew of worshippers. Teen Anne sits with her family, singing 
           a hymn from the hymn book.

           Across the aisle, there’s the TEEN BOY - now older and 
           turning into a real rebel. Their eyes meet.

           INT. ANNE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Teen Anne makes out with the Teen Boy in bed. It’s getting 
           hot and heavy and she pulls down his pants.

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        Lost my virginity to the only boy 
                        to ever punch me in the face.

           EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

           Anne, now in college, hurries up some steps to class.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           A MODEL takes off his robe, revealing his healthy body to a 
           classroom full of students with pencils and pads. 

                                 ANNE (V.O.)
                        And for the first time, I found a 
                        calling.

           Anne sketches the naked model on a pad. She’s quite good.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           A watercolor of the naked model on a canvas - Anne paints it 
           from her drawing.
           INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           A key turns, lock opens. Anne walks into her dorm room. Her 
           roommate is having sex.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh! Okay...

                                 ROOMATE
                        Get out!

           Anne quickly grabs a canvas... and some brushes, and...

                                 ROOMATE (CONT'D)
                        OUT!

           Anne rushes out with her supplies.

           EXT. SOUTH SEAPORT - EAST RIVER - DAY

           A view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Anne sits on a 
           stoop, painting a watercolor of the view on a canvas.

           A few loud SUITS walk by on the street nearby. They disappear 
           when... One of the Suits comes back into view. It’s Sam.

           He approaches her.

                                 SAM
                        Anne...

           Anne turns. She doesn’t recognize him.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been looking for you...

           Anne’s confused, she sets down her brush and looks at him.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m sorry... have we met?

           For a moment, Sam thinks she’s joking, but then he sees her 
           face, and... It’s clear she’s not.

                                 SAM
                        I guess not... Let me start over. 
                        I’m Sam.

           He walks forward, extending his hand.

                                 ANNE
                        Anne.
           They shake.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        How do you know my name?

                                 SAM
                        Maybe we met in another life.

           Anne smiles. Rolls her eyes.

                                 ANNE
                        I don’t really believe in that 
                        stuff.

           She turns back to her work.

                                 SAM
                        Can I buy you a drink?

           Anne eyes the Suits that are watching them.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m sorry, I’m kind of in the 
                        middle of something, here. Maybe 
                        another time...

           It means ‘no.’

                                 SAM
                        I can wait until you’re finished.

           That’s a little weird.

                                 ANNE
                        You shouldn’t keep your friends 
                        waiting.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t mind.
                             (leaning in)
                        To be honest, I’d take any excuse 
                        to ditch them.

                                 ANNE
                        So I’m any excuse to ditch your 
                        friends?

           Anne gives him a concerned look. Sam laughs out of nerves.

                                 SAM
                        Wow. This is going poorly...

           He looks back to the Suits, turns and yells.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I don’t like any of you guys! I’d 
                        rather hang out with this stranger! 

                                 LEAD SUIT
                        You’re such a weirdo! We’ll see you 
                        at the bar, Sammy Boy!

                                 SAM
                        Seriously! We’re not friends!

           They laugh as they walk away.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Nobody ever listens to me.

                                 ANNE
                        You have a natural sarcasm about 
                        you.

                                 SAM
                        Are you calling me a clown?

                                 ANNE
                        Sure. Just not a funny one.

                                 SAM
                        Awww... That was... You still have 
                        that wit about you.

           Anne turns back to painting, picks up her brush.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I don’t want to intrude. 
                        And I can fuck off, right quick, if 
                        you want. Just say the word.

           A moment. Anne turns back, looks at him.

                                 ANNE
                        Do you take anything seriously?

           Sam stares directly into her eyes.

                                 SAM
                        The important things.

           Anne smiles.

                                 ANNE
                        Then you can stay.

           Sam sits down beside her, as Anne continues to paint.
                                 SAM
                        You’ve never painted... Not in any 
                        of your other lives.

                                 ANNE
                        The one where you met me before?

                                 SAM
                        More than one... I wonder why you 
                        don’t remember me.

                                 ANNE
                             (flirty)
                        Don’t flatter yourself.

           Sam smiles. As does Anne.

           And then Sam puzzles it out for a moment until he realizes 
           what’s happened, why she doesn’t remember. His face falls.

                                 SAM
                        This is it. Isn’t it? 

                                 ANNE
                        What?

                                 SAM
                        You couldn’t get it to work...

                                 ANNE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SAM
                        This is our last life together... 
                        It’s why you don’t remember.

           A tear forms in Sam’s eye. Trickles down his cheek. 

           Anne hears him sniffle, turns and looks at him. A man with 
           feelings. Finally, she’s interested.

                                 ANNE
                        You know... I could probably finish 
                        this later. How ‘bout that drink?

           Sam smiles, still a bit sad.

                                 SAM
                        Great.

           Anne packs up. Sam helps.
           INT. BAR - LATER

           Sam and Anne share a corner table in a sawdust-floor bar.

                                 ANNE
                        Fascinating.

                                 SAM
                        I’m telling you... All of this. 
                        It’s for you.

           Anne looks to a patron.

                                 ANNE
                        So that guy.

                                 SAM
                        Yours.

           Anne motions to another patron.

                                 ANNE
                        That lady?

                                 SAM
                        One-hundred percent. Yours.

                                 ANNE
                        What about-?

                                 SAM
                        Everyone in this bar. Everyone 
                        outside this bar.  All for you.

                                 ANNE
                        And why do I love you?

                                 SAM
                        I’m funny.

           Anne rolls her eyes.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’m frightfully good in bed.

                                 ANNE
                        I doubt that.

                                 SAM
                        And I’m the only conscious being in 
                        your simulation. 

           Anne laughs.
                                 ANNE
                        Ah, well, process of elimination.

                                 SAM
                        No matter the circumstances... No 
                        matter the life... We’ve always 
                        just... clicked. No one else knows 
                        you like I do. And you know me.

           They look at each other for a long moment. Anne doesn’t 
           believe him. But she’s intrigued - turned on.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door flies open. Sam and Anne make out hardcore on the 
           way to the bedroom.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Sam lies next to Anne in bed. They’re exhausted from the sex.

                                 SAM
                        That felt like the first time...

                                 ANNE
                        My first time was... Considerably 
                        shorter than that.

                                 SAM
                        I meant ours.

           Sam goes back in for another snog.

           INT. APARTMENT - NY - NIGHT

           Some time has passed. Sam and Anne wear 2014 glasses and hats 
           at a friend’s New Year’s party. Sam pours Anne a glass of 
           champagne hurriedly as everyone counts down:

                                 EVERYONE

           Sam finishes pouring, but clumsily mishandles the bottle. He 
           manages to catch it but spills all over his pants.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh!

                                 EVERYONE
           Anne’s procured a paper towel and attempts to dry his pants, 
           his pockets.

                                 SAM
                        It’s okay... how clumsy of me.

           Sam tries to disengage but... Anne goes back and dries the 
           same spot. There’s something there.

                                 EVERYONE

           Anne looks up at Sam, asking with her eyes what it is. Sam 
           takes it out. It’s a ring box.

                                 ANNE
                        Yes.

           Anne pulls Sam in for a kiss.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Happy New Year!

           They continue to make out as...

           OVER: Music with a beat starts to leak in...

           I/E. TENT - WEDDING - NIGHT

           People dance - have a great time as a DJ rocks out.

           Sam sits outside the wedding tent, experiencing a sadness as 
           he comes to terms with the passing of a life event that you 
           can’t slow down.

           He turns his attention back to everyone inside dancing and 
           having a great time. He watches:

           Anne - in a wedding dress - dancing up a storm. This is maybe 
           the happiest anyone has ever seen her.

           She looks around for Sam, and spotting him, she motions for 
           him to come back and join her. 

           He holds up a finger ‘one minute,’ and kisses the air.

           She smiles at him and goes back to dancing with her friends.

           EXT. ANGKOR WAT - DAY

           Sam and Anne have that honeymoon glow about them.
           They sit side by side staring up at the temple, enjoying the 
           peaceful ambiance. For Sam, it’s more than that.

           Two CHRISTIAN MISSIONARIES sit down nearby. Sam grins.

           INT. APARTMENT - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           Some time has passed.

           Anne’s preparing food in the kitchen. Sam reads a magazine on 
           the couch. Anne’s phone alarm goes off. She picks it up.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s time.

           Sam sits up, tosses aside the magazine.

                                 SAM
                        We’re doing this. Are you sure?

                                 ANNE
                        No, but I’ll regret it if I don’t.

           She takes her shirt off and shakes her tushy at Sam as she 
           walks away.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sam’s on top of her, getting stuff going. Anne waits, 
           patiently rubbing his back and face.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s a limited window of time, hon.

                                 SAM
                        No pressure.

                                 ANNE
                        There’s always next month...

           Sam laughs nervously.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Would it help if I yelled at you?

           Sam shakes his head ‘no.’

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Put a baby in me!

           Anne smiles. Sam laughs some more.
                                 SAM
                        Wow.

                                 ANNE
                        What if I pinch your nipples?

           Sam’s really laughing now.

                                 SAM
                        No, god...

           She goes for it anyways. He tries to fight off her hands. 
           Laughing and distracted he realizes...

           He’s ready. He inserts himself into her.

                                 ANNE
                        Oh... Hello.

           Both of their faces relax into that first-insertion-zen.

           LATER -

           Anne hugs her knees to her chest under the blankets. Sam 
           walks back in, sporting a glass of scotch.

                                 SAM
                        You want one?

                                 ANNE
                        Really? Are you insane?

           Sam checks himself.

                                 SAM
                             (confused)
                        Yes?

           He starts to walk away.

                                 ANNE
                        No, no, no, no. You pour that down 
                        the drain. Alcohol’s not good for 
                        your sperm count!

           Sam walks down the hallway, not particularly worried.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Sam’s packing up after a day of work with the Suits. He hears 
           a familiar voice, walks away from his cubicle, peers around 
           the corner to see...
           Anne talking to the RECEPTIONIST. Anne sees him and she can’t 
           contain herself. Tears form in her eyes.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah?

           Anne nods. Sam runs over to her and hugs her tightly. Then 
           loosens up the hug. Precious cargo.

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Sam and Anne walk down the street, holding hands.

                                 SAM
                        I can’t believe it worked...

                                 ANNE
                        You were worried your boys wouldn’t 
                        fire?

                                 SAM
                        No. I was worried we couldn’t. It 
                        being a simulation and all...

           Anne looks to Sam, a bit concerned.

                                 ANNE
                        You’re going to be a father now. 
                        You have to dial that stuff back.

                                 SAM
                        I can’t promise that.

                                 ANNE
                        With me it’s fine. But with kids...

           Sam gives her a reassuring smile as they start down to the 
           subway.

           INT. APARTMENT - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           A puddle of water on the floor. A VERY PREGNANT Anne stands 
           over it. Sam’s making food in the kitchen.

                                 ANNE
                        Honey...

           He looks over, sees what’s happening.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, shit! I’ll get the bag.
           He runs to get the pre-packed bag. Anne walks over, leans on 
           the kitchen counter. Sam returns, puts an arm around Anne and 
           starts to lead her out. Halfway down the hallway...

                                 ANNE
                        The burners.

                                 SAM
                        Shit.

           Sam drops the bag, turns around. Anne holds onto the wall to 
           keep her steady. A couple of clicks. Sam starts to return...

                                 ANNE
                        The oven.

           Sam stops, turns back.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A baby. Anne holds a beautiful BABY GIRL (pink hat). Sam sits 
           in a chair nearby, holding her BABY TWIN SISTER.

           An exhausted Anne smiles up at a tired Sam.

           INT. BATHTUB - DAY

           BABY LIZA (2) and BABY MINDY (2) are in the bath playing. 
           They’re splashing each other - purposefully not cooperating..

                                 ANNE
                        Here, if you just...

           Anne moves Sam as she tries to get close to Baby Mindy, who 
           steps away from having her hair washed.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Mindy...

           Sam gets a hold of Baby Liza, starts to scrub some soap on 
           her, but she wriggles free, SPLASHING him in the FACE. 

           Sam lets out a discontented grunt before he controls his 
           anger. Anne tries not to laugh. She fails.

                                 SAM
                        You think that’s funny, huh?

           Her laugh turns into a full-fledged guffaw when...

           Baby Mindy splashes Anne, much worse than Sam. She’s soaked.
                                 BABY MINDY
                        Teehee.

                                 ANNE
                        Mindy!

           Sam chuckles now.

                                 SAM
                        How’s it feel?

           Baby Liza farts loudly, and then starts laughing about it. 
           Followed by Baby Mindy. And then they’re all laughing.

           EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           The family of four walk down the steps of their brownstone. 
           LITTLE MINDY and LITTLE LIZA are FIVE now. They hold Anne and 
           Sam’s hands as they start walking down the street.

           EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER

           They turn a corner and arrive at a school together. Out 
           front, there is a YOUNG TEACHER that meets them.

                                 YOUNG TEACHER
                        Who is this?

                                 LITTLE MINDY
                        I’m Mindy. This is my sister, Liza.

                                 LITTLE LIZA
                        No, I’m Mindy.

                                 LITTLE MINDY
                        No you’re not.

                                 YOUNG TEACHER
                        Are you two twins?

                                 LITTLE LIZA
                        No. Triplets. We left the ugly one 
                        at home.

           Anne gives Sam stink-eye. He remains stone-faced. The Young 
           Teacher looks at both Anne and Sam.

                                 YOUNG TEACHER
                        Well, I think you’re supposed to 
                        come with me.
           She puts out her hands for Little Liza and Little Mindy to 
           take them.

                                 YOUNG TEACHER (CONT'D)
                        Do you think that’d be okay?

           They look up at Sam and Anne, but really at their Mother.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s okay girls.

           Both of the girls look nervous, but they take the Young 
           Teacher’s hand.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be right here to pick you up 
                        later.

           The girls acquiesce and the Young Teacher leads them toward 
           the school when Mindy runs back to give Anne a LONG HUG. 

           Sam gives her an affectionate rub on the head before Little 
           Mindy runs back to the waiting Young Teacher and Little Liza.

                                 LITTLE LIZA
                        Baby...

                                 LITTLE MINDY
                        Am not...

           Anne and Sam watch as their children walk away, and we push 
           in on their faces as...

           TIME SPEEDS UP. People come and go. Leaves change. Snow 
           falls. Then melts. Leaves re-emerge as spring returns. 

           Everything moves faster and faster. And as this happens, Anne 
           and Sam age as well. Wrinkles form, eyes droop, hair turns 
           white and youth fades to middle-age.

           UNTIL... things slow down... Anne and Sam are now in their 
           mid-forties. Anne waves. 

                                 ANNE
                        Hi girls!

           The view turns around to see two twin girls - LIZA and MINDY 
           (12)- walking out of school talking to their friends.

           They see their parents and say a quick goodbye to their 
           friends before they hurry over. 
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The four of them walk home together.

                                 SAM
                        What did you learn in school today?

                                 LIZA
                        Nothing interesting.

                                 MINDY
                        You never think anything’s 
                        interesting.

                                 ANNE
                        Well what non-interesting things 
                        did you learn today?

           Liza wears a devilish smile now.

                                 LIZA
                        That Mindy has a crush on Peter 
                        Wallace.

                                 MINDY
                        Do not!

           She pushes Liza, giving away how she actually feels.

                                 SAM
                        Mindy, we don’t push.

                                 ANNE
                        Liza, be nice to your sister.

           The two girls make faces at each other, but fall back in line 
           for their walk home.

           INT. KITCHEN - APARTMENT - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - NIGHT

           Anne pours herself a glass of wine, then walks down the 
           hallway to a-

           LIVING ROOM -

           Nobody’s there, so she turns down another hallway and peeks 
           through a doorway to see...
           TWIN’S BEDROOM -

           Sam on a sofa-chair in the corner of the twin’s bedroom. He’s 
           drinking a scotch watching them sleep.

           Anne slips through the door, tiptoes over, sits on Sam’s lap.

                                 ANNE
                             (whispering)
                        You haven’t done this in ages.

                                 SAM
                        It’s amazing how fast it all goes.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah...

           They watch, kiss, drink.

                                 SAM
                        This might be the last time we 
                        watch our kids sleep.

                                 ANNE
                        We could do it ‘til they’re twenty-
                        one... Might be creepy, though.

           Sam smiles. They sit there in silence. Watching their chests 
           move. Listening to them breathe.

                                 SAM
                        I’ve gotten everything that I’ve 
                        wanted. Out of any life with you.

                                 ANNE
                        I’m so glad.

                                 SAM
                        Really, though... I want you to 
                        know that.

           Anne turns away from the kids and looks at Sam.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’m happy. Here with you.

           She smiles, then kisses him, before she turns back to watch 
           the kids sleep.

           EXT. STREET - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

           Anne, now late 50s, comes walking out of the grocery store 
           with a bag. Sam, also late 50s, waits outside.
           OLDER LIZA and OLDER MINDY (22) are a little ways ahead, on 
           their phones.

                                 SAM
                        You okay?

           Anne nods.

                                 ANNE
                        Yeah... Just... I don’t know.

           She smiles at her husband, who smiles back and they walk 
           toward the kids when suddenly...

           ANNE FALLS. WHITENESS STARTS TO CREEP IN TO THE EDGES OF THE 
           PICTURE.

                                 SAM
                        Anne?!

           Liza and Mindy look up...

                        OLDER LIZA
                                                       OLDER MINDY
           Mom!
                                              Mom!

           They run over to Sam who kneels by Anne. Anne looks up at 
           them but the WHITENESS is closing in.

                                 ANNE
                        Everything’s... turning white.

                                 SAM
                        Honey... Stay with us.

                        OLDER LIZA
                                                       OLDER MINDY
           Is she going to be okay?
                                              What’s going on?

           But it’s no use. Sam sees this. She’s being pulled out. The 
           world is ending.

                                 SAM
                        I love you...

           She goes to open her mouth to say it back to him when...

           THE WHITENESS OVERTAKES EVERYTHING...

           INT. SLEEP CHAMBER HOLD - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Out of it... A blue screen appears. We’re back in the 
           chamber. Anne opens her eyes, confused for a moment. 
           The chamber door slowly opens. And there is Vivian. Holding 
           up a small flashlight to Anne’s pupils.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Can you tell me your name?

           Everything comes rushing back to Anne and...

           She starts to cry. It becomes more and more violent until it 
           is the ugly weeping that affects us only once a lifetime.

           Vivian shuts off her light and averts her eyes as...

           Anne continues to weep.

           INT. MED BAY - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Anne lies in a hospital bed, asleep.

           She’s getting fluids. She’s recovered a bit, enough to look 
           like a person again. Albeit broken. Vivian’s by her side.

           The door opens and Judy walks in. She sees Anne asleep and 
           hesitates, but Vivian waves her over.

           A moment after Judy settles, Anne opens her eyes.

                                 ANNE
                        Judy...

           Judy smiles warmly.

                                 JUDY
                        Hi...

           Anne fully wakes up and the grief hits her once again. Vivian 
           holds out a glass of water. Anne drinks.

           Judy takes her hand and Anne accepts it. Human touch is nice.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Wherever. Whenever. I’m here for 
                        you. I’m so sorry you lost him.

                                 ANNE
                        It wasn’t just him. Our 
                        daughters...

           And she starts to weep anew. She’s a geyser of tears.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to go back to sleep now.
           Vivian and Judy exchange a worried look. But Anne doesn’t 
           care. She turns away as she continues to cry.

           INT. MESS HALL - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Some time has passed. Anne eats alone. She still looks ragged 
           but at least she’s able to remain conscious. Baby steps.

           Judy sits with Melissa nearby. She looks over at Anne, but 
           Anne ignores her as she eats: slowly, deliberately.

           INT. OBSERVATION THEATER - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Alpha Centauri approaches. A swirl of colors, but large and 
           visible. It’s cosmic beauty at its finest.

           Anne stares out at it numbly, not really looking...

           Tears crop up in her eyes.

           INT. MESS HALL - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Some time has passed. Anne carries a tray of food. She walks 
           over to the table with Judy & Melissa and sits with them.

           INT. HALLWAY - SPACESHIP - DAY

           Anne carries her possessions along a hallway behind Judy and 
           Melissa. She follows them through a hatch into a- 

           DROPSHIP -

           She makes her way to a seat and straps herself in.

           EXT. ORBITAL SPACE - LATER

           The Dropship detaches from the cruiser and starts its journey 
           down to the planet below.

           EXT. AIRPORT - BUBBLE - PROXIMA CENTAURI - DAY

           Anne steps out onto alien soil, or rather, tarmac. She looks 
           up at the bubble that covers the entirety of the small city. 
           It’s astonishing.
           INT. SMALL APARTMENT - LATER

           A door flips open, Anne walks in holding her touch-key and 
           looks around her new apartment. It’s a small studio, and as 
           impersonal as it comes, but it has all the essentials.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE - PROXIMA CENTAURI - DAY

           Anne wears a spacesuit. She twists the final pieces together 
           at the top of a terraformer unit. It looks like an air 
           filtration unit that’s three stories tall.

                                 ANNE
                        It’s ready!

           She waves to Co-Workers down below as she takes a step over 
           to the side of the unit. 

           The unit turns on and atmosphere starts to fly out of it. She 
           looks up, following the stream of oxygen as it rises above...

           INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Anne walks into her home. It’s lived in, now. A routine long 
           established. She kicks off her boots...

           Heads over to the desk, puts a cerebral headpiece over her 
           head and...

           EXT. SIMULATION LOBBY - DAY

           Is instantly transported to a ‘simulation lobby’ - a field 
           with hundreds of ‘windows’ into various simulations.

                                 ANNE
                        What do I try today?

           She passes a bar. A rodeo. A pirate ship. She chooses an 
           amusement park.

           EXT. THEME PARK - DAY

           Anne walks through the park like she’s on a mission. 

           Every vendor. Every janitor. Every ticket taker. She examines 
           every face, looking for him. 

           No luck. She lifts her hands up to her head and...
           INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Pulls her headset off. Back to reality.

           MONTAGE - ANNE SEARCHES FOR SAM

           - Anne waves down to her team on the ground as she steps out 
           of the way of the terraformer vents

           - Anne walks in the door of her small apartment

           - Anne appears in the simulation lobby. She looks around, 
           chooses a-

           - Casino. He’s not there.

           - Boat adventure. No dice.

           - Anne gets out of bed, sleepy for work

           - Anne arrives home, ready to look for him

           for the airlock to cycle

           - Anne wanders through a kid’s birthday party

           - Anne strides frantically through a zoo

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. SIMULATION LOBBY - DAY

           Anne walks through the simulation lobby. She passes 
           simulation after simulation window that she’s already tried.

           Tired and ready to give up for the night, Anne starts to 
           raise her hands to her head when...

           She spots a window to... A temple. It looks exactly like 
           Angkor Wat. Anne looks at it for a long moment before she-

           Steps inside.
           EXT. ANGKOR WAT - SIMULATION - DAY

           The glorious temple. Angkor Wat. Anne strides around a corner 
           into the inner courtyard. 

           There’s a Man, sitting there, having lunch... Sam.

           Relief floods Anne as she rushes up to him.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam.

           Sam turns. He doesn’t recognize her.

                                 SAM
                        Hello. Have we met?

           It’s a punch to the gut. Anne tears up as the joy mixes with 
           sorrow.

                                 ANNE
                        Maybe in another life.

                                 SAM
                        Sorry if we have. My memory is 
                        foggy in this place... There’s 
                        something about it.

           A passing REAL WOMAN sees the interaction and stops to 
           address Anne.

                                 REAL WOMAN
                        Their memories get reset every 
                        day... Best to stick to the sites.

           This is hard to hear, but Anne manages a-

                                 ANNE
                        Thanks...

           As the Real Woman continues on.

           Anne sits down next to Sam.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Do you like it here?

                                 SAM
                        Very much. Occasionally some 
                        missionaries come by. But I shut 
                        them down before they get too rude.

           Sam smiles. As does Anne.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Would you like some of my sandwich?

           Anne shakes her head.

                                 ANNE
                        No thanks... Actually, there’s a 
                        story I want to tell you. If you 
                        have time.

                                 SAM
                        Is it any good?

                                 ANNE
                        It starts with me learning that my 
                        husband’s died.

                                 SAM
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 ANNE
                        Then I jumped off a building.

           Sam gives her a look. We push in on Anne as she narrates:

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        It isn’t what you think. This isn’t 
                        the story of how I lost my husband. 
                        Or how I took my own life. This is 
                        the story of how I found... him 
                        once again...

           EXT. ANGKOR WAT - SIMULATION - DAY

           Sam looks up. It’s clear the story’s now done. He looks 
           saddened by it.

                                 SAM
                        What happened to your kids?

           Anne sits before Sam. YEARS have passed. She looks different. 
           A bit older. A new haircut.

                                 ANNE
                        Gone... But never forgotten.

                                 SAM
                        And your husband? Did you ever see 
                        him again?

                                 ANNE
                        I’m looking at him. Right now.
           Sam looks confused.

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry... My memory is foggy in 
                        this place. Do we know each other?

           Old Anne takes Sam’s hand, gives him a warm smile.

                                 ANNE
                        From a past life.

                                 SAM
                        I dreamt this...

           Sam’s face looks like it’s fighting itself as he struggles to 
           remember. Anne watches him patiently, hoping, always hoping.

                                 ANNE
                        I made a promise to you once. To 
                        bring you back. Do you remember?

           A long moment... But nothing comes. Sam stares blankly ahead.

           With a sad smile, Anne rises.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        One of these days, you’ll return to 
                        me. I’ll see you tomorrow, my love.

           She kisses him tenderly on the forehead.

           Sam looks up at her, struggling to remember something he’s 
           forgotten as... 

           Anne turns away from him. She starts to raise her hands up to 
           her head when...

                                 SAM
                        I miss them.

           Anne stops, surprised. She turns back. Sam’s crying.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        In my dreams. I see Mindy. And 
                        Liza... I miss them so much.

           Anne rushes back to him.

                                 ANNE
                        Sam... Oh, my love, my love.

           They kiss and claw at each other with a frantic desperation.
                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        Stay with me. Please. Stay. I 
                        can’t... Please...

           Sam smiles sadly as he strokes Anne’s hair - wipes the tears 
           from her eyes.

                                 SAM
                        I’m here. I’m right here.

           They sit and hold each other for a long moment, relishing in 
           the feel of the other until...

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You can’t keep doing this.

                                 ANNE
                        What do you mean?

                                 SAM
                        I mean that in a few minutes I’m 
                        going to forget-

                                 ANNE
                        I’ll take every moment I can.

                                 SAM
                        That’s no way for you to live. My 
                        time is over, but you-

                                 ANNE
                        Don’t say that.

                                 SAM
                        Anne, you only have one more life 
                        to live-

                                 ANNE
                        And I want to live it with you. I 
                        want eternity with you.

           Sam smiles as he continues to hold her.

                                 SAM
                        You always wanted forever. But 
                        there’s no such thing...

                                 ANNE
                        We can be together, here, every day-

                                 SAM
                        Hon. I dreamt this. My last dream. 
                        It’s my time... One way or another.
           Tears stream down Anne’s face...

                                 ANNE
                        But you’ve just come back to me...

                                 SAM
                        I know... 

           Anne buries her face into Sam and he holds her as she weeps 
           into his chest.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Most people only get one go at it. 
                        How many lifetimes were we given?

                                 ANNE
                             (sobbing)
                        It’s not enough. Never enough.

           She leans back against Sam. He cradles her and they sit 
           facing the same way.

                                 SAM
                        Anne...

                                 ANNE
                        Don’t. Not yet. Please...

           Sam obliges. Together they stare up at the sky. The temple. 
           Listen to the birds. One. Last. Cuddle.

                                 ANNE (CONT'D)
                        I want you to know that you made me 
                        happy. I’m so grateful for the time 
                        that we had... Our children... 
                        Every moment... Every single one.

           Tears leak out of Sam. 

           He kisses her. It’s gentle. Tender. Loving.

                                 SAM
                        Musoka.

           A VOICE speaks from all around them.

                                 MUSOKA (O.S.)
                        May I be of assistance?

                                 SAM
                        I’m ready now. Thank you for doing 
                        what you could for me.
                                 MUSOKA (O.S.)
                        I understand. Thank you, Sam, but I 
                        require human authorization.

           Sam looks to Anne.

                                 ANNE
                        No... please... I can’t...

           She shakes her head emphatically.

                                 SAM
                        It’s okay.

                                 ANNE
                        I... I don’t know how to say 
                        goodbye...

           Anne can’t look at him. Sam brings her gaze back up. 

                                 SAM
                        I love you.

           Anne takes a deep breath in and... Nods.

                                 ANNE
                        I love you.

           And as they kiss... As they hold each other... The image of 
           Sam fades until...

           He’s GONE.

           Anne’s left alone. Shattered. She weeps. A puddle of despair.

           It takes a long moment...

           And another...

           But eventually Anne’s river of tears slows to a trickle.

           She raises her hands back up to her head and...

                                                              TO WHITE.

                                                               FADE IN:

           ON A PAINTING

           Watercolors portray a barren terrain dotted by terraformer 
           units below a two-star sky.
           EXT. OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE - PROXIMA CENTAURI - DAY

           Anne paints wearing a partial atmo-suit. Some time has 
           passed. She pauses to look out at the spectacular view before-

           She squeezes water from a bottle on to the paintbrush, daubs 
           it in her blue and...

           Adds a final touch to the canvas.

           She takes a step back. It’s done. She smiles.

           INT. AIRLOCK - PROXIMA CENTAURI - LATER

           The airlock cycles and the door opens revealing Anne carrying 
           everything back with her.

           INT. SMALL APARTMENT - PROXIMA CENTAURI - LATER

           Anne walks in, sets her stuff down. Her apartment has been 
           transformed from a cold space to something warm and lovely.

           She picks the new painting back up, looks for a spot-

           Amidst the MYRIAD of PAINTINGS that color the walls.

           And as Anne looks, we pass them all...

           Angkor Wat. Glacier Lagoon. Seven Sisters. London. New York. 
           She’s painted ALL of the places they explored together.

           Anne finds a spot and hangs the new painting on the wall.

           She steps back and stares at the collage of work, becoming 
           lost in thought...

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        You’re not ready yet.

           Anne turns. There is Judy, at the door. She’s dressed up.

                                 ANNE
                        You realize it’s only New Year’s on 
                        Earth...

           Judy shrugs, stepping inside.

                                 JUDY
                        Any excuse for a party.

           Judy hands Anne a pair of glasses. They read: 2094.
                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        For tonight.

           Anne stares down at the glasses for a long moment... Her mind 
           back to a New Year’s party many years before.

                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        You want me to help you pick 
                        something out?

           Anne shakes her head...

                                 ANNE
                        No, thanks. I’ll be right along.

           Anne gives Judy a smile and Judy returns it as she leaves.

           Looking back at the glasses, Anne gets lost in thought once 
           again before she...

           Lifts her gaze to look out the window at the barren terrain.

           In the distance... There’s a shadow of a MAN on the horizon. 

           It’s Sam. He’ll always be there.

           Anne stares for a long while before... 

           She smiles, puts the 2094 glasses on and...

           Walks out of frame.

           We’re left with the view of the horizon. Sam’s shadow 
           standing at its edge.

                                                              FADE OUT.
