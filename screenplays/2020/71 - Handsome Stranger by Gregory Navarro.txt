           EXT. WATERFRONT - OCONEE RIVER, GEORGIA - LATE NIGHT

           CLOUDS and silhouetted BIRDS spiral across a moonlit sky. 

           A MAN builds a BONFIRE along the trembling waters of this 
           river shoreline amidst a lush, lowland forest... 

           We don’t see his face completely... only glimpses for now. 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE
                        This is a story for people who follow 
                        their hearts and make their own 
                        rules...

           The Man peels his clothes... into the FIRE they go. WHUMPH! 
           FLAMES FLARE, HISS... reveal they’re torn... blood-smattered. 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        People who get special pleasure out of 
                        doing something well, even if it’s 
                        only for themselves...

           HIS POV: Items burning... wallets, hotel keys, driver’s 
           licenses, receipts, state maps, postcards, business cards... 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        People who know there’s more to living 
                        than meets the eye.

           FROM AFAR, naked, he looks like ancient man... feral and 
           primordial, offering up sacrifices to pagan gods on high.

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve had the chance to influence many 
                        folks along my journey. Show something 
                        of the truth I’ve seen. That sweet old 
                        couple in Nevada for instance...

           FLASH TO: IN A TRAILER, the bound, bloated CORPSES of an 
           ELDERLY COUPLE, riddled with stabs, gunshots. FLIES BUZZ...

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        ... or that power company fella in 
                        Ohio. Boy, was he a talker...

           FLASH TO: A FOGGY FOREST... in the clearing a limp, NAKED MAN 
           tied to a boulder like Prometheus, neck SMASHED -- 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        ... that hitchhiking gal in Texas. She 
                        was crazy about the Beatles... all you 
                        need is love, love...
           FLASH TO: The body of a YOUNG WOMAN, White Album tee, tangled 
           in a BARBED WIRE FENCE at edge of a CATTLE FIELD, eyes open. 

           Nearby, COYOTES yip and circle, eyes aglow in the dusk... 

                                                           BACK TO:

           THE BONFIRE

           The Man obscured by SMOKE, RAGING FLAMES... 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        My whole life was pointed in this 
                        direction. Just fate really... 

           He rushes towards the water now -- SPLASH! 

           IN THE WATER, the ghostly outline of the MAN as he twists, 
           turns in the surrounding darkness... eddies of breath... his 
           movements are lyrical, a BLACK & WHITE filmstrip in motion...

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        I’m just a good ‘ol fashioned American 
                        success story.

           The B&W IMAGES shift... various FACES bubbling up around 
           him... the B&W STILLS OF CRIME SCENE PHOTOS... the VICTIMS...

           In DEEP WATER, we HEAR the THUMP, THUMP of his HEARTBEAT --

           ABOVE WATER

           The Man resurfaces... gasping breaths... his head bobbing 
           above moonlit waters. Can see the fire along the shoreline...

           As he swims off... for a moment it almost appears as if he’s 
           WALKING ON THE WATER AS HE RISES ON TO THE SHORE... 

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- DAWN. The Man in fresh clothes. Pours whiskey from a 
           bottle on the bonfire’s stray embers... SSSSSS... 

           -- A WHITE 74’ CHEVY IMPALA parked under a willow tree. 
           Sleek. Custom. He wipes it down meticulously with a rag, even 
           the rims. Squeezes the water into a bucket... 

           ... and the bucket DRIP, DRIP, DRIPS water into the muddy 
           earth below... seeping with writhing EARTHWORMS...

           -- UNSCREWS the OHIO LICENSE PLATE from the Impala’s BUMPER. 
           Rifles a set he’s carrying in the trunk: Texas, Florida, 
           Alabama, Connecticut... fastens on a New Mexico plate. 

           STOPS just before closing the trunk. Listens. Trees swaying, 
           insect thrums... BIRD WINGS... a SHAPE DIVING FROM ABOVE -- 

           A strangely-patterned SEAGULL lands on nearby STUMP. 
           Magnificent. Inordinate. It’s feathers shimmer. 
           They stare into each other. 

           HE SLAMS the trunk ending and we’re --

           EXT. FOREST - U.S. HWY 80 - GEORGIA - EARLY MORNING

           VRRROOM! The Impala roars down an empty HIGHWAY, a great 
           white predator on wheels. Pines fence the horizon darkly. 

           The Man, a silhouette at the wheel, AM RADIO buzzing, cig 
           glowing in a SIDEVIEW MIRROR. 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE
                        News of some of my success has 
                        followed me out there...

           UP AHEAD, a FEMALE HITCHHIKER, a pale, freckled beauty, 13 
           but trying real hard to be 18, in bell-bottoms, tee knotted 
           above her stomach, orange yarn ties in her pigtails.  

           The Man pulls over. She breaks into a smile, climbs in. 

           INT. TWILLY’S COFFEE SHOP - MACON, GEORGIA - MORNING

           The Man at a COUNTER in a Mesh cap, back to us. Finishing 
           breakfast, sipping coffee. With scissors, CLIPS an AP 
           article, folds it discreetly into a MOTTLED BROWN BRIEFCASE.

           INSIDE... more ARTICLES, a worn copy of ‘Jonathan Livingston 
           Seagull’ and something familiar... orange yarn ties. 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE
                        No matter where I go, I hear people 
                        talking...

           ABOVE THE COUNTER, a B&W MAGNAVOX TV plays the news. LOCAL 
           ANCHORS report next to a GRAPHIC: MURDER IN MILLEDGEVILLE.

           And he’s not the only one watching... the WAITRESSES, 
           FAMILIES in booths, TRUCKERS on stools...

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Not knowing I’m right there among 
                        them... wearing the mask of them. 

           HEARS their whispers. Their theories. Their dreads. 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, he disappears with his briefcase. 

           EXT. ZAYRE DEPARTMENT STORE - MACON, GEORGIA - MORNING

           AT THE COUNTER, the Man, chatting up the pretty, SALES CLERK 
           with a shopping bag. Flirty as hell. He signs a sales slip.  
           E./I. IMPALA - MOVING - LATE MORNING

           The car’s white REFLECTION GLIDES across STOREFRONTS, WINDOW 
           DISPLAYS. Along sidewalks, PEOPLE cross back and forth -- 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE
                        Sad truth is most people out there 
                        just wanna be one’a the crowd. They’re 
                        beyond help. I mean look at ‘em...

           FACES IN THE CROWD... all AGES... walking, talking...

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        They stroll around in a slumber, 
                        asleep when they think they’re awake. 
                        From womb to tomb, they’ve never met 
                        themselves, never really been alive a 
                        day in their life. 

           The Impala cruises to a stop along a curb...

                               KNOWLES’S VOICE (TAPE RECORDER) 
                        That used to be me. Not anymore. For 
                        the first time, I am alive...

           CLOSE ON: his finger hits STOP on a Panasonic RQ CASSETTE 
           RECORDER... we realize HE’S BEEN LISTENING TO HIS VOICE ON 
           THE CASSETTE RECORDER THE ENTIRE OPENING. 

           Casually hits REWIND... SCHWEEEE -- STOP. PLAY again --

           STOP. Silence. Hits RECORD. Speaks into the attached MIC:

                        It’s only a matter of time before they 
                        catch on to what I’m doing. Until then 
                        my work continues. Nothing can stop 
                        me. The only question now is... 

           IN SIDEVIEW MIRROR: His eyes HUNT OUT FACES IN THE CROWD...

           Hits STOP. Pulls the tape, slides it into a MANILA ENVELOPE 
           addressed to SHELDON YAVITZ. A Coral Gables, FL address.  

           EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN MACON, GEORGIA - DAY

           Drops the package into a CITY MAILBOX. As the lid closes, we 
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL THE MAN FULLY FOR THE FIRST TIME -- 
           PAUL JOHN KNOWLES. 28. Wrangler jacket, jeans, alligator skin 
           boots. Rugged good looks that remind us all devils were once 
           angels and glorious in the eyes of their maker. Tall shock of 
           hair the hue of Kentucky Bourbon, thin mustache.

           Blazes a Kool. Looks right at us. A slight grin. Stalks off. 

           REVVS the Impala... LURCHES from the curb and -- 

                                                           SLAM TO BLACK:

           City SOUNDS drifting upward...

           A modernist, multi-story wedge. Dark windows. Lonely, lamplit 
           windows. Windows strangers gaze out everyday, including -- 

           SANDY FAWKES. A silhouette against the glass of a LOW STORY, 
           cradling a Gitanes cig. Exhales... like a lepidopterist’s

           Sandy on the phone, smoking, unclasping an ankle-aching heel. 
           40, but projects younger. Definitely dresses younger. Gritty, 
           yet glam. A Fleet Street journalist who’s learned how match 
           the lads pint-for-pint though she’s never quite fit in.

                        Telegraph. Mm-hmm. I’m trying to do a 
                        little background on a subject. How 
                        late is your cuttings library open?

                        Ah. That’s the one. Research center. 
                        Brilliant. Mmm, perhaps a fellow 
                        journalist can spare an evening to 
                        show a colleague around?
                                  (checks the time)

           Plops the phone on its cradle. Exasperated. Stubs her cig out

           EXT. CARR RESIDENCE - MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA - NIGHT

           A pleasant neighborhood of fenceless, single-family HOMES. 
           Crime is strictly a “news” phenomenon. But tonight there’s -- 

           COMMOTION. Clusters of POLICE CRUISERS, FIRE DEPARTMENT/EMT 
           vehicles. Startled NEIGHBORS in bathrobes, pjs, huddle around 
           elm trees, on porches. Dogs BARK from houses nearby -- 

                          MILLEDGEVILLE, GEORGIA

                                 COLEMAN (O.S.)
                        Wife came home, found ‘em...  

           THE HOUSE. Door ajar. A pair of ominous lights on inside.

           The speaker, DEPUTY CLIFF COLEMAN, 25, Eagle Scout demeanor, 
           surveys the scene with his boss, POLICE CHIEF JED OSBORNE, 
           late 40s, flecks of grey, half-asleep and newly arrived --

                                 COLEMAN (CONT'D)
                        ... Ellen Carr, she’s a night nurse at 
                        Piedmont Henry, up in Stockbridge.

           Osborne glances over at ELLEN CARR, 30s, in nurse’s UNIFORM, 
           in an AMBULANCE with EMTs. Traumatized.

                                 OSBORNE
                        I’ve seen her around... My daughter’s 
                        high school. She call it in?

                                 COLEMAN
                                  (shakes his head)
                        Neighbors. Coupla of ‘em went in the 
                        residence, confirmed it.
                                  (then)
                        One was throwing up out here when I 
                        pulled up.

                                 OSBORNE
                                  (to nearby DEPUTIES)
                        Make sure the Coroner to has a clear 
                        path --
                                  (to Coleman)
                        C’mon... let’s have look...

           INT. CARR RESIDENCE - FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CRUNCH! Osborne and Coleman stepping over glass puddles...
           Some cataclysm of rage in here. FURNITURE upturned, cupboards 
           open, drawers flung. Curtains are slashed, sofas gouged.

           Coleman crouches, lifts an upturned LAMP... light falls on... 

           ... a FAMILY PORTRAIT. On the wall: The Carrs. Family of 3. 
           Smiles, Sunday best. The DAUGHTER seems awkward, shy.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Osborne inspects the DOOR. No signs of forced entry. Between 
           the CURTAIN, sees the ghostly FACES OF NEIGHBORS peering in. 

           IN THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Both make their way down the darkened hallway into...

           INT. MANDY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Osborne flicks the light on. Posters. Dolls and stuffed 
           animals. Girlish knick knacks and on the BED -- 

           MANDY CARR. 15. Frail body face down, her dark hair matted to 
           the pillow. Legs and feet bound with electrical cords to the 
           BED POSTS... a lone pink sock on one foot and a... 

           ... bright AFGHAN across her body. Osborne gapes at it.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Was she covered when you found her?

                                 COLEMAN 
                        Uh... it seemed inappropriate for her 
                        to be exposed like that.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Take it off. For Chrissakes, Cliff, 
                        y’know better than that. Go on -- 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Sorry, Boss -- 

           Coleman yanks the afghan, revealing Mandy in a tee, nude from 
           the waist down, her spidery legs tinging scabiosa... 

           Osborne crouches across from MANDY’S FACE. 
           Her EYES OPEN, raised to the whites, the sclera. 
           A nylon stocking knotted around her throat and...    

           CLICK. Osborne’s Maglite. Something dark between her teeth...

                                 OSBORNE
                        There’s something in her mouth.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Yeah, I didn’t wanna look too close.

           Osborne pulls a pen, uses it to prod about...
                                 OSBORNE
                        It’s a stocking... like the one she’s 
                        been strangled with.
                                  (stands)
                        Probably to keep her from screaming. 
                        ’S why the neighbors didn’t hear.

           INT. CARR RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The gruesome sight of CARSWELL CARR, 45, naked, atop a king-
           sized bed, hands and feet also bound to the posts with cords. 
           Duct tape along his eyes, mouth. But there’s also --

           PUNCTURE WOUNDS... all over his back, waist, thighs... blood 
           pooled like dried sap... an archipelago of splatter.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Think we’re looking at two suspects 
                        minimum. The ransacking, the binding, 
                        killing in separate rooms, that’s a 
                        lotta manpower. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Could be they walked in on a burglary 
                        and panicked. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Except there’s no signs of forced 
                        entry. 

           KNOCK, KNOCK. In the DOORWAY, the CORONER, 50s, hillbilly 
           stout, natty attire, dragging a leather satchel. Sweaty. 
           FORENSIC TECHS trail lugging CAMERAS, EQUIPMENT.

                                 CORONER
                        Sorry, I’m tardy, Jed. S’dozing off a 
                        helluva hangover at my cabin in 
                        Juliette when Dispatch rang.

                                 OSBORNE
                                  (humoring him)
                        Fall fishin’ trip, yeah?

                                 CORONER
                        Some fishin’. Think the bass were 
                        tipped off, fled the scene. 
                                  (motions)
                        Guess we’ll start here. All this 
                        havoc, we’re bound to pull a print off 
                        somethin’, least a partial...
                                  (to Techs)
                        And don’t gimme any guff about dust -- 
                        use ninhydrin.

           The Techs are nonplussed, used to his nitpicking. The Coroner 
           snaps on some plastic gloves, approaches the body.

                                 CORONER (CONT'D)
                        My preliminary assessment is we can 
                        rule out natural causes... 
                                  (chuckles; re: a wound)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CORONER (CONT'D)
                                 CORONER (CONT'D)
                        Mmm. These are shallow... 
                                  (prods with his finger)
                        Maybe a short flathead. Sharp enough 
                        to make an impact. Blunt enough for 
                        maximum pain. 

                                 COLEMAN
                                  (to Osborne)
                        Maybe some kinda sicko, eh Boss? 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Wouldn’t go that far just yet. 

                                 CORONER
                        Nuff a’these would be incentive to be 
                        forthcomin’ about, say, the location 
                        of hidden valuables.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Fits with the binding pattern but 
                        still...
                                  (to Coleman)
                        C’mon. Let’s give ‘em room to work...

           THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Osborne and Coleman taking notes, comparing --

                                 COLEMAN
                                  (re: Coroner)
                        Fishin’ my ass. Least he has an excuse 
                        to be drunk this time.  

                                 OSBORNE
                        He’s an elected official, my hands are 
                        tied. But once his team wraps and the 
                        bodies are moved, bring Mrs. Carr into 
                        the residence, make a list of all 
                        missing items. Be extra thorough.

                                 COLEMAN
                        You think she can handle that?

                                 OSBORNE
                        We have to try. If we’re lucky we’ll 
                        be able to flag something down the 
                        line. If it’s a crew just passing 
                        through, then we’re already graspin’ 
                        at straws.

           THROUGH THE CURTAINS, Ellen Carr still in the AMBULANCE.

           INT. ATLANTA-JOURNAL CONSTITUTION RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT

           Like a hospital. Halogen-bright. Antiseptic. 

           Sandy at a LARGE TABLE making notes. Lights a cig --

                                 NEARBY CLERK
                        Ma’am, there’s no smoking in the 
                        Research Center.
           Points at a posted PLACARD. Like she’s on fucking yard duty. 

                                 SANDY 
                        ... Right.

           Stubs her cig out. The Clerk glares at her. 

                                 NEARBY CLERK
                        And we’re closing in 15. 

           INT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - BASEMENT BAR LOUNGE - NIGHT

           A place for meeting strangers and being a stranger. A JUKEBOX 
           croons Allman Brothers country.

           Sandy at the bar. Snug in a fresh cardigan, jeans. A Scotch 
           warming her over. Habitually takes in the dim lit FACES...

           Mostly SALESMEN-types. Fading hair, buffalo necks stuffed in 
           off-the-rack Brooks Brothers. Sales all day, dining strangers 
           every night. Some drinking away demons they cannot name.

           Here comes one now, bowling ball belly, three juleps in --

                                 SALESMAN
                        Buy’a drink, sweetheart?

                                 SANDY 
                                  (oh boy)
                        ‘M fine, thank you. I’m just having 
                        the one to wind down, and I’m off.

                                 SALESMAN 
                        What’s the accent ya got there?

                                 SANDY
                        British.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Uh-huh. ‘S what I thought. A Union 
                        Jacker.

                                 SANDY
                        A what?

                                 SALESMAN
                        There’s a Union Jack on yer flag. 
                        Hence, “Union Jacker”...

           Only the Salesman slides a chair over, plops down --

                                 SANDY 
                                  (annoyed now)
                        Oh, please, have a seat.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Let’s play a game of questions --

                                 SANDY 
                        Oh, let’s not --
                             SALESMAN
                                                              SANDY (CONT'D)
           Here’s the first one --
                                                  How long’ve you been married?

                                 SALESMAN (CONT'D)
                        Oh, about 10 years or -- 
                                  (oh shit)
                        -- er, what I meant -- 

                                 SANDY
                        -- is that you should probably be 
                        running along. Maybe phone the little 
                        lady, see how she’s keeping up.

           The jukebox drops a track. The Bee Gees: THE GREATEST MAN IN 
           THE WORLD’. A drunken COUPLE stumble out to the floor badly. 

           It’s at that awkward moment when Sandy catches sight of --

           KNOWLES. Just off the Salesman’s shoulder, down the BAR.

           Stands out in this crowd. Angular looks. Stylish threads. 
           Green suede jacket, flower-patterned shirt, and tie.

           Their eyes MEET. Time SLOWS. The music spikes. Currents of 
           chemistry flow between them.  

                                 SALESMAN
                        -- yer a real cunt, anyone ever tell 
                        you that?

           The Salesman snaps her reverie, pissed she’s ignoring him --

                                 SANDY
                        Is that all you have in that little 
                        nitwit skull of yours? A four-letter 
                        insult -- why is that not surprising? 
                        This cunt’s closed as far as you’re 
                        concerned.
                                  (he blinks)
                        You can fuck off now. Go on. Be speedy 
                        about it.

           The Salesman stammers, shuffles off in a huff. Spell broken, 
           Sandy downs her drink. Done with it. Just done.

                                 KNOWLES (O.S.)
                        You handled that well. Was just about 
                        to come rescue you. 

           He’s even better up close. Smoky eyes. An easy grin. Thin 
           mustache. Smells good too. She won’t let on. Not even close.

                                 SANDY
                        I look like your idea of a damsel in 
                        distress? In need of rescuing?

                                 KNOWLES 
                        Not quite, no.
                                 SANDY
                        So this is just your opening then? 
                        Needs some work.

           Fishes another Gitane from her handbag. Takes her time, let’s 
           the awkward silence linger. Pokes one from the pack, and he’s 
           already there with a Zippo, lighting it --

                                 KNOWLES 
                        Care to dance?

           Motions at the near empty dance floor. Sandy nearly bursts 
           out laughing at the absurdity of his request.

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t think so. I’m hardly tempted 
                        to be the life of this party. Besides, 
                        I have to be up early tomorrow.

                                 KNOWLES
                        How about another drink -- Bell’s 
                        whisky and water, right?
                                  (sets down a drink)
                        I asked the bartender. 

           She smiles. Nicely played.

                                 SANDY 
                        Sure. One drink then.

           They sit. NOTE: Knowles will be now be known as --

                                 KNOWLES/DARYL
                        Lester. Lester Daryl Golden. 
                        My friends call me L.D.

                                 SANDY
                        I can’t call you all that, can I? 
                        We’ve only just met. How about I just 
                        call you, Daryl? A nice handsome name, 
                        it suits you well.

                                 DARYL
                                  (considers)
                        Sure. I’d like that.

                                 SANDY 
                        Wonderful. I’m Sandy.

                                 DARYL
                        I noticed you earlier. In the lobby. 
                        You’re a reporter from London.

                                 SANDY
                        That’s right. I didn’t notice you.
                                  (playful)
                        Stalking around after me, that it?

                                 DARYL
                        No, nothing like that. You were asking 
                        the receptionist for directions to the 
                        Atlanta-Journal Constitution Building.
                                 SANDY
                        Oh, yes. Well, you’ll be happy to know 
                        I found it. It’s much more exciting in 
                        print than in person.

                                 DARYL
                        I could’ve shown you. 

                                 SANDY
                        You know your way ‘round? If you’re 
                        staying here, I assume you’d be just 
                        as clueless on the subject of the 
                        local longitudes and latitudes.

                                 DARYL
                        I know a few, but you’re right, I’m 
                        not from around here. I’m from Santa 
                        Fe. How long you staying here?

                                 SANDY
                        You ask a lot of questions for someone 
                        who only just introduced himself.

                                 DARYL
                        You can ask me anything you want.

                                 SANDY
                        But I haven’t, have I? 
                                  (off his look)
                        Surprise me. Tell me something about 
                        you.

                                 DARYL
                                  (considers)
                        I learned a magic trick recently. 
                        Would you like to see?

                                 SANDY
                        You’ve been saving this magic spiel 
                        for just the right moment to spring on 
                        unsuspecting divorcees and barmaids, 
                        haven’t you?

                                 DARYL
                        Actually, I’ve only performed it once 
                        and not in front of anyone. There’s a 
                        70% chance it’s a complete disaster.

                                 SANDY
                        Oh, you want a prize if it comes off, 
                        s’that it?

                                 DARYL
                        If it’s a success, you let me take you 
                        to dinner.

                                 SANDY
                        As in tonight?

                                 DARYL
                        As in why not? Aren’t you hungry?
                                 SANDY
                        I’m positively ravenous and could eat 
                        a race horse if you served it med rare 
                        with a nice Cab Franc, but go ahead. 
                        Dazzle me.

                                 DARYL
                        Hand me your pack of cigarettes.
                                  (off her look) 
                        You’ll see in a minute.

           She hands the pack of Gitanes from her purse.

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        French... exquisite taste. 
                                  (off her shrug)
                        Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going 
                        to tie this cigarette... 
                                  (pulls one from the pack)
                        ... into a knot without ripping or 
                        tearing it. 

                                 SANDY
                        Like for your tennis shoes?

                                 DARYL 
                        Exactly.

                                 SANDY
                        Now this I’ve got to see.

           He clears a space. Uses the pack’s cellophane packaging... 
           sleeves it around the cigarette methodically... then ties it 
           deftly into a knot, much to Sandy’s disbelief. She CLAPS.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Bloody hell... where’d you learn to do 
                        that?

           He unfurls it, flames it with his Zippo. Takes a long drag...

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        You owe me a fag -- cigarette -- by 
                        the way.

                                 DARYL
                        I know what it means. And you owe me 
                        dinner. I’m buying.

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Impala glides up, the engine a steady purr of restrained 
           power. Daryl makes a theatrical show of opening her door.

                                 SANDY
                        Aren’t you the gentleman? I’ve never 
                        ridden in one of these before.

           She notices the back seat’s full of items, including CLOTHES 
           draped on hangars in the back. Quite odd. 
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        It’s like a wardrobe rack back there. 

                                 DARYL
                        I haven’t had time to take it all up 
                        to the room. I’ve been on the road 
                        awhile, things have piled up. 

           She accepts that. He whips them out of the lot --

           INT. POLYNESIAN RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - NIGHT

           Asian flair, Georgia-style. A surreal pastiche of Pan Asian 
           kitsch: postcards of Polynesian beaches, Buddha statues, 
           electric fountains, flower-haired WAITRESSES.

           AT A TABLE by candlelight, Daryl and Sandy. Drinks, food.

                                 DARYL
                        Sure I’ve had some wild notions... 
                        when I was real young I wanted to 
                        knock off a few banks, become an 
                        outlaw bigger than John Dillinger.

                                 SANDY
                        Quite the romantic, Daryl. Not the 
                        least bit divorced from reality. 
                                  (off his confusion)
                        Dillinger met with a pretty violent 
                        end, didn’t he?

                                 DARYL
                        Sure, but he became famous. Legendary. 
                        Like uh, a living God.

                                 SANDY
                        A dead god. Shot down in the street 
                        like a stray dog.

                                 DARYL
                        Yeah... I guess there’s always a price 
                        to be paid. 

                                 SANDY
                        You left out Houdini with your magic 
                        tricks. 

                                 DARYL
                        Oh, that’s just for kicks. Picked that 
                        up on the road when I was playing bass 
                        guitar in a band. 

                                 SANDY
                        Musically-inclined too. Bravo, Daryl.
                                  (decides its OK) 
                        I was once married to a jazz musician. 

                                 DARYL
                        Oh yeah? 
                                 SANDY
                        A lifetime ago. You still play?

                                 DARYL
                        Not much...
                                  (deflects)
                        You enjoy being a journalist?

                                 SANDY
                        Fleet Street has its ups and downs. 
                        Money can be spotty at times and you 
                        can have insufferable bores for bosses 
                        and colleagues who’d steal a story off 
                        your freshly fallen corpse, but other 
                        than that, it’s utterly fabulous.

                                 DARYL
                        Sounds intense to me. 

                                 SANDY
                        And dangerous too sometimes. I covered 
                        the Yom Kippur War for instance.

                                 DARYL
                        So you’ve seen... death.

                                 SANDY
                        Soldiers in the field. Motor bombings. 
                        Not up close. That sort of thing 
                        interest you? 

                                 DARYL 
                        No... just curious.

                                 SANDY
                        These days, it’s features mostly. 
                        The Gossip trade. 

                                 DARYL
                        People love to be busybodies.

                                 SANDY
                        Sure but they do pay handsomely. I 
                        nearly had Spiro Agnew in an interview 
                        at his Crofton hideaway this morning. 
                        S’just as well. Probably only uses it 
                        to bang his secretaries n’such. 

           He laughs. Can’t help it.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        What... ?

                                 DARYL
                        You’re just different’s all. 
                        Different than any gal I’ve met.

                                 SANDY
                        Well, I’m not just some gal am I? 
                        Maybe just direct. I’ve been told 
                        that. I hope you don’t mean older.

                        That where you headed with this, 
                        Daryl? Way to flatter a lady. 

                                 DARYL
                        No, no, I mean, I enjoy your company. 
                        It’s hard to find.

                                 SANDY
                        You never mentioned what brings you to 
                        Atlanta. Not my idea of a vacation 
                        spot. Probably not anyone’s if we’re 
                        honest. 

                                 DARYL
                        My Old Man’s tangled in a lawsuit here 
                        in civil court. Our family owns a 
                        small chain of restaurants.

                                 SANDY
                        Crikey, I hope it’s not serious. 
                                  (off his look)
                        How long it take to drive here from 
                        New Mexico?

                                 DARYL
                        ‘Bout 9 days. Here, lemme show you --

           Pulls a pen... scrawls on NAPKIN. Moments later, holds up a 
           vivid, hand-sketched MAP of his route through various states. 

                                 SANDY 
                        Well done, Daryl. 

                                 DARYL
                        I’m on my way to Miami now.

                                 SANDY
                        That’s funny, I’m headed to Miami 
                        tomorrow as well. 

                                 DARYL
                        You should let me drive you.
                                  (off her look)
                        Only takes a day. It’s a beautiful 
                        country. Can’t see it from the air. 

           AT A NEARBY TABLE, a beefy BUSINESSMAN-type breaks his 
           chopsticks. YELLS for a fork. They watch, bemused. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        We should go dancing tonight. 

                                 SANDY
                        Oh you’re on about that again. And I 
                        bet you know just the place.

           PRE-LAP ‘WATERLOO’ by Abba --
           INT. DANCING LOUNGE - DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - NIGHT

           Vibrant CROWD. Grass and Harvey Wallbangers in here and...

           ... Daryl leading Sandy onto the DANCE FLOOR. Packed. GUYS in 
           King collars, leather jackets. GIRLS with Motown puffs, bangs 
           or bouffants, platforms, kaleidoscopic polyesters.

           Sandy seems self-conscious amongst this unfamiliar crowd...

                                 SANDY
                                  (shouts over the din)
                        I better finish this --

           Downs her drink, puts it on a ledge. CRASH! It slipped off --  

                                 DARYL
                        Forget it, forget it. No big deal.

           He lulls her to start dancing. Slowly, she follows suit. 

           Under the GLITTER BALL, it’s not long before these two are 
           moving in sync rhythmically -- bodies closer -- touching, if 
           briefly -- colliding and parting, colliding and parting --

           The song flips to ‘SUGAR BABY LOVE’ by The Rubettes and the 
           CROWD ERUPTS, goes ape shit crazy --

           They’re moving faster... his white buckle shoes a blur, his 
           body electric. The CROWD PARTS. Daryl is a man POSSESSED --

           Sandy keeps up -- until she can’t. Suddenly standing with 
           everyone else, watching him perform, in his own world.

           The song ends, the crowd’s APPLAUDING, Sandy included --

                                 NEARBY BLACK GUY
                        Where’s a white boy learn to dance 
                        like that?

           EXT. DISCO LOUNGE - BEHIND THE CLUB - NIGHT

           Sandy and Daryl by a wall railing, tipsy, blissed out. She 
           shivers. He pulls his green coat around her shoulders.

                                 DARYL 
                        Better?

                                 SANDY
                        Yes, it is... ‘S a very nice jacket by 
                        the way. Suede brocade. I used to be a 
                        fashion editor. Where’d you get it?

                                 DARYL
                        A place in Santa Fe... they do custom.

                                 SANDY
                        It fits you well. Like a glove. 
                        Listen... good dancer or not, I’m not 
                        going to bed with you...

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                                  (off his surprise)
                        I know you haven’t asked, but it sure 
                        isn’t difficult to read your thoughts. 
                        I have to hop on a plane to Florida 
                        for this assignment tomorrow. 

                                 DARYL
                        Thought we decided I was driving you.

                                 SANDY
                        Oh is that what you thought? 

           He leans in close... but she pushes him away.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Besides, I can’t go around shagging 
                        complete strangers, now can I? You 
                        could be another Boston Strangler for 
                        all I know.

           Long beat. They both burst out laughing --

                                 DARYL
                        You’re in luck -- the Boston 
                        Strangler’s dead. Pretty sure of that. 

                                 SANDY
                        You have some very wicked people in 
                        this country a’yours. We hear all 
                        about it back in Britain. 

                                 DARYL
                        Every country has its monsters. Grow 
                        them like crops in the soil. America 
                        is no different. England had Jack the 
                        Ripper. 

                                 SANDY
                        A century ago but I see your point. 
                                  (touches his upper lip)
                        How long have you had this mustache?

                                 DARYL
                        ‘Bout a week. You like it?

                                 SANDY
                        Mm-mm. Too bristly. It’ll have to go 
                        if we continue down this path. 

           He leans in... she backpedals... it’s awkward but then she 
           succumbs... a KISS. And another... longer... slow burn and --

                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        GO AFTER IT, BRUTHA! WOO-HOO!

           WHISTLES. WHOOPS. The outburst has Sandy aware in the lot -- 
           lots of lounging KIDS, GAWKERS, coming and going. 

                                 SANDY
                        We should get back. We can’t go around 
                        giving shows for free now can we?
           INT. IMPALA - MOVING - DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - MINUTES LATER

           Cruising Atlanta streets, windows down, traffic empty. The 
           horse power of the car, the velvety drone of ‘NIGHTS IN WHITE 
           SATIN’ by The Moody Blues on the radio. They exchange looks.

           INT. SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - HOLIDAY INN - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Sandy on the edge of the bed, removing her earrings, jewelry. 
           Eyes Daryl through the open BATHROOM DOOR...

           IN THE MIRROR, their eyes meet. He pats shaving cream on his  
           upper lip. Hefts a razor. Two swipes and its gone. Splashes.

           She wanders up behind, hands him a towel. He dries his face.  
           Her fingers flutter across his cheeks...

                                 SANDY
                        Why, yes. That’s more like it. 

                                 DARYL
                        You can kiss me now. 

           Both a playful order, and a soft command.

                                 SANDY
                        I have your permission. Gladly. 

           Reaches her arms up beneath his, hands behind his back. A  
           lingering kiss... a slow, melting burn. Leads him towards the  
           bed, undressing them both --

           IN THE DRESSER MIRROR, their bodies clasped, their hands  
           moving over each other’s bodies...

           She leans on the dresser facing him. Peels off her stockings,  
           aware of his eyes on her every movement. She’s in control  
           though now, performing. He’s transfixed.

           Tosses the stockings at his feet. Christian Dior, that’s how  
           she rolls. Undoes his pants, leads him to the bed.

           Shoves him on his back. He smiles, enjoys the power reversal. 

           She walks over to the MINI-BAR area... returns with a bottle  
           of bourbon. A quick swig. Then POURS some between his legs...

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        That should give you a bit of life. 

           He lets out a muffled AHHH, pulls her to him. They kiss 
           passionately on the bed. He reaches over to the lamp, turns 
           out the light, putting us in... 

           DARKNESS. Excited, desperate breathing... rustling, friction.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Something wrong? 

           The LIGHT SNAPS on. Sandy still. Daryl, looking defeated.
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        It happens, darling. We’ve both had a 
                        lot to drink. 

                                 DARYL
                        Maybe if we wait a bit -- 

                                 SANDY
                        No, we’re both completely knackered 
                        and have to be up in the morning. But 
                        I had a lot of fun this evening. 

                                 DARYL
                                  (fighting shame) 
                        Let’s just wait a minute. I’ll be OK. 

                                 SANDY
                        These things happen, darlin’. Look at 
                        this way: even after all my excuses, 
                        you got me into bed after all. 

           An awkward moment, but he smiles anyway.

           LATER

           Moonlight through the BALCONY WINDOWS. Sandy, asleep in bed. 

           IN THE BATHROOM, Daryl wets his neck. Glares down the MIRROR. 
           Something terrible going on inside of him. 

           Hears... whisper sounds.... faint LAUGHTER. 
           Shuts off the light. CREAKS the door open. 

           Idles over Sandy asleep in the bed, head against her pillow. 

           He scoops Sandy’s Dior stockings off the floor... stretches 
           them between his clenched fists in the shape of a NOOSE... 

           Fights an urge... quickly wraps the stocking around his 
           throat again and again... pulls taught... tight... TIGHTER... 

           CHOKING HIMSELF. His neck bulges, eyes water... he STUMBLES, 
           breathing in hoarse rasps as he loses consciousness...  

           THUDS against the floor GASPING... nose running, tears, 
           coughing, spasming. Turns on his back and -- 

           UPSIDE DOWN POV: Sandy still asleep on the bed. Hasn’t been 
           disturbed. And that’s when he hears, low, guttural laughter -- 

                                 GUTTURAL VOICE
                        ... pansy boy, that’s what you get... 

           A LOOMING SHADOW IN THE ROOM. A HUMAN SHAPE... making its way 
           towards Daryl. It’s missing an arm but the other is HUGE --
           SWINGING DOWN with a LONG STRAP and we SLAM TO --

           DARYL’S EYES OPENING

           Naked, in the bathroom, stocking around his throat. Must’ve 
           passed off. Takes it off. VOMITS in the toilet. Looks out. 
           Sandy, sleeping softly.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - MORNING

           The BULLPEN of this small town station has never been busier. 
           DEPUTIES, RINGING PHONES, COMMOTION. Everyone low on sleep, 
           high on caffeine, adrenaline. Osborne hangs up a phone, grim.

           NEARBY, LIEUTENANT JAMES TULLY, 40s, on his phone, NOTEPAD in 
           hand gives Osborne an update --

                                 LT. TULLY
                        Coroner’s confident the weapon used 
                        for Carswell Carr’s stab wounds was a 
                        pair’a scissors they found. They’re 
                        running forensics. 42 a’them total.

           Somebody WHISTLES. Osborne shhhs him. Eyes a NEARBY HALL.

                                 OSBORNE 
                        And prints?

                                 LT. TULLY
                        Nah. Like John the Baptist washed ‘em 
                        in the Jordan himself. Point a’fact, 
                        they couldn’t find a single usable 
                        print in the whole damn house.

                                 OSBORNE 
                        Of course not.

                                 LT. TULLY 
                        And Carr didn’t die from the stab 
                        wounds. He had a massive heart attack 
                        during the torture.

           INTERVIEW ROOM 2

           Oddly quiet. Coleman at a TABLE across from Ellen Carr, still 
           in her nurse’s uniform, and a friend, MS. CROWLEY, 50s, her 
           hand comfortingly on her arm. Both flipping --

           PHOTO ALBUMS. Mementos from Ellen Carr’s vanquished life 
           before them. She’s struggling to keep it together. 

                                 ELLEN CARR 
                                  (points)
                        This one. From our Ensenada trip.

           She can’t PULL the PHOTO from the plastic -- her hands are 
           trembling. Ms. Crowley takes over, slides it to Coleman.

                                 COLEMAN
                                  (takes it, jots notes)
                        Now, I just need you to review the 
                        list of items on this page, make sure 
                        I didn’t miss anything.

           Ms. Crowley takes it for them to look over. The door opens 
           and Osborne enters...
                                 OSBORNE
                        Cliff, why don’t you take, Miz Crowley 
                        outside, give her some air. I need to 
                        speak to Mrs. Carr a moment.

           Coleman and Ms. Crowley exchange looks of concern.

                                 ELLEN CARR 
                                  (to Ms. Crowley)
                        I’ll be OK.

           Coleman leads Ms. Crowley out, not wanting to go. Door shuts. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        I can have an officer escort you home 
                        so you can pick up anything else you 
                        might need from your residence. 

                                 ELLEN CARR
                        No, keep your men for finding who did 
                        this.

                                 OSBORNE
                        We found your husband’s car. A State 
                        Trooper spotted it in a bar lot near 
                        Allentown. The Pegasus. 

                                 ELLEN CARR
                        I’ve never heard of it. Near 
                        Allentown, you say? 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Yes. The Pegasus is known as a bar 
                        frequented by certain... men. 
                        Homosexuals.

           She takes in this news... a lightning bolt.

                                 OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                        You know any reason for... maybe a 
                        friend a’Carswell’s into that sorta 
                        lifestyle? 

                                 ELLEN CARR
                        Carswell told me he was done with all 
                        that.

                                 OSBORNE
                                  (taken aback)
                        Did your husband usually go out when 
                        you were on the nightshift?

                                 ELLEN CARR 
                                  (ignoring the question)
                        It was just a phase. College fancy, 
                        nothing more. Is the... press going to 
                        hear about this?

                                 OSBORNE
                        Hear about what?
                                 ELLEN CARR
                        I want that detail kept out. I don’t 
                        want people thinking we weren’t 
                        happily married. We were. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        I’ll do my best, ma’am, but -- 

                                 ELLEN CARR
                        You can do better than that. My 
                        Carswell was a good husband, a great 
                        provider, a wonderful father. You’d 
                        know that if you were more involved in 
                        your daughter’s life...

           That was meant to land. But Osborne takes it in stride. 
           She absentmindedly picks up one of the PHOTOS. Gazes at it.

                                 ELLEN CARR (CONT'D)
                        He wasn’t like his colleagues -- out 
                        screwing stewardesses after lobster-
                        martini dinners on business trips. He 
                        helped Mandy with her homework after 
                        school. When he was away, he called 
                        every night. So yes. I think you can 
                        do better than that, Chief Osborne. 

           She drops the PHOTO defiantly. CLOSER... Carswell Carr with 
           Ellen, friends on a beachfront patio...

           ... wearing a green suede jacket we recognize immediately.

           INT. SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

           Sandy suddenly awake. Bothered by a dream already fading... 

           Glances over at Daryl, sleeping peacefully beside her. 
           Almost angelic in shafts of morning light. 

           Goes for a cig, but no lighter. Notices Daryl’s green suede 
           jacket draped on a chair closer than her purse. Digs through 
           the pockets, finds a matchbook. Sparks, deep drag. Debates. 

           Daryl’s eyes flutter... sits up, bangs in his eyes. 

                                 SANDY 
                        Morning, darling. You sleep well?

                                 DARYL 
                        Yeah... you?

                                 SANDY
                        Well enough. How about you conjure up 
                        your best hunter-gatherer instincts, 
                        round us up some coffee and breakfast. 
                        A little room service maybe?

                                 DARYL 
                        I can do that.
           He rises, pulling his pants on. Strolls over to where she is. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        So, last night -- 

                                 SANDY
                        No, not another word about that. 
                        It was lovely. Just leave it.

           Puts his hand on her cheek. She squeezes it, delicately 
           brushing it aside.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t keep a lady waitin’. We’ve both 
                        got a big day ahead of us, don’t we?

           INT. IMPALA - MOVING - ATLANTA STREETS - MORNING

           Daryl at the wheel, Sandy beside him, sipping coffee from a 
           Styrofoam cup. Rounds a corner to --

           THE FULTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE

           A looming, Beaux-Arts-style block of stonework. Arched 
           windows, pilastered pillars, PEOPLE up and down the steps.

                                 SANDY
                        Here’s fine. I’ll just cross.

           ON THE CURB OPPOSITE the front steps, Daryl throws it in 
           park, engine running. Long beat. Then --

                                 DARYL
                        I can pick you up if you need me to.

                                 SANDY
                        Probably best not worry about it. 
                        Besides, you’ve got your case in civil 
                        court. But thanks again for a 
                        wonderful evening.

           He nods. An awkward beat. Before he can protest, she exits, 
           shutting the door. She turns back momentarily --

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Good luck.

           Sees her look both ways, crossing the street in his REARVIEW.

           INT. MILLEDGEVILLE POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           Bullpen still humming. Osborne, now in a Brooks Brothers 
           suit, draws a knot for a tie from a FILING CABINET stash.

                        Miss Helen Ray, a clerk at Zayre 
                        Department store over in Macon heard 
                        about the murders, recognized the name 
                        Carswell Carr from a credit card 
                        purchase yesterday.

           Everyone REACTS --

                                 OSBORNE
                        Holy shit -- what time yesterday?

                                 COLEMAN
                        ‘Round 1pm. She sold a tape recorder 
                        and 4 blank cassettes to a tall, 
                        Caucasian man. Red hair, she thinks 
                        mid-20s. 

                                 LT. TULLY
                        Better make sure the credit card 
                        company knows to flag his credentials.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I’ll get on the horn with ‘em.
                                  (re: tie)
                        Looks good on you. When’s the presser?

                                 OSBORNE 
                        In an hour --
                                  (to Lt. Tully)
                        You hear that, Jimbo? Boy’s lying his 
                        ass off but making me feel better. ’S 
                        how you get promoted around here.

                                 LT. TULLY
                        Oh, in that case, it looks like a 
                        refried dog turd.

                                 OSBORNE 
                                  (to Coleman)
                        We gotta get her with a sketch artist 
                        too. Who do we know over there? Damn 
                        best lead we have yet --

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        I’d say it’s the only lead you’ve got.

           RONNIE ANGEL looms, seemingly out of thin air. Nothing 
           angelic about this marble slab of a man. 30s. Appears every 
           inch the ex-wrestler in a Sears suit. Buzz cut. Restrained 
           power like bands around dynamite. Pops a butterscotch button. 

                                 LT. TULLY
                                  (who the fuck are you)
                        Help you with something?

                                 ANGEL
                        Special Agent, Ronnie Angel. Georgia 
                        Bureau of Investigation.  

                                 OSBORNE
                        GBI? But we didn’t call you. 
                                 ANGEL
                        County Comish be my guess.

           Osborne exchanges bewildered expressions with his men.

                                 OSBORNE
                        I haven’t spoken to him in months.

                                 ANGEL
                        Part of your problem right there.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Don’t think he minds, either.

                                 ANGEL
                        Pretty self-explanatory, way I heard. 
                        The last Police Chief was the County 
                        Comish’s huntin’ buddy. Didn’t wanna 
                        sack him but that fella couldn’t stay 
                        off the ‘shine and clubbing the tar 
                        outta colored detainees.
                                  (bristles all around)
                        The Mayor sacked ‘im, probably afraid 
                        of Yankee lawsuits. They brought you 
                        in to clean it up, but that don’t mean 
                        the County Commish likes you. Point’a 
                        fact, he’s probably looking to shitcan 
                        you the moment the right opportunity 
                        presents itself.

                                 OSBORNE
                        You’re more informed than most State 
                        sends our way, I’ll give you that.

                                                             OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                                                  ‘nuff of that.
                              COLEMAN
           We’re not a bunch of country 
           bumpkin rednecks here --

           Osborne cuts him down with a stare. Angel shrugs.

                                 ANGEL 
                        Let’s you and I ride up that lead, 
                        Chief. We can use a sketch artist from 
                        my Macon branch.
                                  (to Coleman)
                        You got that address, right?

           Coleman looks at Osborne, unsure. Osborne nods. No 
           discussion. Hands Angel the paper with the address.

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                                  (re: Osborne’s tie)
                        And Chief, go with a blue tie for that 
                        presser. I’m wearing brown and I’m 
                        gonna be standing right next to you. 
                        Wouldn’t want us to match.

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - LOBBY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           The TV plays the news in the lobby. The FRONT DOOR opens and 
           a tired Sandy drifts in. Notices SOMEONE reading a NEWSPAPER 
           on a couch with a bold headline: HORROR IN MILLEDGEVILLE.

           The paper lowers. Daryl. Flashes that easy grin.

                                 DARYL
                        Guess what? No trial. We settled. 

           She can’t decide if she’s happy to see him.

                                 SANDY
                        ’S wonderful. You leaving soon?

                                 DARYL
                        Tomorrow. What’re you up to?

                                 SANDY
                        Heading to the lounge for a quick wind 
                        me down. It’s been a day. I’m booked 
                        on a 6:20 flight out tonight.

                                 DARYL 
                                  (checks his watch)
                        It’s only 3. We should celebrate a 
                        little. I’ll drive you to the airport.

                                 SANDY
                        I s’ppose I have a couple hours. Why 
                        don’t we explore? We can walk. 
                        You see much more when you walk.

           He smiles, enjoying the echo of their earlier conversation.

           INT. PEACHTREE CENTER - DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - AFTERNOON

           A kaleidoscopic, glass maze in the heart of Atlanta’s 
           decaying convention district. An insular city-within-a-city. 

           Daryl and Sandy explore... like tourists or newlyweds...

           INT. HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - MAIN LOBBY - DUSK

           Architectural splendor. Fountains, towering escalators, 
           plants winding down from balconies over 20 stories high. 

           Daryl and Sandy take it all in, tiny among the surroundings.
           EXT. HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - ELEVATORS - MINUTES LATER

           Daryl and Sandy ZOOM to the top, city glittering around them.

           INT. HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - POLARIS BAR - DUSK

           The revolving Polaris bar is a blue-glass dome with 360(cid:0) 
           views of Atlanta. Daryl and Sandy at a table with cocktails.

                                 DARYL
                        Every man should leave a mark on this 
                        life.

                                 SANDY
                        And what do you think you’ll be 
                        remembered for?

           Daryl genuinely considers his response. Pivots --

                                 DARYL
                        You ever written a book?

                                 SANDY
                        I haven’t been published longform yet, 
                        but at some point I will -- proper. I 
                        have some proposals out. 

                                 DARYL 
                        Would you write a book about me?

                                 SANDY 
                        Why, you have a riveting secret life 
                        you haven’t told me about? Perfect for 
                        the paperback rack?

                                 DARYL
                        I haven’t got long to live.

                                 SANDY
                        You what? Are you ill?

                                 DARYL
                        No, nothing like that...
                                  (then)
                        I’m going to be killed. Sooner than 
                        later. It might be in two weeks, maybe 
                        two months, I don’t know when exactly, 
                        but within in a year, I’ll be dead.

           Sandy, waiting for the joke. For common fucking sense. Nope.

                                 SANDY
                        Killed? Killed by who? 

                                 DARYL
                        For things in my past. I’ve made some 
                        tapes that explain things... kinda a 
                        diary of sorts. So that when it 
                        happens the truth can be known. I’m 
                        sure it’ll make world headlines.
                                 SANDY
                        And where are these tapes now?

                                 DARYL
                        With my lawyer in Miami. In his safe, 
                        sealed with instructions to only be 
                        opened after my death.

                                 SANDY
                                  (taken aback)
                        Bloody hell... you’re serious.

                                 DARYL
                        That’s where I’m headed this weekend. 
                        I think you should write the book. 
                        It’s a lot to ask, I realize... 

           The lounge is full but right now they’re the only people 
           here. A shift in atmosphere powered by Daryl’s intensity.

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        The tapes are a sort of... diary with 
                        my thoughts about things... my past. 
                        But I’m not a writer -- you are.

           A COCKTAIL SERVER intrudes. Daryl waves her off. 

                                 SANDY
                        This is the moment where you say, 
                        “Gotcha luvie,” and tell me this whole 
                        thing is just a joke in poor taste.

                                 DARYL
                        I wish it were that simple.

                                 SANDY 
                                  (weirded out)
                        I’m tired. We should get going.

                              DARYL 
                                                              SANDY (CONT'D)
           I upset you.
                                                  I’m fine.

                                 DARYL  (CONT'D)
                        I can drive you.

                                 SANDY
                        No, I’ll grab a cab, thank you.

           And she leaves. He stares after her as she exits -- 

           EXT. HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - POLARIS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl chases Sandy down. She shakes hand off her shoulder.

                                 SANDY
                        Why the hell would you say something 
                        like that to me?
                                 DARYL
                        But I thought a woman like you would 
                        understand.

                                 SANDY
                        What’s that supposed to mean? You 
                        really frightened me up there.

                                 DARYL
                        Sorry... I didn’t mean to upset you.

                                 SANDY
                                  (looks at her watch)
                        Fucken hell, I missed my flight too.

                                 DARYL
                        You can grab the next one. C’mon, just 
                        lemme drive you to the airport. I 
                        won’t mention anything about it again. 

           Sandy considers... her journalistic instinct at work.

                                 SANDY
                        I’m bloody starving. Let’s get out of 
                        this cold. Not another word about it.

           INT. ALL-NIGHT DINER - NIGHT

           One of those Mel’s Diner knockoffs with car ports, a walk-up 
           counter. Sandy and Daryl in a booth before the remains of 
           what was probably a silent meal.

                                 SANDY
                        Daryl, I have to ask...
                                  (off his look)
                        Have you gotten yourself in a trouble? 
                        Somebody have it out for you?

                                 DARYL
                        No, nothing like that.

                                 SANDY
                        I’ve met some shady characters in my 
                        time but not someone upset enough to 
                        want to kill me. Not even my ex-
                        husband -- though I’m sure it crossed 
                        his mind.

                                 DARYL
                        There’s a story there. I’d like to 
                        hear it.

                                 SANDY
                        Only you’re dodging my question.

                                 DARYL
                        I thought you didn’t want me to talk 
                        about it. 

                                 SANDY
                        I don’t. But humor me anyway.  
                                 DARYL
                        I told you I don’t know who it’ll be.

                                 SANDY
                        Is it Organized Crime? Are you a mob 
                        hit man or something?

           Shakes his head. Maybe enjoying the game.

                                 SANDY  (CONT'D)
                                  (snaps her fingers)
                        I got it. You’re in, what’s that -- 
                        oh, bloody hell -- witness protection. 

                                 DARYL
                        That’s a good one, but not quite. 

                                 SANDY
                        You rob a bank? Make off with your 
                        mates’ cut? Off your rocker? Planning 
                        to assassinate another Kennedy? 
                        Who’s left anyway? Teddy?

           Both laugh at how absurd it all sounds.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe it’s all just a come-on to get 
                        my interest.

                                 DARYL
                        But I already got you into bed. 

                                 SANDY
                        Once. And you aren’t likely to ever do 
                        it again at this rate. 

                                 DARYL
                        So we’re bargaining now. 

                                 SANDY
                        And you’re withholding. 
                                  (muses)
                        I’ll get it out of you yet. 

           INT. IMPALA - DANCE HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Cars, CLUB-GOERS. MUSIC PULSING. Daryl pulls in, parks.

                                 DARYL
                        You know, you haven’t asked me about 
                        government work. 

                                 SANDY
                        As in the military? 

                                 DARYL
                        Sometimes the government needs things 
                        done the public can’t know about. 
           Sandy brightens... does her best to contain it. The first 
           kernel of the truth she’s been hunting for.

                                 SANDY
                        Which is why you’d put them on tapes 
                        and gave them to your attorney.

                                 DARYL
                        That’d be one way to protect my story 
                        in case something happened to me.

                                 SANDY
                        Or when.
                                  (skeptical)
                        So this business about being in your 
                        father’s business back in New Mexico 
                        is what -- some kind of cover story?

                                 DARYL
                        I didn’t start working with my father 
                        until recently. He wanted me to, for a 
                        long time. Maybe I should’ve listened. 

           Sandy’s hooked. But knows she’ll have to be coy, play along.

                                 SANDY
                        I think I’ve had enough of this grim 
                        guessing game for the evening. 

                                 DARYL
                                  (re: Hall) 
                        Shall we?

                                 SANDY
                        How’d I let you talk me into this 
                        again?

           INT. DANCE HALL - DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - LATER THAT NIGHT

           It’s Saturday Night Fever, Southern-style...

           ... TWO STORIES OF JAMMED DANCE FLOORS. BODIES grooving to 
           George McRae’s ‘ROCK YOUR BABY’. On the LOWER FLOOR...

           ... DARYL AND SANDY. BYSTANDERS surrounding them as they 
           swirl with abandon... rhythmic, sexual energy palpable...

           EXT. BEHIND DANCE HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           They couldn’t wait for the car. Making out like horny 
           teenagers by a set of DUMPSTERS, pawning and panting. 

                                 SANDY
                                  (in his ear)
                        I want you...

                               DARYL
           Now -- ?
                                                              SANDY (CONT'D)
                                                  -- YES -- INSIDE ME -- NOW!
           She goes for his pants to free him, but he brushes her away, 
           reaches up her skirt with his hand between her legs. Hikes 
           her higher against the wall, her legs enveloping him...

           Her heels fall... bumps her head. Awkward, but she gives over 
           to the ecstasy of it, his face buried in her neck, climaxing.

                                 HELEN RAY (PRE-LAP)
                        Was real specific about what he 
                        wanted...

           INT. ZAYRE DEPARTMENT STORE - MACON, GA - DAY

           MISS HELEN RAY, 20s, country gal next to her STORE MANAGER, 
           50s, behind the COUNTER, across from Angel and Osborne. We 
           recognize her as the clerk Knowles visited earlier. 

                                 HELEN RAY
                        ... a portable, battery-powered 
                        cassette recorder. Said he was a 
                        traveling salesman and needed it to 
                        make notes on the go.

                                 OSBORNE 
                        What’d you think of him?

                                 HELEN RAY
                        Well, he uh, smelt good. He was 
                        polite. Politer’n most that come in 
                        here anyway. He didn’t seem like the 
                        type of person who, uh... who you’re 
                        looking for. A killing type...
                                  (off their looks)
                        He was nice. I said that right?

                                 ANGEL
                        You’re gonna have to come with us, 
                        Miss. Sit with a sketch artist.

                        HELEN RAY
                                                          STORE MANAGER
                                                    (jumping in, irritated)
           I’m not in some kind of 
           trouble am I?
                                                  How long will this take?

                                 ANGEL
                        It’ll take as long as it takes, sir.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        It’s just that, I’m short-handed. My 
                        other girl called in sick. Now this. I 
                        don’t think we can manage without her.

                                 ANGEL
                        Oh, you’ll manage. Lucky for you, 
                        we’re going to keep the fact the 
                        victim’s credit card was used here for 
                        the time being out of the papers.

           Shuts the Store Manager up instantly. 
           EXT. HOLIDAY INN - HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Sandy next to the Impala, smoking a cig. Deliberating. 

           Daryl exits the hotel with her luggage. Loads the car. 

           INT. IMPALA - MOMENTS LATER

           As Daryl steps in, he hands her three stacks of NEWSPAPERS: 
           an ATLANTA-JOURNAL CONSTITUTION, a NY TIMES, a MIAMI HERALD.

                                 DARYL
                        A local, a national, and a UK paper 
                        for where you’re headed. Figure a 
                        journalist wouldn’t mind a little 
                        reading material for the flight.

                                 SANDY
                                  (taking them)
                        ‘S mighty thoughtful of you...

           As Daryl turns the ignition --

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Wait. 
                                  (he does)
                        I’ve been thinking about your offer to 
                        drive me to Miami.

                                 DARYL
                        It’s still on the table. 

                                 SANDY
                        Unless you think it’s a terrible idea 
                        which it certainly might be.

                                 DARYL
                        I understand the need for company.

                                 SANDY
                                  (stung)
                        What do you mean?

                                 DARYL
                        Traveling around the way you do. 
                        It must get lonely. 

                                 SANDY
                        What’re you implying? That I’m 
                        desperate for company or something? 

                                 DARYL
                        No, I didn’t mean it that way.

                                 SANDY
                        How’d you mean it, then? Let’s get 
                        this straight -- I don’t need you, or  
                        anybody. You and I are nothing alike.
                                  (then)
                        Shit, maybe this is a terrible idea. 
                                 DARYL
                        You’re overthinking it.
                                  (starts the car; grins)
                        ‘Sides, if I change my mind, I can 
                        just dump your body on the side’a the 
                        road somewhere. 

                                 SANDY
                                  (softening)
                        At least I’ll be a suntanned corpse.

           The opening strains of John Denver’s ‘MY SWEET LADY’ over:

           ROAD MONTAGE:

           Their VOICES accompany us through a SEQUENCE OF SHOTS...

           -- HIGH ABOVE as the Impala curves through WETLAND FOREST 
           ROADS, past thick tree lines and mostly deserted roads. 

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        What was it like growing up in New 
                        Mexico? 

           -- DARYL DRIVES THE IMPALA DOWN RTE 75, Sandy with her window 
           open, warming herself against the autumn sunlight. 

                                 DARYL (V.O.)
                        Probably ordinary compared to anything 
                        you’re accustomed to. Not fantastic. 
                        Not Fleet Street. 

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        It’s not all that fantastic. Your 
                        parents still together? 

           -- AT A RAILROAD CROSSING, the Impala waits for a rusty 
           FREIGHTER to pass. Crosses when the GATE ARMS rise. 

                                 DARYL (V.O.)
                        Oh, my Ma, she’d never leave my Old 
                        Man. Never. I also have two sisters. 
                        One’s a beautician, the other’s 
                        married. Fairly ordinary. 

           -- A ROADSIDE DINER, Daryl and Sandy in the WINDOW. 

                                 DARYL (V.O.)
                        My Old Man and I don’t see eye-to-eye 
                        much. He didn’t like my ambition.

           As they leave, Daryl gives some HOBO some spare change. 

           -- THE IMPALA glides over the broken white lanes of RTE 75. 
           Sandy naps. He looks content. 

                                 SANDY (V.O)
                        Must be difficult working for your 
                        father. Surprised you agreed to it. 
           -- AT GAS STATION CONVENIENCE STORE, a CLERK hands Daryl a 
           credit card slip to sign. He does so quickly. 

                                 DARYL (V.O.)
                        It’s just for now. I’ve got my eye on 
                        other things, bigger things...

           In the gas station WINDOW, SANDY studies her reflection among 
           the bright, silly American logos. Pepsi-Cola and Pennzoil 
           Motor Oil and Amigos Tires. Frets about aging.

           Daryl pumps gas. Cleans the Impala windows scrupulously.

           Sandy checks her new SUNGLASSES in the visor mirror. 
           Youngish, they make her feel better. She rips the tag off.

                                 DARYL (V.O.)
                        What about your family?  

           Nearby, a DAD and MOM attempt to wrangle 3 hyper, pre-
           adolescent KIDS into a CAMPER VAN. 

           Daryl and Sandy watch them, amused for different reasons.

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        An older brother and sister, Mum and 
                        Dad. A charmingly middle-class, Oxford 
                        household with a touch of 
                        eccentricity. Neighbors coming and 
                        going, tea at 6, bedtime stories, that 
                        sort of thing --

           INT. IMPALA - MOVING - US RTE 129 - DAY

           Daryl driving, Sandy, feet on the dash. The Denver track 
           still humming from the RADIO... 

                                 DARYL 
                        You were loved. That’s a special 
                        thing.

                                 SANDY
                        ’S where you have one up on me, Daryl. 

           He looks at her. She shrugs. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        The reality is a bit darker. More 
                        Dickens than Oxford.
                                  (why not)
                        My mother abandoned me as a baby. Left 
                        me at a crossing near Grand Union 
                        Canal. Some maintenance worker found 
                        me. I suppose I should thank him for 
                        it, send him Christmas card...
                                  (laughs)
                        So I grew up in an orphanage. As much 
                        as you can grow up in a place like 
                        that. Wicked, wicked nurses. They’d 
                        beat you for any little infraction.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Rip your hair out by the handful, 
                        stuff you in a broom closet for hours 
                        on end... 
                                  (lights a cig)
                        Far as Mummy goes, I don’t know who 
                        she is or where she is. But I always 
                        imagined a sibling or two. Maybe a 
                        brother, just shows up one day looking 
                        for me, wants to go grab a pint. 
                        I’m not holding my breath...   

           Daryl hanging on her every word... 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t know why I just told you that. I 
                        don’t tell anyone that. But for some 
                        reason I feel comfortable with you.

                                 DARYL
                        I’m glad you feel that way with me.  
                                  (then)
                        How do you feel about a little off-the-
                        road detour?

           EXT. IMPALA - MOVING - US RTE 129 FLORIDA BRIDGE - DAY

           The Impala zips over before pulling down the embankment --

           I./E. IMPALA - UNDER THE BRIDGE - SUWANNEE RIVER - DAY 

           MOVING along the muddy river bank past several GARGOYLE-ESQUE 
           FISHERMAN, casting worms from old tin cans on their hooks -- 

           EXT. SUWANNEE RIVER - DOWNSTREAM - DAY 

           The Impala is parked now and they’re exploring along --

           THE RIVER’S EDGE. Sandy, child-like, arms upraised, wanders 
           under the shadowy canopy of straggly PINE TREES draped in a 
           silky seaweed. Her fingers brush against them...

           The sound of the FOREST RISES... a RISING SWOON of water, 
           birds, insects, wind. She closes her eyes, takes it all in...

           Nearby, Daryl watches, spools some moss into his hand.

                                 SANDY
                        It’s beautiful isn’t it?

                                 DARYL
                        It’s cotton moss. Beautiful killers. 
                        All of them.

                                 SANDY
                                  (opens her eyes) 
                        What do you mean?

           Like a snapped reverie. Makes Daryl ashamed for doing so. 
                                 DARYL
                        All these trees are dying. The moss is 
                        slowly killing them. The whole South 
                        has trees like this, dying slowly.

                                 SANDY
                        Don’t forget the beautiful part.
                                  (grabs a piece)
                        I’m taking a lock as a souvenir.

           LATER --

           Deeper along the river’s edge, they come upon an ABANDONED 
           YELLOW SCHOOL-BUS overrun with Kudzu vines. Like something 
           out of a fairy tale. They explore inside and out.

           LATER --

           The Impala creeps along the River’s edge, towards a deserted 
           clearing with a GRAINY BANK. Perfect for a --

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        -- what’re you doing?

                                 DARYL
                        Going for a swim. You should join.

           Stops. Kills the engine. Starts shedding his clothes -- 

                                 SANDY
                        Are you ill? That water looks like a 
                        bog’s arse -- 

           But he’s naked out of the Impala. RUSHES into the water 
           headfirst. Makes some WHOOPING sounds as he swims -- 

           Sandy won’t budge. If only she had more willpower. If -- 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                                  (calls out)
                        Only for a minute, yeah?

           And she steps out of the Impala. Strips to her underwear, 
           still Dior, and absolutely out of place. Wades in SLOWLY... 
           It’s FREEZING. Looks mortified at the edge. Trembles. 

                                 DARYL
                        You have to do it fast or you’ll psych 
                        yourself out. It’ll be OK...

                                 SANDY 
                        Bugger... alright...

           She returns. Stops. HOPS -- SPLASH -- the SHOCK OF COLD WATER 
           takes her breath away -- can scarcely breathe -- suddenly 
           Daryl’s there -- lifting her up like a water baptismal.

                                 DARYL
                        There, there... I gotcha. I gotcha.
           EXT. SUWANNEE RIVER - MOMENTS LATER  

           IN THE RIVER now, further down, Daryl shows Sandy the 
           Palmistry lines on her hand, outlining them on her palm...  

                                 DARYL
                        Line of the Heart... Mount of the 
                        Sun... Line of Life...

           As they swim throughout the river, laughing, splashing, 
           exploring, their V.O.’s OVERLAPPING --

                          KNOWLES (V.O.)
                                                           SANDY (V.O.)
           What is your biggest fear?
                                                  Being avoidable. Being 
                                                  unnoticed.

           Being ordinary?
                                                  Yes... I s’ppose that’s 
                                                  right.

                                 KNOWLES (V.O.)
                        There’s nothing ordinary about you.

           Tell me something perfectly 
           useless about yourself.

                                                  I know all the faces on the

                                                  I agree. You?
           That is perfectly useless, 
           Daryl.

                                                           DARYL (V.O.)
                                                  What do you think happens 
                                                  after we die?
                           SANDY (V.O.)
           I know all the books in the 
           Gideon Bible, Old and New 
           Testament. That’s all they 
           let me read in the orphanage.

                                                  Give it a shot.
           I haven’t thought that far 
           ahead.

                           SANDY (V.O.)
                                                           DARYL (V.O.)
                                                  I like that. Reminds me of 
                                                  Calvino’s Imaginary Cities. A 
                                                  magical city where everyone 
                                                  changes roles periodically.
           I think we’re all just 
           background actors in other 
           people’s dreams. From death 
           to eternity. Shifting roles, 
           in and out. A dream cast.

                           SANDY (V.O.)
                                                           DARYL (V.O.)
           What do you think happens 
           when we die?
                                                  We live on, I think. We’re 
                                                  eternal. No matter what 
                                                  happens to us. Eternal.

           LATER --

           ATOP THE IMPALA’S HOOD on a blanket. Drying off. Gazing up at 
           FLOCKS OF BIRDS spiraling the sky including a lone --  
                                 SANDY
                        -- that a seagull? I thought gulls 
                        only flew over the ocean.  

                                 DARYL
                        No, they fly over all types of water. 
                        In fact, it reminds me of the greatest 
                        influence in my life.  

                                 SANDY
                                  (turns to face him)
                        Now, we’re getting places. Do tell.  

                                 DARYL
                        Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It’s a 
                        book by Richard Bach. You heard of it?

                                 SANDY
                        No. What’s it about? 

           IN THE SKY: THE LONE SEAGULL we’ve seen before, circling 
           lyrically in the air... 

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        It’s a fable about what happens when 
                        an individual breaks away from the 
                        flock. He risks everything to discover 
                        experiences that others in the flock 
                        could never know or understand. 
                        Eventually he discovers the freedom to 
                        fly his own pattern, go his own way. 
                        But he gets ostracized for it. 

                                 SANDY (O.S.)
                        Not a happy ending then.

                                 DARYL (O.S.)
                        But he’s become something else. 
                        His own creation.
                                  (beat)
                        What about you? You’re a writer -- I’m 
                        sure you’ve had influences. 

                                 SANDY
                        None more than a headmistress I had 
                        once. She encouraged my writing, 
                        through all the insults, the bullying. 
                        I won an art scholarship and was able 
                        to leave the bloody foster system for 
                        good. Wrote my way out I did.

           Daryl’s about to respond -- hears a NOISE. Coming closer --

           TWO RIVER RATS. Hobo Deliverance-types, makeshift camping 
           gear. Approaching. Daryl instantly alert. Sandy sitting up. 

                                 DARYL
                                  (hands her the keys)
                        Get in the car and lock it. 
                                 SANDY
                                  (low)
                        Why are they dangerous...? 

                                 DARYL
                        I don’t wanna find out. Go. 

           Sandy jumps off, slips into the Impala. Locks the doors.

           WITH DARYL... sliding his shirt on, crosses to meet them. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        Help you boys with somethin’?

                                 BEARDED RIVER RAT
                        S’wrong with your lady friend?

                                 LONG-HAIRED RIVER RAT
                        Tell ‘ir we don’t bite... 

           Laughs like a wheeze. Half his teeth missing. 

                                 DARYL
                        Yeah, but maybe I do. Suggest you both 
                        keep on goin’. Don’t want any trouble.  

                         BEARDED RIVER RAT
           Sounds ta me as if he’s 
           bossin’ us around...
                                                      LONG-HAIRED RIVER RAT
                                                  ... Fer sure what it sounds 
                                                  like to me.

           SANDY’S POV: Daryl doesn’t wait. ATTACKS. JUST PUMMELS BOTH 
           MEN. Fists, knees, elbows, STOMPING THEM AS THEY’RE DOWN -- 

           Doesn’t hear Sandy yelling, HONKING THE HORN for him to stop.

           He snaps out of it. Doubles back to the car. They drive off -- 

           I./E. IMPALA - MOVING - U.S. RTE 75 - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           They’ve been driving in silence. 

                                 DARYL
                        Real sorry you had to see that back 
                        there. 

                                 SANDY
                        For a minute, I thought you were going 
                        to kill ‘em both. 

                                 DARYL
                        I wasn’t going to do that. 

                                 SANDY
                        I’d bloody hope not. What if it was 
                        all just a misunderstanding?

                                 DARYL
                        Is that really what you think?
                                 SANDY
                        No...
                                  (then)
                        They were going to hurt us weren’t 
                        they?

                                 DARYL
                        Maybe more than just a robbery, be my 
                        guess. And we were a ways from any 
                        kind of help. But I wouldn’t let them. 

           She watches his eyes dart in the REARVIEW. He SLOWS, pulls 
           the Impala to the SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, engine running. 

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        You mind driving some? I need a quick 
                        break... 

                                 SANDY
                        OK... Lucky for us I learned how to 
                        drive on the right side of your road. 

                                 DARYL
                        Just for a little while.  

           She slides over him behind the wheel and he slides to the 
           passenger side. Only they stop, as their lips briefly touch. 

                                 SANDY
                        There’s blood on your face here...

           He POPS the glovebox... a handkerchief inside. She takes it, 
           starts to wipe the blood off... only they kiss... and more... 
           it’s heated, passionate... CARS and TRUCKS pass OUTSIDE. 

           I./E. IMPALA - U.S. RTE 1 - MOVING - AFTERNOON

           Florida’s version of PCH... a four-lane highway along scenic 
           coastline of oceanfront RESORTS, HOTELS, HIGH RISES. 

           Sandy’s at the wheel, Daryl sleeping soundly in her lap. 
           Abruptly wakes... disoriented, startled. 

                                 SANDY
                        Quite the nap you took, Daryl.

           He sits up. PALM TREES, the SUN drowning in the distance. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Look how far I’ve gotten. I drive a 
                        lot faster than you do. 

           He glances at the speedometer. She’s going 95. If Daryl’s  
           concerned -- he might be -- he does his best not to show it.

                                 DARYL
                        Where we headed?  
                                 SANDY
                        Never stayed at the Fontainebleau 
                        before. Supposed to be rather  
                        glamorous. You up for it?

                                 DARYL
                        Sure... I’m up for it. 

           EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

           A citadel of iconic luxury along Atlantic Beach. Sun tans and 
           sundresses and cigars under Panama hats and -- 

           Daryl and Sandy. Outliers departing the Impala. Tall, pale 
           cream redheads even after being out in the sun all day. 

           They both seem to know it... sharing the secret looks couples 
           develop over time, Daryl tipping a BELLHOP for their luggage.

           STAY ON THEM past hanging garlands, under crystal chandeliers 
           like upside down wedding cakes, Cal Tjader BEATS buzzing...

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

           Galaxies from their last suite. Luxurious in every way. 
           Ocean views, blades of light. Sandy on the phone. 
           Daryl on the BALCONY looking out. 

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Both Sandy and Daryl at a sunken table along the wall. 
           Debonair evening wear. Only something’s off with Sandy. 

                                 SANDY
                        Sure you’re up for this? You don’t 
                        have to meet my friends.  

                                 DARYL
                        I don’t mind. They’re from London? 

                                 SANDY
                        Jim’s at the Enquirer but we worked at 
                        the Daily Mail together when I was 
                        fashion editor there. He helped get me 
                        my trial run. And Susan is, well, an 
                        artist, a painter. For now anyway. 

                                 DARYL
                        Just for now?

                                 SANDY
                        Susan’s had so many incarnations now 
                        it’s bloody difficult to keep track. 

                                 DARYL
                        I see. I’m sure we’ll all get along 
                        like apple pie and ice cream.  
                                 SANDY
                        As long as you don’t say things like 
                        that, perhaps...
                                  (off his look; deflects)
                        There’ll be a lot bantering about 
                        industry, gossip. Could get tedious.  

           And suddenly they’re coming... around the CORNER... 

           JIM MACKENZIE, 40, tweed coat, fading pate, make him a dead  
           ringer for an aging professor. His wife SUSAN, mid-20s,  
           platinum blonde (really brunette) like one of his students. 

           Hellos all around. Daryl, trying to appear comfortable. 

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - LOUNGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A TABLE with food, drinks. Convo His Girl Friday fast. Sandy 
           comforts Daryl, with a hand on his knee. Susan observes them.  

                                JIM
                                                              SANDY
                                                  Like Thanton. A little sipper 
                                                  by noon.
           The new boss, Merwyn has 
           every bottle of Glen in his 
           bureau.

                                JIM (CONT'D)
                                                              SANDY (CONT'D)
           How bad can a bloke be if he 
           needs that?
                                                  Except I heard he’s an 
                                                  incorrigible bastard.

                                                              SUSAN
                               JIM  (CONT'D)
                                                    (to Sandy)
           Oh, his tantrums are first 
           rate spectacles.
                                                  Speaking of tantrums, I saw 
                                                  Francis over the holiday. 
                                                  Making a scene in SoHo after 
                                                  a bucketload of champers.

                              SANDY 
                                                              DARYL
                     (to Daryl)
                                                    (lying)
           Francis Bacon, the painter.
                                                  I know who he is.

                               SUSAN
                                                              SANDY (CONT'D)
           Prattling on about skin 
           creams and boot polish -- and 
           Georgie.
                                                  Oh, he still misses, Georgie. 
                                                  Poor thing. And those boot 
                                                  polishes are the only thing 
                                                  Francis dyes his hair with.

                               JIM 
                                                              SUSAN (CONT'D)
                                                    (slaps his shoulder)
           Someone here shouldn’t be 
           talking about hair dye.
                                                  Keep that mouth shut, if you 
                                                  know what’s good for ya.

           Daryl stands...

                                 DARYL
                        Gonna grab some more smokes. 
                        Anybody need anything? 
                                 SANDY
                                  (checks her purse)
                        I could use another. 

           The moment he’s gone --

                                 SUSAN
                        A bit young, innit he? My brother’s 
                        age. 

           That stings, but Sandy takes it in stride. 

                                 SANDY
                        He’s just a friend. It’s nothing 
                        serious. He’ll be on his own way soon 
                        enough.   

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Daryl in a register line. Scans the NEWSPAPER rack, their 
           FRONT PAGES for Milledgville Murder news until it’s his turn.

           INT. TAVERN - MIAMI - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sports themes and coats of arms. Daryl much more relaxed, 
           shows Susan trick shots around the felt. Impossible shots, 
           wowing people. There’s even APPLAUSE, bet money won.   

           AT THE BAR NEARBY, Sandy watches with pangs of jealousy she 
           can’t understand, Jim off her shoulder with a pint. 

                                 JIM
                        Ken’s antsy. Goin’ on about how you 
                        haven’t landed the big interviews: 
                        Agnew, Onassis, Barbara Walters.

                                 SANDY
                        It’s called a cold streak. You’d know -
                        - you’ve been on quite a few yourself.  

                                 JIM
                        I’m just relaying. 

                                 SANDY
                        And I’m just reminding. It’ll pass.

           Jim nods. Not so sure. Sandy, still watching Daryl and Susan. 

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - LATE NIGHT

           Daryl and Sandy in bed. He’s on top, moving rhythmically. 
           From Sandy’s expression, it’s not going well. 

                                 SANDY
                        If you’re not into it we can stop.
                                 DARYL
                        No, no, just give me some time and 
                        everything will be alright. 

                                 SANDY
                        Well, now I need some time. 

           And she breaks away, going for a cig on the nightstand. 
           With a reluctant sigh, he collapses on his side. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        I’m not used to this.  

                                 DARYL
                        Used to what?

                                 SANDY
                        I’m not used to it being so bloody 
                        difficult. I usually have to slow 
                        someone down. You understand how that 
                        makes me feel?  

                                 DARYL
                        Don’t feel that way. It’s not... you.  

                                 SANDY
                        Then what? There somebody else? 
                        Back in New Mexico? 

                                 DARYL
                        It’s not that --

                                 SANDY
                        Then what then? Are you gay? 
                        Swing more one way than the other? 

           Daryl... barely contained menace.

                                 DARYL
                        You shouldn’t say things like that.

                                 SANDY
                        It’s better to be honest in bed. If 
                        you can’t make it, you can’t, darling.

           TIGHT ON DARYL. Perspiring now. Fighting something. 

           HIS POV: Sandy exiting the bed to the bureau. He rises after. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        You were fine out on the highway. 
                        Maybe you need a little more 
                        excitement. Control... 

           She steps towards him... inches from his face...

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Total domination? Maybe you want to 
                        tie me up? Hurt me a little? 
           In her hands, her Dior stockings... STARTS TO TIE THEM AROUND 
           HER NECK... MAKES HIM TAKE THE REINS WITH HIS HANDS...

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                                  (gasping as he tightens)
                        You need to choke me, then do it. 
                        Choke it all out of me. Harder... I 
                        want to pass out...

           And he’s CHOKING HER TIGHTER at her urging, pulling the 
           stocking. Her hands rove below his waist. She’s giggling now, 
           but it sounds fucking strange because she’s choking too -- 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Oh now you’re ready for me. 
                        YOU’RE SO READY --

           And they FALL TO THE FLOOR, Daryl TIGHTENING THE STOCKING 
           OVER HER BACK, and presumably, mounting her from behind -- 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        MORE, BLOODY MORE --  

                                                           SLAM TO:

           DARYL ON THE FLOOR

           Masturbating in the dark... Sandy’s Dior stockings bulging 
           his neck. Finishes grinding his teeth, biting his lips. 

           Sandy on the bed nearby, sleeping. Unaware of any of this. 

           Daryl sits up, unwinding the stocking from his neck. Suddenly 
           OVERWHELMED with shame. Shivers. Sees a SHAPE move in the...

           Corner... that ONE-ARMED SHADOW CREEP along the wall.  

                                 GUTTURAL VOICE
                        ...you weak, cocksucking sissy...

           Daryl bolts for the bathroom. FLICKS the light on. 

           EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU - OUTDOOR POOL AREA - THE NEXT MORNING

           Tanned bodies in and out of this Olympic-sized pool 
           surrounded by wicker chaise lounges.

           Sandy, in a bathing suit, shades, quirky Aussie bushwhacker’s 
           hat shielding her pale skin. Reviewing notes. Looks up at --  

           Daryl rising out of the water. Shakes loose. Draws several 
           female stares along the way... not lost on Sandy.  

           Grabs a towel on the chaise next to hers, dries off.

                                 DARYL
                        What’re you reading? 
                                 SANDY
                        Notes for my interview tomorrow. 
                        Have a nice swim? 

                                 DARYL
                        Not bad. Who’s the interview again? 

                                 SANDY
                        Your Attorney General, William B. 
                        Saxbe.  

           Daryl whistles. Not bad. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Just in time really... I haven’t had a 
                        big interview in awhile. Feeling more 
                        anxious than usual. 

                                 DARYL
                        Is that why you left London?

                                 SANDY
                        Hell no, I was doing well. I needed a 
                        change of scenery. Get out of my 
                        comfort zone, if that makes sense.

                                 DARYL
                        At least it wasn’t because of a man. 

           Sandy won’t offer up anything there and we do wonder...

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        What’re you interviewing Saxbe about?

                                 SANDY
                        Focus is recidivism. Say that three 
                        times fast, get your tongue in a 
                        tither. But I haven’t the faintest how 
                        your criminal justice system works. 
                        It’s not exactly English Common Law. 

                                 DARYL
                        I know a little about it. I took a few 
                        criminal justice courses in college.  

                                 SANDY
                        That’s be wonderful but aren’t you 
                        seeing your lawyer today?  

                                 DARYL
                                  (shakes his head)
                        He’s not in the office. I called.  

                                 SANDY
                        Why’s he here and not in New Mexico?

                                 DARYL
                        He’s a family attorney. We moved to 
                        New Mexico when I was in junior high 
                        so we just kept on. He’s trustworthy. 

           Reaches for the nearby suntan lotion...
                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to burn up out here.  

           Starts applying it to her legs. She doesn’t protest.

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - LATER THAT DAY

           Daryl mounting Sandy from behind, her stockings around her 
           eyes like a blindfold... his fantasy bleeding into reality. 

           It’s heated, passionate -- an afternoon delight -- the first 
           “successful” sex they’ve had. She laughs. 

                                 SANDY
                        So you just needed props... a dash of 
                        theatricality. Why didn’t you say so?

           IN THE BATHROOM - LATER

           Sandy drying off after a shower. Daryl rushes up excitedly, 
           holding a Lilliput magazine in his hand.

                                 DARYL
                        This right here. Right here. 

           Holds them out to her. She eyes them closer.

                        My Ilie Nãstase profile. 

                                 DARYL
                        This is how I want you to write about 
                        me. 

                                 SANDY
                        He’s a world-ranked tennis player. And 
                        you’re... a secret, government, 
                        operative with a military background 
                        who helps run your father’s restaurant 
                        business? I see the similarities.   

           Saying it like that just makes him feel ridiculous. Deflated. 
           Daryl at loss... like he might breakdown.   

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Forget it. Let’s have some music. 

           Goes for a NIGHTSTAND RADIO. Fiddles stations. Finds --  

           Freda Payne’s ‘BAND OF GOLD’. She CRANKS IT. Daryl softens, 
           takes Sandy’s hand, twirls her around. She laughs. Suddenly 
           they’re both dancing out of FRAME ON TO --  

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           - A MIAMI BEACH DANCEFLOOR. Daryl and Sandy swaying to ‘BAND 
           OF GOLD’. The growing CROWD parts as they move, a 
           kaleidoscopic shimmer of light and motion --  
           -- LEAVING THE NIGHT CLUB. They thread their way through the  
           CROWDED Miami Beach STREETS passed KIDS, COUPLES, VENDORS. 

           -- ALONG RTE 1, Daryl at the wheel of the Impala, Kool in his  
           lips, Sandy next to him. Leaving Miami in the rearview.

           -- A WEST PALM BEACH HOTEL ROOM. Sandy writing notes, Daryl  
           drawing on POSTCARDS with sunny tableaus, penmanship sharp. 

           -- Daryl and Sandy watch an ALLIGATOR WRESTLING MATCH in a 
           crowded FAIR. An old Seminole Indian drags a ANGRY GATOR 
           around by the tail. Jumps on it, CLAMPS ITS JAWS closed.  

           -- A DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING. Daryl drops Sandy off. 

           -- SAXBE’S OFFICE. Sandy interviews WILLIAM B. SAXBE, the 
           U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL, a distinguished, grim-suited Ohioan we  
           suspect hasn’t smiled in decades. Doesn’t smile now either.

           -- THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER SATELLITE OFFICE. Sandy arrives in 
           bushwhacker’s hat, greeting STAFF, Jim at a CORNER DESK. 

           From a NEARBY OFFICE, KEN MCCARTEN, the FEATURES EDITOR, 50s, 
           eyes Sandy with barely concealed contempt.

           -- A BAR PATIO. Daryl walks on stage, takes a banjo from a  
           DEPARTING PERFORMER. Nods, while Sandy claps wildly nearby. 

                                 DARYL
                                  (sings in mic)
                        I know an old lady who swallowed a 
                        bird... How absurd to swallow a 
                        bird... She swallowed the bird to 
                        catch the spider that wriggled and 
                        jiggled and tickled inside her... She 
                        swallowed the spider to catch the fly, 
                        but I don’t know why she swallowed the 
                        fly... Perhaps she’ll die... 

           LATER --

           Daryl and Sandy along a back wall, tipsy. SOMEONE SINGS Lynn  
           Anderson’s ‘HOW CAN I UNLOVE YOU?’ 

                                 DARYL
                        I wanna apologize.  

                                 SANDY
                        For what? 

                                 DARYL
                        The other night. Making you feel 
                        unwanted. 

                                 SANDY
                        We’ve done better since, haven’t we?  

                                 DARYL
                        Thing is, I’ve been having the best 
                        time of my life these last few days.

                        Maybe because I’m finally with someone 
                        who accepts me for who I am... for 
                        what I am. For once, I feel... normal. 

           INT. THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER OFFICE - WEST PALM BEACH - DAY

           Sandy at a DESK working on her Saxbe piece. McCarten hovers.

                                 MCCARTEN
                        Surprised you’re even here, Sandy.  

                                 SANDY
                        A good journalist doesn’t spend all 
                        their time kooked up in an office, 
                        Ken.  

                                 MCCARTEN
                        This isn’t London, Sandy. We do things 
                        differently here.  

                                 SANDY
                        I know. I’m following the rules. 

                                 MCCARTEN
                        We have rules about results too. To 
                        say we’ve been underwhelmed would be 
                        an understatement. 

                                 SANDY
                        But I’ve only just started --  

           She takes in the OFFICE AUDIENCE, including Jim nearby,  
           looking like a pained wolfhound. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps we should move this discussion 
                        to your office. 

                                 MCCARTEN
                        I’m not finished.

                        Your Telegraph and Daily Express

                        celebrity interviews and you haven’t 
                        landed a single high profile piece. 
                        Upstairs set Saxbe up.  

                                 SANDY
                        It’s called a cold streak.  

                                 MCCARTEN
                        We don’t do cold streaks in the 
                        States. We do results.  

                                 SANDY
                        I have other stories to file, I have --

                        Once you’re finished with the Saxbe 
                        piece, you’ll need to pack it up.

           EXT. WEST PALM BEACH STEAKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Daryl and Sandy in a booth. Daryl recognizing her shitty mood  
           but not quite sure what to do. 

                                 SANDY
                        Tell me more about these mysterious 
                        tapes.  

           He wants to. Instead he shakes his head. 

                                 DARYL
                        You know I can’t. 

                                 SANDY
                                  (testy)
                        Well fuck, tell me something, Daryl!  
                                  (no response)
                        Are you sure this all isn’t just a 
                        morbid obsession? Have you seen a 
                        psychiatrist? 

                                 DARYL
                        I saw one once. He told me I had the 
                        perfect criminal mind.  

                                 SANDY
                        That’s nothing to boast about. 
                                  (then)
                        You aren’t going to tell me anything 
                        are you? 

                                 DARYL
                        And you’re not just fucking me for a 
                        story are you? 

           Sandy bursts out laughing. Flippant. Steely. 

                                 SANDY
                        Actually, you’ve got it backwards. The  
                        only one getting royally fucked around  
                        here is me. But you can only get  
                        fucked so long barely getting off  
                        before it all just becomes another  
                        trip to the dry cleaners, yeah?  

           Stare at each other. Brooding anger. 

                                 DARYL
                        I’ll tell you something not on those 
                        tapes, something you’ll understand. 

                                 SANDY
                        Now we’re bloody getting somewhere. 

                                 DARYL
                        Before we moved to New Mexico I got 
                        into trouble once. I stole this 
                        bicycle, so they sent me to this 
                        reform school up in Marianna for 
                        a’year, Florida School For Boys.

                        It was worse than your orphanage... 
                        there was this one-armed supervisor 
                        who worked there, a man named 
                        Caldwell... he used to take us to this 
                        utility shed to discipline us. And 
                        he’d... do unspeakable things. There 
                        was this ceiling fan he’d turn on to 
                        drown out the screams but you could 
                        still hear ‘em. There was blood 
                        everywhere and pieces of tongue stuck 
                        to the mattress where he’d make you 
                        lay down. The boys that didn’t 
                        survive, he’d make me bury in graves 
                        off in the woods at night. Lotsa 
                        colored boys, they got it bad. Dead 
                        bodies didn’t bother me like the 
                        others, so I was useful to him. 
                        Got me outta there in one piece.

           Sandy, horrified... takes his arm.  

                                 DARYL (CONT'D)
                        I never told anyone that... 
                        But now I’ve told you something. 

           INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - WEST PALM BEACH - NIGHT

           Sandy’s restless. Can hear Daryl’s shallow breaths getting  
           sharper, more frantic. Peers over at Daryl in the low light. 

           He’s TREMBLING... pained... fighting for survival somewhere.  

           Her instinct: to comfort. But an incendiary thought takes  
           hold. Rises. Leaves with something from Daryl’s nightstand.  

           THE PARKING LOT - THE IMPALA

           SANDY’S POV: digging through the GLOVEBOX. Finds the  
           REGISTRATION. WILLIAM BATES. Huh. A hunting LICENSE.  
           Different envelopes, addresses, slips, maps, etc...

           IN THE TRUNK, Sandy rummages. Luggage, fishing equipment,  
           hunting gear. Gets distracted by bag with the -- 

           PANASONIC CASSETTE RECORDER. MIC wrapped neatly around it. 

           CLICKS EJECT. A CASSETTE INSIDE. Presses it back, HITS PLAY. 

                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE (OVER RECORDER)
                        ... Break from the flock, it’s  
                        inevitable you will draw others in the  
                        their own state of transition, seeking  
                        similar answers. Seekers, fellow 
                        travelers. Just. Like. Her. 

           Hits STOP. Suddenly shivering, self-conscious. Hits REWIND to  
           track back to the spot he left it. CLOSES THE TRUNK and -- 

           Daryl is there. Off her shoulder. Alert. Sandy YELPS --
                                 SANDY
                        Bloody Christ, you scared me.  

                                 DARYL
                        What’re you doing? 

                                 SANDY
                        I couldn’t sleep. Thought I’d work a  
                        little, get my thoughts in order. 
                        I didn’t want to disturb you.  

           She holds up the NOTEBOOK in her left hand. He studies her.  
           Walks slowly towards her... 

                                 DARYL
                        You’re upset with me, I can tell.  

                                 SANDY
                        It’s fine, darling. Let’s head in. 
                        It’s like a Greenland tundra out here.  

           She drops the keys in his hand, walks past. He doesn’t follow  
           right away... feels something... his nose... bleeding.  
           Horrified, he wipes it away hurriedly, heads after her. 

           EXT. WEST PALM BEACH CAFE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Crowded, but it’s silent between them. Holiday intimacy gone. 

                                 SANDY
                        I’m heading back to London Saturday. I 
                        have a lot of work to do before I go, 
                        people to see. Unfortunately that 
                        means there’s no more time for us.  

                                 DARYL
                        I understand.

                        But it’s been a marvelous week. 
                        Like a holiday.  
                                  (lying her ass off)
                        Maybe you’ll come to London one day.  
                        I’ll have a chance to look after you  
                        the way you looked after me.

                        Couldn’t we spend one more night  
                        together? 

                                 SANDY
                        No, darling. No. Then you would stay  
                        over and there’d be another and  
                        another, and I would have to leave you  
                        at the airport and I would hate that.  
           INT. IMPALA - MOVING - WEST PALM BEACH - LATER

           Daryl driving, deep in thought. Sandy staring out at the 
           Florida landscape that’s become somewhat familiar. Palm 
           trees, sandstone beaches, wide highways...

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - CAR PARK AREA - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Daryl loads the Impala with his stuff. Sandy, suddenly 
           overcome with an urge to get away that’s almost unbearable. 

           Now he’s before her in the drowning dusk, eyes desperate. 

                                 SANDY
                        You know, you are quite young, Daryl. 
                        You can still get married, have 
                        children. Have the life deep down I 
                        know you want.  

                                 DARYL
                        I can’t. You know I can’t. 

                                 SANDY
                        The bloody tapes, right?  

                                 DARYL
                                  (considers something)
                        I -- 

                                 SANDY
                        No, no. Ssssh. Like I said, I hate 
                        good-byes. Go now, drive carefully, 
                        and please, don’t let me have to write 
                        that book for a long, long time.  

           She kisses him firmly on the mouth... lingering, bittersweet,  
           careful not to touch him anywhere else. Breaks away... into 
           the HILTON, no turning back. Daryl fades from view...

           STAY WITH HER she BREAKS INTO A RUN, rounding the nearest  
           CORRIDOR, towards a DINGING ELEVATOR --

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - SANDY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sandy LOCKS the DOOR. Goes to the WINDOW. Lifts a blind --

           THE PARK AREA BELOW. He’s gone.

           INT. WHITE CHAPEL PUB - WEST PALM BEACH - THAT NIGHT

           Sandy, deep into several Bell’s whisky with Jim, Susan and 
           some of their FRIENDS. It’s loud, festive, but Sandy doesn’t 
           appear into it. You can tell she’s going to beg off early. 
           INT. HOLIDAY INN - SANDY’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sandy in bed. Can’t sleep. The PHONE RINGS. A shrill, 
           startling sound at this hour -- 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        Sandy, it’s Jim. Daryl’s here. 

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. WHITE CHAPEL PUB - WEST PALM BEACH - NIGHT

           Jim, on the pub’s phone. OVER HIS SHOULDER, Daryl, with Susan 
           and their friends. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Wait, how? 

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        I dunno. Someone at the Hilton told 
                        him. Anyway, he’s askin’ for you. You 
                        wanna come down? Cheer ‘im up?

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Of course not. I can’t give be giving 
                        him the wrong impression.

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        He’s a nice enough bloke. Fulla 
                        stories from traveling the country. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Best chums now, yeah? He tell you the 
                        one about the audio tapes?

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        What tapes?

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Nothing... Jim, I’m so sorry. I feel 
                        like I dumped him on you and Susan. 

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        Susan’s like a restless teen, needs 
                        company her age. Long as she doesn’t 
                        try and screw ‘im it’s alright by me. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                                  (veiled jealousy)
                        You needn’t worry. He’s a gentleman. 

                                 JIM (OVER PHONE)
                        We might head over to my place later 
                        if you’re interested. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m knackered. But have fun, really. 
           She hangs up. Alone. Back to fighting her own thoughts.

           Jim hangs up. Sees Daryl waving him over. That easy grin...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY - WEST PALM BEACH - THE NEXT DAY

           As Sandy heads out, a HOTEL CLERK waves her over -- 

                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Ms. Fawkes, I have a message for you. 

                                 SANDY
                        From?

                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        The West Palm Beach Police Department. 

           INT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - DAY

           A UNIFORMED DESK OFFICER leads Sandy into --

           INT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - GABBARD'S OFFICE - DAY

           SERGEANT TED GABBARD looks up from a cluttered desk as 
           Sandy’s led across the threshold. Blunt, stockish, balding, a 
           dull tan suit. 40s. Doesn’t like thinking too hard. 

                                 GABBARD
                        Come on in. Siddown, Ms. Fawkes. 

                                 SANDY
                        What’s this all about?

           Tentative, she takes one of the chairs across his desk.

                                 GABBARD
                        Tell me, what is your relationship 
                        with this --
                                  (reads from a file)
                        -- Daryl Golden?

                                 SANDY
                        He’s a friend. I met him a week ago 
                        and he drove us here from Atlanta. I'm 
                        a journalist based in London here on 
                        assignment. Why, has something 
                        happened to him?

                                 GABBARD
                        And what about Susan MacKenzie?

                                 SANDY
                        Yes, of course. She’s Jim MacKenzie's 
                        wife, one of my colleagues out here.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        I have to say, I'm finding all this 
                        suspense a bit much. Something happen? 

                                 GABBARD
                        Miss Fawkes. I think you need to tell 
                        us everything you know about this man. 

           INT. IMPALA - MOVING - EARLIER THAT DAY

           Knowles driving, Susan next to him. She's a stream of 
           busybody consciousness: smokes, applies lipstick, curls her 
           eyelashes in a compact --

                                 SUSAN
                        You can’t take it personally, dearie. 
                        Sandy Fawkes has quite the reputation. 
                        You hear all sorts'a things about her 
                        and the other little Soho 
                        spinsterettes that'll leave you 
                        positively gobsmacked. 

                                 DARYL
                        That right... ?

                                 SUSAN
                        They have this informal sorta thing, 
                        this Michelin guide for men, rating 
                        ‘em by sexual prowess. I mean, can you 
                        believe it? Any two-legged geezer in a 
                        double-breasted Hayward is fair game 
                        for their duvets apparently. Gossip-
                        mongering clucks, the whole lot.
                                  (off his look)
                        Sounds harsh but it’s reality. 
                        Sandy likes 'em, er, like you.

                                 DARYL
                        What do you mean?

                                 SUSAN
                        Young. It's what Sandy's known for. 
                        They think she's the greatest thing on 
                        Piccadilly. The next day she dumps 
                        them and its oyster brunch and 
                        Sancerre toasts at Wheeler's and it 
                        starts all over again. 

           Daryl takes this in... stirs something terrible within. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        What I'm saying is... don't feel the 
                        need to mope. She's not worth it.

           He pulls over to the shoulder of the EXPRESS WAY. Puts the 
           Impala in park, engine running. CARS zoom by OUTSIDE --

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                                  (concerned)
                        Why're we stopped...? 

           Daryl... a deep breath. Looks as if he might break down...
                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                                  (comforts him)
                        Was it something I said?  
                                  (hand on his shoulder)
                        It'll be alright. Trust me. She's not 
                        worth it. Not worth one bloody tear.  

           And her hand on his cheek now... tasseling his hair. Tender. 

                                 DARYL
                        Get out.

                                 SUSAN
                        What...?

                                 DARYL
                        You heard me. GET. OUT. 

           THWOCK! UNLOCKS the automatic doors. Susan's dumbfounded. 

                                 SUSAN
                        I can't just get out here. 'S the 
                        matter with you? It's dangerous. 

                                 DARYL
                        I won't ask again.

                                 SUSAN
                                  (folds her arms)
                        No, no -- I'm not going anywhere. Take 
                        me back to the Hotel.
                                  (off his look)
                        I won't hear another word. To think, 
                        me trying to help you, you silly 
                        bastard and this is how you treat me? 

           His EYES in the rearview mirror... Looking about. 

                                 DARYL
                        Fine.

           THWOCK! LOCKS the doors. A deafening sound. 

           AND HE GRABS HER BY THE HAIR -- SLAMS HER HEAD INTO THE DASH -
           - AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN -- SHE SCREAMS -- FRESH BLOOD 
           STREAMS FROM HER NOSE, HER SPLIT LIP -- 

           OUTSIDE, we see the struggle inside the Impala on the 
           Expressway, cars whizzing passed obliviously -- 

           IN THE IMPALA, Susan RESISTS -- STRUGGLES mightily to escape 
           as he grapples her -- overpowering her adrenaline with brute 
           strength -- yanks her head close, submissive --  

                                 KNOWLES
                        FINALLY SHUT UP NOW? MOUTH FULLA 
                        BLOOD YOU SHUT RIGHT THE FUCK UP! 

           And SHE SPITS THE BLOOD IN HIS FACE -- HE RECOILS -- SHE 
           CLAWS AT HIS FACE WITH NAILS -- SHOVES HIM OFF -- does the 
           impossible -- across his lap to pry open his door -- 
           And GOES SCREAMING INTO DAYLIGHT ON THE EXPRESS WAY --

                                                           BACK TO:

           Sandy dumbfounded. Gabbard hand her the FILE. She opens it...

           HER POV: TWO DARYL PHOTOS. One full, one profile. Youthful 
           intensity. Beneath each, a six figure number and a name --

                                 GABBARD
                        PAUL JOHN KNOWLES. Jumped his parole 
                        in Jacksonville earlier this year. 

           His eyes search hers. They say it all. It’s him. 

                                 SANDY
                        He hasn’t got the mustache now. 
                                  (off his look)
                        His mustache. I made him shave it off. 

                                 GABBARD
                                  (scribbles a note)
                        That's a good detail to have.

                                 SANDY
                        So what happens now?

                                 GABBARD
                        We have the number of his car, an 
                        alert out. If you think of anything 
                        else, please contact me.

           Hands her a CARD. A beat as she mulls something...

                        ‘Course, there is the business of the 
                        tapes. Maybe he was right after all. 

                                 GABBARD
                                  (stops writing)
                        What tapes? 

           FLASH ON: Knowles driving in the Impala at the beginning, 
           speaking into the TAPE RECORDER below the dash. 

                                 GABBARD (CONT'D)
                        You said he sent them to his attorney?

                                 SANDY
                        That's what he said. Based in Miami. 

                                 GABBARD
                                  (checks his notes)
                        Sheldon Yavitz? Name sound familiar? 

                                 SANDY
                        No... Wait -- yes. I recall seeing 
                        something -- a post card --
           FLASH ON: Knowles in the Atlanta Hotel filling out a POST 
           CARD atop an ENVELOPE with Yavitz's name --

                                 GABBARD
                        Did he indicate what’s on these tapes?

                                 SANDY
                        Not exactly. Not for lack of trying on 
                        my part, mind you. I heard part of 
                        one. Sounded like a’bit of musing to 
                        me. But he thinks whatever’s on them 
                        will make him famous.

                                 GABBARD
                        Famous, huh? 

                                 SANDY
                        And get him killed. I thought at the 
                        time maybe he was just being 
                        fatalistic but... maybe he was just 
                        telling me the truth.  

           Long beat. Gabbard scribbles furiously.

                                 GABBARD
                        May just be hogwash, but we’ll try and 
                        get ahold of this lawyer in Miami. 
                        Knowles doesn't have a record for 
                        violence, far as I can tell. 

                                 SANDY
                        Is Susan going to be alright...?

                                 GABBARD
                        Far as I could tell. Was a bit 
                        hysterical... 
                                  (shrugs)
                        She mighta provoked Knowles, came on 
                        to him and he rejected her -- who 
                        knows? You don't know what to expect 
                        from the young ladies these days. 

           OUTER OFFICE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           A disturbed Sandy steps out, comes face-to-face with --

           JIM AND SUSAN. Coming from a SIDE ROOM with a SKETCH ARTIST. 

           Susan’s face is blotched and bandaged, her eyes purple and 
           blue like cauliflower. 

           A stare between the trio... veiled shame and animosity from 
           the couple... you brought this on us. Jim steers Susan away. 

           INT. SHELDON YAVITZ’S HOME - CORAL GABLES - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Dinner in progress. SHELDON YAVITZ, 50s, sits at the helm of 
           the table. There’s wine, chatter. Hard to tell if he actually 
           enjoys this or if this whole affair was his wife’s idea. 
           Several GUESTS. The PHONE RINGING OFF. Nearby, his wife, 
           PATSY, late 20s, looks up. Patsy is what happens when a 
           flower power wild child becomes a suburbanite mother.  

                  CORAL GABLES, FLORIDA, OCTOBER 24TH, 1974

                                 PATSY
                                  (not pleased)
                        We’re eating, Shell’. 

           And Yavitz slides his chair back, excusing himself --

                                                             YAVITZ
                               PATSY (CONT'D)
           Tell ‘em to call back --
                                                    (over his shoulder)
                                                  I will, I will --

           INT. SHELDON YAVITZ’S HOME OFFICE - FLASHBACK - SAME

           Cluttered with FILES, office supplies, GIFTS from clients, 
           including several craft-style tchotchkes made by prisoners. 
           Yavitz grabs one of two red phones on the desk.

                                 YAVITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 KNOWLES (OVER PHONE)
                        Hey Shelley, this is PJ Knowles... 

           He’s flipping through a nearby ROLODEX with details -- 

                                                       YAVITZ (INTO PHONE)
                       KNOWLES (OVER PHONE) (CONT'D)
                                                  Yes, yes, I remember...
           You helped arrange my release 
           from Raiford. Angela Covic 
           hired you.

                                 KNOWLES (OVER PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        I'm in town and need a minute. 
                        I could be in some trouble. 

                                 YAVITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        Can it wait? I’ve got guests.

                                 KNOWLES (OVER PHONE)
                        I can come there, if it helps. 

                                 YAVITZ (INTO PHONE)
                        No, no. And we can’t talk on the phone 
                        about it... 
                                  (debates)
                        Tell you what. There’s a bar across 
                        from Miami U -- the Inn. I can --
                                  (checks a clock)
                        -- get there at 9pm. How’s that sound?

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI STREET CORNER - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Yavitz arrives in a sleek, Cobra roadster, two door. A “gift” 
           from a client. Crosses past the Impala out front. 
           INT. UNIVERSITY INN LOUNGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           A cozy tavern. Mostly young couples, stray drinkers. Carly 
           Simon over the speakers. Yavitz is early, surprised to hear --

                                 KNOWLES (O.S.)
                        Over here.

           Knowles already nursing a half-gone Planter’s Punch at a two-
           top by the door. Yavitz takes in the noise, patrons... 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Why don’t we sit outside? There’s a 
                        nice patio out there.
                                  (to a nearby Bartender)
                        Lone Star longneck -- 

           PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Yavitz and Knowles near the back, out of earshot. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Thanks again for coming out like this. 
                        Interrupting your dinner n’all.

                                 YAVITZ
                        Don’t worry about that... 
                                  (totally sincere)
                        Was glad to get outta there, tell ya 
                        the truth...

                                 KNOWLES
                        Read a profile on you not long ago. 
                        Sun-Sentinel. You really defend all 
                        those drug smugglers?

                                 YAVITZ
                        I like professional criminals. I’m not 
                        judgmental. I’m too anti-social to 
                        have regular clients. Is what it is. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        It’s a good business.

                                 YAVITZ
                        I do OK...
                                  (impatient)
                        Why aren’t you with Angela in San 
                        Fran? Something happen?

                                 KNOWLES
                        A lot actually. Brace yourself, I’ve 
                        got something to tell you. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        I’m listening.

                                 KNOWLES
                        I'm a mass murderer. 

           Yavitz considers. Long beat.
                                 YAVITZ
                        That’s interesting.  

                                 KNOWLES
                        It's a bit much to digest.

                                 YAVITZ
                        Look, ethically, legally, I'm bound to 
                        protect my clients or I can get 
                        disbarred. Morality doesn't factor in. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        I thought so. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        What happened with Angela? 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Angela and I didn’t last four days. 
                        She went back to her husband -- so she 
                        says. She didn’t even let me stay with 
                        her. I was at her mother’s house...
                                  (lights a Kool)
                        So I went back to Jacksonville. You 
                        know how that goes. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        I’m not sure what you mean.

                                 KNOWLES
                        Means fellas like me tend to get into 
                        trouble. We’re repeat business. And 
                        money has a way of runnin’ out... 

           EXT. SIDE STREET - JACKSONVILLE, FL - FLASHBACK - DAY

           Knowles strolls along a sidewalk looking over PARKED CARS. 

                           JACKSONVILLE MAY, 1974 

           More habit than curiosity. Chevy pickups. Chrysler LeBarons 
           and -- a VW VAN. Window lowered just enough to reach a...

           ... LEATHER HANDBAG. Passenger side. And since Knowles stole 
           his first bicycle at 7, he’s rarely passed on an easy score. 

                                 KNOWLES (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m worth more’n that. A lot more...  

           INT. PAWN SHOP - JACKSONVILLE BEACH, FL - FLASHBACK - DAY

           A frustrated Knowles across a portly PAWN SHOP CLERK with 
           loupe and scale, handbag jewelry spread atop a DISPLAY CASE. 

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                                  (re: scale)
                        When’s the last time you had this 
                        calibrated? A Troy ounce is 31 grams. 
                                 PAWN SHOP CLERK
                        You think I don’t know my business, 
                        fella? I know my business.

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           POOR NEIGHBORHOODS around Jacksonville. Lots of old TRUCKS, 
           junk, KIDS on faded lawns JUMPING on abandoned furniture. 
           Knowles meets a series of RELATIVES/FRIENDS:  

                      AUNT IN A PINK BATHROBE
                   Sorry, PJ, I can’t help you.
                                                   REDNECK FRIEND IN DIXIE TEE
                                                  When you get outta, Raiford, 
                                                  hoss? 
                                                    (eyes darting)
                                                  Jax PD’s got a warrant out 
                                                  for me.

                      UNCLE IN PAINT COVERALLS
           That check come, see if 
           somethin’s left. But I gotta 
           fix the mower.
                                                     AUNT SWEEPING HER PORCH
                                                  I don’t even know where my 
                                                  jackass husband is. You see 
                                                  ‘im out there, you give ‘im a 
                                                  good ass kickin’, will ya?

           SOMETIME LATER, Knowles, ambling along, looking defeated 
           through a neighborhood... notices a corner GREEN HOUSE... 

           Sees ALICE CURTIS, 65, retired school teacher outdoors, 
           watering her garden. Takes notice, keeps walking...

           INT. SPORTS BAR - JACKSONVILLE BEACH, FL - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Somebody’s favorite hole in the wall. Darts, pool tables, 
           TVs, fake ficus. Knowles in the far corner, drinking alone. 

           Eyes a COCKTAIL WAITRESS. Probably a part-time student. 
           Wholesome, effortless beauty. And since Knowles is easy on 
           the eyes, she returns his smile. He WAVES her over. 

           The BARTENDER, ex-linebacker, polishing a glass, watches...

                                 KNOWLES
                        The bartender your boyfriend? 

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        He’s the owner, actually.
                                  (shoots a glance back)
                        Why ya askin’? 

                                 KNOWLES
                        How you interact with each other. How 
                        he looks at you. How you look back. 

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        We don’t talk titles, darlin’, but I 
                        go home with him most nights if that’s 
                        what you’re wonderin’. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Most nights... but not every night? 
           She smiles. Sweet. Flirty. Not far off, the Bartender is very 
           much listening. Takes off his apron, cracks his knuckles. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The Bartender has Knowles in a headlock. They’re almost at 
           the exit when Knowles shoves off the door with his legs -- 
           MOMENTUM -- they FALL BACK -— careen against a POOL TABLE. 

           Knowles recovers, grabs a pool cue off a nearby table -- 
           ducks the Bartender’s haymakers -- THWACKS the cue against 
           Bobby’s ribs --- THWACK, THWACK -- like a snare drum -- 

           The Cocktail Waitress can’t pry Knowles off, PEOPLE SHOUTING, 
           the chaos feeds Knowles, he becomes POSSESSED -- 

           The Bartender lunges with a KNIFE from his boot -- CRACK! 
           Knowles SHATTERS HIS HAND WITH THE CUE -- 

           The blade CLATTERS to the floor. 

           Knowles scoops the BLADE, RAMS IT IN THE BARTENDER’S THIGH -- 
           he HOWLS -- AGAIN AND AGAIN -- DULL THUNKS -- like raw meat -- 

           Knowles grins at the horrified “audience”, blood dripping off 
           the blade. Then, as if realizing his predicament, BOLTS -- 

           EXT. SPORTS BAR - JACKSONVILLE BEACH, FL - FLASHBACK - SAME

           Knowles FLINGS the BLOODY BLADE atop the roof. 
           Rounds a CORNER, then another, then -- 
           A POLICE PATROL CAR behind him. Accelerates, SIRENS ON --

           Cuts him off by the DUMPSTERS. Knowles scrambles up the WALL  
           -- SLIPS! -- shit -- into the waiting arms of -- 

           TWO COPS below. Wrangle him. Deliver a RIGHTEOUS BEATING -- 

                                 COP 1 (PRE-LAP)
                        Fella don’t put up a fight like that --

           INT. JACKSONVILLE BEACH POLICE STATION - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Quiet but for Knowles, cuffed in a chair opposite a mammoth 
           HAITIAN, 20s, still bleeding from his wounds, also cuffed.  

           NEARBY, the TWO COPS that brought Knowles in, a DESK SGT. and 
           a BIG COP that arrested the Haitian. 

                                 COP 1
                        ‘less he’s pretty damn sure when he 
                        gets boxed they’re gonna lose the key.  

                                 COP 2
                                  (to Big Cop re: both)
                        Bet our collar put up more of a fight 
                        than Banana lips over here. 
                                 BIG COP
                        Had to teach ‘im a lesson or two. 
                        He don’t speak much English anyhow. 

                                 COP 1
                        These Haitian niggerachis are 
                        spreading up from Miami like a goddamn 
                        termite infestation. We can’t throw 
                        ‘em back in the ocean fast enough.

           Laughter. Agreement. The Desk Sergeant ruffles his notes.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                                  (to Knowles)
                        Who’s your parole officer, again? 

           Knowles looks at him. Fuck you. Turns away, his stare meeting 
           the Haitian’s. Cops’ conversation FADES OFF... 

           Knowles. The Haitian. Some silent communication between them.

           TIME SLOWS... Knowles’s HAND parts... a crumpled piece of 
           paper in his palm and a PAPER CLIP which Knowles has 
           discreetly retwisted for the lock of the cuffs...

           The Haitian’s eyes SHARPEN, DILATE. Might be on something. 
           What he does next defies explanation -- 

           EXPLODES at the BIG COP, wielding the CHAIR LIKE A BAT -- 
           WAILS THE FUCK OUT OF HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN! Attacks the rest --

           A FRENZY. BLOOD SPRAYS THE WALLS, TYPEWRITER KEYS, COFFEE 
           FLIES AS THE COPS PILE ON THE HAITIAN like he’s gunning for 
           the End zone at the Orange Bowl --

           Knowles works quickly on the lock -- 

           The Haitian now chokes Cop 1 while BASHING HIS FACE INTO A 
           DESK -- BLOOD, TEETH, SPIT splattering like loose change --

           The Haitian lets out a primal SCREAM, a VICTORY CRY --

           BLAM! Cop 2 BLOWS the Haitian’s brains all over the ceiling 
           from the floor. Swivels, aims for Knowles --  

           Only Knowles is long gone.

           EXT. ALICE CURTIS’S HOME - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           The Green House, lone porch light. Breaking quietly from the 
           shadows is Knowles... sweaty... like he ran all the way here. 

           Eyes the DODGE DART in the DRIVEWAY, the silence of the 
           street. Circles around the BACK OF THE HOUSE...
           INT. ALICE CURTIS’S HOME - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           A house more for memories than people. Old PHOTOS, a piano. 
           TV. Alice Curtis, the old woman from earlier, dozes on a sofa 
           recliner, magazine in her lap, CATS lounging about her feet.

           AT THE BACK SLIDING SCREEN DOOR, Knowles CREEPS stealthily. 
           Removes his shoes, socks. Puts his shoes back on WITH THE 
           SOCKS OVER THE SOLES, soundproofing. 

           Inches open the SCREEN...

           Alice Curtis stirs slightly. Doesn’t feel Knowles edging over 
           her... wearing HER GARDEN GLOVES, just patient... 

           HER EYES OPEN, suddenly aware -- he CLAMPS HIS HAND OVER HER 
           MOUTH. She can’t even cry out, eyes darting wildly --

                                 KNOWLES
                        STOP MOVING.

           Alice resists -- he CLAMPS harder, TIGHTENS his grip. 
           She’s spirited but powerless under his strength. 

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Do what I say and this will be over 
                        soon, understand? Blink your eyes if 
                        you understand. 

           She blinks. Cats whirl around alarmed. One’s on the piano. 

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Anyone else here? Blink -- once for 
                        yes, two for no. 

           She blinks her eyes TWICE.

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        This will be over soon.  

           Gags her with a dish cloth, drags her from the recliner to a 
           chair at a nearby table. Forces her down. Unspools SWATHS of 
           electrical tape, tears them with teeth, binding her firmly.

           RAISES THE VOLUME ON THE TV. CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE TV 
           until the IMAGES AND SOUND OF THE PROGRAM FILL THE SCREEN...

           INT. UNIVERSITY INN LOUNGE - PATIO -  FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Knowles and Yavitz as before. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Whoa, hold on, lemme stop you there. 
                        This is a crime you’re describing -- I 
                        need you to speak in generalities. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        OK. I’ve got the specifics on audio 
                        tapes.
                                 YAVITZ
                                  (incredulous)
                        You recorded these things?!!

                                 KNOWLES
                        No, no, not during. After... later. 
                                  (shakes his head)
                        Now, I was just getting to the good 
                        part... 

           Yavitz -- both riveted and repulsed -- 

           INT. ALICE CURTIS’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Knowles has RANSACKED the house, now searches several BAGS -- 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Christ, lady, you got a lotta purses -- 

           She’s in the corner, totally rattled, her cats zipping around 
           her feet in a frenzy. Knowles holds up TWO SETS OF KEYS.

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Which ones are the keys to the Dodge? 

           She blinks to indicate. He heads out the FRONT DOOR. 

           The second he’s gone, she struggles. Gets a HAND FREE --

           INT. DODGE DART - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

           Knowles turns the ENGINE. VROOMS to life. Lets it run. 
           Satisfied, turns it off. Looks towards the house... 

           INT. ALICE CURTIS’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           She’s managed to WRIGGLE herself free enough to stand -- only 
           it’s too much too fast -- PITCHES FORWARD -- FALLS FACE-FIRST 
           AGAINST A GLASS COFFEE TABLE -- SMASH!!!

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (storming in)
                        Fuck, I told you not to move, lady. 
                        Now look what you’ve done. 

           He lifts her head off the bed of glass... large SLIVERS in 
           her THROAT, blood oozing over his gloves... 

           He lifts a nearby SHARD, holds it to her nose... no breath 
           streaks... No signs of life. Lets her head drop. 

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Now look what you’ve done... 

           As Knowles crouches over her dead body, the CEILING LIGHT 
           ABOVE HIS HEAD forms a Christ-like halo...

           As he rises, his FACE DARKENS, and THE HALO BLINDS US...
                                 KNOWLES (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                        At that moment, I KNEW. 

           INT. UNIVERSITY INN LOUNGE - PATIO - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Knowles and Yavitz as before. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Knew what? 

                                 KNOWLES
                        That it was time to become something 
                        great. No going back. I was a killer 
                        now. Killing was my destiny. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        You probably don’t want me to ask, but 
                        you wanna give yourself up? I can take 
                        you to the station to surrender. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        I’m not surrendering, Shelley. My 
                        work's not done.

                              YAVITZ
           But each additional crime --
                                                  Success --

                                 YAVITZ (CONT'D)
                        Sorry -- success -- is making it 
                        worse. The police aren't stupid, 
                        they're gonna figure out whatever 
                        you’ve done. One way or the other.  

                                 KNOWLES
                        But these are perfect crimes. No 
                        prints. No traces. I changed up how I 
                        do ‘em, different methods, keep ‘em on 
                        their toes. And no witnesses. The only 
                        good witness is a dead witness. 

           Yavitz suddenly aware his own well-being may be in jeopardy.

                                 YAVITZ
                        Look, uh, if you don't wanna give  
                        yourself up, that's one thing. But if 
                        you're caught, you don't want a 
                        situation where only the two of us 
                        know. I choose not to be in your “good 
                        witness” category.

                                 KNOWLES
                        You needn’t worry. You’re on my side. 

                                 YAVITZ
                                  (calculates)
                        On these tapes you mentioned... you 
                        talk only about the “successes” right?
                                 KNOWLES
                        And my thoughts. Feelings. Just in 
                        case there are any dark Buddhas out 
                        there, distant disciples. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Send them to me. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        To you? 

                                 YAVITZ
                        I won’t listen to them. They’ll go in 
                        my safe. Be protected under attorney-
                        client privilege. They won't be opened 
                        until after -- or in the unfortunate 
                        event -- of your demise. We'll make 
                        sure your will is finalized and 
                        notarized, all in order. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        I have some in the car.

                                 YAVITZ
                        No, no, send them via the mail. 
                        So there's an official trail. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        But if I'm gone, there's no reason the 
                        public shouldn't know about these.  

                                 YAVITZ
                        And they will. Trust me.

                        For your boy, Shelley. I remember he 
                        was playin’ with one in court.  

           Touched in spite of himself. Wonders if it’s stolen. Likely. 
           His car was a gift from a coke smuggler, so he won’t judge.

                                 YAVITZ
                        Thanks... he’ll appreciate it.

                        Whatever you think a’me, just 
                        remember: I came from nothing. My Old 
                        Man was nothing but a carpenter, the

           in his hand... trying to reconcile the two. END FLASHBACK.
           EXT. SR 80/ SOUTHERN BLVD. BRIDGE - PALM BEACH - DAY

           The IMPALA ZOOMS over a flat-comb, cantilever BRIDGE past -- 

           A PALM BEACH POLICE CRUISER headed the opposite way. 
           PATROL OFFICER, mirror shades, grabs his CB radio, U-turns -- 

           E./I. IMPALA - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Knowles. Charged. Radio blaring Cubano music of all things. 

           Gradually notices the SIRENS closing in on his REARVIEW. 

           Deep breath. Moment of truth. No running. No escape. 

           They've both cleared the bridge. Knowles pulls over...

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - MONROE AND OLIVE - CONTINUOUS 

           SLAM! The Patrol Officer exiting. Annoyed. Peers into the 
           Impala. Only the back of the Driver’s head. No movement.

           AT THE DRIVER'S SIDE now, engine on, window powering down.

                                 PATROL OFFICER
                        Sir, can you turn off the engine and 
                        step out of the vehicle for me? 

           Knowles doesn't move. Won’t even look up.

                                 PATROL OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        SIR, TURN OFF THE ENGINE AND STEP OUT 
                        OF THE VEHICLE -- 

           BOOM! The Patrol Officer ducks KNOWLES’S GAUGE just in time!

           KA-CHIK -- Knowles racks again -- the Patrol Officer BOLTS --  

           BOOM! The second blast takes out the a FRONT HEADLIGHT -- the 
           Patrol Officer dives over the hood -- 

           BAM, BAM! The Patrol Officer comes up firing -- URRRHH!!! --
           only the Impala's fishtailing back on the HIGHWAY --

           I./E. IMPALA - RAILROAD TRACKS CROSSING - MOMENTS LATER

           Knowles exits the Impala, changed into a fresh suit, 12 gauge 
           stowed, brown briefcase in hand. One last look. Goes...   

           SIRENS approaching... LOUDER... CLOSER... 

           EXT. PALM BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD - LOCUST ST. - MOMENTS LATER

           Knowles pounding sidewalk. Dogs BARKING, SIRENS. JETS from 
           the nearby airport ROARING OVERHEAD. 
           Towards a SMALL YELLOW HOUSE. RAPS on the FRONT SCREEN DOOR. 

           INT. SMALL YELLOW HOUSE - 705 LOCUST ST. - CONTINUOUS 

           BEVERLY MABEE, ancient at 31, Winston cig, glances up from 
           her favorite TV soap. ON THE FLOOR, her nephew, DALE, 6, 
           freckles, plays with Hot Wheels. 

                                 DALE
                        Zuh-zoom, zuh-zoom -- someone's here, 
                        someone's here, somebody's here -- 
                                  (uncontrolled giggling)

                                 BEVERLY 
                        Shhh with that... 

           She LIFTS up on crutches at a small TABLE littered with 
           cerebral palsy prescription bottles. Ambles to the door. 

           STAY WITH Dale playing, his very own POLICE CHASE complete 
           with audio soundtrack: VROOMS, SCREECHES, HAIRPIN TURNS -- 

           Doesn't see KNOWLES ENTER -- his AUNT GASP -- THE FRONT 
           SCREEN DOOR CLATTERS CLOSED -- blotting out the SUN -- 

           LATER --

           Dale, still on the floor playing with his Hot Wheels. 
           Quieter, eyeing something in the corner we can’t see. Then -- 

           ZIPS a HOT WHEEL ACROSS THE HARDWOOD FLOOR where it hits -- 

           KNOWLES'S SHOE. In a corner, perched on a limp Lazy-Boy, 
           shotgun in his lap, eyeing the street outside the WINDOWS. 

           Nearby, Beverly is back at her table -- bound with electrical 
           cord, duct tape on her mouth. Scared witless for the boy. 

           Knowles calmly presses his shoe atop the Hot Wheel, and...

           ... ROLLS IT BACK. Dale smiles. Knowles nods, eyes a clock. 

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (to Beverly)
                        Said your sister'd be back by now.
                        She don't arrive soon, it won’t be 
                        good for you. Nod if you understand. 

           Beverly nods. Grows more terrified... 

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Your journey has just started. A dark 
                        and lonely desert lays ahead. And if, 
                        and when I choose, you’ll know how 
                        alone you are. There’ll be no one to 
                        save you. No prayers to recite, no 
                        dawn to break the night. I’d make 
                        peace with your mortality. 
           She's taut, truly abhorred by this frightful character. 
           Only to have him slump with a shrug.

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Or nothing’ll happen at all...  
                                  (grins)
                        Jus’ depends on my mood.
                                  (motions)
                        Got anything in that icebox with a 
                        kick? A cold one? 

           A sound -- THE SOUND. The loud prattle of a ‘67 beige VW 
           PULLING UP. Knowles checks OUT THE WINDOW. 

           Crouches behind Beverly, who shakes. RAISES THE TV VOLUME 
           with a remote. Looks at Dale finger to his lips... SHHHH. 

           BARBARA TUCKER, backs in with grocery bags, junk mail. Takes 
           us a second to register she's more than just an attractive, 
           doppelgänger for her sister: they're identical twins.

                                 BARBARA
                                  (annoyed by the loud TV)
                        Bev -- !
                                  (spots Dale)
                        Hey, sweetie, where’s -- 

           As Barbara rounds the corner to the KITCHENETTE -- KNOWLES 
           SPRINGS -- she GASPS -- a CHOKEHOLD -- her bags spill --  

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - SANDY’S HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           SNAP! Sandy shuts her suitcase. KNOCK, KNOCK! Loud. She opens 
           the door. An impatient Gabbard, with UNIFORMED DEPUTIES. 

                                 GABBARD
                        You need to come with us, Ms. Fawkes.
                        Not a request. 

           INT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - AUDIO ROOM - DAY

           A TECH with headphones sits listening, taking notes --

                                 ANGEL (OVER HEADPHONES) 
                        Ma’am, we're investigating crimes 
                        Knowles may have committed across 
                        multiple jurisdictions...

           INT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Sandy smokes across from Osborne and Angel. Gabbard stews in 
           the corner like someone pissed in his Sanka this morning.  

                                 SANDY
                        I’m in the dark about most of this. I 
                        only knew Daryl -- er, Knowles, a 
                        short time.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        I know what happened to Susan and 
                        there’s now a hostage but I don’t know 
                        anything about your case. 

                                 GABBARD
                                  (jumping in)
                        Do you think Knowles was queer? 
                        A pansy homosexual? 

           Osborne glares at him. Not tactful. Angel, a poker face. 

                                 SANDY
                        That's a rather roundabout way of 
                        asking me if we slept together.

                                 GABBARD
                        Did you two have sexual relations?

                                 SANDY
                        Yes. But to answer your first 
                        question, no. I don't think so. 
                        I just think he was inexperienced. 

                                 GABBARD
                        Inexperienced. 

                                 SANDY
                                  (testy)
                        That’s what I said. 

                                                              ANGEL
                                                  OK, let’s skip that for now --
                              GABBARD
           How often you two engage in 
           fornication?

                                 OSBORNE
                        Ma’am, I'm the Milledgeville Chief of 
                        Police. Are you aware of a double 
                        homicide we had a coupla weeks back? 
                        Carswell Carr and his 15-year old 
                        daughter, Mandy? 

           FLASH TO: Daryl and Sandy in the Impala, the clipped stack of 
           torn articles about the murders in the brown briefcase...

                                 SANDY
                        Yes, he'd brought it up once or twice.
                        He was carrying around a stack of 
                        articles about it.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Articles? About the murders?

                                 SANDY
                        In a briefcase he had. He said he had 
                        some friends that lived close to where 
                        they’d occurred, so he kept up on it.

           The cops all share a knowing look. Not lost on Sandy.
                                 OSBORNE
                        Knowles met Mr. Carr in a local gay 
                        bar the night of November 6th, and 
                        were soon seen leaving together... 
                                  (then)
                        Way the house looked initially, we 
                        thought it had to be the work of 
                        multiple perpetrators, but maybe it 
                        was just made to look that way. 

                                 SANDY
                        My whereabouts on that date can be 
                        confirmed. I hadn’t met him yet. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        We're not accusing you of anything -- 

                                 ANGEL
                        That's why we inked you earlier -- we 
                        already cleared your prints from the 
                        recovered vehicle. 

           Osborne opens a FOLDER, lays out some PHOTOS from earlier. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        We’d like you to look at these photos. 
                        A lot of items were taken from the 
                        Carr residence, including wardrobe. 

           The first is like a CLASS PHOTO of Carswell Carr, something 
           that might be in a company directory. But the next is --

           THE MEXICO SNAPSHOT. Carswell’s green suede jacket. 
           The one he wore. The one she wore. Sandy’s guts twist up in 
           knots. It’s one thing to hear, another to see. 

                                 SANDY
                        That one... yes. 

           FLASH TO: SHOTS of Daryl/Knowles in the jacket. The bar. 
           Dinner. The DANCE FLOOR. Warming herself with it.

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        He was wearing it the night we met. 
                        November 7th. 

           The two men exchange charged looks. Their first positive I.D. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You say, he called himself Daryl 
                        Golden when you met? 

                                 SANDY
                        Lester Daryl Golden. I only expected 
                        to stay with him one night. 
                        I know I shouldn't ask this but... 
                        what happened to the... young girl? 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Mandy. She was a classmate of my 
                        daughter’s... 
                                  (lets that drift)

                        The killing itself was sadistic. The 
                        Coroner said Mr. Carr had 47 puncture 
                        wounds. Mandy was raped, strangled. 
                        Took the Coroner 6 hours to dislodge 
                        the stocking she was gagged with. 
                        The wife came home from her night 
                        shift at the hospital, found them.

           Sandy -- roiled by the details. It’s unfathomable --

                                 OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                        We're also tracking victims' credit 
                        cards. Apparently he was using them 
                        frequently from what we can tell.

                                 SANDY
                        Yes, he used them quite often when we 
                        were together.

                                 ANGEL
                        We're going to need a list of the 
                        places you visited. 

                                 SANDY
                        Yes, yes... I have some receipts in my 
                        bag -- it's in the other room. 

                                 ANGEL
                                  (to Gabbard)
                        Can you grab her bag for us? 

           Gabbard doesn’t like the request one bit. Off in a huff --

                                 SANDY
                        He knows my hotel room number. 
                        What if he comes after me? 

                                 ANGEL
                        I expect they'd switch you to another 
                        room, something without an accessible 
                        balcony. There’ll be officers posted.

                        Another thing -- the car -- documents 
                        in the glovebox, I saw. The name 
                        “William Bates” was on the 
                        registration in case it was emptied 
                        when you recovered it.   

                                 OSBORNE
                                  (taking the note)
                        B-A-T-E-S. 

           She nods. Gabbard returns, heaps her purse on the table.

                                 SANDY
                                  (a little sifting)
                        Looks like my bag’s already been 
                        tallied through... 
                                  (glances at Gabbard)
                        Here -- he drew this.
           The COCKTAIL MAP he drew on the first night. Lots of stops. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Should be able to give you an idea of 
                        all the places he's been. His route.

           Osborne and Angel look at it. It's only going to get worse. 

           INT. SKYWAY MOTEL - LOBBY - FORT PIERCE, FL - EARLY MORNING

           AN ELDERLY CLERK READS aloud from a GUEST BOOK --

                                 CLERK
                        -- Mister and Missus Johnson?

           Looks up -- Knowles, slightly disheveled, and Barbara Tucker, 
           trying not to look perturbed. Dawn light outside. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        That’s right.

                                 ELDERLY CLERK
                        Welcome to Fort Pierce. Been driving 
                        all night, huh?

                                 KNOWLES
                        You bet... Hey, you know a place we 
                        can get a good breakfast ‘round here? 

                                 ELDERLY CLERK
                        I sure do. Our brochure has a map of 
                        town, lemme show you...

           Slides over the key and reaches for a brochure -- 

           INT. SKYWAY MOTEL ROOM #12 - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Knowles hangs the DO NO DISTURB SIGN outside. Locks it.

           Knowles CUTS BED SHEETS into long strips, ties Barbara Tucker 
           to the bed post. She’s gagged, tears stream down her face. 

           LATER --

           Nightfall out the WINDOWS. Knowles across from Barbara Tucker 
           on the floor, feet up on the bed, shotgun in his lap. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Comb your hair after dark. Comb sorry 
                        into your Old Man's heart...
                                  (grins)
                        Nursery rhymes. My grandmama was an 
                        Ozark. Used to sing them to us all the 
                        time as a kid.

           Now looms over her. Tenderly puts his hand on her forehead. 
           She trembles. He pulls the sheet gag from her mouth. 
                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        You need to use the bathroom? 

                                 BARBARA TUCKER
                        No...

                                 KNOWLES
                        OK. 
                                  (then)
                        That boy back at house, that your kid? 
                                  (she nods)
                        How old?

                                 BARBARA TUCKER
                        Six. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Six. A good age. An innocent age. 
                        You miss ‘im don’t you? 

           She nods. Calculating what to say. Terrified.

                                 BARBARA TUCKER
                        What’s going to happen to me?

           Knowles refastens the gag. She sobs quietly. He checks the 
           window. Quiet. Just the MOON... a wax-dripped Roman coin. 

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (sings)
                        New moon, new moon, do tell me 
                        Who my own true love will be?

           EXT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Sandy outside under that same moon... pacing, smoking, 
           thinking... reckoning with the horror of it all.

                                 KNOWLES (V.O.)
                        The color of her eyes, her hair 
                        The clothes she will wear
                        Where’s that precious beloved of mine? 
                        Out there in the night for me to find?

           She ducks the suspicious stares of COPS nearby...

           INT. SKYWAY MOTEL ROOM #12 - THE NEXT MORNING - DAWN

           EYES OPEN. Barbara Tucker. Still gagged, tied and bound. 

           But no sign of Knowles. RIPS at her binding. Guts and 
           adrenaline. PULLS a leg free --

           EXT. SKYWAY MOTEL ROOM #12 - CONTINUOUS

           Opens the door. VW gone. SCREAMS HER WAY TO THE FRONT DESK --
           EXT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           As chaotic as you’d expect it to be with a manhunt underway. 
           Osborne, Angel, Gabbard around the room.

           SANDY’S POV: THROUGH THE MINI-BLINDS. An armada of NEWS CREWS 
           camped out. Jumps as Osborne taps her on the shoulder -- 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Hey -- didn’t mean to scare you. 

                                 SANDY
                        I’m fine. It’s just a lot. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        I know. For everyone.

                                 SANDY
                        How much of my participation in this 
                        is going to be publicized?

                                 OSBORNE
                        Not sure I follow...?

                                 SANDY
                        I’m press, I know how this works. 
                        News is spreading. It’s only a matter 
                        of time before they’re on to me.   

                                 OSBORNE
                        You’ve been cleared, Sandy. Obviously 
                        with a man this dangerous out there, 
                        we need the public’s help. 

                                 SANDY
                        But I slept with him. It’s bad enough 
                        with every cop here treating me like 
                        I’m some filthy whore who beds down 
                        with killers, gets a thrill out of it. 

                              OSBORNE

                                                  -- It’s not?
           Sandy, that’s not what’s 
           happening here --

           Motions. Some COPS are eyeing them. She’s not imagining it.

                                 OSBORNE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll see what I can do. By the way, 
                        good job on that Bates detail. 

                                 SANDY
                        You found something?

                                 OSBORNE
                                  (reads from notepad)
                        William Vernon Bates, 32, an account 
                        exec for Ohio Power. His wife reported 
                        him missing on September 3rd --
           FLASH TO: A BUSY TAVERN. Two MEN huddled at a CORNER TABLE. 
           One is WILLIAM BATES, handsome, mustache, other is Knowles, 
           in a turtleneck sweater, bright blazer. They leave together. 

                                 OSBORNE (V.O.)
                        Bates was spotted leaving the Scott’s 
                        Inn in Lima, Ohio with a young, red-
                        haired gentleman. Sound familiar? 

           FLASH TO: In a FOREST thick with FOG, the limp, naked FIGURE -
           - BATES bound to a boulder -- the image from the beginning. 

                                 OSBORNE (V.O.)
                        They found his body in October in the 
                        woods near Williams Reservoir. Beaten. 
                        Strangled. 

           FLASH TO: Sandy driving the Impala along RTE 1, Knowles 
           sleeping peacefully in her lap. Both of them serene.

                                 SANDY
                        The car.

                                 OSBORNE
                        Been missing since we recovered it. 
                        And his credit cards. Maxed out.

                                 GABBARD (ON THE PHONE)
                        THEY FOUND HER! WHERE?

           The “her” he’s referring to is Barbara Tucker. The whole room 
           reacts, trains on Gabbard, including Sandy and Osborne. 

                                 GABBARD (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Shit yeah, I’ll take news like that --  
                                  (hangs up; to the ROOM)
                        Knowles left Barbara Tucker tied up in 
                        a Motel in Fort Pierce and she 
                        escaped. VW is still in play.  

           A slew of them converge towards a MAP on the wall. 

                                 ANGEL
                        He’s headed North... 
                                  (at Osborne)
                        Maybe back to Georgia. 
                                  (to Gabbard)
                        How soon can we question Tucker? 

                                 GABBARD
                        Gonna be a line for that.

                        For a guy who’s been leaving a trail 
                        of bodies, he’s sure leaving a lot of 
                        live witnesses behind. Beverly Mabee, 
                        her sister --

           TROOPER CHARLES CAMPBELL, on his usual RTE 27 run through 
           this sleepy Tallahassee suburb. He’s 35, ex-Army, all brawn, 
           business. Sees STORES, boat rental YARDS, storage UNITS and -- 

           A 1967 BEIGE VW. Parked outside a local DINER. And a red-
           haired man climbing in. Campbell goes for his radio --  

           I./E. VW - MOVING - RTE 27 - PERRY, FL - SAME

           Knowles, struggling a little with the unfamiliar gearbox, 
           downshifts out onto the highway, AM radio buzzing. 

           I./E. FLORIDA STATE TROOPER SEDAN - PERRY, FL - MOVING - SAME 

           Campbell pulls over, U-turns fast he can come up behind -- 

                                 CAMPBELL (INTO HANDSET)
                        ... off Route 27, headed eastbound...

           HIS POV: accelerating within view of the VW’s rear bumper.

                                 CAMPBELL (INTO HANDSET) (CONT'D)
                        ... VW plate number six-David-six-nine-
                        zero-zero -- 

           I./E. VW - MOVING - RTE 27 - PERRY, FL - SAME

           Knowles tilts his REARVIEW, spots the Trooper. His speed -- 
           the limit. Every nerve jangles, blazes. Looks at the SHOTGUN 
           stashed beneath the seat. Checks the chamber: empty. Fuck. 

           SIRENS FLASH. Knowles downshifts, pulls off the SHOULDER. 
           Idles. A Fresh Kool. The tall-brimmed Trooper exits.

           CAMPBELL. Approaching, hand on his S&W .357, slowly up to the 
           VW. As Knowles rolls the DRIVER’S SIDE WINDOW DOWN --

                                 KNOWLES
                        Was going the limit, Officer.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hands on the steering wheel where I 
                        can see ‘em -- 
                                 (Knowles compiles)
                        Sir, step out of the vehicle for me 
                        with your hands visible.

                                 KNOWLES
                        What’d I do?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sir, I need you to step from the 
                        vehicle. 

           Knowles shrugs, unlocks the door. Climbs out nonchalantly. 
           Keeps his hands aloft, lit Kool dangling from his lips.  
                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        Turn around. Put your hands on the 
                        roof and put out your cigarette.

           CLOSE ON: Campbell’s hands frisking Knowles for weapons... 

           KNOWLES SPINS -- GRABS CAMPBELL’S WRIST -- catches the big 
           Trooper off-guard -- TWISTS -- PITCHES CAMPBELL FORWARD using 
           the Trooper’s own weight -- SLAMS CAMPBELL AGAINST THE VW --

           Knowles at Campbell’s back -- rips the .357 from Campbell’s 
           holster, JAMS IT AGAINST HIS SKULL -- 

                                 KNOWLES
                        How’s it feel? How’s it fucking feel? 

           Snaps Campbell’s own cuffs on him -- tight.  

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        Cuffs snug enough? Had lots’a 
                        practice. 

           E./I. GRAN TORINO - MOVING - RTE 27 - SHORTLY THEREAFTER 

           Sipping cold Circle K coffee, JAMES MEYER, 29, businessman, 
           blinks in the mid-day sun. Sleepy, been on the road since 6. 

           Spots SIRENS IN HIS REARVIEW. Checks his speedometer. Faster 
           than he should. Sigh. Fucked his day. Turns off a gravelly 
           stretch of HIGHWAY. Silences the engine. 

           IN THE REARVIEW: A tall-brimmed TROOPER exits, approaches... 

           Meyer rummages for his registration in the GLOVE BOX. A

                        Miss, there’s a call for you.

                        You know, we have friends everywhere.

                        So you’re checking in for my well 
                        being, that it?  

                                 MCCARTEN (INTO PHONE)
                        I suppose you have me at a loss. I’ve 
                        been a bit of horse’s ass, haven’t I?

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Just doing your job. I understand. 
                                  (senses an opportunity)
                        I’m in the middle of a huge palaver

                       MCCARTEN (INTO PHONE)
           I heard what happened. About 
           this man you encountered, 
           Knowles --

                                 MCCARTEN (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        That’s just the sort of experience 
                        we’d love to have an exclusive on. 
                        First-hand. Lucrative, naturally. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        I thought you were fairly clear my 
                        contract wasn’t up for discussion.

                                 MCCARTEN (INTO PHONE)
                        Frankly, this changes the discussion. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                                  (eyeing cops eyeing her)
                        I have to go. 

                                 MCCARTEN (INTO PHONE)
                        How’s a 2-year contract sound? Plus a 
                        bonus that a knight could choke on? 
                                  (no response)
                        C’mon, Sandy. It’s the smart play. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        I’ll call you back. 

           Hangs up. Super-annoyed. Wheels turning. Then -- 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        Can you dial out? 
                                 DEPUTY
                        Uh-huh. Just dial nine. Local, right?

                                 SANDY
                                  (smiling and dialing)
                        Of course.

           Knowles at the wheel. IN BACK, CAMPBELL AND MEYER. Both 
           cuffed, legs shackled. Oil rags STUFFED in their mouths. 
           Dried blood from head blows, rancid sweat. 

           Knowles eyes them in the REARVIEW. Tugs his last Kool.

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (to Meyer)
                        Say fella, any smokes in here?
                                  (Meyer shakes his head)
                        Don’t smoke? Healthy lifestyle, huh? 
                                  (Meyer nods slowly)
                        I respect that. 

           Eyes an APPROACHING GAS STATION. Tilts that way. Campbell’s 
           .30 Carbine rifle on the floor of the passenger side.

           EXT. GAS STATION/MINI-MART - ABBEVILLE, GA - DAY

           The Gran Torino circles a set of REAR PUMPS furthest from the 
           door. Knowles inspects. Clear enough. Turns to his hostages -- 
                                 KNOWLES
                        Now, I ain’t gotta tell you two what 
                        happens if there’s any antics. You two 
                        ain't nuthin' but beetles under a

                                  (points at Campbell)
                        Hear me, Trooper? I won’t be boxed in. 
                        It’ll be you first, if it comes to it. 

           Campbell won’t meet Knowles’s gaze. Knowles heads INSIDE. 

           NEARBY, a MOTORIST screws the cap back on his Opel Station 
           Wagon. Takes in the weird sight of Knowles and the two men.  

           EXT. WEST PALM BEACH POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Sandy pacing with a cig by the LOBBY. Notices a BULLPEN 
           COMMOTION. A flurry of COPS pouring over MAPS --

                                  (as Sandy comes over)
                        Knowles just took a Florida State 
                        Trooper hostage outside of Perry, 
                        Florida. Then he used that Trooper’s 
                        car to take another citizen hostage. 

                                 SANDY
                        Oh my God... how’d he manage to take 
                        an armed policeman hostage?

                        If you read his jacket, the first 
                        thing Knowles got sent up for was 
                        taking a Trooper hostage. 

                                 SANDY

                        You told me he didn’t have a history 
                        for violence.

                                 GABBARD

                        cooperating. 

                                 GABBARD
                        Says she is. We don't know for sure.

                                 GABBARD
                        Last time I checked you’re in my 
                        playpen. You wanna swing a big dick, 
                        do it in yours.

                        That car was spotted at a filling 
                        station near Asheville... 

                                 ANGEL
                        So it looks to me like he’s already 
                        headed back to our playpen. Good day, 
                        gentleman.
                                  (to Osborne)
                        Let’s get outta here. 

                                 GABBARD
                        You can take Ms. Fawkes with you. 
                        She’s press now as far as I’m 
                        concerned. Press ain’t welcome.

                                  (to Osborne)

           INT. GRAN TORINO - MOVING - BIBB COUNTY, GA - DAY

           Soft rain against the windows. Knowles off to the side of the 
           road. Smoking, talking into the Panasonic Cassette Recorder. 

                                 KNOWLES (INTO RECORDER)
                        ... Sometimes you gotta let evil do 
                        what it does. Conquer nature within.

           KNOWLES -- looking for a TURNOFF -- fuck it -- no time -- the 
           ROADBLOCK coming up fast -- rushes to meet his violent fate --

           THE ROADBLOCK -- OFFICERS OPEN FIRE -- BAM, BAM, KRATT!! -- a 
           FUSILLADE OF FIREPOWER fit for Beirut, only --  

           NO SLOWING -- KA-BASH!!! THE GRAN TORINO PLOWS THROUGH THE

           THE GRAN TORINO STAGGERS -- SMASHES INTO A TREE OFF ROAD -- 

           IN THE GRAN TORINO -- Knowles in a daze -- BLEEDING from the

           OFFICERS APPROACHING -- scrambles -- pulls Campbell’s 
           carbine, a .357, the briefcase, eardrums BRRRINGGING --

           KRATT!! -- KNOWLES FIRES -- OFFICERS SCATTER, GET HIT --  

           KNOWLES -- BOLTS FOR THE FOREST -- a BULLET GRAZES HIS ANKLE, 
           cuts a nasty gash. Felled, Knowles TUMBLES into the dirt -- 

           Staggers up, spins -- unleashes a hail of GUNFIRE. Briefcase, 
           carbine in hand, limps on his bloody ankle into the FOREST -- 

           QUICK MANHUNT MONTAGE:

           The biggest manhunt in Georgia history is underway: 

           - AERIAL: Silent. FLASHING POLICE CARS tailgate, jam COUNTRY 
           ROADS between GA 42 and GA 155 forming a dragnet. Then -- 

           - WHUMPH, WHUMPH! -- A POLICE CHOPPER SWOOPS INTO FRAME 
           over Henry County’s SPRAWLING FORESTS, FARMLANDS, spotters  
           peering out rifle scopes. And below, a wave of --

           - ARMED SHERIFFS, STATE TROOPERS, COUNTY POLICE comb FOREST 
           FLOORS, BLOODHOUNDS hard-charging -- 

           EXT. DEEP IN THE HENRY COUNTY FOREST - DAY

           Knowles -- down a steep hill -- moving too fast -- SLIPS -- 

                                 KNOWLES
                        FUCK! 

           BRIEFCASE flies -- the Carbine too -- he ROLLS -- LANDS 
           AGAINST bramble, a tree log at the foot of a steep TRENCH.

           HOWLS IN AGONY. Picked up a dozen bruises, scrapes on the way 
           down. Maybe broke something. Sits up, sees down the hill -- 

           THE BRIEFCASE: Contents strewn, including the PANASONIC 
           RECORDER. Goes for it. Turns it over... the horror... deck 
           ajar, off-kilt. Panicked, Knowles hits PLAY --
                                 KNOWLES’S VOICE
                        ... And the last thing that dies in 
                        any living creature is the fear of 
                        man. The FFFUUHHR OF M A N N -- 

           GARBLING -- Knowles EJECTS THE CASSETTE -- only it’s jammed 
           in the cylinder -- FUCK! Looks around. There. Goes for --

           A TREE BASE. Starts digging frantically, fistfuls of wet 
           dirt. Will bury it out of sight for now -- 

           EXT. CRUMBLEY ROAD - MCDONOUGH, GA - DAY

           Knowles limps onto a country road of wooded farmland. Eyes --  

           A ONE STORY-HOUSE. In the clearing. 

           EXT. CLARK RESIDENCE - CARPORT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Knowles stumbles up to an old FORD PICKUP. Has to lean on it  
           for support. Peeks in. There’s gas, engine slightly warm. 

           FROM A WINDOW, owner, TERRY CLARK, 27, soft features, 
           glasses, coveralls, spots Knowles hunched over. Vanishes. 

           Knowles HEARS a door open. Looks at the carbine by his feet.

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (sees Clark coming)
                        Hey Mister, I need some help... 

           Terry Clark makes his way over to help Knowles. 

           Knowles quickly scoops the carbine -- FIRES -- 

           CLICK. It JAMMED. He checks the chamber and --

           KA-CHIK! Terry Clark’s got a SHOTGUN. Fresh off a hunting 
           trip, so his aim’s quite steady. 

                                 TERRY CLARK
                        DROP IT. HANDS IN THE AIR, bub! 
                        No funny business now...    

           Knowles lets the Carbine CLATTER beneath him. Backpedals.
           Terry Clark lifts the carbine, tosses it on carport’s roof. 

                                 TERRY CLARK (CONT'D)
                        Keep walking... 

                                 KNOWLES
                        You know what you’ve done? 

                                 TERRY CLARK
                        I SAID KEEP WALKING! HANDS UP! 

                                 KNOWLES
                        You’ve caught yourself a devil, fella. 
                        That’s what you’ve done, alright...
           EXT. SALEM BAPTIST CHURCH PASTORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Knowles hobbles ahead of Terry Clark, hands raised, towards a 
           neighbor’s HOUSE, a local Pastor. The PASTOR’S DAUGHTER, 17, 
           leans out the SECOND-STORY WINDOW, eyes wide -- 

                                 TERRY CLARK
                                  (up at her)
                        CALL THE SHERIFF! I GOT HIM! 

           E./I. MILLEDGEVILLE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY

           A CIRCUS awaits Knowles. REPORTERS, NEWS CREWS, ONLOOKERS. 

           THE PATROL CAR with Knowles ARRIVES. 

           When they yank Knowles out, he has a lit cig dangling from 
           his mouth. With his dark turtleneck, jacket... looks every 
           inch the handsome, rogue drifter killer.

           CLICK, CLICK, FLASH, FLASH from CAMERAS all around -- 

                                 REPORTERS
                        Did you kill Carswell Carr? Where are 
                        the hostages? How many victims?

           Knowles... surprised, pleased with the frenzy, the attention. 
           It’s the moment he’s been waiting for. SLAM TO --

           KNOWLES

           Posing for his MUGSHOT. Holding a black slate that reads:

           Lt. Tully making notes across from Knowles. Coleman observes.

                        do?

                                 KNOWLES
                        I’m a musician. Guitar. 

                                 LT. TULLY
                        I hope you appreciate the kinda 
                        trouble you’re in.

                                 KNOWLES
                        Yeah. You happen to see all those 
                        reporters outside. Gonna build my Mama 
                        a’house before they kill me. 
                                 LT. TULLY
                        And what exactly you admittin’ to?

                                 KNOWLES
                        I can tell you what I’ve done is gonna 
                        be impossible one day. It’s gonna get 
                        harder and harder. Ballistics. 
                        Forensics. Scientific advancements. 
                        They’ll be computers tracking 
                        everyone’s thoughts, tallying every 
                        little dark remark or deed. People 
                        will be locked up just for thinking 
                        about hurting someone, let alone kill 
                        ‘em. I’m a rarity. A dying breed. The 
                        crest of a giant wave that’s already 
                        crashing down. 

           EXT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - MILLEDGEVILLE, GA - SAME

           Angel’s sedan in the lot, Osborne helping Sandy out. Angel 
           looking annoyed by the delay. 

                                 SANDY 
                        I don’t see why we just didn’t go 
                        straight to the station if he’s there. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        Because we’re in the middle of an 
                        active investigation, Sandy. Even if 
                        you’re a material witness, you’re 
                        still press. How would that look?

           As he climbs back into the car -- 

                                 SANDY
                        Where will they be keeping him?

                                 OSBORNE
                        He’s being processed right now but 
                        we’ll be moving him around. He’s an 
                        escape risk after all. 

                                 SANDY
                        But when should I come by?

                                 OSBORNE
                        I’ll call you -- 

                                 ANGEL
                        Good day, Ms. Fawkes...
                                  (as he drives)
                        You told her too much already. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MILLEDGEVILLE POLICE STATION - DAY

           In comes a large, silver-haired Trooper, COLONEL BEECHUM, 55, 
           Commander of the Florida Highway Patrol, TWO TROOPERS by his 
           side. Coleman, Lt. Tully lingering in the back. 

           Colonel Beechum takes a seat across from Knowles, who smirks. 
                                 COL. BEECHUM 
                        I’m only going to ask you one time. 
                        For humanitarian and Christian 
                        reasons: tell me where my Trooper is. 
                        His family’s waiting for answers and 
                        I’d like to give them some. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Now you know I can’t do that. Not in 
                        the cards, no, no...
                                  (to Lt. Tully)
                        You contact my attorney, Sheldon 
                        Yavitz?

                                 LT. TULLY
                        He’s on his way. Might take him a long 
                        time to get here though. A long time. 

                                 COL. BEECHUM
                        It’s in your best interest to help me, 
                        son. You’re under our control now. 

           Knowles absorbs the veiled threats. Knows it won’t be pretty. 

                                 LT. TULLY
                        He jack-jawed earlier about more 
                        victims. But it’s prolly just B.S...

                                 COL. BEECHUM
                        That so?
                                  (daggers at Knowles)
                        How many you kill, son? Don’t be shy. 
                        This ain’t some queer bar like you’re 
                        used to. We can handle it. 

           Knowles extends his left palm. Traces a figure 8 and a slash.

                                 COL. BEECHUM (CONT'D)
                        18....?

           Knowles draws again... it looks like --

                                 COLEMAN 
                        Now it’s 35

                                 LT. TULLY
                        He’s playin’ games...

           Knowles shrugs. Incites a mixture of revulsion, disgust...

                                 COL. BEECHUM
                        If you’ve done something, don’t be a 
                        sissy faggot about it. Tell me where 
                        my Trooper is and I’ll make sure the 
                        boys go easy on you. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        If you win it, tie a blue ribbon 
                        around it.

                                 COL. BEECHUM
                        The hell you say?
                                 KNOWLES
                        Y’like nursery rhymes? If you win it, 
                        tie a blue ribbon around it. Say it a 
                        few times, you might discover where 
                        your Trooper’s hiding.

           Something lodges in Coleman’s head. His mind races. 

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Osborne and Angel arrive. Make their way towards the... 

           INTERROGATION ROOM -- THE ONE-WAY MIRROR. Osborne and Angel 
           lay eyes on Knowles for the first time...  

                                 KNOWLES (CONT'D)
                        You King Kong boys in your uniforms,

                        your cuffs, think you got all the 
                        power. Don’t think twice about hurtin’ 
                        people when they can’t fight back. But 
                        how many’a you ever taken a life? 
                        Snuffed a soul with your bare hands 
                        ’til the heart was as cold as all 
                        those dead stars up there? Oh you

                        cowards afraid to get honest blood on

                                  (leans into Col. Beechum)
                        I don’t need more than a’pair of your 
                        wife’s stockings to end your misera -- 

           Beechum has Knowles BY THE THROAT -- the TROOPERS RUSH IN -- 
           not to hold him back -- to help -- RAIN BLOWS -- a SAVAGE 
           BEATING ONLY STOPPED BECAUSE OSBORNE AND ANGEL RUSH IN --

           INT. SANDY’S HOTEL ROOM - AMBASSADOR HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sandy unpacking, Scotch in hand. Notices something jutting in 
           a suitcase pocket... the lock of cotton moss. Cradles it.

           EXT. BIBB COUNTY JAIL - MACON, GA - THE NEXT DAY

           A TAXI pulls up. Out steps Yavitz hurriedly, in a tan suit, 
           lugging a briefcase, coffee, newspapers --

           INT. BIBB COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Yavitz at the table. Looks up as GUARDS bring Knowles in 
           shackles, bandaged from his wounds. Waits until their alone. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Looks like you’ve been treated to some

                        Nothing I can’t handle. But something

                        Raiford. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Depends on our plea, the degree the 
                        various prosecutions can prove their 
                        cases. Just because they’re threading 
                        a noose doesn’t mean you help them tie 
                        the knot. 

                                 KNOWLES 
                                  (conspiratorially)
                        I can hear the cops ‘round here 
                        whispering my case might not even make 
                        it to trial.

                                 YAVITZ
                                  (sidesteps the dramatics)
                        Why don’t we take one thing at a time. 
                        Now, the hostages -- 
                                  (from his notes)
                        Georgia State Trooper, Charles E. 
                        Campbell and the Delawarean 
                        businessman, James E. Meyer.

                                 KNOWLES 
                        What about ‘em?

                                 YAVITZ
                        The police are convinced you know 
                        their whereabouts. Now, if you’re 
                        willing to divulge such information, 
                        perhaps we can negotiate reduced 
                        charges, leniency for cooperation 
                        especially at sentencing.

                                 KNOWLES
                        I think I’ve said everything I want to 
                        about that already.
                                  (re: Yavitz’s cigs)
                        May I?

                                 YAVITZ
                                  (slides them over)
                        You confident in the decision?
                                  (off his look) 
                        Your choice. Had to ask.

                                  (blazes a Kool)
                        One thing’s for sure, if I do get the 
                        death penalty, I don’t wanna be 
                        electrocuted. Gettin’ fried -- that’s 
                        a bad way to go. One’a the reasons I 
                        didn’t do anything in Texas. Or at 
                        least anything I’ll admit to. They 
                        love fryin’ cons in Texas.

                                 YAVITZ
                        Firing squad more your thing?
                                 KNOWLES
                        Maybe. I don’t want to be hung 
                        neither.

                                 YAVITZ 
                        Lethal injection?

                                 KNOWLES
                        Sure, I’d take poison -- er, lethal 
                        injection. But I want you to do what 
                        it takes to keep me alive.

                                 YAVITZ
                        If even a quarter of what you hinted 
                        at is true, you have a peculiar way of 
                        wanting to stay alive.

                                 KNOWLES
                        I haven’t made it easy for myself, 
                        I’ll give ya that. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Any victims you want to discuss? I 
                        have a preliminary list authorities 
                        are compiling where you’re considered 
                        a “person of interest”.

                                 KNOWLES 
                        Not really.

           Beat. Yavitz won’t let this go. Time for a mind game. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        They’ve made a lot of mistakes then. 
                        We’ll expose them. They can’t just pin 
                        things on you without evidence.

                        I assume this woman, Kathy Sue Pierce, 
                        in Musella, Georgia -- you never met 
                        her, right? August 3rd, 1974? 

           Knowles muses on it. Falling into his attorney’s game...

                                 KNOWLES
                        That one went bad. Was before I had my 
                        IRS ploy down. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        IRS ploy...?

           INT. PIERCE HOME - FOYER - FLASHBACK - AUGUST 3RD, 1974 - DAY

           KATHY SUE PIERCE, 30s, nice face, leads Knowles, salesman’s 
           seersucker suit, briefcase, into a bright DINING ROOM. 

                                 KNOWLES (V.O.) 
                        Something I cooked up to get into 
                        places. “Bob Williams”, IRS Agent. 
                        Even had a business card from a local 
                        restaurant...

                        got it from one of those bowls you 
                        drop your card in to try and win a 
                        free lunch. He sure didn’t win.    

           Knowles set his briefcase on the DINING ROOM TABLE. 
           SNAPS it open. INSIDE, a pair of DARK GLOVES...

           Knowles, staring off...

                        Was just going to clear the place out. 
                        But she got upset. And it went bad...

           INT. PIERCE HOME - FOYER - FLASHBACK - AUGUST 3RD, 1974 - DAY

           Knowles and Kathy mid-struggle -- she’s FLAILING HIM WITH 
           FISTS, FEET -- he can barely control her -- drags her into --

           THE ADJOINING KITCHEN. Knowles stretches for the WALL PHONE, 
           the dangling CORD -- grips -- WRAPS IT AROUND KATHY’S NECK --  

           ROUND AND ROUND... SHE’S CHOKING NOW -- a dress strap TEARS, 
           her breast EXPOSED. Knowles, panting, looks almost as if he’s 
           taking Kathy from behind -- until she’s still. 

           Lets her body THUD against the tile floor... 

           EXT. BACK YARD - FLASHBACK - AUGUST 3RD, 1974 - DAY

           Knowles, disheveled, exits with the briefcase. Startled by --

           KATHY’S SON. 7 or so. Been playing in the backyard this whole 
           time. They share a long stare. Knowles steps towards him...

           INT. BIBB COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Yavitz, surprised to read -- 

                                 YAVITZ
                        -- says you left the boy unharmed. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Don’t sound so disappointed, Shelley.

                                 YAVITZ
                        It’s just that you mentioned there 
                        were no witnesses before I thought... 
                        that included everyone.

           Knowles leans back... takes a drag.

                                 KNOWLES
                        You can’t get ‘em all now can you?

           That laugh. That easy grin...

                        This woman in Woodford, Virginia, 
                        Doris Hovey. Was that the Bob Williams 
                        IRS routine? October 19th? Or are the 
                        police mistaken about that one too? 

           INT. HOVEY STUDY - FLASHBACK - OCTOBER 17TH, 1974 - DAY

           NO SOUND. Full of BUSTS, ANTLERED ANIMALS. DORIS HOVEY, 53, 
           greying socialite, unloads a SAFE. Pulls stacks of $100 
           bills, stock certificates, jewelry cases into a bag.  

           Nearby, Knowles (different suit, gloves), at her husbands 
           GLASS GUN CASE. Pulls a Remington DOUBLE-BARREL. Loads it. 

           She brings him the bag. He’s surprised how calm she seems. 

           Knowles SNAPS the breech closed. Lets the barrel drift her 
           way slowly, never breaking eye contact... and... BOOM! 

           INT. BIBB COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

           Knowles and Yavitz as before. Knowles looks troubled... 

                                 YAVITZ
                        They don’t have a list of missing 
                        items here... 

           INT. HOVEY STUDY - FLASHBACK - OCTOBER 17TH, 1974 - DAY

           Knowles peering down at Doris Hovey’s BODY... BLOOD FROM HER 
           EXPLODED HEAD SPREADS IN A WINGS PATTERN OVER A BRIGHT RUG... 

           THE ROOM practically GLOWS. Deer mounts. Elk heads. Solemn 
           buffalo. All their glassy, fixed stares. Dull mouths, claws. 
           He’s a hunter among the trophies.

           Knowles hears the beating of wings, the CRY of a SEAGULL... 
           its shape flitting OUTSIDE THE WINDOW -- 

           Leaves without taking anything... not even the gun.

                        I think we’re done for now. 

           Yavitz looks up. Knowles’s expression. Yeah, they’re done.

                        Yes. I heard part of one. The others 
                        they’re fighting over right now --

           Jam-packed. Sandy in back, with other press. Yavitz at the  
           DEFENSE TABLE across from TOM VROMAN, 30s, a prim, U.S.  
           ATTORNEY, a rising star. On the bench, JUDGE WILBUR OWENS,  
           60s, jelly-jowled, Old Testament-justice vibe.

                                 YAVITZ 
                        Your Honor, turning the tapes over to 
                        this court would be a serious, ethical 
                        breach of attorney-client privilege. 

                                 JUDGE WILBUR OWENS
                        The life-threatening urgency of the 
                        matter supersedes your fidelity to 
                        attorney-client privilege. Your client 
                        revoked that for himself. Turn over 
                        the tapes to the Marshals, or I’ll  
                        find you in contempt, Counsellor.

                                 YAVITZ
                        I’m afraid I cannot comply with this 
                        request, Your Honor. I don’t represent 
                        the missing or even the deceased, I 
                        represent my client. 

                                 JUDGE WILBUR OWENS
                        Then you give me no choice. Let’s see 
                        if jail changes your mind. Court finds 
                        defendant’s counsel, Mr. Yavitz, in 
                        contempt. Bailiff -- 

           Strikes the gavel. The COURTROOM. Pandemonium.

           Coaster to the hilt, next to Patsy Yavitz at the DEFENSE  
           TABLE. Same crowd as the day before. Sandy in back. 

                                 ELLIS RUBIN
                        Your Honor, as I said in my opening  
                        statement, Mrs. Yavitz intends to 
                        plead the 5th to any questions 
                        injurious to her husband. 

                                 JUDGE WILBUR OWENS 
                        I wonder, Counsellor, if a contempt 
                        charge and a night in jail like her 
                        husband would compel her to reason.  

                                 ELLIS RUBIN
                        Your Honor, she is his wife and his 
                        secretary. This information the People 
                        request from her is privileged -- 

                                 JUDGE WILBUR OWENS
                        They might interpret things more 
                        loosely in Miami-Dade, Mr. Rubin, but 
                        here, defendants don’t get to shirk 
                        their civic duties under the guise of 
                        “privilege”.  
                                  (to Patsy)
                        Do you still refuse to show the 
                        Marshals where these tapes are?

           Judge Wilbur Owens leans back in his chair. Inscrutable look.  
           A HUSH in the courtroom. Then, the Judge leans forward --

                                 JUDGE WILBUR OWENS
                        Your client might find she could’ve 
                        saved a man’s life and she’ll have to 
                        live with that ‘till her doomsday. 
                        This Court finds her in contempt. 

           Patsy, quietly floored. Sandy takes in the COMMOTION, Rubin  
           shouting, the Bailiff coming to take Patsy into custody. 
           INT. SHELDON YAVITZ’S HOME - CORAL GABLES - DAY

           A dozen U.S. MARSHALS turn Yavitz’s home inside out while his  
           terrified CUBAN HOUSEKEEPER watches with his SON, clutching  
           the Weeble toy Knowles gifted him. A Marshall finds the SAFE. 

                                 SANDY (V.O.)
                        Yavitz told the Marshals where to find 
                        the tapes to get his wife out. 
                        But he’s still in jail.

                        They won’t let you see him? 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        I’ve tried, believe me. They’re 
                        limiting his exposure.  

                                 HARRISON (OVER PHONE)
                        Considering the relationship you had 
                        with Knowles, have they considered he  
                        might tell you where the hostages are?

           Sandy opposite Osborne and Angel. Mulling her proposition.

                        It’s worth a shot.  

                                 ANGEL
                        You’d be in there with him alone. He’s 
                        already attacked one of his relatives.  

                                 SANDY

           Still waiting. Eyes the clock. Hears the door. Braces herself 
           and -- it’s Osborne. Takes her by surprise. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        We found ‘em Sandy. Both men.  

                                 SANDY
                        When? 
                                 OSBORNE
                        An hour ago. One’a my deputies 
                        actually figured out the ribbon riddle 
                        Knowles dropped on us before a pair’a  
                        hunters stumbled upon them. Our search 
                        team was minutes away. Pabst. They 
                        were left near a Pabst factory. 

                                 SANDY
                        I see. Were they... ? 

           Osborne doesn’t have to say it. 

                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        That’s awful. So I don’t get to talk 
                        to him. 

                                 OSBORNE
                        ‘Fraid not.

           No, Sandy, it doesn’t --

                        Constitution. It true you spent a week 
                        with Paul John Knowles?  
                                  (before she can respond)
                        Were you a willing companion or 
                        captive to this mass murderer, this 
                        modern-day Jack the Ripper? 

                                 SANDY
                        You’ve got your hyperbole down, I’ll 
                        give you that. But you’ve got your 
                        facts wrong.  

                                 JOSEY
                        Oh, so you weren’t about to have an 
                        interview with him that got cancelled.  
                                 SANDY

                                 JOSEY
                        So it’s true. Is it also true you’re 
                        some publicity-seeking broad out to 
                        make a name for yourself? 

                                 SANDY
                        Your opinion or someone else’s?  

                                 JOSEY
                        It’s just what I heard.  

                                 SANDY
                        Your sources are dead wrong.  

                                 JOSEY
                        Why not clear up the record then? 
                        Helluva story.

                        I really don’t have time for this

                                 JOSEY
                        I was there when they brought him in. 
                        He loved the attention -- loved it. 
                        But who’d expect a killer’d look like 
                        that. They’re calling him a real 
                        Casanova... the Casanova Killer. 

                                 SANDY  
                        That’s a stupid name. Doesn’t suit him 
                        at all. 

                                 JOSEY
                        Worked on you. Charmed the clothes 
                        right off’a you.

                        You’re talented, PJ... in another life 
                        we’d be meeting at an art show.

                        Maybe. But you have to agree, I 
                        haven’t done too bad for myself. 

                                 YAVITZ

                        My daughter read it for school. 
                        It’s a children’s book.

                        It’s not a children’s book. It’s a 
                        fable. Fables aren’t age specific.

                        That’s the stuff of kid’s nightmares. 
                        I bet you never knew the bogeyman only 
                        had only one arm.

                                 YAVITZ
                        I don’t believe in stuff like that. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Not even when you were a kid?

                                 KNOWLES
                        She’s someone special alright. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Not a... a victim?

                                 KNOWLES
                        No. She’s a survivor. Like me. 
                                  (then)
                        I’ll expect you make a bundle of cash 
                        off alla this. My case. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        I don’t know about that. I wouldn’t 
                        say things are going well for us right 
                        now. We’ll know more after your 
                        arraignment tomorrow. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Oh? Why else would you be sitting here 
                        in jail with me. The upside, Shelly.  

                                 YAVITZ
                        I’m your attorney. I’m obligated to --

           Only Knowles laughs shrill enough it stops Yavitz cold. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        Yeah, you are. But that don’t mean you 
                        won’t figure out some way to get rich. 
                        I’ve been in the system. I know how it 
                        works. 
                                  (dead serious)
                        Just make sure my Ma’s taken care of. 
                        That’s all I ask. You do that... and 
                        you and your family will be alright. 

           If Yavitz is scared, it doesn’t show. Knows a threat.

           Angel driving, Osborne bird-dogging Knowles in the BACKSEAT.  
           He’s in a bright orange jump suit, cuffed, manacled. 

           PATROL CARS, in front, behind... a mock parade route on the 
           way to the courthouse. Knowles a little giddy for the --

           CROWDS. Lining streets. Sidewalks. Atop cars, rooftops with 
           binoculars. NATIONAL, LOCAL NEWS and all their mics, cameras.

                                 ANGEL
                        It’s a nuthouse out here. 
                                 OSBORNE
                        They’ve never had anything like this.  

           EXT. BALDWIN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - MILLEDGEVILLE, GA - DAY

           Angel’s Ford muscles its way to the Courthouse CURB. 

           POLICE skirmish to keep CROWDS at bay, everyone eager to 
           glimpse this Casanova Killer in person. 

           IN THE CROWD: Familiar faces. Coleman, Lt. Tully. A stricken 
           Ellen Carr. Ms. Crowley. Helen Ray, the Zayre clerk. Jim and 
           Suzanne MacKenzie. Terry Clark. TEENS, COLLEGE co-eds.

           Angel and Osborne pull Knowles out. The CROWD surges. 

           REPORTERS SHOUT ad-libbed QUESTIONS, poke mics, cameras -- 

           This is Knowles’s ROCK STAR MOMENT. Center of the universe.

           Basks in the crowd, the attention, a white-hot opioid --

                        PJ, PJ, OVER HERE! WE LOVE YOU! 

           Rubin by his side now, following in Knowles’s wake, Angel and  
           Osborne on either side, leading him in --

           Knowles eyes search the CROWD, wanting to find -- 

           SANDY. Near the front. THEIR EYES LOCK. He approaches. 

           And it’s as if the whole crowd goes SILENT momentarily... 
           they’re back at the river, the only two people in the world. 

                                 KNOWLES
                        You look good.

                        Remember what I said. What needs to be 
                        done. Remember -- 

           Only they’re dragging him away now, Sandy staring after -- 

           INT. BALDWIN COUNTY COURTHOUSE - COURTROOM - DAY

           Knowles being arraigned. He tilts back towards Sandy along a  
           far WALL, notebook in hand. 

           Shares with her a resigned expression... the same one when 
           told her he was  going to be killed. Turns back again.

                        Why was it not proper when they sent 
                        me to into war-zones -- Israel, 
                        Belfast -- but not this?! 

                                 HARRISON
                        Believe me, I know. Just get back 
                        here. Time to come home.  

           CLICKS OFF. Glances over at MERWYN ABERNATHY, the new boss, 
           sitting off like a Bishop. 60s. Paternal and patronizing.

                                 MERWYN
                        You let her down gently, I’ll give you 
                        that. There’s going to be quite a few 
                        changes around here.  

           INT. SANDY’S HOTEL ROOM - AMBASSADOR HOTEL - MORNING

           Sandy hangs up. SMASHES HER GLASS AGAINST THE WALL. KNOCKS 
           SHIT OVER. LOSES IT -- ALL OF IT --

                        I’ve killed more. Many more than what 
                        they’re saying.   

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DOUGLAS COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER DAY

           Yavitz across from Knowles. Knowles, stubbled, bleary-eyed. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        Than who’s saying? 

                                 KNOWLES
                        The press. I’m not on the front pages 
                        anymore. They’re forgetting about me. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        You need to focus on what’s your 
                        trial. Not the press, not --  

                                 KNOWLES
                        The night Angela dumped me in Frisco, 
                        I killed three people in Battery Park. 
                        Bodies just waiting to be found.  

                                 YAVITZ
                        You want me to relay this to the San 
                        Francisco authorities? 
                                 KNOWLES
                        No -- yes -- I mean, I keep hearing 
                        things in here. That my case won’t 
                        ever make it to trial. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        You’re on about that again.  

                                 KNOWLES
                        I wanna go somewhere safer.  

                                 YAVITZ
                        I’ll see what I can do. 

                                 KNOWLES
                                  (near disbelief)
                        It’s like what I done, didn’t matter.  

                                 YAVITZ
                        What’re you upset about? The threats 
                        or that your face isn’t plastered all 
                        over the front pages anymore?

                                  (indignant)
                        Look, I made a lotta sacrifices to be 
                        here. I want leverage.  

                                 YAVITZ
                                  (testy)
                        PJ, I strongly advise, if you really 
                        want to avoid the death penalty -- 
                        STOP confessing to crimes you may or 
                        may not have committed.  

                                 KNOWLES
                        Help me, then. Show them I’m being 
                        cooperative.  

                                 YAVITZ
                                  (ruminates)
                        They might be more lenient if you help 
                        them with their existing cases. How 
                        about the murder weapon of the Trooper 
                        and Meyer?  

                                 KNOWLES
                        I know where it is. 

                                 YAVITZ
                        That would demonstrate cooperation 
                        without adding to existing charges. 
                        But they won’t let us dictate terms. 
                        It’ll be quiet because they don’t want 
                        press involved. They’re being watched 
                        closely by Governor Carter right now. 

           Knowles crestfallen. He wanted a show alright.

           Angel at the wheel, Osborne shotgun. Knowles in the back

                        Maybe I don’t mind. I can lose our 
                        tail, pull over, take care of him once 
                        and for all.

           A gunslinger’s standoff in the tight confines of the sedan.

           Angel POUNDS THE GLOVEBOX with his free hand -- .38 BACKUP -- 
           SEIZES IT -- pushes it towards Knowles’s chest... POP, POP!!

           Knowles JERKS back oozing fresh blood, hazy smoke in the air. 

           Knowles looks at Angel... that easy grin.

                        NO!!!! 

           Angel BLASTS KNOWLES IN THE HEAD!!!

           Knowles’s body slumps into in a crucifix-like repose.  

           Out the window, the Seagull circles, watching below...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK:
           EXT. FLEET STREET - LONDON - DAY

           Establishing. This urban heart of journalism in London.

                        LONDON, DECEMBER 18th, 1974

           INT. THE CITY GOLF CLUB - DAY

           For Fleet Street journalists, this is home away from home.  
           Crypt-dark, but lively as they banter over pints, pretzels.

           Sandy at the BAR, chatting up a colleague from the Sun when 
           Harrison arrives, sits off her shoulder. Sandy leans over.

                                 SANDY
                        A Bloody Mary to take the edge off 
                        that hangover, eh? 

                                 HARRISON
                        Feelin’ a bit better actually.  
                                  (motions at BARTENDER)
                        I s’ppose you’ve heard.  

                                 SANDY
                        Heard what?  

                                 HARRISON
                        They shot your boyfriend.  

           It’s there, flickering in Sandy’s eyes... the hatred for the  
           press game where every tragedy is a joke to be had. Just when  
           we think she’s going to explode, she breaks into a... grin. 

                                 SANDY
                        Oh, really?  

                                 HARRISON
                        Just came in off the telex -- 
                                  (as Bartender arrives)
                        Gin and T, up the usual way. 

           Harrison pulls a piece of paper from his jacket. Reads:

                                 HARRISON (CONT'D)
                        “Paul John Knowles, an alleged mass-
                        murderer suspected in at least thirty-
                        five killings across the United States 
                        was shot dead in an apparent attempt 
                        to escape whilst being transferred  
                        from one maximum security jail to 
                        another.”  

           Lays the telex on the bar. Beat. She picks it up. 

                                 HARRISON (CONT'D)
                                  (studies her)
                        Least you needn’t worry about 
                        punchlines around the punchbowl this 
                        Christmas. After this dies out anyway.  

                                 SANDY
                                  (absently)
                        40 days...  
                                 HARRISON
                        Say again?  

                                 SANDY
                        Nothing..  
                                  (puts paper in her purse)
                        Absolutely nothing.  

                                 HARRISON
                        If you’re headed back to the office, 
                        don’t tell anyone I’m here.  

           Only she’s already gone. 

           INT. DAILY EXPRESS - MAIN FLOOR - LATE AFTERNOON

           Sandy steps off the ELEVATOR. Walks quietly to her DESK,  
           enduring several gawking stares from COLLEAGUES around her. 

           Just sits before her typewriter in the pale, afternoon light. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        Not tonight, Sandy.  

           INT. SANDY’S FLAT - SOHO, LONDON - EARLY EVENING

           Elegant furnishings, artful touches... and a sense of 
           desolation. Someone stays here, they don’t live here. 

                                 SANDY (INTO PHONE)
                        But you’ve put me off for weeks. I 
                        already made the reservation.  

                                 MAN (OVER PHONE)
                        I know but, things are a bit different 
                        now... I don’t think we should see 
                        each other for awhile. I --  

           CLICK. She’s already hung up. Same story. 
           No one wants to see her that way anymore. 

           LATER - THE BEDROOM

           Sandy, buzzed, drinks alone atop her BED, across from her 
           MIRRORED ARMOIRE covered in jewelry boxes, accessories.

           Just staring off and back at herself... listless. 

           IN THE ARMOIRE MIRROR, a PAIR OF HANDS envelop her... 

           LIPS KISS HER shoulders... then her neck, parting her hair. 
           Hungry hands rove her body, pulling at her nightgown...

           It’s reverent. It’s passionate. It’s -- KNOWLES. 

                                 SANDY
                        Wait, wait. Don’t... STOP... STOP! 

           She’s hitting him -- pushing, shoving him away --  

           He doesn’t answer. Stares OVER HER SHOULDER in the mirror. 
           She HURLS HER TUMBLER AT THE MIRROR -- SMASH -- it shatters -- 

           EXT. LONDON BOOKSHOP WINDOW - SIDEWALK - YEARS LATER - DAY

           Sandy watches a BOOKSELLER arrange a GIANT WINDOW DISPLAY. 

           It’s her BOOK about her experience with PJK: KILLING TIME.

           Sensationalistic JACKET COPY BLURBS: 

           “JOURNEY INTO NIGHTMARE”; “ON THE ROAD WITH A KILLER”, etc... 

           Sandy feels SOMEONE behind her... a tall, familiar SILHOUETTE 
           looming off her shoulder peering in the window...

           She turns around. 

           There’s no one there. 

           Just London street life going about its business. 

           FACES IN THE CROWD, anonymous, oblivious... 

           Sandy shivers a little before she walks off. 

                                                           FADE TO BLACK

           Sandy Fawkes book KILLING TIME was published in 1976. 

           The audio tapes of Paul John Knowles were irretrievably damaged when the basement 
           of the Macon courthouse was flooded after a severe thunderstorm. 

           No other copies are known to exist. 

           The Florida School for Boys was closed in 2011 amid decades-long allegations of 
           physical and sexual abuse.

           Researchers from the University of South Florida have discovered evidence of dozens 
           of unmarked graves and are advocating for federal funds to conduct an in-depth 
           forensic investigation into the site.

           18 victims were subsequently linked to Paul John Knowles, with claims as high of 35 by 
           some authorities as new DNA evidence emerges from ongoing investigations.
