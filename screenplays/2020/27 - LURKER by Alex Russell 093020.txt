           EXT. THE ORIGINAL FARMERS MARKET - AFTERNOON

           CHYRON: 2016

           MATTHEW, 22, walks around aimlessly among crowded stalls and 
           tents. He’s anonymous, but surrounded by groups of people. 
           FAMILIES dine together, laughing. FRIENDS clown each other. 
           PEOPLE taking group selfies. 

           Everyone seems to be laughing at an inside joke that does not 
           include him. He sits down at an empty table, scrolling his 
           phone, starts to eat alone. A GROUP of friends and family 
           sits down at the table next to him, but they’re a few too 
           many. One DAD approaches Matthew.

                                 DAD
                        Hey, you here all by yourself?

           Matthew perks up, thinking he’s about to be invited to eat 
           with them. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh yeah, feel free to sit--

                                  DAD
                        --Would you mind if we took some of 
                        these chairs?

           Matthew feels silly for thinking they were reaching out to 
           him. He gathers himself.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh um, yeah sur--

                                 DAD
                        --Thanks, bud.

           The Dad and one of the sons grab all three chairs at 
           Matthew’s table, leaving Matthew in a single chair by 
           himself. The family roars into laughter and conviviality. 
           Matthew looks over, concerned they are laughing at him, but 
           quickly realizes they are just having a good time. 

           He stares longingly as more people join them. He toys with 
           his food and goes back to scrolling his phone silently. He 
           puts his AirPods in. The same Dad comes back over again, 
           tapping Matthew on the shoulder.

                                 DAD (CONT'D)
                        Hey, bud.
                                 MATTHEW
                             (taking AirPods out)
                        Oh, hey.

           Again, a part of Matthew thinks they’ve clocked his 
           loneliness and will invite him to sit with them this time.

                                 DAD
                        You mind taking a picture of us?

           He’s less surprised this time.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh, sure. Yeah, of course.

           Matthew frames the Dad’s iPhone, snaps a few pictures of the 
           group and hands the phone back.

                                 DAD
                        Thanks, bud.

           Matthew walks off through the crowd and gets on his bike.

           INT. AMERICAN RAG STORE - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew stands behind the counter with his co-worker JAMIE, 
           20. A couple of CUSTOMERS browse the racks. Matthew and Jamie 
           take turns playing music on the store speakers, through an 
           auxiliary cord. Jamie selects something to play from his 
           phone.

                                 JAMIE
                        You heard this yet?

                                 MATTHEW
                             (scrolling his phone)
                        Yeah this shit is ass.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh shit.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What.

                                 JAMIE
                        Look.

           Matthew and Jamie see through the shop windows to the other 
           side of the street. OLIVER, 24, up-and-coming music 
           celebrity, is being swarmed by FANS. He’s leaning over on his 
           BMX bike, engaging them. 
           EXT. AMERICAN RAG STORE, ACROSS THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver is trying to calm the fans down, but they’re acting 
           like vultures.

                                 OLIVER
                        Aight let’s play a game. Everybody 
                        close your eyes. And don’t open 
                        them until I say “I am a bad 
                        bitch.”

           All the fans close their eyes. Oliver gets on his bike and 
           wheelies across the street, attempting to escape the fans by 
           heading toward the mostly empty store.

           INT. AMERICAN RAG STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Matthew and Jamie see Oliver approaching the store. The STORE 
           MANAGER emerges from the back.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh shit.

           Quickly, Matthew UNPLUGS Jamie’s phone from the aux cord, 
           GRABS his own phone, PLUGS it into the aux cord, and CHANGES 
           the song to “Waltz for Debby” by Bill Evans. Oliver steps 
           into the store, straddling his bike. 

           But before he can exhale, all the fans have followed him 
           inside like sheep.

                                 OLIVER
                        Did y’all hear the words “I’m a bad 
                        bitch?” 

           A FAN gets right up next to Oliver like he’s about to say 
           something, but just stares at him, gawking.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        ... Yes?

           The fan’s mouth widens but no words emerge.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Yo, I appreciate you. But can you 
                        please back the fuck up.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        Can I help you get anything?

           Oliver notices the music playing.
                                 OLIVER
                        Yo, what radio is this? Is this a 
                        playlist?

           Pause. Matthew seizes his chance to speak.

                                 MATTHEW
                        We get to... choose the music. It’s 
                        the one good part about this job.

                                 OLIVER
                        You like Stevie?

                                 JAMIE
                        Yo I love your shit, bro.

           Oliver ignores Jamie.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I do. I grew up on this type 
                        of shit.

                                 OLIVER
                        Me too, my aunties used to play 
                        this shit for me when I was a baby. 
                        I would shit myself and jump on the 
                        couch.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah my grandma used to play this 
                        for me too. Classic.

           A fan gets up really close to Oliver and takes a flash 
           picture of him and ANOTHER FAN who’s standing behind him. 
           Oliver’s had enough.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo! Get the fuck away from me! I’m 
                        trying to have a normal 
                        conversation with a regular person.

           CLOSE ON Matthew, holding back a grin: I’m the regular 
           person. The fan is terrified. Oliver relents.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry. You wanna take another 
                        one? Let’s take another one. 
                        Alright, come on now.

           The fan brightens up again and takes another picture with 
           flash, right up in Oliver’s face. It’s excruciating. Oliver 
           turns back to Matthew.
                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Yeah my next album, I want it to 
                        sound like this, like fucking... 
                        timeless, you know?

                                 MATTHEW
                        You make music?

           Pause. 

           CLOSE ON Jamie.

                                 OLIVER
                        You don’t know who I am?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, I mean... I’m sorry I don’t 
                        really listen to like... 

                                 OLIVER
                        What?

                                 MATTHEW
                        New music, or whatever. No offense, 
                        though.

                                 OLIVER
                        Oh... no, I feel you.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I guess that’s why all these 
                        kids are here? I’m dumb as shit, 
                        sorry.

                                 OLIVER
                        Uh-huh. Yeah. 

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        That’s cool.

                                 OLIVER
                        I think you’d like my shit though, 
                        for real. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        You think so?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah I mean, if you like this type 
                        of shit... and it sounds like you 
                        have an open mind. My shit is 
                        like...

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        super-futuristic alternative 
                        Mariachi music. It’s like a cross 
                        between Fergie and Big Sean if they 
                        made a gospel album... not 
                        sonically but like, visually.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh... 

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m playing. But nah, you’ll fuck 
                        with it, I think.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ok, I’ll check it out, for sure. 
                        What’s your uh... Are you on 
                        Spotify?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo just come to my show tonight. 
                        I’m gonna have a full band and 
                        everything.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You got a show?

           All the other fans and Jamie are now looking at Matthew with 
           disdain. They can’t believe this shit is happening.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah at the Echo. You wanna come? I 
                        need somebody real to actually 
                        appreciate what I’m doing on stage 
                        instead of just coming so they can 
                        put the shit on their IG story.

           The other fans, clearly guilty of this, cower shamefully.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ok, I’m down.

           Oliver hands Matthew his phone, and Matthew types in his 
           number, saving the contact as “Matthew (real person)”. Oliver 
           calls Matthew’s number. Matthew pulls out his phone and 
           answers.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 OLIVER
                             (angrily)
                        Ay you got my shit?!
                                 MATTHEW
                             (taken aback)
                        Huh?

                                 OLIVER
                        The fucking... the heroin. The 
                        crack. The fucking... Pop tarts and 
                        Toaster Strudels. You got it all 
                        wrapped up for me like we 
                        discussed?!

                                 MATTHEW
                             (playing along)
                        Oh, uh... yeah. It’s in the... in 
                        my drawer.

                                 OLIVER
                        Good. Put that shit in a Whole 
                        Foods bag and leave it under the 
                        110 overpass. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        I got you. Listen, my grandma needs 
                        me to help her with the groceries.

                                 OLIVER
                        Ok blood. Tell that bitch I said... 
                        Merry Christmas.

           They both hang up, smiling. Oliver starts walking out, 
           stepping through fans. 

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Ay, just hit me when you get there.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Aight. 

           Oliver gets on his bike.

           EXT. AMERICAN RAG STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver gleefully wheelies into oncoming traffic, forcing cars 
           to a screeching halt. He laughs hysterically.

                        Yield, bitch!
           INT. AMERICAN RAG STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           The fans empty out of the store. Jamie looks at Matthew, who 
           finally breaks character, reverting back to his normal self: 
           a fan who just interacted with his idol.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        You should quit this job and become 
                        a professor of lying.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I appreciate that. Would you like 
                        to audit my masterclass?

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        That was truly impressive. “I love 
                        jazz bro, wait who are you? Oh me, 
                        I only listen to music from the 
                        1840s.”

                                 MATTHEW
                        You liked that, huh.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        You need help.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I need help refolding these 
                        hoodies.

           Jamie graciously helps Matthew refold hoodies.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - DUSK

           Matthew bikes home, finally letting himself smile.

           TITLE CARD: LURKER

           We see opening credits as he rides from La Brea to Downtown 
           Los Angeles. “Nameless” by Gesaffelstein plays.

           INT. GRANDMA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is at his laptop, scrolling through something, 
           riveted. We see posters of Oliver all over the walls. 
           Matthew’s GRANDMA comes into his room, holding a plate of 
           sliced fruit.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Eat, please. You like peaches.
           Matthew stares at his laptop, ignoring his grandmother’s 
           presence. She tries to feed Matthew a slice of peach with a 
           fork but he flinches away from it. She puts the plate down.

                                 GRANDMA (CONT'D)
                        Eat.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m good, thank you!

                                 GRANDMA
                             (desperately)
                        I have blueberries, too.

           We see Matthew’s screen. He’s scrolling through Oliver’s 
           Instagram account. Matthew opens up a new tab, this time of 
           Oliver’s Twitter account. He keeps scrolling, looks through 
           all of Oliver’s liked tweets in yet another tab. 

                                 GRANDMA (CONT'D)
                        I wish you would talk to me.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        I’m depressed.

           Grandma is not sure what to say. Matthew turns and glares at 
           her, hoping this will make her leave. After a few seconds, he 
           begrudgingly starts eating the sliced peaches, eyes still 
           laser-focused on the laptop. That is enough of a win for 
           Grandma, and she exits the room. 

           Juice DRIPS from Matthew’s lips. We see that he’s now 5 years 
           deep in Oliver’s Tumblr. Almost imperceptibly, we scroll past 
           an embedded YouTube video of the song Matthew played when 
           Oliver entered the store yesterday.

           Matthew starts putting together an outfit. He cycles through 
           several Oliver merch t-shirts before settling on a plain 
           white tee. He grabs an old point-and-shoot film camera and 
           throws it around his neck. 

           EXT. TOUR BUS - DUSK

           Matthew examines his own face in the selfie camera of his 
           phone, trying to hold an expression that looks cool and 
           casual. He walks up and knocks on the tour bus door. A 
           SECURITY GUY opens up and we see the expression Matthew 
           landed on: nervous attempt at nonchalance.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey, uh... I’m here to see Oliver. 
                        He asked me to come through.
           Security shrugs and lets him in. Matthew sees a whole 
           bearded, hirsute, heavily tattooed DEATH METAL BAND sitting 
           inside. They’re all sipping espressos.  

                                 METAL GUY
                        Didn’t your mother raise you to 
                        introduce yourself when you walk 
                        into a room?

           Awkward pause. Matthew’s fake expression dissolves once he 
           realizes he’s in the wrong place.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hi, I’m... Matthew.

                                 METAL GUY
                        Nice to meet you, Matthew. Would 
                        you like a biscotti?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Is there another show going on 
                        around here?

           EXT. OLIVER’S TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew looks down at his phone, then around at the block 
           he’s on, having located another tour bus. He puts on the same 
           expression of nonchalance that he just practiced, then knocks 
           on the door. SECURITY pops out.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey, I’m... is Oliver here?

                                 SECURITY
                        Name?

                                 MATTHEW
                        He... told me to come by. My name 
                        is Matthew.

                                 SECURITY
                        Hold on one second.

           He shuts the door.

                                 SECURITY (CONT'D)
                        Matthew?

                                 OLIVER
                        Little white boy?

                                 SECURITY
                        Ya.
                                 OLIVER
                        Sexy ass lips?

                                 SECURITY
                        Uhh.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yup, he’s good.

                                 SWETT
                        Give us one second and then let him 
                        in.

           SWETT, 20’s, starts taking his pants off, revealing his 
           underwear.

                                 SWETT (CONT'D)
                             (addressing everyone on 
                              bus with a loud whisper)
                        Ay-yo yo yo.

           Oliver and the rest of his crew - BOWEN, JESSE, NOAH, all 
           20’s - start taking their pants off, gleefully. 

                                 SWETT (CONT'D)
                             (whispering to Security)
                        Ok, go ahead.

           The security guy lets Matthew walk up and he sees: a bunch of 
           guys with their pants down acting like nothing weird is going 
           on. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey... 

                                 OLIVER
                        Ay wassup.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey.

                                 OLIVER
                        Say hi to the new kid, y’all. This 
                        is Matthew, he’s coming to the show 
                        tonight. My baby girl. My new 
                        boyfriend. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nice to meet you guys.

                                 SWETT
                        You just gonna stand there with 
                        your pants on?
                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh... 

                                 SWETT
                        Making us feel stupid as fuck, bro, 
                        looking like this. Making us feel 
                        nasty or something. You making this 
                        moment real awkward right now, 
                        bruh. And we just met you.

           Matthew cautiously starts taking his pants off. Suddenly, 
           everybody pretends to be appalled.

                                 EVERYBODY
                        Yooooo whoooa whoa.

                                 SWETT
                        You gay? The fuck? We don’t fuck 
                        with that gay shit around here.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh... I... 

                                 SWETT
                        You just gonna do whatever a bunch 
                        of random strangers on a bus tell 
                        you to do?

           Matthew starts putting his pants back on, laughing shakily. 

                                 SWETT (CONT'D)
                        Bro, I’m playing! Take them shits 
                        off, seriously. If you wanna come 
                        to the show, you gotta be fresh 
                        like us, bro. This the costume for 
                        all of squad tonight. Don’t be 
                        homophobic, we are not with the 
                        homophobic shit, bro. What era are 
                        you from?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ok.

           Matthew starts taking his pants off again.

                                 SWETT
                        Yo what the fuck, ay this kid is 
                        really gay as hell. Please stop! 
                        Spare us from the gay shit. Lord, 
                        please forgive him for this gay 
                        shit, for he know not what he do!
           Matthew has clocked the game they’re playing with him, 
           decides to double down by fully taking off his underwear as 
           well, thereby going one step further than everyone else.

                                 SWETT (CONT'D)
                        Nahhhhhhhhh--

           Everyone starts dying laughing, but they’re impressed. He has 
           somehow gained the support of everyone on the bus. He sits 
           down on the bench, pulling his underwear and pants back up 
           unceremoniously. 

           He notices the mounted bus TV. It’s playing the scene in 
           Belly where Nas sits down on DMX’s couch to watch Gummo on 
           the projector. Matthew watches Nas watching Gummo. On the 
           tour bus screen, DMX shakes his head and says, “Shit is 
           bugged out,” then he breaks a set of racked pool balls. 

                                 OLIVER
                        So... these are my friends.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nice to meet you all.

           Oliver walks around, slapping all of his friends sequentially 
           as he introduces them.

                                 OLIVER
                        Swett ugly ass. Jesse, my producer 
                        ugly as fuck. Bowen my, what do you 
                        do exactly? Anybody know what this 
                        man does? 

                                 SWETT
                        He cleans the nut off the floor 
                        every night.

                                 BOWEN
                        It’s a thankless job, but it is my 
                        honor and duty.

                                 SWETT
                        Salute.

                                 OLIVER
                        Bowen my useless ugly ass.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Good to meet you.

           Bowen salutes Matthew.
                                 OLIVER
                        Nah but for real, I can’t do shit 
                        without all these people here. I’m 
                        not shit without them.

                                 SWETT
                        Aw my baby, come here and let me 
                        eat that ass.

           Another knock on the bus door. It’s a CONCERNED FAN waiting 
           for the show. We hear him talk to the security guard.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Hey is there a girl named Maggie in 
                        here?

           A GIRL’s head emerges from under a blanket of the tour bus 
           bunk beds, hair frazzled. Swett steps out toward the front 
           door to address the fan.

           EXT. OLIVER’S TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Swett is standing on the stairs in the doorway, holding a bag 
           of sunflower seeds.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Holy shit. Hey.

                                 SWETT
                        You looking for somebody?

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                             (taken aback)
                        Yeah uh... my girlfriend. She said 
                        she was gonna get a picture but I 
                        haven’t heard from her in three 
                        hours.

                                 SWETT
                             (fake concerned)
                        Oh, I see. Heavens, you must be 
                        worried sick.

           Loud laughter emerges from the belly of the bus.

                        Do you know if she left her phone 
                        here or... if she said she was 
                        going somewhere to meet me?

                                 SWETT
                             (munching sunflower seeds)
                        Let me check on that for you, boss.

                        I’ll ask the staff. What’s her 
                        name?

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Maggie. Thank you, you’re my idol 
                        bro!

                                 SWETT
                        Not a problem, one second my man.

           INT. OLIVER’S TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Swett dips back into the bus to address the Fan’s girlfriend, 
           MAGGIE, who’s curled up in a bunk with Oliver now, 
           canoodling. 

                                 SWETT
                        Maggie?

           It’s obviously her, but she shakes her head, as in: Don’t 
           tell him I’m here. Oliver cuddles her and she giggles.

                                 OLIVER
                             (to Swett)
                        Tell him she’ll be back in 3-5 
                        business days.

                                 SWETT
                        Why I gotta tell him?

                                 OLIVER
                        I gotta do everything myself?

           Oliver jumps up and they both go together. Bowen leaps up too 
           and heads for the front of the bus. The three of them reach 
           the front, smiling conspiratorially.

           EXT. OLIVER'S TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver, Swett, and Bowen emerge again in the front door 
           stairway, sharing and shucking sunflower seeds casually.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Oh my God! Oliver!

           Oliver nods.

                                 OLIVER
                             (spitting a seed)
                        Sup, brah.
                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Um... Super excited for the show 
                        tonight!... 
                             (to Swett)
                        So was she in there? Or did anyone--

                                 BOWEN
                             (pointing inside)
                        --Yeah she in here, bro.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        Oh man, thank you!

           He tries to start walking onto the bus. Security steps in the 
           way. He looks to Oliver for support. Oliver ignores, spitting 
           a sunflower seed shell out onto the sidewalk.

                                 SWETT
                        She gon’ be out in about 40 minutes 
                        bruh. She’s good, though. She’s 
                        taken care of.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        What?

                                 BOWEN
                        She’s Allstate insured bro.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                        What? 

                                 SWETT
                        In good hands, bitch!

           Oliver breaks character and doubles over laughing. Fan is 
           suddenly horrified and desperate.

                                 CONCERNED FAN
                             (into the bus)
                        Maggie!

                                 SWETT
                             (seriously now)
                        Yo I said she’s good bruh.

           Fan makes a MAD DASH toward the open bus door, only to be 
           stopped by the security guard, who proceeds to beat the 
           LIVING SHIT out of him. Oliver is laughing hysterically now.

                                 OLIVER
                        Fucking fans, man. 

           Oliver, Swett, and Bowen all jump out of the bus onto the 
           sidewalk.
           Oliver grabs the Fan’s pen and signs his stunned face, then 
           walks out to the venue line with Swett and Bowen. They’re all 
           immediately swarmed by OTHER FANS. 

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        I know, I know. It’s really him. I 
                        can’t believe it either.

                                 ANOTHER FAN
                        Spit in my mouth!

           Oliver spits a sunflower seed shell into her mouth and she 
           screams with delight. He keeps walking through.

           INT. OLIVER’S TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew watches Oliver abandon him and disappear into a sea 
           of THRONGING FANS, through the bus window. NOAH, Oliver’s 
           main photographer/videographer, sits next to Matthew, 
           munching on chips. He hands the bag to Matthew without 
           looking at him. Matthew thinks he’s being offered a chip. He 
           goes for one.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thanks man--

                                 NOAH
                             (without looking up)
                        --Yo can you hold this for a 
                        second?

           Matthew contorts his hand to act like he wasn’t going for a 
           chip, re-routing it to accept the responsibility of holding 
           onto the bag. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh... sure, yeah.

           Matthew holds the half-empty chip bag awkwardly. He doesn’t 
           mind, he’s so in awe of even being on this bus. 

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        No problem, big bro.

           Noah gets up and walks away. Matthew is left alone with SHAI, 
           Oliver’s manager, who has emerged from the back of the bus. 
           She’s amused, just having witnessed all of Matthew’s social 
           fumbling with Noah. Matthew catches her sympathetic smile.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Hey uh... where’d... do you know 
                        where Oliver went?
                                 SHAI
                        Nope. He just does that sometimes.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What’s your name?

                                 SHAI
                        Shai. He’ll probably be back in 
                        about an hour or two. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        How do you know that?

                                 SHAI
                        You start to get a sense for these 
                        things... So where’d he find you 
                        at? 
                             (a little jab)
                        You win a Meet & Greet or 
                        something?

                                 MATTHEW 
                        Uh, I just work over at American 
                        Rag on La Brea, he told me to come 
                        by. See the show.

                                 SHAI
                        Oh that’s cool, that’s cool. A real 
                        person, huh. He’s getting 
                        experimental these days.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What do you mean?

           EXT. CONCERT VENUE LINE - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew walks through crowd with Shai. A TOUR MANAGER greets 
           Shai and hands her some passes. Shai fastens an artist 
           laminate around Matthew’s neck.

                                 SHAI
                        Just stick with me, you’ll be 
                        straight.

           FANS are staring Matthew down. Matthew refocuses his 
           attention on not falling behind Shai. He gets right up behind 
           her like a puppy dog.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thanks big sis! 

           Shai shakes her head and sighs.
                                 SHAI
                        Please don’t ever call me that.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I got you!

           INT. CONCERT VENUE - LATER

           Oliver performs. The CROWD SCREAMS. He oozes raw energy and 
           charisma as he flails about on stage, fully embodying his own 
           rockstar fantasy.

           INT. SIDE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Matthew is slack-jawed, watching the show from this intimate 
           vantage point. Shai is trying to suss out what Matthew is 
           about. She’s not threatened, but amused and curious.

                                 SHAI
                        So what are you trying to do? 
                        What’s your angle? Aspiring... 
                             (looks him up and down)
                        ... Instagram user?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I don’t know. I don’t have an 
                        angle.

                                 SHAI
                        Just wanna be with the cool kids, 
                        huh.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah... What?

                                 SHAI
                        But seriously. You should figure 
                        that out. My advice is: make 
                        yourself useful... before you 
                        become boring.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What do you mean?

           It’s clear now that Shai knows Matthew’s secret. She can spot 
           a fan from a mile away. She sees right through him, but it 
           doesn’t matter to her either way. 

                                 SHAI
                        Me and Ollie grew up together. 
                        Thought it’d be sick being a team, 
                        managing my best friend.

                             (beat)
                        These days, we don’t even hang out 
                        at all outside of like, shows and 
                        meetings. When he looks at me, all 
                        he sees is contracts and call 
                        times... sound checks... shit he 
                        doesn’t want to do... work shit. 
                        But I suspect if I wasn’t work, I’d 
                        be nothing at all by now.

           Pause. Matthew doesn’t get it, he’s just so happy to be here, 
           staring out onto the stage. He looks back at Shai, still wide-
           eyed.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo thank you. Wow, you’re for real 
                        like a big inspiration to me. 
                        You’re like my mentor.

                                 SHAI
                        Jesus Christ.

           RAUCOUS APPLAUSE. The show ends. Oliver comes back from 
           performing on stage.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’d you think?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Super sick, you killed it man.

                                 OLIVER
                        But musically? You fuck with it?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh yeah, I mean. Yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s it?

           Matthew scrambles to elaborate as though he’s hearing it for 
           the first time and the gears are turning.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh... I’m still processing you 
                        know... but I definitely heard the 
                        influences. It was like a modern 
                        day version of Innervisions...mixed 
                        with like, Yeezus-era Kanye.

                                 OLIVER
                        Bro, you don’t understand how much 
                        that means to me, to hear.
                                 SHAI
                             (under her breath)
                        Oh, I think he does.

                                 OLIVER
                        You riding back with us?

                                 MATTHEW
                        To where?

                                 OLIVER
                        The Glass House.

           INT. OLIVER’S TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           They ride home on the tour bus. Matthew gets settled in one 
           of the bunk beds, across from Maggie, with whom he makes 
           awkward eye contact. He closes the curtain and looks at his 
           phone, starts scrolling through Oliver’s Instagram. Swett 
           rips open the curtain and whispers aggressively.

                                 SWETT
                        Psst... yo.

                                 MATTHEW
                        ... yo, what’s up?

                                 SWETT
                        You suck dick?

           Swett points at the crotch of his pants.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Huh?

                                 SWETT
                        You suck dick? I really need to get 
                        my shit topped right now. Been on 
                        the road for too long. Can you take 
                        care of me real quick?

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I got you.

           Calling Swett’s bluff, Matthew grabs at Swett’s pants and 
           starts unzipping them. Swett jumps back, genuinely surprised.

                                 SWETT
                        Yo, stopppp what the fuck, gay ass.
                                 MATTHEW
                             (taunting)
                        It’s ok to ask for what you want. I 
                        get it. You don’t have to be shy.

                                 SWETT
                        Yo this kid just tried to touch my 
                        dick!

                                 A VOICE (O.S.)
                        Swett shut the fuck up!

                                 SWETT
                        Ay fuck you!

           Swett bolts off toward whoever said that. Matthew smiles to 
           himself as the bus rocks him back and forth like a boat.

           PRE-LAP: “The D. Elkan” by Hella.

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER

           They arrive back at the house. They push each other out of 
           the way playfully as they file out of the bus. Bowen gets 
           knocked to the ground, but he gets up and wrestles with Noah. 
           Camaraderie is in the air, like a baseball team high off 
           victory. Matthew is wrapped up in this energy, looking around 
           with a grin: am I a part of this?

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           We see Oliver’s house through Matthew’s wide-eyed curiosity. 
           We pan around a nice, two-story house. It looks like a 
           teenager’s parents left him home alone for a summer with 
           their credit card. 

           END MUSIC.

                                 OLIVER
                        So this is where I live and I let 
                        everyone eat my food and shit in my 
                        toilet. I got people working on 
                        shit in here too, I like to keep it 
                        all close, in house. Music, merch, 
                        videos, graphics, everything with 
                        my name on it comes out of this 
                        address.

           There’s Postmates trash everywhere.

                                 MATTHEW
                        So you choose to live like this?
                                 OLIVER
                        Absolutely.

           There’s a WHITE KID half-asleep on one of the couches. Oliver 
           doesn’t introduce or acknowledge him.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey what’s up, I’m Matthew.

                                 WHITE KID
                        Hey... uh... I... 

           Oliver bounds up the stairs, Matthew follows. They go 
           upstairs to Oliver’s bedroom.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew and Oliver in Oliver’s master bedroom. There are 
           toys, crafts, designer clothes strewn about like dirty 
           laundry. There’s a brief silence as the pair finds themselves 
           alone for the first time.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I fuck with these bedsheets. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah? I had them made in an all-
                        white sweat shop.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh, sick. What’s the thread count 
                        on the--

                                 OLIVER
                             (cutting him off)
                        --We’re about to have a house 
                        meeting, you can just chill in here 
                        for a bit.

           Oliver goes downstairs. 

           “Wall of Memories” by Gesaffelstein plays. 

           Matthew looks around at Oliver’s walls. We see a poster of 
           Michael Jackson. Then a poster of Steve Jobs. Then a poster 
           of Kanye West. Then a poster of Britney Spears. Then a poster 
           of Jesus. Then a poster of Kim Jong-Un.
           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           House meeting is in session. Everyone is at attention, 
           sitting in a circle on couches and floor space, serious for 
           just this moment. One of the crew who we haven’t seen until 
           now, PHOTO ASSISTANT, is looking stressed out. Oliver looks 
           on with quiet authority.

                                 PHOTO ASSISTANT
                        Ollie?

                                 OLIVER
                        What? Don’t look at me.

                                 SWETT
                        He not gonna save you.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew watches through the bedroom window as the Photo 
           Assistant gets escorted from the premises, having been kicked 
           out of the group. Shai tries to take the camera from him, but 
           he smashes it on the ground. An Uber arrives that Shai 
           ostensibly called. Shai guides the crying, pathetic-looking 
           kid into the car.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Oliver gets back up to the room. Tries to lighten the mood.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo.

           Matthew takes out AirPods that he wasn’t wearing earlier, 
           pretends to be ignorant of what was going on downstairs.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey.

                                 OLIVER
                        Shit is crazy. Running this shit is 
                        like... some Wolf Of Wall Street 
                        shit. Got all my dumbass friends in 
                        here and I gotta make them pass as 
                        professionals... 

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo, I just wanna say, this night 
                        has been super eye-opening for me.

                        I feel like I’ve known you guys my 
                        whole life.

                                 OLIVER
                        Really?

                                 MATTHEW
                        You guys have already inspired me 
                        so much, just to be creative and 
                        not be afraid of being myself. I 
                        feel like I met you guys for a 
                        reason.

                                 OLIVER
                        Wow, that’s crazy. Yeah, I never 
                        know if I’m really reaching people 
                        the way I want. But you’re living 
                        proof that I’m getting through to 
                        y’all. I’m not special, I just 
                        believed in myself enough when 
                        nobody was fucking with me and I 
                        was just the weird kid in school.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I think you’re gonna be the biggest 
                        artist in the world.

           Oliver grins.

                                 OLIVER
                        They don’t see that, though. They 
                        just see this moment like we 
                        already made it. But now’s when the 
                        actual work starts. 

           A pause. Oliver notices the film point-and-shoot around 
           Matthew’s neck.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        You got a camera that does video?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        What kind?

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s uh... Canon... uh... 

                                 OLIVER
                        --Doesn’t matter. You know how to 
                        press record?
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        We need someone to just shoot 
                        everything me and the crew are 
                        doing. I wanna put together a 
                        documentary for when my next album 
                        drops. Sell physicals with a 
                        digital download of the album so it 
                        counts toward sales. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I can do that.

                                 OLIVER
                        Good, yeah you’re gonna kill it. Or 
                        it’s gonna suck and no one’s gonna 
                        care.

           Pause.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        You have like... fly on the wall 
                        vibes, or something. We might 
                        forget you’re even around, filming 
                        shit. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah... yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        You probably don’t know this but 
                        this is like, a huge opportunity. A 
                        lot of kids would kill their mom to 
                        be in your position right now.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I bet. I don’t know much 
                        about--

                                 OLIVER
                        You’ll be good. We live in a time 
                        where you don’t have to be just one 
                        thing. Like forty years ago or 
                        whatever if you’re an artist, you 
                        focused on one thing cause you had 
                        to. You had to really learn the 
                        tools for that shit. You play the 
                        piano, cool, that’s you. You are a 
                        piano player. You paint, that’s it, 
                        you’re a painter. But now, 
                        everything can be done on the same 
                        device, in your room.

                        you need is taste and I know you

                                 MATTHEW
                        ... Yeah. Damn, that’s crazy.

                                 OLIVER
                        Look, I don’t know if you heard 
                        what was going on downstairs.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Not really.

                                 OLIVER
                        Basically, we had to let somebody 
                        go. But it’s nothing for you to 
                        worry about. He was on his way out, 
                        anyway. The thing is, I have to run 
                        this a certain way, because 
                        otherwise there won’t be any 
                        Oliver, and then there won’t be a 
                        career for any of us. It sucks 
                        because these are my friends, but 
                        it’s also a business, which I guess 
                        they forget because I’m such a 
                        sweetheart all the time. So you 
                        gotta cut off the dead weight 
                        sometimes. Snakes in the grass, 
                        gotta mow the lawn... For the team, 
                        you know? But again, you don’t have 
                        to worry about that.

           Shai comes in, shaking her head.

                        Yo.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo. Can you set Matthew up? He’s 
                        gonna be helping out with shit.

           EXT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - LATER

           Shai has called an Uber for Matthew. They’re waiting outside 
           on the sidewalk for it. Shai looks Matthew up and down, 
           really starting to size him up now. 
                                 SHAI
                        Happy for you.

           Shai’s words should feel somewhat ambiguous, but Matthew 
           takes it at face value: he’s on cloud nine. The Uber arrives 
           and takes Matthew home.

           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is eating sliced kiwis, desperately thinking about 
           what to text Oliver. Grandma brings in some more, he smiles 
           at her. She’s so happy that he’s happy. 

                                 GRANDMA
                        Good boy.

           To Oliver, he starts typing: “Hey man, yesterday was super 
           sick. You’re like a big brother to me. Or my dad lol. I’d 
           love to hang out again if you’re down. Feel like I’ve never 
           met somebody real as you. No homo lol. I’ve got ideas for the 
           doc. When did you wanna start?”

           He deletes that whole composition.

           He starts again with “hey daddy i miss you”

           He deletes again, shaking his head. He lands on “wyd.” He 
           deletes again. Puts his phone down.

           Pause. 

           He gets a text from Shai: “wya” immediately followed by 
           another: “come to the crib.”

           Matthew frantically gets ready, getting dressed and picking 
           up his keys, phone, wallet, then heads for the door. On his 
           way out, he sees his grandma’s old camcorder, looks around, 
           and grabs it.

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATE MORNING

           Matthew gets to Oliver’s house, super excited for his first 
           day on the job. He pulls out his phone and examines his face 
           in his front-facing camera, tries out some angles and tries 
           to hold a nonchalant facial expression. He relaxes his 
           shoulders, adjusts his posture to more of a slouch.
           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Matthew gets to the house, but nobody is there except Bowen 
           and Swett playing Call Of Duty on a XBox One, over in the 
           living room. This isn’t how his first day looked in his head 
           (an Instagrammable room full of cool kids with Matthew in the 
           middle laughing at an inside joke). Nothing is affirming his 
           existence or the significance of him being here. He stands 
           around for a second, looking around for acknowledgement.  

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew steps in, awkwardly. He is so desperate to be 
           acknowledged but knows he has to play it cool, like he 
           belongs here.

                                 BOWEN
                        Bro I will mash you.

                                 SWETT
                        You are not good at this game.

                                 BOWEN
                        Actually, it is you who is not good 
                        at this game!

                                 SWETT
                        I will beat you.

                                 BOWEN 
                        It is I who will beat you!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Err... Hey, what’s up guys.

                                 SWETT
                        Wassup. You back.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Is Ollie here?

                                 BOWEN
                        Ollie? Nah.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can I get next?

           No one responds, they’re engrossed in the game. 

                                 SWETT
                        Oooh, I’m bout to fuckin... get in 
                        that ass!
                                 BOWEN
                        Nope. You are trash. Get. Off. My. 
                        Dick.

           Swett yelps as he loses the game. Bowen stands up and bows. 
           Matthew walks down the hallway to Noah’s editing room.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, EDITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew enters. Noah doesn’t look up.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey.

                                 NOAH
                        Hey, what’s up.

                                 MATTHEW
                        So Oliver told me I’d be helping 
                        out with the doc. 

                                 NOAH
                        Mm. That’s dope.

           Pause. Matthew looks around for a bit, as Noah works, chewing 
           a granola bar.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Is there anything I can help with?

                                 NOAH
                        Do you know Adobe Premiere?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Not really.

                                 NOAH
                        Then not really.

           Ouch.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I mean, I can learn.

           Brutal silence.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna go get some water, you 
                        want anything?

                                 NOAH
                        I’m good bro.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Aight, big bro. 

           Matthew walks back to the living room, aimlessly.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew sits down awkwardly next to Swett and Bowen, stares 
           at his phone for a bit. He pulls out his camcorder slowly, 
           unsure if he should say anything, then starts recording them.

                                 SWETT
                        Yo what the fuck are you doing, put 
                        that away.

                                 BOWEN
                        Bro are you filming us like a tour 
                        thot? What the fuck is wrong with 
                        you?

           Matthew puts the camcorder down.

                                 SWETT
                        We’re not zoo animals, Matthew, 
                        we’re real people.

                                 BOWEN
                        I haven’t even put my make-up on 
                        yet.

                                 SWETT
                        I’m not a fucking... marsupial.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, I’m s’posed to be shooting--

           Shai walks in.

                                 SHAI
                        --Yo!

                                 MATTHEW
                             (relieved)
                        Hey!

                                 SHAI
                        You ready to work?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yes, absolutely. I brought my 
                        camera and--
           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew washes beyond disgusting dishes. He scrubs with 
           purpose, but then continues to scrub a bowl intensely long 
           after it’s been cleaned. 

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew sits next to Swett and Bowen, awaiting further 
           instructions. They’re watching a movie now.

                                 BOWEN
                        This is the part. That old ass man 
                        is about to jump off the cliff.

                                 SWETT
                        Oh my God, I can’t watch this.

           We hear the SPLAT of impact. Swett and Bowen cringe. 

                                 BOWEN
                        Wait now watch the lady, her face 
                        is gonna explode on impact.

                                 SWETT
                        Matty, you seen this shit?

                                 MATTHEW
                             (sullen)
                        Nah.

                                 BOWEN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 SWETT
                             (facetious)
                        Damn, you bored with us, already? 
                        You don’t fuck with us? You 
                        switched up, bruh, wowwwww.

                                 MATTHEW
                        No I do, it’s just... 

                                 BOWEN
                        What is it, my liege?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Do you know when Oliver will be 
                        back?

                                 SWETT
                        Oh you only talk to bosses now. Big 
                        boy shit, huh. I get it.

                        me just get back in my lane.  

                                 BOWEN
                        Damn bruh, cold world.

                                 SWETT
                             (to Bowen)
                        Yo, you know Matthew... 
                             (to Matthew)
                        What’s your last name?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Morning.

                                 SWETT
                             (to Bowen)
                        Yo you know Matt Morning? I used to 
                        kick it with him before he like, 
                        blew up for real.

                                 BOWEN
                        You’re lying. Stop playing. Don’t 
                        flex for me.

                                 SWETT
                        Nah, I’m dead serious. He was just 
                        this sweet little boy on the bus. 
                        Now he act like he don’t know 
                        nobody.

                                 BOWEN
                        That’s a damn shame. They always do 
                        that man, forget about their day 
                        ones.

           CLOSE ON Matthew trying to smile through the humiliation.

                                 BOWEN (CONT'D)
                             (tapping Swett’s shoulder)
                        Oooooh, this the part!

           WE HEAR the impact of a somebody’s face exploding on impact 
           from the television.

                           BOWEN (CONT'D)
                                                          SWETT
           Ewwwwwww.
                                              God damnit, this is nasty.

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Matthew picks up trash off the floor and puts it into trash 
           bags.
           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATER

           Matthew does everyone’s laundry. We see tattered hoodies and 
           delicate designer clothing all thrown together. Matthew 
           examines his own basic skater kid outfit: too boring? 

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Swett is playing Grand Theft Auto while Bowen watches. 
           Matthew sits down next to them, exhausted, awaiting further 
           instructions.

                                 SWETT
                        I am... sweaty as a bitch!

                                 BOWEN
                        Me too.

                                 SWETT
                        Watch this.

                                 BOWEN
                        Damn, you did something there.

           Oliver finally gets back, with his fashionable friend, 
           SEBASTIAN. Matthew straightens up. So do Swett and Bowen a 
           little bit. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Listen, if anyone is gonna convert 
                        to Judaism it’s gonna be me. I got 
                        good ass credit.

           Oliver walks through living room.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey man, you’re back!

                                 OLIVER
                        Oh... hey. You’re here!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah!

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s cool, man.

           Oliver keeps walking by, grabs something from upstairs, then 
           comes down and puts a cool jacket on, heading back out.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey uh... where you headed?
           Oliver doesn’t stop moving.

                                 OLIVER
                        The mall. 

           He leaves. Shai clocks Matthew’s desire to glom onto Oliver.

                                 SHAI
                        Yo.

            She points out the trash bags Matthew was filling earlier.

                                 SHAI (CONT'D)
                        Yo. Can you grab those, big homie.

           EXT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Matthew takes out the bags of trash. He sees, in the middle 
           of the residential street, two adjacent cars. Oliver is at 
           the wheel of one, a BMW M3, while his friend Sebastian is at 
           the other, a Tesla Model X. They’re about to race.

           INT. OLIVER’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver screams out of the window.

                                 OLIVER
                        You ain’t shit, you don’t want the 
                        smoke! Flop! Pussy!

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Sebastian puts one hand out the window and talks with it like 
           a sock puppet.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        All that talk. 

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver calls out from his car.

                                 OLIVER
                        Five! Four! Three! Two...

           “Orck” by Gesaffelstein plays.

           Matthew watches from the trash cans as the two giggly racers 
           hurtle down the street. 
           He feels extremely left out of the fun. He goes back inside, 
           we can sense the gears are turning inside his head.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew, seeing Shai in the living room with Swett and Bowen, 
           grabs one more trash bag to bring outside, then 
           surreptitiously grabs something else that we don’t see.

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew tosses a conspicuously light bag of trash in the 
           trash can... 

           INT. OLIVER'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

                                 OLIVER
                        Watch this.

           Oliver steps on the gas and gleefully LURCHES toward the end 
           of the cul de sac, then SCREECHES to a halt. Adeptly, he 
           shifts into first gear then slowly ACCELERATES INTO A 
           GRACEFUL DONUT. He continues to circle around, doing donuts.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Can your iPad bucket do this?

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        That was cute, I guess.

           Sebastian presses a button and the falcon wing doors come up 
           on his Tesla Model X. Then starts closing and opening them as 
           though the car is flapping its wings.

           INT. OLIVER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver, still doing donuts, screams out of his window.

                                 OLIVER
                        You made it clap for me, thank you! 
           EXT. SEBASTIAN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        How many more you gonna do? We get 
                        it. Aren’t you dizzy? Give it a 
                        rest.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, once I’m done spelling out 
                        how many zeros in my bank account.

           Sebastian looks at the skid marks on the pavement. It looks 
           like one big circle that’s been left on the pavement by 
           Oliver’s tires.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        One?

                                 OLIVER
                        Ay shut the fuck up.

           Oliver’s car KNOCKS over the neighbor’s trash and recycling 
           bins and drives back over to the front of his house. We see 
           the NEIGHBOR, an older white man, open his front door to 
           scold them, but Oliver’s engine renders it inaudible. Oliver 
           floors it back over to his own driveway, Sebastian follows in 
           the Tesla. As they get closer, we see Matthew has been 
           filming all this on his camcorder.

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Matthew, not sure if it was alright to be documenting all of 
           that, starts awkwardly lowering the camera, with nowhere to 
           put it, as Oliver and Sebastian get out of their cars and 
           approach. They get closer and Matthew freezes up, he’s braced 
           for humiliation and banishment.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Heyyy.

                                 OLIVER
                        Ohh shit, wait you got all that?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        Lemme see!
           Matthew shows Oliver and Sebastian on the tiny camcorder 
           screen what he captured. It looks objectively cool. We see 
           what they’re seeing: Oliver screaming from inside of the BMW 
           and leaving donut skid marks on the street.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Ohhhh shit, this is so hard.

                                 OLIVER
                        Bro this look crazy. I need this. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You should put this in your next 
                        video.

                                 OLIVER
                        Bro, this is the video right here.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You snapped for real. Went stupid. 
                        Shitted on ‘em.

           Pause as Sebastian opens the opportunity to be introduced.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo this is Matty, he’s my shooter. 
                        My documentarian.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (to Matthew)
                        Yo will you do my video?

                                 OLIVER
                        Woah woah, chill. I got a patent 
                        pending on this one. Get your own 
                        little boy. I got him signed to a 
                        360 deal. A 900, Tony Hawk deal. I 
                        got this kid’s soul.
                             (to Matthew)
                        Yo send me this.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew sits on the couch next to Bowen and Swett, uploading 
           footage from the camcorder onto a laptop.

                                 SWETT
                        Ay, you want next?

           Though stunned by the gesture, Matthew keeps his cool as 
           Swett hands over a controller.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

                                 BOWEN
                        You better not be fye at this.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew is beating Bowen handily.

                                 BOWEN
                        Jesus Christ man, get the fuck out 
                        of here with this. Did you have a 
                        fucking... Xbox tutor growing up? 
                        These fucking hyper-competitive 
                        parents, man.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (grinning)
                        Nope.

                                 BOWEN
                        You trained with a sensei. You were 
                        raised by controllers.

           Swett is dying laughing.

                                 SWETT
                        Bruh, I never seen you this mad. Oh 
                        my God.

           Matthew looks relaxed for the first time, he feels like he’s 
           one of the boys. Noah emerges from his room and approaches 
           them.

                                 NOAH
                        Yo.

           Matthew nods back super casually, but remains focused on the 
           game.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ayo.

                                 NOAH
                             (pointing to the laptop)
                        What’s this?

                                 MATTHEW
                             (sincere)
                        It’s Ollie doing donuts outside. 
                        Looks fucking sick, right. He wants 
                        to use it for his next video.
                                 NOAH
                        He said that?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, he and Sebastian.

                                 NOAH
                        Seb was here?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I was so scared to meet him 
                        at first. He’s actually super chill 
                        though. Like down to earth, for 
                        real.

                                 NOAH
                        Can I see it.

           Matthew is in the middle of the game, but looks up and sees 
           Noah's face, realizing this isn’t the time to protest. He 
           puts the controller down.

                                 SWETT
                             (to Bowen)
                        Saved your ass.

                                 BOWEN
                        Shut the fuck up.

           Matthew shows the footage to Noah gleefully. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        So sick, right?

                                 NOAH
                        Can you put this on a flash drive 
                        for me.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, Ollie told me to send it to 
                        him.

           Pause: that was a mistake.

                                 NOAH
                        Who you think he’s gonna give it 
                        to? Dude, he’s gonna forget about 
                        this in two seconds. I do all of 
                        his visuals. If I didn’t, nothing 
                        would ever come out. Trust me, he’s 
                        like a dog sniffing everything on 
                        the street. He doesn’t remember 
                        anything except whatever he’s 
                        currently sniffing.

                        desktop right now. 

           Matthew realizes he can’t be possessive of the footage, that 
           he is outranked and doesn’t want things to get acrimonious. 
           He relents. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Okay. 

                                 NOAH
                             (calculated)
                        Look... We’re gonna work together 
                        on this. And I’ll teach you 
                        everything, okay. Alright, lil bro?

           Matthew’s face brightens. He naively accepts Noah’s offering 
           of mentorship.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Aight.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, NOAH’S EDITING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Two desktop screens show Matthew’s footage and a video 
           editing software interface. Matthew sits on the bed behind 
           Noah’s chair.

                                 NOAH
                        Aight, you can go home for the 
                        night.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ok, thanks.

           His camcorder is still plugged into Noah’s computer.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Can I grab my camera?

                                 NOAH
                        You’re only gonna be shooting stuff 
                        when you’re with us, just keep it 
                        here. This is like your office now. 
                        You’re my sous-chef.

           Matthew is afraid to object, knows he needs to pick his 
           battles. He’s satisfied with the impression he made today and 
           the position he seems to have solidified.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ok cool! So I can be here whenever 
                        tomorrow morning.
                                 NOAH
                             (thinking quickly)
                        Actually, why don’t you take 
                        tomorrow off? I know it’s been 
                        hectic around here and I’m not 
                        gonna need much help tomorrow. 
                        You’ll just be standing around.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I don’t mind, I just like being 
                        around you guys, honestly. You’re 
                        like my big brothers.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah man, and we appreciate your 
                        help... But nah, just come back in 
                        a couple days and I’ll have some 
                        work for you.

           Matthew, accepting that he shouldn’t press the issue further, 
           heads out through the living room.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Swett and Bowen are curled up on the couch. 

                                 SWETT
                        Later, man.

                                 BOWEN
                        Love you.

                                 MATTHEW
                        See y’all.

           He daps them and exits.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT

           Matthew bikes home alone on various streets, exhausted but in 
           a satisfying way. He’s brimming with validation, feeling 
           affirmed and happy: this is who I was always supposed to be. 

           INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew finds Grandma asleep, kisses her, and finds a plate 
           of fruit that’s been left for him. He eats it and flops 
           himself onto the bed to scroll Instagram. He sees Oliver, 
           Swett, Bowen, Shai have all followed him. He smiles.
           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is having a great time at home with Grandma, playing 
           music. He hugs her and they slow dance, it’s genuinely cute. 
           Matthew gets a FaceTime - it’s Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo where you at?

           Matthew goes into his room to take the call.

           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew closes the door behind him.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What you mean, I’m at home.

                                 OLIVER
                        We’re shooting my music video bro, 
                        I was gonna put your pretty face in 
                        it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Bro what? I didn’t know. No one 
                        told me it was today. Yo, I can 
                        come right now.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s cool, we’re probably gonna be 
                        done soon.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah I’ll pull up right now bro, 
                        I’ll hop in the whip and Andretti 
                        that shit.

                                 GRANDMA (O.S.)
                        Matthew, apple!

                                 OLIVER
                        I think your Grandma needs you, 
                        bro.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can you text me the address? I’m on 
                        my way.

                                 OLIVER
                        Uhh... yeah.
                             (to Shai)
                        Ay text Matty the address.
                                 GRANDMA
                        Matthew, apple!

           Matthew rushes out the door.

           EXT. PETTING ZOO - SUNSET

           Matthew frantically arrives in an Uber. Swett, Bowen, Noah - 
           everyone’s chilling, scattered around, done for the day. No 
           one really notices Matthew. He missed everything. It’s 
           devastating. This could’ve been his chance. He walks up to 
           Oliver.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey man.

                                 OLIVER
                        My boy.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You’re done shooting, huh.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah man. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Fuck.

                                 OLIVER
                             (being fake)
                        Yo, it’s all good, you’re doing 
                        great. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Fuck, man. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Don’t even trip, we’re gonna have 
                        another shoot day tomorrow, get 
                        some more footage.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Okay.

           Oliver lights a cigarette and inhales.

                                 OLIVER
                        You do want this though, right?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I mean... I guess.
                                 OLIVER
                        You guess? I mean, it’s cool if you 
                        don’t really want this, like I get 
                        it. That’s fine, I know you weren’t 
                        like a fan or whatever. If you 
                        don’t care about being here... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        No it’s not like that. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Okay, I got you. So you do want 
                        this.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                             (abruptly serious)
                        Say it, then.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (earnest)
                        I want this.

           Oliver laughs unexpectedly. Matthew’s earnestness cracked him 
           up.

                                 OLIVER
                        Why? Why do you want it?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Because I like feeling like I’m a 
                        part of something.

           Oliver exhales smoke through a smile.

                                 OLIVER
                        Good answer.

           Oliver steps on his cigarette butt. Matthew is left sullen, 
           staring down at the cigarette butt in shame. He gathers 
           himself and looks up with a new determination: he needs to 
           tighten up. And he’s done pretending this isn’t important to 
           him.

           EXT. OLIVER’S NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE, ALLEY - NIGHT

           “Obsession” by Gesaffelstein plays.

           Matthew sets up a makeshift bedroom in the neighbor’s alley, 
           next to the neighbor’s backyard. We watch him roll out a 
           sleeping bag and shake it out. 
           We see him arrange water, a flashlight, binoculars, and some 
           other essentials like he’s camping under the stars. He’s 
           meticulous and organized. 

           He sets up his laptop and watches Adobe Premiere YouTube 
           tutorials for hours. Matthew looks at his phone, he has a 
           text from Jamie: “yo can you cover my shift tomorrow?” 

           Matthew texts a response: “Nah sorry.” 

           He follows that with another text: “also I’m quitting.” 

           Matthew gets into the sleeping bag, stares at the sky with 
           intensity and determination, thinking: I will not show up 
           late to anything ever again, and I won’t let Noah dupe me 
           ever again. 

           EXT. OLIVER’S NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Matthew gets up, changes clothes, packs all his stuff up in 
           an orderly fashion, then hides it behind a shed. He gathers 
           himself, dusts himself off, and walks over to Oliver’s. 

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew washes the dishes gleefully.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew picks up trash, there’s not much. He’s just trying to 
           appear busy. Shai arrives. Swett and Bowen start to filter 
           in, ready for the shoot day. Noah arrives, holding bags of 
           equipment.

                                 MATTHEW 
                        Yo let me get that for you.

           Noah smiles, thinking: Good, Matthew seems to know his place 
           now. He then happily unloads his bags into Matthew’s open 
           arms. Oliver comes down from his bedroom in pajamas.

                                 OLIVER
                        Give me like an hour, I need to get 
                        fresh... and do my full skincare 
                        routine.
           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, EDITING ROOM - 30 MINUTES LATER

           Matthew is helping Noah do stuff in Premiere. We see 
           Matthew’s camcorder on the desk. It hasn’t moved since he was 
           last here.

                                 NOAH
                             (genuinely)
                        So you are actually useful?

           Matthew shrugs. They’re getting along.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m a fast learner. 

                                 NOAH
                        Okay, can you blur out his mouth 
                        all the times where he says “fuck” 
                        in this file?

           We see that it’s five hours of footage on the monitor.

                                 MATTHEW
                        On it.

                                 NOAH
                        I hope you don’t mind, I know it’s 
                        tedious.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, I’m just happy to be helpful. 
                        You guys are like my idols.

                                 NOAH
                             (sincere)
                        Aight, lil bro.

           Matthew smiles at the moniker, gets to work. Noah leaves the 
           room to go play video games with Swett and Bowen. We see the 
           back of Matthew's head at the workstation, rack focus on 
           Noah's bags of equipment piled on the bed.

           EXT. VIDEO SHOOT AT PETTING ZOO - DAY TWO, AFTERNOON

           Matthew is carrying all of Noah’s bags, following him around 
           as they set up a tripod with Noah’s DSLR camera and get 
           performance shots of Oliver next to various goats and sheep. 

           EXT. VIDEO SHOOT AT PETTING ZOO - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew grabs stuff for Noah and hands it to him. Noah sets 
           up the shot. It’s Oliver petting a sheep.
                                 NOAH
                        That’s golden.

           They walk around for another shot. Matthew follows Noah like 
           a caddy, overwhelmed by the weight of the equipment. As they 
           set up the new shot, Noah’s DSLR indicates that his battery 
           is now dead.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        Grab me another battery. They’re in 
                        the blue bag.

           Matthew unzips the blue bag and fiddles around inside.

                                 MATTHEW
                        This bag?

                                 NOAH
                             (without looking)
                        Yeah, in a Ziploc. There should be 
                        six of them.

           Matthew keeps searching, perfunctorily. Noah turns around, 
           finally.

                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        I gotta do this shit myself?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Are you sure it’s in this one?

           Matthew reaches for another bag, while Noah impatiently grabs 
           at the blue one.

                                 NOAH
                        Yes, where the fuck is it?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Dude, I don’t... 

           Noah empties out the blue bag, shaking it out, then starts 
           searching the other bags. He gives Matthew the death stare. 
           Oliver is getting bored.

                                 OLIVER
                             (pointing at a sheep)
                        Yo, this moose about to shit on me.

                                 NOAH
                        I can’t shoot anything without a 
                        battery. Where did you put it?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I just opened the bag just now.
                                 OLIVER
                        It’s your shit, Noah. Don’t press 
                        Matty about it.

           Oliver is dancing sensually on the sheep now to amuse 
           himself.

                                 NOAH
                        We gotta just come back tomorrow, I 
                        guess. This is fucking trash, I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 MATTHEW
                        We could try using this? 

           Matthew pulls out his camcorder to Noah’s unpleasant 
           surprise: When did he take that back?

                                 OLIVER
                        Damn you had this shit the whole 
                        time?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I didn’t want to get in the 
                        way or anything. I figured we were 
                        sticking to using real cameras for 
                        this.

                                 NOAH
                             (fuming)
                        We can’t just shoot half on a DSLR 
                        and the other half on a fucking... 
                        home video.

                                 OLIVER
                        Well, it’s not like we can do 
                        anything else right now. You wanna 
                        go home? We can go home.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What if, like, we shot with this 
                        camera from the perspective of the 
                        sheep?

                                 NOAH
                        What?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Like we strap it on the sheep so 
                        it’s like we’re seeing Ollie 
                        through its eyes.

           Noah looks at Oliver, hoping he’ll say how stupid of an idea 
           it is. 
           EXT. ANIMAL FARM - MOMENTS LATER

           We see Oliver perform his parts of the music video from the 
           sheep’s perspective, through the camcorder, then we fall and 
           tumble to the ground. The makeshift strap they’ve used to 
           fasten the camcorder to the sheep has fallen loose, but 
           Oliver is laughing, very amused.

                                 OLIVER
                        Lemme see.

           Oliver, Noah, and Matthew look at the footage.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        This is fucking genius.
                             (to the others)
                        Ay! Come look at this shit!

           Swett, Bowen, and Shai come over and huddle the tiny 
           camcorder screen, ooh-ing and ah-ing.

                                 SWETT
                        Damn, this is some like, Spike 
                        Jonze shit. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Matty went crazy. Yo Matty, you are 
                        on some other shit, you need to be 
                        doing all my visuals. This is so 
                        hard. Oh my God bro, we put this 
                        with the shit you got of me doing 
                        donuts. That juxtaposition is... 
                        phew, this shit about to be next 
                        level, bruh. No one is doing shit 
                        like me, this shit too easy.

           Close on Noah’s face, aghast. Close on Matthew's face, just 
           barely containing a grin.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Yo. Strap it back on again. Put the 
                        strap-on back on. Or, nah nah, put 
                        it on that one.

           Matthew fastens the camcorder on a goat this time, and 
           presses the record button.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Aight, yo yo, get in the shot.

           We see Oliver record another take of his music video 
           performance, arm around Matthew's shoulder, jumping up and 
           down. Noah is standing around, looking awkward with nothing 
           to do. The camera starts falling off again.
                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                             (to Noah)
                        Yo can you just... like hold it 
                        right there?

           Oliver hands Noah the camcorder, forcing him to get down on 
           his hands and knees in the dirt to simulate shooting from the 
           goat’s eye-level.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Nah, it gotta be like, over the 
                        shoulder, the sheep shoulder.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (smug)
                        There should be some of the sheep 
                        fluff in the foreground, like 
                        blurry.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, we gotta feel the sheep 
                        vibes. Like we’re one of the herd. 
                        And I’m the shepherd.

           Noah tries to hold the sheep in place with one hand while 
           keeping the camcorder steady on the sheep’s neck, totally 
           humiliated. 

           PRE-LAP: “Hellifornia” by Gesaffelstein.

           EXT./INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

           Matthew, Noah, Oliver, Swett, Bowen get home. Swett and Bowen 
           plop down on the couch in the living room. Noah rushes toward 
           the editing room. Matthew follows him in, carrying all the 
           equipment in dutifully.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, EDITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah walks into the editing room with a surprised and angry 
           expression on his face. He looks over at Matthew 
           suspiciously, but doesn’t say anything. Matthew feigns 
           obliviousness, unloading the equipment onto Noah's bed. We 
           see the batteries in a Ziploc bag on top of Noah's shelf. 

           END MUSIC.
           EXT. OLIVER'S HOUSE, BACK PATIO - DUSK

           Matthew is sitting cross-legged, looking through the 
           viewfinder of the camcorder, filming and interviewing Oliver 
           while he circles around on his BMX bike in the back patio.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What’s uh... what’s your most 
                        embarrassing memory?

                                 OLIVER
                        Ha! Probably when I told my dad I 
                        wanted to do music.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Really, what he say?

                                 OLIVER
                        Nothing. He just kept eating salt & 
                        vinegar chips. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Are you sure he heard you?

                                 OLIVER
                        Oh he heard me. I laid out my whole 
                        plan, told him I didn’t need any 
                        money or anything. He just sat 
                        there until I walked away.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What’s your happiest memory?

                                 OLIVER
                        When I turned 18 and left. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Was that scary?

                                 OLIVER
                        No. I got a new family... and now I 
                        get to choose who’s in it.

           Noah watches this intimacy from inside, through glass doors, 
           accepting defeat: Matthew is my superior now.

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew is walking around the house with the camcorder, doing 
           brief facetious interviews. He crosses paths with Swett in 
           the hallway.
                                 MATTHEW
                        When did you meet Oliver?

                                 SWETT
                        When did you know you were gay?

                                 MATTHEW
                        When I first locked eyes with you, 
                        my sweet cupcake.

                                 SWETT
                        Ooh, what kind of cupcake am I?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hm. Red velvet cake.

                                 SWETT
                        I will accept that... 

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew now approaches a lounging Bowen with the camera.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What is your favorite cereal?

                                 BOWEN
                        Uhh... Bitch Krispies.

           Matthew continues on into the adjacent kitchen.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse is at the counter, sitting on a stool. He’s producing 
           an instrumental on his laptop with Ableton. A Korg 
           synthesizer is attached by USB. Jesse is playing with the 
           knobs, generating strange sounds.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What do you love about music?

                                 JESSE
                        Well, son. Have a seat, young man. 
                        When I was 3 years old, I heard 
                        “Slob on My Knob” by Three 6 Mafia. 
                        It was then, at that precise 
                        moment... when Juicy J uttered 
                        those fateful words... “Squeeze on 
                        my nuts... lick on my butt... The 
                        natural curly hair... please don’t 
                        touch...” 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                        I knew there was only one path for 
                        me in this life. And only one 
                        direction to go: forward.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE, EDITING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Noah is at his workstation, cutting together footage.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey.

                                 NOAH
                             (conciliatory)
                        Hey.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can I ask you some questions for 
                        the doc?

           Noah is a little bit flattered, accepts the olive branch.

                                 NOAH
                        Yeah, aight. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        You’re a really important part of 
                        this crew, but more behind the 
                        scenes creative--

           EXT. OLIVER'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, ALLEY - EVENING

           ANGLE FROM Oliver’s house to this alley, where a giant lump 
           appears to be moving. It’s Matthew rustling in his sleeping 
           bag, laptop open, looking through the footage of himself and 
           Oliver in the music video. He opens his phone to look at 
           Oliver’s Instagram. He scrolls through a slideshow Oliver 
           posted. We see: a picture of a flower, then a close-up 
           picture of Oliver’s face, then a picture from the music video 
           shoot: Swett, Bowen, and Matthew sitting on a fence. Matthew 
           stares at it, takes a screenshot, then closes his eyes and 
           goes to sleep, grinning in his dingy paradise.

           INT. CONCERT - WEEKS LATER

           Matthew is filming side stage. Oliver is finishing up his set 
           for the night. He’s gotten quite a bit bigger since the last 
           concert we saw. He’s basking in the glory of rising success. 
           He motions for the crew (Swett, Bowen, Noah, Jesse, Shai, and 
           Matthew) to come join him on stage. Matthew keeps filming as 
           he and the crew swarm Oliver. 
                                 OLIVER
                        These are my boys. I wouldn’t be 
                        shit without them.

           The music starts back up again. The crowd erupts, Oliver 
           grabs Matthew's head and jumps up and down with him while 
           performing. This is Matthew’s ultimate fantasy finally 
           happening. On stage with his idol: I’m his number one boy.  

           INT. GREEN ROOM - AFTER THE CONCERT

           Matthew is exhausted and sweaty among Oliver’s crew, INDUSTRY 
           PEOPLE, and various RANDOMS. It’s a party in here. Swett and 
           Bowen are flirting with some girl fans, introducing them to 
           Oliver. Matthew opens up a bottled water as Sebastian walks 
           up to him.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You looked good up there. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thanks bro.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I like to be out in GA and catch 
                        all the true fan vibes.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh yeah, that real feeling. The 
                        energy. I get that.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Felt like they were cheering for 
                        you out there. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Just wait til I drop my album.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What, for real?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, I’m playing. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (laughing)
                        You should though. All you need is 
                        a USB mic. Enough people are 
                        curious about you that you’d get 
                        some streams no matter what. Just 
                        sing in a falsetto. Anyone can sing 
                        falsetto.
           Sebastian tries out his falsetto voice.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                        See?

           Matthew tries one too, for fun.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                        I can hear the pain inside you. 
                        Hold onto that. Don’t let anyone 
                        take it from you.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thank you.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m going to Atlas’s show tomorrow 
                        with Ollie, you wanna come?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, yeah, I don’t know too much 
                        about the fashion scene or 
                        whatever.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        It’s cool, neither do they. Text me 
                        your number.

           EXT. FAIRFAX - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is walking down the street. He gets recognized by 
           someone, who starts approaching. At first, Matthew cowers, 
           but then realizes it’s a CURIOUS FAN.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        Hey can I get a picture with you?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Me?

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        Yeah. I saw you at that concert. 
                        And you’re always on Oliver’s IG.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh okay, sure.

           They take a selfie together.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        You’re my hero man.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah?

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        You just inspire me. Just to be 
                        myself and that it’s okay to be who 
                        I am.

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Don’t you ever forget that. There’s 
                        no difference between me and you. 
                        You can be doing this too.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, little bro.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        What do you um... do? I wanna be 
                        like you. But like, what do you do? 
                        Or what did you do to like... get 
                        to where you are now?

                                 MATTHEW
                             (gears turning)
                        Well I... I’m a photographer...  
                             (gathering himself)
                        And I’m making a documentary. So I 
                        do mostly, like visuals. Visual 
                        art. I’m a visual artist.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        Did you go to school for that?

           Matthew is starting to get anxious to leave.

                                 CURIOUS FAN (CONT'D)
                        How did you like, get in with them? 

                                 MATTHEW
                        We grew up together.

                                 CURIOUS FAN
                        I’ve been trying to get my friends 
                        to see the vision with me, but I 
                        had to come out here by myself.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo I really gotta go bro, sorry.
           Matthew takes off on his bike.

           EXT. LA BREA STREETS - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew rides by the stores and notices his old job, where he 
           sees Jamie working behind the counter. He decides to pull 
           over and head in.

           INT. AMERICAN RAG STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew peruses the racks of clothing with dramatically fake 
           interest like he’s a customer. He’s feeling himself, waits 
           for Jamie to approach. 

                                 JAMIE 
                        What’s up, man. How you been?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh, yo! Good good, man. Actually, 
                        really good. Been growing and 
                        learning a lot. Realizing shit.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah I been seeing you everywhere. 
                        You got like a cult following now. 
                        So sick. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I mean, I don’t care about 
                        all that. Actually been just 
                        working on creative stuff with 
                        Ollie and them. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh really? Like what?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Just like visuals, mainly. Photos, 
                        music videos. Working on a 
                        documentary right now with Oliver.

                                 JAMIE
                        What? Damn, you really made it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah man, I feel like they just get 
                        me and they’re helping me reach my 
                        potential as an artist.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh that’s really tight, can I see 
                        some of the footage?
                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, nah, I don’t have my camera on 
                        me.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh okay, no worries. Well, that’s 
                        super dope that they’re letting a 
                        fan spend all this time around 
                        them. Don’t forget about us!

                                 MATTHEW
                             (chuckling)
                        I’m not a fan, bro.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh, my bad.

           Pause: Matthew is fuming, needs Jamie to know how far he’s 
           come from folding hoodies.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You wanna come to this fashion 
                        thing? Me and the boys were gonna 
                        go.

                                 JAMIE
                        The boys? You mean Oliver?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, and Seb.

                                 JAMIE
                        Sebastian?!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, it’s his homie’s runway show 
                        or something. Nothing crazy.

                                 JAMIE
                        Uh, yeah, I know what the fuck it 
                        is. You have tickets?

           Matthew scoffs.

                                 MATTHEW
                        We should be good, bruh.

           EXT. FASHION SHOW - EVENING

           Matthew and Jamie approach the fashion show entrance lined up 
           with COOL FASHION CROWD. 
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo what are you wearing bro?

           CLOSE ON Jamie’s patchwork sweater.

                                 JAMIE
                        I made it myself.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Jesus Christ.

           They get whisked in.

           INT. FASHION SHOW - MOMENTS LATER

           Jamie looks around in awe, taking it all in. The MODELS, the 
           VIP CROWD. Matthew acts like this is everyday.

                                 JAMIE
                        I feel like I’m in the mafia or 
                        something.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo just be cool. These kids, they 
                        can sniff out a lame from a mile 
                        away.

                                 JAMIE
                        I got you.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And don’t ask for a pic with 
                        anyone, okay? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Why not?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Dog this isn’t a fucking meet and 
                        greet. Act like you’re supposed to 
                        be here.

           INT. FASHION SHOW, FRONT ROW - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew sits next to Oliver and Sebastian. Jamie stands out 
           behind the chairs. The show commences. It’s a bunch of SKATER 
           KIDS walking out in grey hoodies and sweatpants. 

           CLOSE ON one of the hoodies reveals a tiny cursive embroidery 
           on the shoulder that reads: “If I’m a bitch, then I’m the 
           baddest bitch.”
           EXT. FASHION SHOW - LATER

           Matthew is smoking a cigarette over-dramatically, because 
           it’s his first, talking to Oliver and Sebastian outside.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What you mean? I told her to send 
                        her friend home. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Damn.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        She asked ME for an Uber, I said 
                        did she bring her bathing suit?

                                 OLIVER
                        Why?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Cause she getting in a pool.

           Matthew bowls over laughing, starts coughing from the smoke. 
           Jamie approaches genuinely but awkwardly.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yo.

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ay, yo. Uh... yo, this is my boy 
                        Jamie.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hey, we met, once.

                                 OLIVER
                        Oh word.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (bowing)
                        Bless up.

                                 JAMIE
                        That was so weird man, it was just 
                        hoodies and pants. I don’t know why 
                        they needed a whole event.

           CLOSE ON Matthew's face, furious: Why did I bring him here?

           Pause long enough for us to think Jamie made a faux pas.
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Cause these people need this shit 
                        to feel important.

           Matthew sighs in relief.

                                 OLIVER
                        They needed a way to meet new 
                        models.

                                 JAMIE
                        They should just go on Instagram, 
                        the human menu.

           Oliver and Sebastian laugh. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Well that’s where they came from. 
                        They were born on IG, molded by it. 
                        Point of this is to prove to each 
                        other that it’s real. The physical 
                        manifestation of dick-rider 
                        culture.

           Matthew breaks a smile.

                                 OLIVER
                        So you knew the old Matty, before I 
                        put him on.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh shit. What was he like? He used 
                        to beat his meat with Nutella or 
                        something crazy?

           Matthew stares Jamie down.

                                 JAMIE
                        He was pretty much the same, 
                        honestly. He’s always been like my 
                        big brother. 

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        And he’s my son. So if he’s my son, 
                        and you’re his little brother. That 
                        makes you... my other son.

                                 OLIVER
                             (to Sebastian)
                        And you’re my son. 
                             (to Jamie)
                        Which makes you... my grandson. 
                                 JAMIE
                        Grandpa! Thank you for your 
                        service, by the way. Appreciate you 
                        fighting for us in Vietnam.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, I fought so you could have 
                        the freedom of looking at people 
                        wearing hoodies.
                             (snapping at Matthew)
                        Yo Matty, you not filming this? You 
                        should be getting everything here 
                        for the doc. I need proof that Seb 
                        is a ugly bitch.

           Matthew, taken aback, having forgotten his purpose, reaches 
           for his camera and takes it out. He now feels like the least 
           important person in the group.

           EXT. FASHION SHOW AFTER PARTY, THE NICE GUY - EVENING

           Matthew, Jamie, Oliver, and Sebastian are getting whisked 
           into the club. A LONG LINE sprawls around the corner outside.

                                 SOMEONE #1
                        Ollie, Ollie! 

                                 SOMEONE #2
                        Can I get a hug, please?

           Matthew is filming the other three from behind as they walk 
           through the entrance, ignoring the line. The BOUNCER stops 
           Matthew as he steps in.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Hold up, he with you too?

                                 OLIVER
                        What? Yeah.

           The bouncer lets a thoroughly humiliated Matthew in.

                                 SOMEONE #1
                        Your music is trash! You fell off, 
                        bitch.

           INT. FASHION SHOW AFTER PARTY, THE NICE GUY - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew, Jamie, Oliver, and Sebastian are at a table. Matthew 
           is filming Jamie, Oliver, and Sebastian laughing and joking 
           over heaping plates of pasta.
                                 JAMIE
                        And then Matty was like “Do you 
                        want that in a plastic bag?”

           Oliver and Sebastian are dying laughing. Oliver grabs Jamie’s 
           shoulder for support.

                                 OLIVER
                        Damn bruh, they had you looking 
                        like a bitch!

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Why didn’t you do anything?

           Before Matthew can respond, the rest of the crew (Swett, 
           Bowen, Jesse, Shai, Noah) arrives and sits down.

                                 SWETT
                             (pointing at Jamie)
                        Yo who is this?

           Matthew doesn’t say anything.

                                 JAMIE
                        What’s up, I’m Jamie.

                                 OLIVER
                        This is Matthew's young boy.

                                 NOAH
                        What’s up, man.

                                 SWETT
                        That sweater is hard. Where you get 
                        it at?

                                 JAMIE
                        I made it! You want one?

                                 SWETT
                        The fuck? Yes. Thank you, bro! Ay I 
                        fuck with this kid.

                                 NOAH
                        Yo can you make me one?

                                 OLIVER
                        Woah woah, chill. I need one before 
                        any of these vultures.

                                 JAMIE
                        I got you. I’ll make one for 
                        everybody. Just uh, let me know 
                        your sizes.
                                 SHAI
                        What’s your number? I’ll text them 
                        to you.

           Matthew has to continue filming everybody as they dote on 
           Jamie. A KID comes up to the table.

                                 KID
                        Hey, could I get a picture?

                                 OLIVER
                        Of course!

                                 KID
                             (to Jamie)
                        Can you take it?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo let our in-house photographer 
                        take it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m filming.

                                 JAMIE
                        I can do it!

           Jamie takes the kid’s phone and snaps the photo, then hands 
           it back over.

           EXT. THE NICE GUY - END OF NIGHT

           Jamie and Matthew standing, catching Ubers. Matthew is so 
           relieved for this night, and Jamie’s presence, to be over.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yo, thank you so much man. That was 
                        so crazy. You’re my big brother, 
                        for real.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (patronizing)
                        Aight, bro.

                                 JAMIE
                        You coming to the crib tomorrow, 
                        too?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Huh? Ollie’s?
                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah, they were talking about 
                        kicking it tomorrow at the crib.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh, uh... Yeah, I’ll be there. Are 
                        you?

                                 JAMIE
                        I mean, yeah. I feel like, yeah I 
                        want to.

           Jamie’s Uber arrives.

                                 JAMIE (CONT'D)
                        Aight big bro, later man!

           EXT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Matthew gets out the Uber on the verge of tears. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thank you.

           He walks inside.

           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew sits up in his bed, texts Jamie: “yo feel like i 
           should tell you... they were just being nice about coming to 
           the crib”

           Matthew gets a text back from Jamie: “oh shit... ah ok all 
           good”

           Matthew: “yeah they can’t just have anybody coming through 
           all the time”

           Jamie: “i feel that”

           Matthew: “but they thought you were cool though”

           Jamie: “really??”

           Matthew: “yeah for sure” 

           Matthew: “they told me they loved you”

           Matthew: “I’ll let you know when we come around the store 
           next time too”

           Pause. Jamie’s text bubble appears and disappears. Then... 
           Jamie: “aight bro lmk”

           Matthew puts his phone down and turns over on his pillow, 
           feeling like he’s put this Jamie threat to bed.

           We see under his bed, a plate of uneaten moldy fruit that’s 
           been forgotten, sitting there for days. 

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew walks in through the front door to find: Jamie, 
           sitting on the couch with Swett and Bowen.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yo!

           Matthew is surprised.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yooooo... 
                             (moving closer to Jamie)
                        ... what are you doing here?

                                 JAMIE
                        Ollie hit me! Said he needed some 
                        help getting ready for London.

                                 MATTHEW
                        London?

           Jamie gets back to co-mingling with everyone. Matthew bounds 
           upstairs toward Oliver’s room.

           INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew busts in. Oliver is in there with another WHITE BOY 
           and TWO GIRLS. They all presumably just had sex.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo, what’s London?

                                 OLIVER
                        Huh?

                                 MATTHEW
                        You going to London?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, you are too, bitch. You’re 
                        shooting it.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Shooting what?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo, you sound real frustrated. I 
                        wanna do the album cover out there, 
                        we’re doing a Nike thing and then 
                        we’ll just use the same studio. And 
                        I’m bringing everyone. I’m letting 
                        your boy style it, too. Wanted to 
                        let him tell you. Flying y’all out, 
                        like my most special hoes.

           Matthew processes this.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                             (getting dressed)
                        Yo, you need to be getting way more 
                        B-Roll. Just random shit here at 
                        the crib, people hanging out, real 
                        daily life shit. Especially when we 
                        get to
                             (British Roadman accent)
                        London, bruv, innit. You need to be 
                        shooting bare B-roll, bruv, are you 
                        mad?

           INT. BEST BUY - LATER

           Matthew stands at check-out, buying GoPros. The CASHIER looks 
           at him.

                                 CASHIER
                        You got like a sex dungeon or 
                        something?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Something like that.

                                 CASHIER
                        Wait aren’t you that kid, that’s in 
                        all of the Oliver videos and shit.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

                                 CASHIER
                        You fucked him or something?

                                 MATTHEW
                        What?

           The Cashier hands Matthew the shopping bag.
                                 CASHIER
                        Have a wonderful day and thank you 
                        for shopping at Best Buy.

           EXT./INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Matthew sets up the GoPros, making Jamie help him attach them 
           to the ceiling corners.

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re coming to London with us, 
                        right?

           Matthew bites his tongue: “Us”???? These are MY friends.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, he wants me to shoot the 
                        cover.

                                 JAMIE
                        What! That’s so sick, bro. You’re 
                        gonna kill that.

           Matthew’s thinking about killing something else... 

           PRE-LAP: “Destinations” by Gesaffelstein.

           EXT./INT. LAX AIRPORT - ONE WEEK LATER

           Everyone at the airport. Shai checks gate times. Bowen and 
           Noah and Jesse check their phones. Jamie is wide-eyed. 
           Matthew is shooting B-roll. Oliver and Swett are trolling the 
           TSA by taking their pants off.

           INT. PLANE - HOURS LATER

           Everyone is handed customs slips and golf pencils to fill 
           them out. Jamie is asleep in the window seat. Shai is in the 
           seat in front of Matthew.

           END MUSIC.

                                 SHAI
                        Yo.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey.
                                 SHAI
                        When we get there, you can’t tell 
                        them you’re with us, because I 
                        don’t have performance visas for 
                        you guys.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What’s that?

                                 SHAI
                        Like when you and Jamie go through 
                        customs, just tell them you’re 
                        visiting family or friends. Ollie 
                        is doing a one-off show in 
                        Shoreditch. If you tell them you’re 
                        with us, they won’t let you in 
                        because you don’t have a 
                        performance visa. And we all might 
                        get fucked over.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Okay. Can I get one?

                                 SHAI
                        Why? You need to apply for them in 
                        advance. Just tell them you’re here 
                        to visit the fucking Buckingham 
                        Palace and you should be fine.

           INT. LONDON HEATHROW CUSTOMS - HOURS LATER

           Matthew is at the customs booth, he hands the AGENT his 
           filled-out slip.

                                 AGENT
                        What are you here for?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Just seeing a friend.

                                 AGENT
                        Where do they live?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, Shoreditch.

                                 AGENT
                        How long are you here for?

           Jamie goes over to the booth, and Matthew looks over at him, 
           but he doesn’t do anything.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Sorry, what?

                                 AGENT
                        How long are you staying in London?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, just a few days.

                                 AGENT
                        What is your occupation?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh--

                                 AGENT
                        What do you do for a living?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, I take photographs and make 
                        videos.

                                 AGENT
                        No, not what’s your hobby. What is 
                        your job? Do you have a job?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh... 

                                 AGENT
                        Unemployed.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I--

                                 AGENT
                        Do you have anything to declare?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Declare? Like do I have something 
                        to confess?

           Matthew looks back over at Jamie, who’s clearly struggling at 
           another customs booth.

                                 AGENT
                        Do you have any perishables? Meat 
                        or meat products, vegetables, 
                        fruits... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, no.
           Matthew looks over to see Jamie being forcefully escorted to 
           an interrogation room by AGENTS. They confiscate his phone.

                                 AGENT
                        Enjoy your stay.

           Agent stamps Matthew's passport.

                                 MATTHEW 
                        Thank you.

           INT. LONDON HEATHROW CUSTOMS, UK SIDE - LATER

           Matthew and Oliver’s crew (Swett, Bowen, Jesse, Noah, and 
           Shai) are waiting for Jamie. They’ve grown impatient.

                                 SWETT
                        Yo, where’s your boy?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I don’t know.

                                 SHAI
                        Did you tell him what to say?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I explained everything to 
                        him. He might’ve just forgot.

                                 SHAI
                        Alright, well, we need to check in.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m sure he’ll call us.

                                 SHAI
                        Shit, they probably already sent 
                        his ass home. We should roll.

           PRE-LAP: “Perfection” by Gesaffelstein.

           EXT. THE BRITISH MUSEUM - DUSK

           Matthew is taking B-roll of everyone being shuffled around 
           various London tourist attractions. Swett and Bowen skate in 
           front of The British Museum steps, Oliver dances super goofy 
           for the camera. Noah, Jesse and Shai laugh.
           EXT. LONDON, BEIGEL BAKE - EVENING

           Matthew is having so much fun, shooting B-roll of Oliver and 
           everyone eating a London delicacy: salt beef bagels.

           INT. LONDON AIRBNB - EVENING

           Matthew flops down on a bed.

           CLOSE ON his face. His eyes are distant, hollowed out. Hold 
           on his vacuous expression as we PUSH IN further, his mouth 
           twitches into a smile. Oliver, Swett, Bowen, Jesse and Noah 
           bust in the door with bottles and GIRLS. They want to go back 
           out.

           INT. VISIONS NIGHT CLUB - LATE NIGHT

           END MUSIC.

           Matthew shooting B-roll in dark room of an underground party, 
           interviewing Oliver. They shout over the loud music and 
           PACKED CROWD in their booth. Oliver has not abandoned his 
           horrible London road man accent yet.

                                 MATTHEW
                        So, what do you want out of life?

                                 OLIVER
                        To be the biggest, bruv. My own 
                        company, bruv. #1 album in the 
                        country, bruv. Bare movies out. A 
                        clothing line, fam. But that’s all 
                        just so I can guarantee the team is 
                        good, fam. Everybody that helped me 
                        get here, that’s my family, innit. 
                        There’s a whole piece of Oliver, 
                        Inc. for anybody in my family, 
                        bruv. If I make sure everybody 
                        eating, I’ll be satisfied, innit. 
                        I’d be a proud papa.

           Pause.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        The question, is what do you want, 
                        bruv?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I have everything I want.

           He means it.
           INT. LONDON PHOTO SHOOT, BLEND STUDIOS - THE NEXT DAY

           Oliver sits on a stool in front of a white studio backdrop. 
           The room is crowded. Matthew is behind the camera, taking 
           pictures. 

           Noah and Jesse absentmindedly scroll their phones. Swett and 
           Bowen are wrestling playfully but aggressively.

           There’s a BUZZ at the door and some industry people arrive: a 
           NIKE REP, a PUBLICIST, and a JOURNALIST. Objects populating 
           the area include: lights (some pointed at Oliver, some idle), 
           rolling racks of clothing, a ladder leaning on the wall, and 
           various gag props (Super Soakers, NERF footballs, etc.) 
           Matthew is behind the camera, taking pictures of Oliver.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Alright now give me sexy horse.

           Oliver tries to do a sexy horse face interpretation.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Now give me Brazilian soccer 
                        player. You just made a goal on 
                        your own team.

           Another BUZZ at the door. The studio door OPENS and in comes 
           Jamie, carrying a rolling suitcase, alongside Shai. The two 
           of them clearly just discussed the fact that Matthew didn’t 
           tell Jamie about the visa thing. Shai looks at Matthew 
           disapprovingly, thinks he’s sus now.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Yo! You made it.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yes. Yes, I did.

           Jamie unzips his suitcase. It’s full of the sweaters he 
           promised to make everyone and he starts handing them out.

                                 SWETT
                        Oh shit, you actually made them?

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah, I wanted to surprise you 
                        guys.

                                 BOWEN
                             (catching his)
                        Bruhhh, yesss, thank you.

           Jamie TOSSES one to Matthew without looking at him. His toss 
           is off and Matthew has to lurch awkwardly to catch it. 
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo, let me show you what we’re 
                        working on.

           Jamie’s attitude has clearly changed. He knows Matthew 
           betrayed him and will no longer play the stooge.

                                 OLIVER
                        All my boys are here. My creative 
                        dream team. 92 Olympics shit.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (to Oliver)
                        Yo, come look at this.

           Matthew shows Oliver and Jamie the pictures he’s taken on the 
           camera display.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Crazy, right.

                                 OLIVER
                        Uh, yeah. Yeah, that’s dope. I 
                        don’t know if that’s really the 
                        right vibe, though. For this album. 
                        I feel like it needs more. More 
                        emotion or something... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        What? Nah, no it doesn’t. 

                                 OLIVER
                             (taken aback)
                        What?

                                 MATTHEW
                        This is exactly what your album 
                        sounds like. It’s minimalist.

                                 OLIVER
                        I got an 8-part orchestra section 
                        on my intro.

                                 JAMIE
                        Yo, I got an idea.

           Jamie hands Oliver the Super Soaker.

                                 OLIVER
                        Uh... 

           Jamie takes it, pumps it up again, and hands it back to 
           Oliver. Oliver SPRAYS it in his mouth and DROOLS out the 
           water.
                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                             (drooling)
                        Get that, get that.

           Jamie jumps behind the camera and starts taking pictures, as 
           Matthew stands by awkwardly.

                                 JAMIE
                        Spit some out.

           Oliver spits some of the water out and laughs as Jamie 
           continues to take photos. They’re having fun. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Aight, aight, let me see.

           Oliver checks out the camera display to look at the shots. 
           Jamie flips through them. Oliver’s big smile shrinks into an 
           unenthusiastic smirk.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Eh... kinda too goofy.

           Matthew sighs in relief: Thank God he doesn’t like Jamie’s 
           idea.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Noah? You got anything?

           Noah, surprised to be back in the game, comes up with an idea 
           on the spot.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What if we--

           Oliver shoots Matthew a deathly look.

                                 OLIVER
                        Noah?

                                 NOAH
                        Uh..what if you like... what if you 
                        tied this around your neck?

           Noah has grabbed a rope and handed it to Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        Y’all really like imagery of me 
                        killing myself, huh.

                                 NOAH
                        Nah, it’ll just look sick, it’s a 
                        metaphor.
                                 OLIVER
                        A metaphor for what? Wanting to 
                        kill myself?

                                 NOAH
                        Nah like, the industry.

           Oliver shrugs: Let’s give it a try.

           Noah snaps some photos, then shows Oliver as Matthew and 
           Jamie crowd the camera. As soon as he sees them, Oliver busts 
           out laughing.

                                 OLIVER
                        Nope. This ain’t it, bruh.

           Another BUZZ at the door: lunch delivery arrives. Sandwiches 
           are passed around. Oliver starts devouring his sandwich on 
           the stool. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Oh, I got something.

                                 OLIVER
                             (chewing)
                        What?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Just stay right there. Keep eating.

           Matthew unscrews the camera from the tripod and gets right up 
           in Oliver’s face while he’s eating the sandwich. Matthew 
           starts snapping photos while Oliver continues to eat. Oliver 
           chuckles through a mouthful as Matthew gets closer and closer 
           to him. Matthew gets a little too close and Oliver snaps at 
           him, slapping the camera (attached to Matthew’s face) away.

                                 OLIVER
                        Get the fuck back. Jesus--

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, it’s like a detail shot, it 
                        looks--

                                 OLIVER
                        What are you, a fucking weirdo 
                        fangirl? Get off my dick, bro.

           Matthew tries to laugh it off and swallows his pride, it’s 
           excruciating. Jamie sets up the ladder next to Oliver and 
           grabs the camera from Matthew. Jamie climbs up the ladder.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Ay Swett!
           He LOBS the rest of his sandwich at Swett, who deftly DODGES 
           it. He grabs it and tries to force feed it to Bowen.

                                 SWETT
                        I’m too fast, shoulda been in The 
                        Matrix 3.

                                 JAMIE
                             (to Oliver)
                        Look up at me.

           Oliver looks up at Jamie like a baby, CLUTCHING HIS KNEES on 
           the stool.

                                 JAMIE (CONT'D)
                        Yes. 

           Jamie snaps photos from a high angle. Then he walks down and 
           shows Oliver. Matthew and Noah look over their shoulders. On 
           the display, we see a fetal Oliver, looking 
           uncharacteristically vulnerable from above. Oliver loves it 
           so much he gets quiet.

                                 OLIVER
                        Damn.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Bro, what? This is so basic.

                                 NOAH
                        This is pretty hard, not gonna lie.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, this is it. Oh shit, this is 
                        it! Wait, toss me the sweater. Yo 
                        Matthew, get the B-Roll cam. We 
                        need to capture this moment for the 
                        doc.

           Oliver starts putting on the sweater Jamie made for him.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Aight get this one Jamie. Oooooh, 
                        this is the one, I’m telling you. 
                        Shit is iconic.

           Jamie starts climbing back up the ladder with the camera. 
           Noah decides to be helpful to Jamie. He helps Oliver pull the 
           sweater over his knees as he assumes the fetal position. Noah 
           then arranges the lights perfectly to accentuate the shot. 
           Matthew grabs the camcorder, defeated. 

           He starts filming, first catching some of the rest of the 
           room: we see Swett and Bowen slap-boxing in the corner. 
                                 SWETT
                        Ay Matty get this, get this. I’m 
                        bout to slap the shit out of this 
                        pussy boy---

           Bowen slaps him first, then they go at it.

           They’ve been doing Jackass-esque horseplay this entire shoot. 
           Once we catch a glimpse of them in Matthew’s camcorder, we 
           turn back over toward Jamie and Oliver.

           Jamie gets to the top of the ladder and shoots a perfectly 
           lit Oliver from above. 

           Matthew, watching through the camcorder, simply can't take 
           it. We see through the camcorder viewfinder, Matthew getting 
           closer and closer to the ladder, where Jamie is taking 
           photos.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yea Matty, can you hold onto that, 
                        it’s wobbly.

           But as he moves in toward the ladder, he doesn’t stop. He 
           walks straight into it. The ladder TOPPLES OVER and Jamie 
           TUMBLES down, CRASHING into hot lights, which fall over and 
           SHATTER. Jamie finally lands awkwardly, upon which we hear a 
           terrifying SMUSH of flesh against the slick floor. Matthew is 
           still filming: did he shove it intentionally?

           Matthew immediately starts to cover for himself. Having 
           clocked Swett and Bowen’s rowdy behavior, he attempts to play 
           it off as the same kind of harmless thing.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ooooohhhhhh, yo I got all of that. 
                        This is gonna be so sick for the 
                        doc, or you should just put this in 
                        the music video! This is some 
                        Jackass shit, bro!

           Matthew removes the camcorder from his eye. Clearly, he 
           crossed a line. Everyone is dead silent, looking at him or 
           looking away awkwardly, then looking back at Jamie. 

           WE SEE: Jamie motionless, BLOOD POOLING around his head.

           INT. AIRBNB - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew wakes up and walks around. No one is there. 
           EXT. AIRBNB - MINUTES LATER

           He rushes to the airport and gets in an Uber. As soon as he 
           sits, he texts Shai about his boarding pass.

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - AN HOUR LATER

           Matthew is asking the desk ATTENDANT about his pass.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        No I see your name, but it was only 
                        for a one-way ticket. The return 
                        flight had to be confirmed at least 
                        24 hours before takeoff.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m in a group, though. I’m with 
                        Oliver... the artist.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Okay, well... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can you just look him up?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Last name?

                                 MATTHEW
                        You don’t know who he is?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        No, I’m sorry. 
                             (typing)
                        Yeah, I see he and 5 others checked 
                        in about an hour ago.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And there’s no ticket in there for 
                        me?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        In where? Do you think there’s like 
                        a manila envelope or something?

           Pause.

                                 ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
                        Would you like to just buy a ticket 
                        for the next flight?

                                 MATTHEW
                        When is that?
                                 ATTENDANT
                        There’s one in about 7 hours.

           Matthew gulps.

                                 MATTHEW
                        How much is it?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        1500 pounds.

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I don’t have that.

           A LINE has developed behind Matthew. He starts furiously 
           making phone calls to Shai, Jamie, Noah, Jesse, Swett, Bowen, 
           then finally, Oliver. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Is there anything else I can help 
                        you with?

           Matthew makes one more phone call, which we don’t see, but we 
           hear Grandma’s voice on the other line.

                                 GRANDMA (O.C.)
                        Matty!

           INT. LAX AIRPORT, U.S. CUSTOMS - AFTERNOON

           Matthew scans his passport and breaks into an unnatural smile 
           for the requisite picture taken by the machine. The machine 
           spits out a slip with his information and picture on it. 

           He grabs the slip with his smiling face staring up at him, as 
           he considers himself. Then we see his real face again, empty 
           and exhausted. 

           EXT. LAX AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER

           Grandma waits patiently for Matthew's arrival. He walks out. 
           She calls out to him.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Matty! Matty baby!

           Matthew sees her and completely ignores her, getting into an 
           Uber. Grandma is left stranded and confused. 
           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - SUNSET

           Matthew knocks on the front door and rings the doorbell 
           multiple times. No one lets him in. He keeps knocking and 
           knocking until finally Shai answers the door.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yooooo. What happened with the 
                        flights? Shit was crazy, did they 
                        lose yours too?

                                 SHAI
                        You gotta head out, man.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What?

                                 SHAI
                        Gotta bounce, I’m sorry.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What do you mean, I’m doing the 
                        documentary?

                                 SHAI
                        We’re gonna have someone else 
                        finish it. Or just not do one. I 
                        think he’s over it, anyway. Ollie’s 
                        more into being mysterious now.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What? Where is he? 

                                 SHAI
                        In his room.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Let me talk to him, I know he 
                        wouldn’t want anyone else doing the 
                        doc, he said I’m his fucking muse.

                                 SHAI
                        I honestly think you should just 
                        take a break and chill out for a 
                        while.

           Matthew rushes past Shai and bounds up the stairs to Oliver’s 
           bedroom. The door is locked. WE HEAR giggling and screams of 
           delight. Matthew keeps knocking. A half-dressed Oliver opens 
           the door smiling until he sees Matthew.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo.
                                 OLIVER
                        Uh... hey... 

           Pause.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Can I help you?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I need help.

           Matthew starts touching Oliver sensually, grabbing at the 
           bottom of his polo shirt.

                                 OLIVER
                        Bro, what the fuck... 
                             (laughing)
                        Ohhh my God, no. Nope. That’s not 
                        for you.

           Oliver, still laughing, closes the door on Matthew. Matthew 
           walks down and exits the house, as Swett and Bowen play video 
           games but pretend not to see him.

           PRE-LAP: “Pursuit” by Gesaffelstein.

           EXT. OLIVER’S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALLEY - DUSK

           Matthew throws his bags down where his sleeping bag setup 
           used to be. The sleeping bag is still hidden behind the shed 
           with his other stuff. He goes to grab it. It’s covered in 
           dirt and debris. He dusts it off in disgust, then starts 
           setting it all back up like old times. This time, he does it 
           sloppily and rushed. Then he lies down in his crusty, gross 
           outdoor bedroom, eyes wide open.

           After some squirming, he picks up his camcorder and starts 
           filming through the fence. He’s able to see just a sliver of 
           Oliver’s house, a sliding glass door. Matthew sets up his 
           tripod to hold the camera in position and continues to stare.

           WE SEE through Matthew’s POV: Oliver walks by, wrestling and 
           laughing with Swett. Matthew smiles, thinking to himself: At 
           least I still have this.

           Just then, WE HEAR a man approaching. It’s the NEIGHBOR, the 
           old white man whose trash cans got knocked over by Oliver and 
           Sebastian’s cul de sac race. It’s this man’s side yard alley 
           Matthew has been squatting in all this time.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        What the hell?
           Matthew turns his head to see the neighbor, who’s making a 
           purposeful beeline toward him. He seems PISSED. Neighbor has 
           his hands out as though he’s going to grab the camera. As 
           soon as he’s in range, we hear a THWACK. The neighbor FALLS 
           like a ton of bricks.

           WE SEE Matthew, calm as ever, having just clubbed the old man 
           with the tripod. WE SEE a shovel in the yard. Matthew 
           considers it.

           END MUSIC.

           EXT./INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE  - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew PEEKS into the neighbor’s house to check if anyone 
           else is home. They aren’t.

           EXT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew DRAGS the unconscious neighbor back up to his house.

           INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew drags the neighbor into the living room and sets him 
           on the couch. He sees a prescription bottle of Klonopin among 
           some other medications. 

           INT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew OPENS the bottle, CRUSHES a handful of them on a 
           cutting board with the bottom of a glass, then fills that 
           glass with water. On his way back to the living room, he 
           grabs an apple and takes a bite.

           INT. NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew FUNNELS the crushed up pills into the neighbor’s 
           mouth, then POURS some water in from the glass. Relieved, 
           Matthew then notices a tape player on a shelf and a 
           collection of cassettes. After considering a few, he puts one 
           on: “Nobody But Me” by The Human Beinz. 

           Matthew starts DANCING WILDLY around the room. He tucks in 
           the old man with a throw blanket. 

           Still dancing, he POCKETS the pill bottle. Then, he notices a 
           framed family photo on a side table. It’s the old man with a 
           wife and a few kids, the Normal Rockwell epitome of familial 
           love. 
           He picks it up and examines it, truly moved, picturing 
           himself in this scenario. He smiles to himself, then STEALS 
           it.

           EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALLEY - EVENING

           Matthew walks out toward his sleeping bag setup, family photo 
           in hand, still all smiles. He faces his sleeping bag 
           arrangement, remembering now that he actually has to leave 
           for good. 

           END MUSIC.

           We see the shovel as Matthew faces Oliver’s house. Something 
           in his face suggests he may go full psycho and kill everybody 
           over there. Instead, he packs all his stuff into the sleeping 
           bag and orders an Uber.

           EXT. THE GROVE FOUNTAIN - A MONTH LATER, NOON

           CHYRON: One month later.

           People shopping at The Grove. The fountain sprays with an 
           ersatz happiness in the distance. The sun is beating down, 
           shimmering in the fountain water. 

           INT. STORE AT THE GROVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew works here now, wearing the store’s brand from head 
           to toe. A customer, white with blue-tipped blonde hair, 
           approaches Matthew. Let’s call this customer TROLL. He’s 
           wearing an extra small hoodie from this store, grinning 
           deviously. 

                                 TROLL
                        Yo can you get me this in another 
                        size? It’s a little on the small 
                        side. Do you have a medium?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, for sure.

           Matthew goes to the back and retrieves a hoodie. The Troll 
           puts it on, on top of the original extra small hoodie. 
           Matthew is confused. 

                                 TROLL
                        Do you have this in a large?

           Pause.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah.

           Pause.

                                 TROLL
                        Well, can you go get it?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yeah, I got you.

           Matthew goes to grab the large hoodie, brings it back to the 
           grinning Troll.

                                 TROLL
                        Thanks, bra.

           The Troll puts on the large hoodie, on top of the other two 
           hoodies, now trying to contain his laughter as he becomes a 
           Russian doll of hoodies.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        You got an extra large?

           Matthew rolls his eyes, goes to grab the extra large hoodie, 
           a 2XL hoodie, and a 3XL hoodie. Troll accepts them, then sees 
           that Matthew has caught on to his game.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        Yo what the fuck is this?

           Pause.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        I said XL, what the fuck is this? 
                        Are you calling me a fat bitch? 
                             (to no one in particular)
                        This employee just called me a fat 
                        ass white bitch!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh... 

                                 TROLL
                        Yo fuck this place!

           Troll takes off all the hoodies, throwing them on the ground 
           sequentially. He then proceeds to knock all the other neatly 
           folded, shelved clothes onto the floor. We see TROLL’S FRIEND 
           in the corner, filming all of this on his phone. The Troll’s 
           affect dissolves. 

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        You got it?
                                 TROLL’S FRIEND
                        Yep.

           The Troll and Troll’s Friend start to leave. Matthew starts 
           picking the clothes up off the floor. The Troll stops in his 
           tracks on his way out.

                                 TROLL
                        Wait... 

           He gets serious, walks closer to Matthew. He grabs on to 
           Matthew’s jacket, inspecting it.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        This is fake.

                                 MATTHEW
                        No, it’s not.

                                 TROLL
                        Oh my God, it is. How you work here 
                        at the actual store and you got the 
                        fake version on?

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s not fake.

                                 TROLL
                        Why don’t you just rock some 
                        regular shit? Fuck it, I’m 
                        snitching, this is too much. I need 
                        to speak to the manager!

           Troll’s Friend ups his phone to start filming again. Troll 
           waves at him to put it away.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        Nah nah, this is too shameful.

           Troll’s Friend puts the phone down. Troll finds The STORE 
           MANAGER and leads him back to Matthew.

                                 TROLL (CONT'D)
                        Your employee got on a fake jacket, 
                        why you let him do that? You don’t 
                        give them some of the clothes?

                                 MATTHEW
                        He’s trolling.

           Store Manager checks the tag on Matthew’s neck: It is fake.
                                 STORE MANAGER
                             (disappointed)
                        Take it off, please.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Why, what’s the difference?

           Store Manager glares at him, appalled. Matthew takes it off. 
           Underneath the jacket, he’s wearing a dirty t-shirt.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        Why don’t you just go home for the 
                        day, Matthew.

                                 STORE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                             (to Troll)
                        Thank you for letting us know.

                                 TROLL
                        Not a problem. Here to help.

           Matthew starts leaving, doing as he was told.

                                 STORE MANAGER
                        Hey... after you re-shelve.

           Matthew goes back to picking up the clothes off the floor. 
           Troll and Troll’s Friend exit, giggling. Store Manager 
           continues to watch over Matthew.

           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Matthew is sitting down at home, eating sliced fruit 
           despondently. Grandma gets home with a bag of In-n-Out.

                                 GRANDMA
                        I thought you might like something 
                        different, I don’t always know what 
                        you want. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s okay.

           Matthew forces a smile, accepting it. He starts eating out of 
           the bag, opens his phone. 

                                 GRANDMA
                        What else do you want? I can go to 
                        the store. You don’t eat enough.

           Matthew ignores her. He sees that the music video he worked 
           on for Oliver is out. It already has 3 million views, and is 
           #4 on trending. Matthew presses play on the video. 
           It reads “Directed by Oliver & Noah.” Matthew can’t bring 
           himself to watch more, he puts his phone away.

           EXT. LA BREA STREETS - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is biking to work. He passes by a LINE OF PEOPLE, all 
           wearing Oliver merch. There’s a frenzy outside of what 
           appears to be a pop-up store. Oliver is probably in there 
           based on how crazy the fans are going. Oliver is clearly 
           bigger than ever now. Matt stops biking to take a closer 
           look.

           EXT. POP-UP SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew tries to catch a glimpse of Oliver inside the store 
           through the CROWD, but shakes his head and gets back on his 
           bike (like a gambling addict forcing himself to walk away 
           from the casino that bankrupted him). As he stabilizes to 
           pedal away, he gets recognized by a group of SUPER-FANS.

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        Oh my God, my king! It’s Matty. 

                                 SUPERFAN #2
                        That’s him! Matty we love you! 

           Matthew is taken aback.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, hey.

                                 SUPERFAN #3
                        Can we get a picture, please?

           Matthew, not wanting to be seen by Oliver, for fear of 
           getting publicly embarrassed, looks reluctant.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I... was actually about to leave.

           They look disappointed, so he relents and takes the picture.

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        Why are you even out here, can’t 
                        you just skip the line?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I just like to be with the people, 
                        this is where the real fun is at. 
                        Plus all this merch shit gets sent 
                        to my crib, anyway.
           We see Oliver making his way through the crowd from inside 
           the store, and is being escorted by SECURITY. He CLIMBS UP on 
           the security guard’s shoulders and shouts at the crowd.

                                 OLIVER
                        Thank you everybody for coming! Uhm 
                        I gotta feed my snake now but the 
                        store is gonna be open for the rest 
                        of the day! And I’ll see you at The 
                        Echo tonight!

           The crowd screams in a cacophony of cheering and 
           disappointment. Oliver is carried out by his security guard, 
           piggy-back style. Matthew and the super-fans watch him leave. 

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        You’re not gonna go with him?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, I see him every day. I’ll 
                        catch up with him later.

                                 SUPERFAN #2
                        At the Echo? 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Uh, yeah maybe.

           The fans exchange glances, starting to be less impressed with 
           Matthew, suspecting he’s not as close with Oliver as they 
           thought. He can feel himself losing their attention.

                                 SUPERFAN #3
                        You’re not going?

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’ve been to like eight thousand of 
                        his shows... if I hear him play 
                        “Bird Watching” one more time I 
                        might off myself.

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        Self-harm isn’t funny.

           Awkward beat.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (breaking the silence)
                        Are you guys going?

                                 SUPERFAN #2
                        Uh, kind of. It’s 18+ so we like to 
                        go to the parking lot and listen 
                        from there.
                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        We’re losers, basically. We just 
                        close our eyes and pretend we’re in 
                        the balcony seats.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You guys don’t have fake IDs?

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        No, Jelly had one but it got  
                        confiscated. Cause she’s a dumb 
                        bitch.

                                 SUPERFAN #3
                        My dumbass got one that said I was 

                                 SUPERFAN #2
                        You should go! And stream it for us 
                        up close. Oh, and FaceTime us 
                        backstage so we can meet Ollie!

                                 SUPERFAN #1
                        Oh my God, please!

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nah, I really been to way too many 
                        of these. Maybe when he drops some 
                        new music. 

                                 SUPERFAN #2
                        So you’re not really good friends 
                        with him anymore, huh.

           This strikes a buried nerve somewhere inside Matthew. The 
           gears start turning.

           START QUICK CUT MONTAGE. 

           MUSIC CUE: “Hate or Glory” by Gesaffelstein.

           INT. SHERMAN OAKS HOME - THREE HOURS BEFORE CONCERT

           The same group of super-fans at the home of one of their 
           parents. They’re dancing to old Oliver concerts playing on 
           the living room TV. PARENTS come in and glare at them until 
           they turn the music down. They all change into merch bought 
           from the pop-up shop.
           EXT. CONCERT VENUE - SAME TIME

           A LONG LINE is developing outside of the venue. The TOUR 
           MANAGER from the first concert (who walked Shai and Matthew 
           in) emerges from a staff-only side door with his phone out, 
           greeting Matthew warmly. He doesn’t know Matthew has been 
           dead to Oliver for a while.

                                 TOUR MANAGER
                        Ayyyy. Yo my bad, I just saw your 
                        text. 

           EXT. VENUE PARKING LOT - TWO HOURS BEFORE CONCERT

           The Super Fans eagerly wait, wearing Oliver merch, seemingly 
           ready to absorb the concert from the parking lot. They spot 
           Oliver arriving in an SUV and FREAK OUT.

           INT. VENUE OFFICE - EARLIER

           The Tour Manager casually picks up a box of laminated artist 
           passes and holds it out for Matthew. They have a few 
           different designs. We see Matthew’s hand reach for the box.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. VENUE LINE - THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE CONCERT

           The group of super-fans reveal laminated artist passes to 
           SECURITY and get whisked inside, skirting the line as OTHER 
           FANS shoot them dirty looks.

           INT. VENUE - DURING CONCERT

           Our Super Fans enjoy the show from sidestage, loving Oliver. 
           They sneakily share a couple flasks.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - EARLIER

           Matthew checks out at the store - a ton of fruit and then the 
           same flasks we saw being passed around by the fans.

           INT. VENUE, GREEN ROOM - AFTER CONCERT

           The Super Fans, now semi-sloppy and intoxicated, are 
           introduced to Oliver by Swett and Bowen.
           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - EARLIER

           Matthew crushes up the old neighbor’s prescription pills and 
           funnels the resultant powder into the flasks. He puts them 
           into his backpack with the artist passes and slings the 
           backpack over his shoulder.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew bikes somewhere with his backpack on... We FOLLOW 
           him, get close to his face... his eyes stare straight ahead 
           with a fixed indignation.   

           END MONTAGE. END MUSIC.

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - THE NEXT AFTERNOON

           Oliver watches something on a couch, closes his laptop. We 
           reveal Shai sitting next to him. They both have horrified 
           looks on their faces. Oliver gets up with livid purpose and 
           makes a beeline through the living room. He looks up at the 
           ceiling to find: the GoPro Matt and Jamie set up months ago. 
           He gets up on a stool and rips the GoPro out of the wall 
           angrily, then hops back down to find Shai standing right 
           there.

                                 SHAI
                        16 years old?

                                 OLIVER
                             (breathing heavily)
                        No I...

                                 SHAI
                        Jesus Christ.

           Shai storms off, shaking her head in disgust. Oliver looks 
           around. Swett and Bowen are off in the corner playing video 
           games. Oliver walks back over to his laptop and opens it.

           INT. GRANDMA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Matthew is at his laptop, replying an email, ostensibly from 
           Oliver, that reads: “What do you want?” We see Matthew smile, 
           then begin to type out his response: “I just want to finish 
           our documentary!”
           EXT. TOUR BUS - DAYS LATER

           Everyone is filing onto the bus - Swett, Bowen, Noah, Jesse 
           and Oliver. Matthew is filming enthusiastically, but no one 
           is paying attention to him.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Back on the road, again. Tour life 
                        is crayyy-zyyyyy.

           INT. TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew walks down the aisle filming, eye in the camcorder’s 
           viewfinder.

                                 MATTHEW
                        This is where we sleep. This is 
                        where we eat. This is Jesse. Say hi 
                        Jesse.

                                 JESSE
                        Hi, mom.

           Matthew approaches the front, where the driver SPENCER is 
           sitting at the wheel.

                                 MATTHEW
                        This is Spencer, our driver, what’s 
                        it like going on tour with a big 
                        celebrity like Oliver?

                                 SPENCER
                        It’s like chaperoning a bunch of 8-
                        year-olds, except they get to tell 
                        me what to do and I have to listen. 
                        Otherwise, I get fired.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Isn’t that Shai’s job?

                                 SPENCER
                        She ain’t here. Left me to raise 
                        all the kids.

           Matthew seems unaffected by this information, steps out of 
           the bus with the camcorder.

           EXT. TOUR STOP #1 - DAYS LATER, DUSK

           The bus stops in Kentucky. There are FANS flocking outside. 
           Matthew is still filming, eye on the viewfinder. He shoots an 
           EAGER FAN.
                                 MATTHEW
                        Yo, what’s good Kentucky?

                                 EAGER FAN
                        Oh my God, you’re Matty right. Can 
                        I get a pic with you and Oliver?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Of course. Ollie?

           Oliver agrees reluctantly. The eager fan hands a camera to a 
           FRIEND.

                                 OLIVER
                        Uhhh, alright.

                                 EAGER FAN
                        Hey, I just wanna say, your music 
                        helped me a lot. When I found it, 
                        it was just what I needed to help 
                        me grow into who I am.

                                 OLIVER
                        I appreciate that.

           The friend snaps a photo.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Alright, you got it?

                                 FRIEND
                        Yup.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can you send that to me?

           Matthew opens his DM and saves the photo, then puts it on his 
           own Instagram while Oliver gets swarmed by more fans.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Yo, I just sent it to you too, put 
                        it on your story.

           Oliver knows he can’t say no. He’s visibly defeated, 
           operating completely at the whims of Matthew. Matthew’s 
           formerly delicate approach has devolved into shamelessness: 
           he just plainly tells Oliver what to do now. After some 
           squirming, Oliver posts the picture.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        And tag me!
           INT. TOUR STOP #2, TRAMPOLINE PARK - EVENING

           Oliver, Swett, Bowen, Noah and Jesse are jumping around in a 
           foam pit. Matthew runs around with the camera, forcing 
           everyone to be friends with him for the documentary. He 
           starts with Oliver.

                                 MATTHEW
                        So, what is it like to be the most 
                        beloved artist in the world?

                                 OLIVER
                             (playing along)
                        It’s uh, it’s everything I ever 
                        wanted. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        You made it happen.

                                 OLIVER
                        Everybody told me to get a real 
                        job.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And what did you say to them?

                                 OLIVER
                        I said I wanna make music.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Then did what they say?

                                 OLIVER
                        They said I was delusional... that 
                        only one in a billion people get to 
                        live out their dreams.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And what do they say now?

                                 OLIVER
                        They say uh, I don’t know what they 
                        say cause they still work at the 
                        mall and they have to see 
                        billboards of me on Sunset.

                                 MATTHEW
                        They say “Sir, would you like 
                        whipped cream on that Frappucino?”

           Oliver forces a chuckle. Matthew hops over to Swett and 
           Bowen, who exchange glances with each other, like they were 
           just talking about him.
                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        How would you describe your 
                        relationship to Oliver?

                                 SWETT
                        Uh.

                                 BOWEN
                        Um.

                                 SWETT
                        That’s the big homie.

                                 BOWEN
                        I mean, I been with this guy since 
                        day one, he’s my big brother.

                                 SWETT
                        Honestly, we’d probably be working 
                        at the gas station if it wasn’t for 
                        him, so... 

                                 BOWEN
                        I would’ve killed myself for sure.

           Matthew hops over to Jesse, and we briefly stay with Swett 
           and Bowen as they look over at Oliver. The three exchange 
           looks like: We gotta deal with this... 

           INT. TOUR BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Matthew sits on his bunk, editing footage. Oliver comes by 
           and sits next to him. He’s being nice and conciliatory.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yo, you think you got enough 
                        footage now? I can’t wait to see 
                        it, man.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What do you mean?

                                 OLIVER
                        For your doc.

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s your doc! And I was thinking I 
                        should just keep capturing shit for 
                        like the next couple years and then 
                        people will really be able to see 
                        the progression, you know... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        and really see our relationship 
                        develop over time and shit. Gotta 
                        make it super organic.

           Oliver is imploding: couple years???

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, I feel that.

           Oliver is a shell of himself, a pussy if you will. He has got 
           to figure out a way out of this. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Oliver sits alone on his bed, drinking liquor with the hotel-
           provided bath robe on. A KNOCK at the door rattles him. He 
           goes up to the peep hole, it’s Matthew. For the first time, 
           Oliver is on the other side of a lens. Oliver sighs. Another 
           KNOCK, louder. Oliver goes back to the bed and takes another 
           swig, hoping Matthew will give up. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Room service! I know you’re in 
                        there.

           Another, louder KNOCK. Oliver walks over and unbolts the 
           door. Matthew walks in.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Hey.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey. Sorry, I couldn’t hear 
                        anything, had my headphones in. 

           Matthew scans the room for headphones, doesn’t see any.

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s cool, just figured both our 
                        rooms have two beds, no need to be 
                        wasting all that space by 
                        ourselves. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I know you get lonely.

           Pause.
                                 OLIVER
                        Nah I’m good, you know. We spend so 
                        much time on the bus with everyone, 
                        it’s nice to have a little quiet.

           After a beat of silence, Matthew inexplicably grabs Oliver 
           and playfully — but terrifyingly — pushes him onto the bed. 
           He then starts jumping up and down on the bed, leaping from 
           double bed to double bed. 

           Oliver is not participating, but Matthew encourages him to 
           jump on the beds with him. He doesn’t, so Matthew starts 
           wrestling with him on the bed. It’s excruciatingly awkward, a 
           physical display of how the power dynamic has shifted.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Matthew and Oliver are both in bath robes now. There’s a room 
           service cart with a fruit platter beside them. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Can you cut up the apple for us, I 
                        don’t like it like that.

           Oliver obliges. The knife doesn’t go unconsidered. Matthew, 
           sitting next to Oliver in bliss, opens his mouth as if to 
           say: feed me. Oliver obliges, placing cut up apple pieces 
           into Matthew’s open mouth.

           INT. TOUR BUS - THE NEXT DAY

           Matthew is editing documentary footage. Oliver is in the back 
           with Swett, Bowen, and Jesse, discussing something.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ollie!

           Oliver comes over to Matthew.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Check this out.

           Matthew shows Oliver footage from the previous night’s 
           concert where he stage-dove. Oliver couldn’t be less 
           interested.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s tight.

           Oliver sees the folders on Matt’s laptop. There’s an external 
           hard drive attached. 
           Most folders are labeled by concert dates (”Denver-4/16”, 
           etc.)... but one of the folders is labeled “GoPro Hero8.” 

           Oliver’s gears start turning: that’s where the blackmail 
           footage is. If I can just get that from him, I’ll be free. 
           Oliver perks up, sits down next to Matthew in the bunk.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Lemme see Memphis. That one had to 
                        be insane.

           Matthew is happy to keep showing Oliver stuff.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Oliver is sitting on one of two double beds with a GIRL. 
           They’ve been drinking. Oliver is a bit loopy, he’s clearly 
           started to hit the liquor a bit harder on this tour.

                                 GIRL
                        Why don’t you believe me?

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s not that I don’t believe you, 
                        I just have to be extra careful.

                                 GIRL
                        Fine.

           The Girl gets off the bed in a huff, grabs her wallet out of 
           her purse, and produces a driver’s license for Oliver to 
           inspect. He inspects it. She puts her hands on her hips, 
           impatiently.

                                 OLIVER
                        Do you have anything else?

           She rolls her eyes, then pulls out her phone to show him 
           pictures of her college graduation ceremony.

                                 GIRL
                        You happy?

                                 OLIVER
                        You’re not like a kid genius or 
                        something, are you? Like one of 
                        those kids that skipped 9 grades?

                                 GIRL
                        Nope.

           They start hooking up until we hear a KNOCK at the door. 
           Oliver is shaken, the Girl is not. 
                                 OLIVER
                        Don’t open it.

                                 GIRL
                        What?

           She goes up to the peephole to find: Matthew and OTHER GIRL. 

                                 GIRL (CONT'D)
                        It’s just Matty.

           She opens the door.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ayyyyyy... 

           Oliver is not into it. 

                                 OTHER GIRL
                        Don’t stop cause of us! It’s fine.

                                 OLIVER
                        Nah we were--

                                 MATTHEW
                             (demanding)
                        --Go ahead.

                                 OLIVER
                        We were just chilling honestly, I’m 
                        so exhausted.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You had them switch your room?

                                 OLIVER
                        What?

                                 MATTHEW
                        The front desk, they told me you 
                        didn’t like your room.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah, it had a--

                                 MATTHEW
                        --You guys, seriously, don’t be shy 
                        around us. We just wanted some 
                        company.

           Oliver is feeling pressured on all sides.

                                 GIRL
                        I don’t mind.
                                 OTHER GIRL
                             (smiling conspiratorially)
                        Me neither.

           He’s cornered, plus he knows he needs to keep Matthew 
           appeased for the time being.

           The Girl starts making out with Oliver on one bed. He gives 
           in. On the other bed, Matthew and the Other Girl start making 
           out. The Girl starts unzipping Oliver’s pants. Matthew 
           encourages the Other Girl to do the same to him. Matthew 
           shifts his body so that he’s in a parallel orientation to 
           Oliver. The two girls are into it. The Girl gets on top of 
           Oliver and starts riding him. The Other Girl starts riding 
           Matthew. Matthew swivels his head to look over at Oliver. 
           They lock eyes. Matthew smiles.

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

           The tour bus speeds along into the night.

           INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           Matthew lies in his bunk, the bus rocking him to sleep as he 
           scrolls Instagram. He gets a text from his Grandma: it’s a 
           selfie of her in a new house for which Matthew is ostensibly 
           footing the bill. 

           Another text comes in: “Thank you Matty! I always knew you 
           would be so successful!” 

           Another: a picture of Grandma’s feet up on new furniture 
           inside the house, followed by “Now I can relax!” Matthew 
           smiles, responds to her with heart emojis.

           The bus stops. The curtain to his bunk opens and he gets 
           dragged out by several hands, forcefully. He thinks he’s 
           being harmlessly pranked.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You guys, I was sleeping!

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 

           Matthew getting STOMPED out in the middle of the desert. They 
           break his camera. Matthew shrieks.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Stop!
           They break all his equipment: his laptop, his hard drive, 
           etc. Swett takes Matthew’s phone out of his pocket while 
           Noah, Jesse, and Bowen hold him down. After realizing his e-
           mail has a password, Swett gets up in Matthew’s face. Matthew 
           looks up at him, bloody.

                                 SWETT
                        What’s your e-mail password?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Come on, guys.

           Bowen slaps the SHIT out of him. Matthew starts whimpering.

                                 BOWEN
                        What’s the password?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Stop, why are you doing this? I’m 
                        your little bro.

           Oliver slaps him.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Okay, okay.

           Pause.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        It’s... 
                             (spelling it out)
                        O... L... I... V... E... R... F... 
                        A... N... 94... 

           Pause.

                                 OLIVER
                             (taken aback)
                        What the fuck... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        You changed my life. I felt alone 
                        until I heard your music. I used to 
                        be depressed and feel like there 
                        was no one who understood me. But 
                        you spoke to me. You got me 
                        through... so much.

                                 OLIVER
                        Jesus fucking Christ. What the fuck 
                        are you even talking about right 
                        now. You’re like just making up 
                        words.
           Matthew is starting to smile, his bloody grinning face looks 
           sickening.

           Meanwhile, Swett has opened Matthew’s phone and is deleting 
           the emails with the incriminating footage. Then they stomp 
           his phone out with the rest of his stuff. Matthew is unfazed.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I love you Oliver. Now we get to be 
                        together, forever. Think about it. 
                        No one knows you like I do, Ollie. 
                        No one understands people like us, 
                        that’s why we have to stick 
                        together. That’s why we have to 
                        take care of each other. 

           Oliver’s head is in his hands, stressed out. The rest of the 
           crew starts hitting Matthew again and he just starts 
           laughing, spitting up blood. He grins through two more 
           punches before being knocked unconscious. CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. PREMIERE - 6 MONTHS LATER - EVENING 

           CHYRON: 6 MONTHS LATER

           We’re seeing the end of the documentary.

           On the theater screen: Oliver and the rest of the crew 
           screaming and laughing in the foam pit at the trampoline 
           park. Then it cuts to: Oliver’s crew wrestling at a tour stop 
           gas station. Looks like they’re all having fun as a group of 
           friends. Then it cuts to: various concert BTS shots, ending 
           with innocuous green room footage from the concert used to 
           blackmail Oliver. We glimpse the super-fans giggling 
           hysterically, but nothing incriminating. Then it cuts to:

           Early footage from Oliver’s house, from when Matthew was 
           asking him questions in the back patio while he circled 
           around on his bike.

                                 MATTHEW
                        What is your greatest fear?

                                 OLIVER
                        Probably uhh, being broke. Nah, uh, 
                        probably... just being 
                        misunderstood. I just want people 
                        to connect with me. My greatest 
                        fear is probably... no one relating 
                        to me. And everyone pretending that 
                        they do... 
           INT. PREMIERE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

           We see the credits roll. The AUDIENCE erupts into applause. 
           WE SEE: “Directed by Matthew Morning.”

           INT. PREMIERE THEATER - AFTER SHOWING, MOMENTS LATER

           A MODERATOR comes out. Matthew and Oliver step up to do the 
           Q&A. We see some familiar faces in the crowd: Sebastian, 
           Matthew’s Grandma, etc.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Alright, sounds like you guys liked 
                        it.

           The CROWD erupts into cheering.

                                 MODERATOR (CONT'D)
                        Oliver and Matthew are gonna answer 
                        some questions, so raise your hands 
                        and I’ll call on you.

           Hands shoot up and the Moderator looks around, allowing the 
           tension to build. He points to a THIRSTY FAN.

                                 MODERATOR (CONT'D)
                        You. In the pink hoodie. Just say 
                        your name and then your question.

                                 THIRSTY FAN
                        Hi, I’m Gerald.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey, Gerald.

                                 THIRSTY FAN
                        I just wanna ask Oliver. Um, what 
                        inspires you?

                                 OLIVER
                        To be honest, people telling me 
                        that I can’t do something. That 
                        gives me the motivation to go do it 
                        and prove them wrong.

           The Moderator points to BLUE SHIRT FAN.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Okay, you, over there in the blue 
                        shirt.

                                 BLUE SHIRT FAN
                        Me?
                                 MODERATOR
                        Yeah, you.

                                 BLUE SHIRT FAN 
                        Hi, my name is Lisa and I just 
                        wanted to ask um, how does it feel 
                        to be a Grammy-nominated artist?

           Oliver and Matthew smile at each other.

                                 OLIVER
                             (chuckles)
                        I don’t give a fuck about those 
                        suits. I wanna be here with the 
                        kids, you know. But for real, it 
                        does feel good to be acknowledged.

           Oliver points over to another fan, OSCAR, a little kid 
           dressed just like Oliver.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        You, I wanna hear your question. 
                        You look cool as fuck. I like your 
                        hat.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hi, my name is Oscar.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hi, Oscar.

                                 OSCAR
                        Um, this is a question for Matthew.

           Oliver hands the mic to Matthew.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Hey Oscar, what’s up lil bro.

                                 OSCAR
                        I just want to know, I really look 
                        up to you, and I... I take photos 
                        and stuff too... 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Take your time, don’t be nervous.

                                 OSCAR
                        I just wanted to say, umm, I wanna 
                        be like you when I grow up. What do 
                        I have to do?
                                 MATTHEW
                        Just be yourself, stay true to who 
                        you are, you know. And you’ll find 
                        success the right way. Oh, and pick 
                        some real friends to help you get 
                        there, because you’re not shit 
                        without your team.

           The crowd erupts. Oliver smiles, hugs Matthew. 

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m proud of you, dog.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m proud of you!

                                 OLIVER
                        This is your night, though.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Well, I wanna thank a couple people 
                        real quick... because this was a 
                        team effort. Swett and Bowen, 
                        you’re my brothers for life. Clap 
                        for them please. 

           We see Swett and Bowen in the audience, nodding along to 
           applause. There’s a strained tension in their faces.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Noah, you’re like my mentor, for 
                        real. I learned everything I know 
                        from that man.

           We see Noah in the audience, accepting the applause with a 
           reserved humility. 

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Shai, I don’t know what I’m gonna 
                        do without her... she moved on to 
                        bigger and better things, but she’s 
                        still the mother and father figure 
                        to all of us...

           We hear applause. Matthew moves right along.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        Oh and my boy Jamie, of course, who 
                        makes sure everything is always 
                        backed up and secure. He’s kinda 
                        behind the behind the scenes but 
                        there’s no doc without him so 
                        please show him some love.
           We reveal Jamie in the audience. They share a knowing nod. 
           CLOSE on Oliver, stone-faced for a second. Matthew throws his 
           arm around Oliver, who has a recessed fear in his eyes.

                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        And of course, there’s this guy... 
                        the boy... Oliver. I just wanna 
                        thank you for believing in me. This 
                        guy found me when no one gave a 
                        shit, so he must’ve seen something 
                        special in me. And I’m just 
                        grateful he gave me a chance... Oh 
                        wait, and one more thing I wanna 
                        say... if you have a dream... don’t 
                        let anyone take it from you. They 
                        just don’t wanna see you win. 
                        Remember, the only person that can 
                        get in your way is you...

                                 MODERATOR
                        Okay, we got time for one more... 
                        you.

                                 LAST FAN
                        Hey! Um, so, I’ve been trying to 
                        meet people that wanna make music 
                        and videos and creative stuff like 
                        that with me. How did you guys find 
                        each other and become a team?

           Oliver accepts the microphone back from Matthew.

                                 OLIVER
                        Well, uh, me and Matty just clicked 
                        as soon as we met. He was just a 
                        random kid working at a store. But 
                        there was something about him that 
                        was different, and eventually I 
                        learned that he is just the most 
                        persistent, hard-working, thorough 
                        collaborator. And I can say that 
                        without this guy right here, I 
                        definitely wouldn’t be standing in 
                        front of you right now. Alright, 
                        that’s it for me, goodnight.

           The crowd gives a STANDING OVATION. As Matthew basks in the 
           attention, everyone finally taking pictures of HIM, we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           THE END.
