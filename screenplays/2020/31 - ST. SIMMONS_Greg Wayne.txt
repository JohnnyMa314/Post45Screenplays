           FADE IN:

           An impish, middle-aged man with a delightfully frizzy afro, 
           wearing a sparkly red tank top and dolphin shorts grins at 
           us...

           The twinkle in his eye is the most mischievous thing 
           imaginable. He’s outrageously, fabulously effeminate. He’s a 
           glorious bundle of light and love...

           He’s RICHARD FUCKING SIMMONS.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s sweatin’ time!

           Multicolored lights blast on behind him, revealing rows of 
           HAPPY PEOPLE of all shapes and sizes in workout gear.

           Richard leads them in a fun, energized, cheekily-sexy 
           aerobics routine.

           The TODAY SHOW bug appears in the lower corner of the screen.

                        For forty years, this has been the 
                        Richard Simmons the public has been 
                        accustomed to seeing -- energetic 
                        and irresistible.

                        But the fitness guru disappeared 
                        from the public eye in 2014, 
                        leaving many -- including his 
                        closest friends -- deeply 
                        concerned.

                        But Simmons is now breaking his 
                        silence, after opening up to us by 
                        phone.

           Richard, via phone, tries to conjure the liveliness seen in 
           the video clips. But there’s a despondency he can’t hide...

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        Savannah, it’s Richard Simmons. How 
                        are you?
                                 SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (V.O.)

                        I’m feeling good. I’m just sort 
                        of... enjoying the day.

                        What do you make of people being 
                        fearful that you’ve become a

                        Yunno, I do what I want to, as I’ve 
                        always done. 
                        People should just respect that I 
                        know what’s best for Richard 
                        Simmons, because, like... I’m 
                        Richard Simmons.

                        You’ve always been very public and 
                        open about going through ups and 
                        downs, and your own struggles with 
                        depression and different things.

                        Survival has always -- yunno -- 
                        meant a lot, when you’re an 
                        overweight kid, and you’re made fun 
                        of, and you’re put down. 
                        Some of that stuff never leaves 
                        you, Savannah. It always sort of is 
                        like a shadow, like Peter Pan.

                                 SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (V.O.)
                        Are you surprised that people have 
                        been so worried about you?

           a massive gathering of PEOPLE in an aerobics routine. These

                        For all the people that are 
                        worrying about me. I want to tell 
                        them that I love them, with my 
                        whole heart and soul...
                        I just really... don’t want to do 
                        anything.

           Richard raises his arms, as if in a blessing, to his flock in 
           the square.

                                                                 BLACK.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL - DAY

           BISHOP RUMMEL (80), an ancient Roman Catholic relic, delivers 
           a droning sermon to the pews full of khaki uniform-clad 
           ELEMENTARY SCHOOLERS in this grand, 18th century church.

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        ...And St. John de Brebeuf left 
                        France because he knew the Gospel 
                        must be spread, and traveled to 
                        serve the Huron nation in Canada...

           Seated front row center, clutching a Bible to his chest, and 
           gazing at the giant crucified Jesus on the stage, is MILTON 
           SIMMONS (10), a cherub with a frizzy afro, an effeminate way, 
           and that mischievous sparkle in his eyes. 

           Milton is Richard, before the name change. For simplicity’s 
           sake, let’s just call him Richard.

           Richard is different from the other kids. Simply put, he’s 
           fat -- like challenging the integrity of his belt fat.

           Next to him is LENNY SIMMONS (12), Richard’s more handsome 
           and less frizzy brother, who’s zoned out on this sermon. 

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        ...The land had roaming bands of 
                        Iroquois determined to kill and 
                        torture every Huron, or Frenchman, 
                        they met...

           Richard’s gaze drifts to TOM (10), the beautiful altar boy on 
           the stage. 

           Tom smiles at Richard. Wriggles his fingers in a little wave.

           Richard smiles back. Blushes. Looks away.
           MOOSE (12), the resident bruiser, leans forward to whisper in 
           Richard’s ear.

                                 MOOSE
                        Hey, retard. Ever smell pussy?

           BILLY (12), the jock next to Moose, chuckles.

                                 BILLY
                        Pussy’s the only thing fat faggot 
                        doesn’t eat.

                                 RICHARD
                             (turns to face them)
                        Did someone say eat? That communion 
                        wafer wasn’t enough for me -- I’m 
                        starving.

           Moose and Billy roll their eyes -- annoyed they couldn’t get 
           Richard’s goat.

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        ...And as the Iroquois drank his 
                        blood, de Brebeuf turned to his 
                        fellow captives and said, “Bear up 
                        with courage under the few torments 
                        remaining. The sufferings will end 
                        with your lives... The grandeur 
                        which follows will never have an 
                        end.”

           This brings a smile to Richard’s lips.

           The church bells vibrate through the pews. The children 
           spring to their feet and rush to the exit.

           Richard grabs his book bag. Bobs, weaves, and races past the 
           other kids, into the warm Louisiana sunlight.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER

           New Orleans is drunk early today. PEOPLE chat, laugh, and 
           dance from the church steps to the nearby Mississippi.

           Richard surveys the scene -- delighted.

           The sound of a brass band playing a festive tune drifts in 
           from the distance. Richard dashes, with a penguin-like 
           waddle, toward the music.

           Lenny ducks his head out of the church.
                                 LENNY
                        Don’t be late for dinner!

                                 RICHARD
                        I never am!

           I./E. CANAL STREET - VARIOUS - DAY

           Richard weaves through the thick crowd. PEOPLE everywhere are 
           dressed in loud colors, feathered masks, and wild costumes.  

           It’s Mardi Gras, and Richard feels completely at home. 

           He rips off his tie. Loosens his belt. And can finally 
           breathe. 

           The BRASS BAND blows loud and proud as they dance down the 
           parade route. Their song carries us through...

           --A MARDI GRAS INDIAN CHIEF in an insanely ostentatious, 
           feathery costume dances for the crowd. Richard leaps in front 
           of him and shows off his own unhinged dance moves.

           --Richard ducks into a SWEET SHOP. He slides a nickel across 
           the counter. The SHOPKEEPER flashes a knowing grin and hands 
           Richard a bag of creamy dreamy pralines.

           --Richard sells his pralines to REVELERS for a dime a piece.

           --Richard dumps a load of candy bars on a CORNER STORE 
           counter. Pays for them with a few of his dimes.

           --Richard polishes off a candy bar. His jaw drops at a 
           scantily costumed WOMAN. He scurries over... And bites one of 
           her toned, glistening calves. She yelps and smacks his head.

           --Richard marches with a gaggle of DRAG QUEENS. Their blonde 
           leader winks at him. Places her wig on his head.

           --He jumps on the back of the iconic court jester float. 
           Raises his arms in triumph... And is hit by a barrage of 
           Mardi Gras beads.

           INT. D.H. HOLMES DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           The brass band fades away. Richard is in the doll section. He 
           gazes at a Barbie, clad in a zebra striped swimsuit.

           Richard glances around... Opens the Barbie box. 

           He wraps his stubby fingers around the doll’s teeny waist -- 
           wow, so skinny.
           Richard catches a glimpse of himself in a nearby mirror. He 
           frowns. Sucks in his bulbous stomach.

           1950’s Barbies all have bitchy sneers on their faces -- this 
           one looks like it’s judging him.

           He rips the Barbie’s head off. Crams its body in his bag.

           A slow, gently-jazzy baseline eases toward Richard. His ears 
           perk up.

           Then he hears it... Her voice...

                                 HER VOICE
                             (singing)
                        Now you say you’re lonely
                        You cry the lone night through
                        Well you can cry me a river
                        Cry me a river
                        I cried a river over you...

           Richard is drawn toward her dulcet tones. He finds himself in 
           the electronics section.

           A record spins on a turntable. The album cover beside it...

           Richard is transfixed by the woman on the cover. Her full, 
           pursed lips behind a microphone. Her mysterious, gleaming 
           eyes. Her pronounced yet perfect nose...

           It’s BARBRA STREISAND at age twenty-one, gracing the cover of 
           THE BARBRA STREISAND ALBUM.

           With his eyes locked on Barbra’s image, Richard mimes a 
           microphone in his hand. Purses his lips like hers. 

           His eyes gleam.

           INT. GIN’S CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Chinese lanterns glow down upon the bustling dining room.

           Richard drools over the menu at a table with his mother 
           SHIRLEY (47), father LEONARD (61), and brother Lenny.

           Leonard is a slender, neat man -- the spitting image of Fred 
           Astaire -- with beautiful eyes that you wish weren’t so hard. 
           He turns to the WAITER.

                                 LEONARD
                        Chicken chow mein, glazed pork 
                        belly, and beef with broccoli for 
                        the table. 
                                 LENNY
                        Dad, can I have an egg roll?

                                 LEONARD
                        Sure.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to waiter)
                        We’ll also have the lobster yee 
                        mein, orange chicken, annnd--

           Leonard grabs Richard’s menu. Shakes his head at the waiter.

           The waiter nods. Takes the menus. Departs.

           Shirley, with a gentle heart that belies her glamorous 
           exterior, softens Leonard’s blow with a smile to Richard.

                                 LENNY
                        We got our report cards today.

           Lenny presents his report card to Leonard, who scans it.

                                 LEONARD
                        Excellent. Very nice.
                             (to Richard)
                        Where’s yours?

                                 RICHARD
                        I didn’t get one... Mother Mary 
                        Porter died.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Oh my God.

                                 LEONARD
                        Mother Mary Porter did not die.
                             (glares at Richard)
                        Give it to me.

           Richard pulls out his report card. Hands it to Shirley.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        This is good, honey. What were you 
                        so ashamed of?

           Richard shrugs. Lenny glances at the report card.

                                 LENNY
                        A “C” in conduct is almost failing.
                                 LEONARD
                             (to Richard)
                        Quit acting up. The classroom isn’t 
                        your stage.

           Richard scowls... But remembers something. His eyes sparkle.

                                 RICHARD
                        I found my new favorite singer 
                        today.

           He pulls Barbra’s album out of his bag. Shows it off.

                                 RICHARD
                        The lady at the store said she’s 
                        performing at the Saenger on the 
                        third. I have to go.

                                 LEONARD
                        Your confirmation is on the third -- 
                        and nobody needs you going to any 
                        performances.

                                 RICHARD
                        Can’t I just skip my confirmation?

                                 LEONARD
                        That’d make it real hard to get 
                        into seminary school.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well maybe I don’t want to be a 
                        priest.

           Leonard’s eyes blaze. But he’s got something in his back 
           pocket...

                                 LEONARD
                        Your mother is going on a trip 
                        tomorrow.

                                 RICHARD
                             (jumps out of his chair)
                        Again?!

                          LEONARD
                                                         SHIRLEY
           Sit down.
                                              I’m sorry, sweetheart.

                                 RICHARD
                        No -- you can’t keep leaving -- 
                        it’s not fair -- it’s... bullshit!

           Nearby DINERS scowl at this foul mouthed little boy.
           The waiter arrives with the food. Places it on the table.

                                 LEONARD
                             (to the waiter)
                        Call a cab. My son is going home.

           The waiter nods. Rushes off.

           Richard glowers at Leonard. 

           Gazes at the steaming, savory food... 

           And stomps out of the restaurant.

           INT. SIMMONS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The last room of this shotgun house -- all the rooms are in a 
           direct line with each other, like living in a train.

           The ceilings are high, with ornate moldings and chandeliers. 
           The walls are decorated with Simmons family photos.

           Richard’s tear-brimmed eyes are locked on the big, white 
           refrigerator. He’s in checkerboard pajamas.

           He stalks to the fridge. Hauls open the door...

           A bevy of food worthy of a fine restaurant stares out at him.

           Richard dives in. Cheese, cold cuts, pie, leftovers -- they 
           all fly down his gullet. Food stains his PJs. 

           The binge of all binges.

           INT. SIMMONS RESIDENCE - RICHARD’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The walls of the tidy bedroom are covered with movie posters: 
           SINGIN’ IN THE RAIN, CINDERELLA, PILLOW TALK, and the like.

           Richard holds his achey belly. Places his new Barbra album on 
           the nightstand, behind a little piggy bank.

           He slips the remaining dimes from his praline sales into the 
           bank. Smiles at Barbra’s image on the album cover.

           Richard reaches into his book bag... 

           Pulls out the Barbie doll body.

           He opens his closet. Whips a sheet off something big...
           It’s a decrepit dollhouse in Antebellum fashion. And it is 
           full of headless Barbies.

           Richard sets the new Barbie body with the zebra swimsuit, and 
           three others -- in a gold gown, red bikini, and blue dress, 
           respectively -- around the kitchen table.

           Richard does a little scene with these four headless dolls. 
           For the ZEBRA SWIMSUIT, he uses a deep male voice. For GOLD 
           GOWN, a high pitched voice. BLUE DRESS has a bratty voice. 
           And RED BIKINI speaks in Richard’s own voice.

                                 ZEBRA SWIMSUIT
                        A “C” in conduct?! Mother Mary 
                        Porter must be a crackpot -- the 
                        kids all love your jokes and gags. 
                        Milty, I’m going to march in there 
                        tomorrow and--

                                 RED BIKINI
                        It’s okay, Dad. I’ve already 
                        forgiven her -- for she knows not 
                        what she does.

                                 ZEBRA SWIMSUIT
                        Lenny, why can’t you be more like 
                        your brother?

                                 BLUE DRESS
                        I’m trying, Dad. Milty’s just so 
                        good at everything.

                                 RED BIKINI
                        Dad, please don’t be so hard on 
                        Lenny. He’s my brother, and I love 
                        him.

                                 ZEBRA SWIMSUIT
                        You’re right. I’m sorry, Milty... 
                        Shirley, can I please eat your 
                        pussy?

                                 GOLD GOWN
                        Of course, darling. I’d love that.

                                 ZEBRA SWIMSUIT
                        Thank you.

           Richard places Gold Gown on her back atop the kitchen table, 
           and rubs Zebra Swimsuit back and forth on top of her.

                                 GOLD GOWN
                        That feels good.
                                 ZEBRA SWIMSUIT
                        Yes, that feels very good.

                                 GOLD GOWN
                        I like when you eat my pussy--

           Richard hears the front door open -- his family’s voices 
           drift into the room.

           Richard throws the sheet over the dollhouse. Slams the closet 
           door. Jumps into bed.

           INT. SIMMONS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Leonard places three plates of eggs Benedict on the table. 
           Lenny joins him. They dig in.

           Richard rushes in. Leaps onto his chair. Grabs a fork and--

           Leonard notices the food stains on Richard’s PJs.

           He grabs Richard’s plate. Dumps the food in the trash.

                                 RICHARD
                        Dad, I’m starving!

                                 LEONARD
                        I’m taking you to the doctor.

                                 RICHARD
                        But I’m not sick.

           INT. DR. HALLMAN’S CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Sickly green walls. Harsh neon lights.

           Richard is nearly naked and completely miserable. He’s seated 
           on the cold, metal exam table. His stomach fat rolls over his 
           Jockey shorts. His arms are crossed to hide his flabby chest.

           Leonard is seated by the door -- impassive.

           DR. HALLMAN (60), balding and distant, opens the door. Gets a 
           load of Richard...

                                 DR. HALLMAN
                        Whoa. You’re a big fella.

           Richard sighs.
           QUICK FLASHES:

           --Hallman grips Richard’s belly fat with a pair of calipers.

           --Richard’s eyes plead to Leonard. Leonard looks away.

           --Richard steps onto a medical scale. Hallman adjusts the 
           weights on the balance bar.

           --A wince betrays Hallman’s face.

           --Tears well up in Richard’s eyes.

           INT. DR. HALLMAN'S CLINIC - OFFICE - DAY

           Richard and Leonard sit across the desk from Dr. Hallman. 

                                 DR. HALLMAN
                        We’ve got to get some weight off 
                        you. Start this diet today.

           Hallman hands Richard a sheet of paper.

           Richard reads it. His soul fills with dread.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - SPORTS FIELD - DAY

           Richard is alone on the bleachers. He watches his male 
           classmates play shirts vs. skins flag football.

           FATHER LAWANGA (40), a human buzzcut of a PE teacher, glances 
           at Richard.

                                 FATHER LAWANGA
                        Asthma not getting any better, huh?
                             (Richard shakes his head)
                        You’ll never feel good unless you 
                        get some exercise.

           Richard takes a passive aggressive hit from an asthma puffer.

           Lawanga shakes his head. Turns his attention to the game.

           Richard spots Tom, the gorgeous altar boy, on the skins team.

           He gazes at Tom’s glistening, athletic torso.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           A reel-to-reel projector plays a choppy, black and white film 
           for Richard and his classmates...
           ON THE PROJECTION SCREEN: RALPH, a middle aged man, and 
           JIMMY, a teen boy, fish by a secluded river.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        What Jimmy didn’t know was that 
                        Ralph was sick. A sickness that was 
                        not visible like small pox, but no 
                        less dangerous and contagious -- a 
                        sickness of the mind... You see, 
                        Ralph was a homosexual...

           Richard furrows his brow -- disturbed.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...A person who demands an intimate 
                        relationship with members of their 
                        own sex.

           Richard glances a few desks down -- catches Tom’s eye.

           Tom stifles a chuckle -- amused by the film. He gives Richard 
           a grin and a shrug.  

           Richard grins back.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        One never knows when the homosexual 
                        is about. He may appear normal, and 
                        it may be too late when you 
                        discover he is mentally ill.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Richard gazes at the trays of meatloaf and mashed potatoes...

           He sighs. Places a half grapefruit on his lunch tray.

           ANNA (10), cute and roguish, steps up beside him.

                                 ANNA
                        Hey, Milty. Wanna eat with us?

           Richard smiles.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Richard and Anna sit at a table with SUSIE, LINDA, and 
           PATTIE. All three girls are ten years old and slender. Their 
           plates are loaded with meatloaf.

                                 SUSIE/LINDA/PATTIE
                        Hey, Milty./How are you?/Milty!
                                 ANNA
                        We were just talking about the time 
                        you whoopie-cushioned Mother Mary 
                        Porter.

                                 PATTIE
                        Fuck that whore.

                                 LINDA
                        I still think that fat bitch really 
                        farted.

                                 SUSIE
                        I bet she takes it up the ass.

           The girls giggle.

           Richard’s jaw drops -- delighted by the crude language.

                                 PATTIE
                             (re: Richard’s lunch)
                        You’re just having a grapefruit?

                                 RICHARD
                             (embarrassed)
                        My dad put me on a diet... I guess 
                        I need to lose some weight.

           Anna notices the woe in Richard’s eyes... She gets an idea.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - GIRLS ROOM - DAY

           Richard gazes into the open prescription bottle in Anna’s 
           hand... It is full of little red capsules.

                                 ANNA
                        My mom takes these. She lost a 
                        ton... Maybe they’ll help you.

           Susie, Linda, and Pattie bob their heads.

                                 SUSIA/LINDA/PATTIE
                        They work./My mom takes them too./I 
                        can steal some for you.

           Richard is wide eyed. He fishes a pill out of the bottle.

           Susie hands him a Dixie cup of water. Anna touches his arm.

                                 ANNA
                        Go ahead.

           Richard pops the pill. Swallows it with water.
           He waits for something to happen...

           Richard’s skin begins to glow... then glitter, like he’s 
           covered in Swarovski crystals.

           ...A beaming smile blossoms on his face...

           I./E. NEW ORLEANS - VARIOUS

           --Richard dances down busy BOURBON STREET.

           --Leonard and Lenny feast on bacon and eggs. Richard eats a 
           tiny bite of dry toast. Flashes a sly grin at Leonard.

           --MOTHER MARY PORTER (65), a very toad-like nun, hands 
           Richard his marked test -- he got an A+!

           --Anna, Susie, Linda, and Pattie open bottles of diet pills 
           for Richard. Each has a different color: red, pink, yellow, 
           green.

           --Richard pops a pink and a yellow pill at once.

           --Richard is in the CHURCH CONFESSIONAL. He yaps a mile a 
           minute at the PRIEST behind the screen...

                                 RICHARD
                        I steal dolls all the time -- all 
                        the time -- but I don’t just steal 
                        them -- I rip their heads off. 
                        I was soooo gluttonous -- I’d shove 
                        anything in my face -- but that was 
                        the old me -- I’m fine now.
                        I make my dad’s life hell -- but 
                        he’s a jerk anyway.
                        I have very unsavory thoughts -- 
                        lustful, I guess -- and I wonder if 
                        I should touch myself--

                        That’s enough, son -- it’s been two 
                        hours.

           --Richard pops a pink, a yellow, a blue, and a red pill at 
           the same time. He flicks out his tongue like a happy lizard.

           --Richard is on the skins team in football. But he care not 
           about his fat on display. He bolts down the field -- easily 
           outruns Moose, the bully. 

           Tom throws Richard the ball... Touchdown! 

           Father Lawanga leaps up and cheers.
           --Susie, Linda, and Pattie look on in horror as Richard grabs 
           Anna by the collar.

                                 RICHARD
                        I said gimme some fucking pills!

           --Anna hands Richard a new prescription bottle. Richard’s 
           mouth waters at the nasty looking black pills inside.

           --Richard pops a black pill. Swallows it dry.

           --Richard runs past ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL with three adorable 
           Dalmatians behind him. He grins up at the bell tower. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Thank you, God!

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - THEATRE WINGS - NIGHT

           BOYS in suits and GIRLS in white dresses fill the air with 
           nervous chatter.

           Richard, crammed into a suit, peeks through the curtain into 
           the theatre. PARENTS filter inside and take their seats.

           Richard spots Leonard and Lenny in their seats, third row 
           center. There’s an empty seat next to them.

           Richard frowns. Turns -- Tom is right beside him, looking 
           fantastic in his suit.

                                 TOM
                        You okay, Milty?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...My mom’s not here.
                             (shakes it off)
                        Can I talk to you for a minute?

           Tom flashes his million dollar smile.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - SPORTS FIELD - NIGHT

           A crystal clear night. No one around. 

           Richard and Tom stroll side-by-side to the 50 yard line.

                                 TOM
                        You nervous about confirmation?

                                 RICHARD
                        No. I love being on stage.
           But Richard does look nervous. Something’s on his mind...

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Do you want to go to spring 
                        formal with me?

                                 TOM
                             (halts, blushes)
                        ...We’re supposed to go with girls.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah... But that’s a stupid rule. 
                        We should be able to go with 
                        whatever friend we want.

           Tom ponders this. 

           Ricard gazes at him -- hopeful and anxious.

                                 RICHARD
                        So--

           Tom punches Richard in the stomach--

           Richard staggers back--

           Tom knees him in the balls--

           Richard crumples to the ground -- his breath wheezes.

                                 TOM
                             (spits on Richard)
                        I’m not queer, you fucking faggot.

           Richard struggles to his feet. Full of confusion... Shame.

                                 TOM
                        You have a sickness of the mind -- 
                        don’t infect me.

           Richard wants to speak -- but can barely breathe.

           Tom spots a stray lacrosse stick. Picks it up.

                                 TOM
                        Ask the Lord for forgiveness and be 
                        healed.

           Tom rears back -- swings the stick--

                                 RICHARD
                        No--

                                                                 BLACK.
           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - SPORTS FIELD - NIGHT

           Richard’s eyes drift open. His body in a heap. Tom is gone.

           Richard touches his head -- winces.

           He looks up at the dark sky. At God.

           Silent tears trickle down his cheeks.

           INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           The house lights are low. The curtain ripples... And rises.

           A spotlight hits the stage.

           Her glittery dress sparkles. Her eyes smile. And that nose...

           Barbra Streisand sings Billie Holiday’s achingly bittersweet 
           GOD BLESS THE CHILD in her own distinctive style...

                                 BARBRA
                        Them that’s got shall get
                        Them that’s not shall lose
                        So the Bible said and it is still 
                        news...

           Richard sits third row center in the packed, Baroque style 
           SAENGER THEATRE.

           His breath catches in his throat -- astonished by Barbra.

           He nods to himself...

           And lets Barbra’s song break his heart wide open.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - THEATRE - NIGHT

           On stage, Anna receives the blessing from Bishop Rummel.

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        Peace be with you.

                                 ANNA
                        And with your spirit.

           Anna skips off stage. Rummel refers to his list.

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        Milton Simmons.

           From his seat, Leonard looks to the wings...
           No Richard.

                                 BISHOP RUMMEL
                        ...Milton Simmons?

           ...Nothing. The parents murmur.

           Leonard can hardly contain his fury.

           INT. SAENGER THEATRE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Barbra is surrounded by a group of excited FANS.

           Richard scurries toward the pack. Squeezes past a woman. 
           Ducks under a man’s legs...

           He emerges right in front of Barbra. Gaze up at her...

           She is bathed in Holy light. Her smile so divine.

           Nothing exists but her.

           She reaches toward Richard as God reaches toward man.

           She runs her fingers through his frizzy locks.

                                 BARBRA
                        Well hello, cutie.

           Richard can’t respond -- can’t move -- can only stare...

                                 BARBRA
                        Are you okay?

           Richard snaps back to reality.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want to do what you just did.

                                 BARBRA
                        Go for it, doll. You’ve got what 
                        they call “it.”
                             (Richard beams)
                        But if you really want to be a 
                        performer, there’s one thing you 
                        need to remember...

                                 RICHARD
                        What is it?

           Barbra smiles... Opens her mouth to speak--

           A hand grabs Richard -- rips him away from Barbra.
           Richard looks up -- it’s Leonard.

           EXT. BOURBON STREET - NIGHT

           Leonard drags Richard, kicking and screaming, down the block.

                                 LEONARD
                        Where do you think you’re going to 
                        get in life acting like such an 
                        idiot?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m gonna study art and be a 
                        performer like you and mom -- and 
                        I’m not gonna fail like you did.

           Leonard stops in his tracks. Scary and scared.

                                 LEONARD
                        You will not be a performer.

                                 RICHARD
                        Then I’m running away.

                                 LEONARD
                        You’re going away alright. I’m 
                        sending you to your Uncle Dick’s in 
                        Florida.

                                 RICHARD
                        Good. I fucking hate you.

                                 LEONARD
                        I love you too, son.

           Leonard drags Richard out of sight.

           The crucifix atop St. Louis Cathedral looms in the distance.

           EXT. DUOMO DI FIRENZE - DAY

           The Duomo stands tall in its grand, sacred glory.

           Richard, now nineteen, gazes up at it as TOURISTS flutter by. 
           At 5’7” and at least 240lbs, Richard looks like a Jack-o-
           lantern in his big, orange overalls.

           He closes his eyes in silent prayer.
           INT. RICHARD’S TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The bangs and shouts of NOISY NEIGHBORS drift up through the 
           floorboards of the dark efficiency.

           Richard writes by candlelight at his art table...

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        Dear Dad... I made it to Florence. 
                        Or, as the locals call it, Firenze.
                        I’m having such a great time...

           EXT. VILLA FABRICOTTI - DAY

           Richard waddles out of the school with his art portfolio. He 
           spots some bohemian ART STUDENTS laughing and smoking nearby.

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        ...Everyone in my art class has 
                        welcomed me with open arms...

           He waves. They ignore him.

           EXT. VIA DE’ TORNABUONI - DAY

           EUROPEANS in stiletto heels, boxy jackets, and crushed velvet 
           suits strut the promenade of the fashion district.

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        ...For once, I feel like I really 
                        fit in somewhere...

           Richard edges through the crowd. In red overalls, he looks 
           like a literal sore thumb. He glances around -- ashamed.

           INT. TRATTORIA MARIO - DAY

           The no-frills eatery overflows with boisterous ITALIANS. 

           Richard sits alone. Stuffs his face with steak and penne.

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        ...And wow -- the food... Turns out 
                        Italians eat as much as I do...

           Richard’s eyes dart about at his fellow diners...

           A woman forks a big piece of steak into her mouth-- 

           But her waist is so tiny...
           A man stabs a forkful of penne--

           But has the chest of an underwear model.

           Richard frowns in disgust at his own bulging belly.

           INT. STUDIO TELEVISIO - DAY

           Mid-shoot. A CINEMATOGRAPHER films. FREDO DEFONZO (35), a 
           hunky talent agent, is nearby -- loving what he’s seeing. 

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        ...And guess what, Dad? I got an 
                        agent! He’s gotten me some terrific 
                        roles. I can feel myself growing as 
                        a performer...

           We see what they’re filming... 

           Richard, in a bulbous meatball costume, plops his ass down 
           onto a giant plate of pasta. He rolls around. Giggles 
           maniacally. Stuffs the huge noodles in his mouth.

           INT. RICHARD'S TINY APARTMENT - AS BEFORE

                                 RICHARD (V.O.)
                        ...I’m so grateful to Uncle Dick 
                        for paying for me to study abroad.
                        In fact, I’ve decided to call 
                        myself Richard, to honor him.
                        Wish you were here, Dad.

           He signs the letter with a flourish:

                                       Missing you,
                                         Richard

           INT. CINEMA - DAY

           Richard is third row center in the tiny, sparsely populated 
           theatre. He dumps a box of Milk Duds onto his butter drenched 
           popcorn without taking his eyes off the movie...

           On screen, FUNNY GIRL is projected twenty feet high with 
           Italian subtitles:

           Now mid-twenties, Barbra Streisand’s character, FANNY, sits 
           in the third row of the empty New Amsterdam theatre. EMMA 
           (26), the theatre assistant, speaks to her from the stage.
                                 EMMA (ON SCREEN)
                        Mr. Ziegfeld wants to see you -- 
                        when you feel like it, he says. 
                        He’ll be waiting in his office.

                                 FANNY (ON SCREEN)
                        Thanks, Emm.

           Emma walks backstage, leaving Fanny alone in the theatre. A 
           little smile blooms on her lips.

                                 FANNY (ON SCREEN)
                        Did you hear that, Mrs. Strakosh? 
                        Ziegfeld is waiting for me...
                             (leans back)
                        For me... See, you were wrong, Mrs. 
                        Strakosh.

           The same grin on Fanny’s face appears on Richard’s.

           He looks beside him -- keen to share the moment with someone.

           But instead he spots a COUPLE making out near the aisle.

           Richard looks to his other side... Two HANDSOME GUYS neck 
           nearby -- there may be a handjob in progress.

           Richard squirms in his seat. Breathes shakily.

           He focuses on the screen. Fixates on Barbra as she breaks 
           into I’M THE GREATEST STAR, alone on the Broadway stage.

           His breath calms. A blissful smile grows.

           EXT. PONTE VECCHIO - DAY

           I’M THE GREATEST STAR continues to blare as Richard 
           practically floats across the medieval arch bridge, with a 
           FUNNY GIRL record under his arm, and Barbra in his heart.

                                 ITALIAN TEEN (O.S.)
                             (giggles)
                        Polpetta -- polpetta grassa.

           Richard turns... A trio of ITALIAN TEENS giggle at him. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Excuse me?

                                 ITALIAN TEEN
                        You are the big meatball.

           Richard glows -- he’s just been recognized.
                                 RICHARD
                        That’s me.

                                 ITALIAN TEEN
                        We take photo?

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course.

           Two of the teens pose with Richard. Their hands comedically 
           on his belly.

           Richard flashes a big, famous grin.

           The Kodak flash blinds us.

           EXT. FLORENTINE MANSION - POOL - NIGHT

           I’M THE GREATEST STAR gives way to the chatter and giggles of 
           SEXY ITALIANS in designer bathing suits.

           Fredo, in a silk robe, has his arm around Richard, in bright 
           overalls. Richard is bigger than ever -- near 300lbs.

                                 FREDO
                        Never go back to America, Riccardo. 
                        You will have work in Italy as long 
                        as you want it. Television shows 
                        next. Then films -- starring roles.

                                 RICHARD
                             (hopeful)
                        You really think so?

                                 FREDO
                        Of course. You will be the biggest 
                        fat actor in Italy -- bigger than 
                        Saro Urzi.

                                 RICHARD
                        Who’s Saro Urzi?

           Fredo gestures to SARO URZI (55), morbidly obese and naked. 
           Saro pours a bottle of olive oil on himself and shakes his 
           fat rolls to the delight of the party guests.

           SOMEONE hands Saro a sumo thong. He puts it on.

                                 RICHARD
                        Who’s he going to sumo wrestle?

           Richard turns back to Fredo... Who’s holding a sumo thong out 
           to Richard.
                                 RICHARD
                        ...Oh...

           MINUTES LATER

           Richard and Saro, in sumo thongs, circle each other in an 
           olive oil-filled kiddie pool. Surrounded by a cheering crowd.

                                 SARO URZI
                             (sneers at Richard)
                        Sono il più grasso.

           Richard makes a tentative lunge at Saro-- 

           Saro bats Richard away -- slaps him around and laughs.

                                 SARO URZI
                        Magro pezzo di merda americana.

           Saro turns his back to Richard. Poses for the spectators.

           Richard’s eyes dart around the crowd -- these pretty fucks 
           are all laughing at him.

           Richard’s eyes blaze -- he tackles Saro.

                                 RICHARD
                        Fuck you, fat retard. I bet pussy’s 
                        the only thing you don’t eat.

           Richard sits on Saro’s back -- grabs Saro’s head -- shoves 
           his face in the oil.

           Saro flails -- Richard snarls.

           Fredo breaks through the crowd -- grabs Richard by the thong  
           -- but Richard will not relent.

           Fredo slips and falls in the oil.

           Others grab Richard -- finally pull him off.

           He struggles against their grasp -- his eyes wild.

           Richard shrieks as we beam toward his bloodshot eyes -- into 
           his black pupil.

           Suddenly, we’re in--

           RICHARD’S POV:

           It’s blurry and bright. Richard huffs and puffs. Running.
           Laughter chases him.

           Richard runs smack into a marble wall. He rises. Turns...

           There’s a huge CROWD around him. All pointing and laughing.

           INT. GALLERIA DELL'ACCADEMIA - THAT MOMENT

           OUT OF RICHARD’S POV: Richard is standing in the crowded art 
           gallery -- completely naked.

           The perfection of Michelangelo’s David looms above him. The 
           contrast between their two bodies speaks for itself.

           The crowd’s laughter gets louder -- deafening.

           Richard has never been so ashamed... He makes a decision.

           INT. RICHARD'S TINY APARTMENT - DAY

           Richard rips all the food out of his cupboards and fridge.

           He chucks every last bit in the garbage.

           LATER

           A thin strip of light beams through a crack in the drapes.

           Richard, in his orange overalls, is slumped on the couch. He 
           casts a thousand yard stare at his television.

           On the grainy TV screen is a commercial starring Richard: 
           pieces of cheese move quickly past him on a conveyer belt as 
           he tries to stuff as many pieces into his mouth as he can.

           Richard’s blank gaze stays locked on the TV as he loses 
           weight before our very eyes...

           From morbid obesity...

           To chubby...

           Ideal...

           Skinny...

           Emaciated.

           His skin is gray. His hair thin. His overalls hang off him.

           Richard struggles to his feet...
           And collapses.

                                                                 BLACK.

           An ambulance siren wails...

           QUICK FLASHES:

           --A headless Barbie doll in young Richard’s plump hand.

           --Richard, lifeless on a gurney, is rushed down a HOSPITAL 
           hallway.

           --Richard’s mom, Shirley, steps out the door of the SIMMONS 
           RESIDENCE with a suitcase. Closes the door behind her.

           --NURSES scramble around Richard’s body. A DOCTOR barks 
           commands.

           --That disappointed, disgusted look on Leonard’s face when he 
           ripped Richard away from Barbra.

           --A heartbeat monitor flatlines...

           --Enraged Tom swings his lacrosse stick at us.

                                                                 BLACK.

           INT. NEW AMSTERDAM THEATRE - NIGHT

           A scene from FUNNY GIRL, complete with the slight 
           imperfections of projection film.

           But something’s different... The gaunt Richard edges out onto 
           the empty Broadway stage. Scans the empty theatre seats.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Well hello, cutie.

           His head whips to the third row... 

           It’s Barbra Streisand, in her Fanny costume from the movie.

           Her smile blooms for him. She rises. Drifts toward him.

                                 BARBRA
                        Why are you doing this to yourself?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I want to be skinny...
                                 BARBRA
                        You need to eat...
                        But you have to eat healthy.
                        Love yourself...
                        You need to stay alive.

           Richard averts his gaze -- still so disheartened.

           Barbra is right in front of him now.

           She grabs him by the chin. Forces him to look at her.

                                 BARBRA
                        Take it from me...
                        A big nosed little girl from 
                        Brooklyn... 
                        Who realized one day she had a 
                        voice.
                        ...Go where you’ll be seen...
                        ...You can help people...
                        Don’t let them suffer like you 
                        have.
                        And make a lot of money, so you can 
                        build your own church...
                        ...And become a saint...

           Richard isn’t so sure -- how could I help anyone?

                                 BARBRA
                        Richard...
                        Do you want to live...
                        Or do you want to die?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SANTA MARIA NUOVA HOSPITAL - HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard’s eyes shoot open. 

           He gazes at the crucifix on the wall above him.

           He’s in a hospital bed. An IV in his arm.

           Richard notices a plate of pasta on a tray beside him.

           He stares deep into the sea of spaghetti...

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - SUNSET

           We soar backward, above the HOLLYWOOD sign... Over the seedy 
           Sunset Strip... Into glitzy Beverly Hills... 
           Down toward a restaurant canopy, bearing the name DEREK’S...

           We travel through the window, into...

           INT. DEREK’S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           And there’s Richard, looking healthy and slightly plump. Now 
           twenty-five, he’s focused, with a newfound confidence -- and 
           very fabulous.

           Richard holds two plates of spaghetti, and is dressed in a 
           black shirt and slacks -- like the rest of the WAIT STAFF in 
           this busy Italian restaurant.

           We track Richard as he proves he’s the best waiter in LA...

           He puts the plates down in front of a POSH MAN and WOMAN.

                                 POSH MAN
                        Oh -- I ordered the ravioli.

                                 RICHARD
                             (twinkle in his eye)
                        It’s hot. It’s here. You’re hungry. 
                        Eat it.

           The man and woman laugh. 

           Richard glides toward the foyer. Spots ROBERT EVANS (44), the 
           ultra-tan megaproducer, with two slim, busty ladies -- a 
           BLONDE and a BRUNETTE -- in mink coats.

                                 RICHARD
                        If it isn’t Mr. Robert Evans.

                                 ROBERT EVANS
                        Hiya, Richie.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to the ladies)
                        Let me take those coats.
                             (he does)
                        These are just beautiful.

           He tosses the minks in the corner like they’re towels.

           Robert cackles as Richard seats the trio.

           Richard heads toward another table -- gets a handoff of menus 
           from JOSIE KENNELLY (24), a svelte and winsome waitress. They 
           wink at each other.

           Richard lays the menus in front of a MOTHER and DAUGHTER.
                                 RICHARD
                        It’s so nice to see sisters eating 
                        together.

                                 MOTHER
                             (giggles)
                        I’m her mother.

           Richard slaps his own face like Faye Dunaway in CHINATOWN.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sister -- mother -- sister -- 
                        mother!

           The mother cracks up.

           Richard returns to Robert Evans’ table -- plops himself down 
           in Robert’s lap.

                                 RICHARD
                        Have you decided what you’d like?
                             (looks at Robert’s crotch)
                        Apparently today’s special is 
                        sausage.

                                 ROBERT EVANS
                             (cackles)
                        Gimme a steak. Biggest one you got.

                                 RICHARD
                        Got a nice, big, thick one for ya.
                             (to Robert’s dates)
                        Ladies?

                                 BLONDE
                        We’re on a diet.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        We’ll just have salad.

           Richard grimaces. Gestures to a sad little salad bar in a 
           dark corner.

                                 RICHARD
                        Salad bar’s over there.

           They take one look...

                          BLONDE
                                                        BRUNETTE
           That’s okay...
                                              I’m not that hungry...
           INT. DEREK’S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard counts a huge stack of tips. Josie, who we met 
           briefly in the dining room, pounds cannolis next to him. 

           CHANEL (22), a glamorous waitress, snorts a line of coke off 
           the sink and lights a cigarette.

                                 CHANEL
                        Damn, Richard -- how do you get 
                        such good tips?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll tell you as soon as you girls 
                        tell me how you stay so skinny.

                                 JOSIE
                        Genetics, I guess.

                                 CHANEL
                        Smokes and coke sure help. And a 
                        little of the ‘ol...

           She makes a finger-down-her-throat motion.

                          RICHARD
                                                          JOSIE
           That’s so bad for you.
                                              You shouldn’t do that.

                                 CHANEL
                        Okay, moms.

           A toilet flushes. MAGGIE DAVIS (25), shy and quite overweight 
           in chef’s whites, steps out of a stall and washes her hands.

                          RICHARD
                                                          JOSIE
           Hi, Maggie.
                                              Hey, Maggs.

           Maggie flashes a no-eye-contact smile.

                                 RICHARD
                        How’s your daughter doing?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Good.

           Maggie gets the hell out of there.

                                 CHANEL
                        Damn -- has she gotten even fatter?

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey -- shut the fuck up.

           Richard clocks Josie’s reaction.
                                 CHANEL
                        Jesus. Excuse me, Josie.

           Richard gazes at the door Maggie just stepped through.

           EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           Richard walks with Josie. Neither in any hurry.

                                 JOSIE
                        Will you come somewhere with me?

                                 RICHARD
                             (a little nervous)
                        Like a date? I have to warn you, 
                        Josie, I love the single life.

                                 JOSIE
                             (chuckles)
                        Of course not a date.

           “Of course not” stings Richard a bit.

                                 JOSIE
                        This Saturday. Wear something you 
                        can move in.

           INT. BODY BY GILDA - DAY

           Josie, looking flawless in a skintight leotard, leads 
           Richard, in a baggy sweatsuit, into the aerobics studio.

           Richard halts -- overwhelmed...

           Floor to ceiling mirrors. Pristine wood floors. A goddamn 
           grand piano in the corner...

           And the studio is full of stunning, slender YOUNG WOMEN 
           stretching in colorful leotards.

                                 RICHARD
                        Holy shit.

           Josie grins. Leads Richard to the front of the class, with 
           smiles and waves to the other women.

           Richard’s eyes dart around-- 

           Suddenly, all these gorgeous women are headless Barbie dolls.

           Richard snaps back to reality. Realizes something...
                                 RICHARD
                             (whispers to Josie)
                        Where are all the fat people?

           Josie shrugs.

           GILDA MARX (30), a blonde warrior princess in a sparkly 
           leotard, steps out from the back room with a big smile.

                                 GILDA MARX
                        You girls ready to sweat?

           The women hoot and holler.

           Gilda signals the PIANIST, who breaks into ROCKIN’ ROBIN.

           Richard lights up. Josie winks at him.

           Gilda breaks into a brisk, but somewhat robotic, aerobics 
           routine: lunges, box step, grapevine, etc.

           The women follow along -- Richard finally realizes he should 
           follow along too, and springs to action.

           Gilda utters occasional instructions and encouragement.

           Richard puts his own sassy panache on every move.

           He dances wild and free. 

           He is possessed by the Holy Spirit -- bathed in white light.

           He can’t keep quiet--

                                 RICHARD
                        This is like dancing!

           The women holler in agreement -- which only eggs him on...

                                 RICHARD
                        C’mon, girls -- move those hips!
                        Your boyfriends’ll thank you later!
                        I want our asses to hurt tomorrow!
                        Mine’s getting tight as a drum -- 
                        someone touch it!
                        Get rockin’ you sexy little robins!

           The women laugh and cheer him on.

           Gilda gives him a death stare...

           But Richard doesn’t notice -- he’s too busy performing.
           He turns around to face the class and bursts into an arm-
           flapping bird dance, while singing along to ROCKIN’ ROBIN. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Go rockin' robin 'cause we're 
                        really gonna rock toniiight!

           Richard thrusts up his arms in victory.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes!

           The class devolves into chaos -- the women cheer, sing, and 
           break into their own little dances.

           Richard surveys the madness. Breathing heavy. Sweating.

           Happy.

           EXT. BODY BY GILDA - DAY

           Richard, who is positively glowing, and Josie bound out of 
           the studio.

                                 RICHARD
                        I love it -- this is going to make 
                        my body beautiful -- a few more 
                        weeks of this and I’ll look 
                        terrific--

           Gilda steps out behind them.

                                 GILDA
                        Josie...

           Richard and Josie look back. 

           Gilda’s hard look makes Richard’s smile evaporate.

                                 GILDA
                        I need to speak to your friend.

           EXT. CIVIC CENTER DRIVE - SUNSET

           Richard looks like he was just given three months to live. 

           He and Josie trudge through the part of Beverly Hills Regis 
           Philbin once called “the wrong side of the tracks.”

                                 RICHARD
                        She said having a man in the class 
                        made the women uncomfortable.
                                 JOSIE
                        She’s a liar. Boring bitch just 
                        didn’t want to share the spotlight.

                                 RICHARD
                        Do you think I went too far?

                                 JOSIE
                        No fucking way. Everyone loved it -- 
                        I’ve never seen those bitches move 
                        like that.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I’m an idiot.

                                 JOSIE
                        Would you cut it out? Let’s just go 
                        to a different class.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...No...

                                 JOSIE
                        We can do whatever we want... What 
                        do you want to do?

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t know... Feel what I felt in 
                        there, I guess... I know they were 
                        having a good time... 
                        Maybe I could start my own class. 

           He stops walking. Stares into Josie’s eyes.

                                 RICHARD
                        I think I could help people... Is 
                        that stupid?

                                 JOSIE
                             (takes his hands)
                        No.

                                 RICHARD
                             (little smile)
                        What do you want to do?

                                 JOSIE
                             (bashful)
                        ...Be a comedian, like Joan Rivers  
                        -- have my own talk show... Now 
                        that’s stupid.
                                 RICHARD
                        No way... When I’m a big time 
                        aerobics instructor, can I be on 
                        The Josie Show?

                                 JOSIE
                        Fuck yes.

           They beam at each other. Glow together.

           Richard spies something over Josie’s shoulder... He’s drawn 
           toward it...

           A ramshackle, grey warehouse: WILSON’S HOUSE OF SUEDE

           There’s a FOR LEASE sign in the window.

           Richard cups his hands around his eyes and peers through the 
           filthy window for a long moment.

           He turns back to Josie -- his eyes sparkle.

           INT. DEREK’S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard is alone with Maggie, the overweight chef. She’s 
           avoiding eye contact, like always.

                                 RICHARD
                        I just want you to know -- if you 
                        ever need anyone to talk to, I’ve 
                        been in your shoes.
                             (no response)
                        A few years ago I weighed almost 
                        three-hundred pounds.

                                 MAGGIE
                        ...Really?

           He nods. But discouragement takes control of her.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s pointless to talk about. I’ve 
                        tried every kind of diet... There’s 
                        nowhere for me to work out.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure there is. Apparently every 
                        aerobics class in town is for 
                        women.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (scoffs)
                        What about fat women?
           Richard doesn’t have an answer.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t want to get laughed out of 
                        another class. Thanks anyway.

           Maggie plods out of the restroom.

           Richard broods over her words -- must investigate further.

           I./E. LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS

           --GYMNASIUM: Two buff GYMNASTS hoist Richard up to a pair of 
           gymnastic rings. Richard grabs hold. The gymnasts let go -- 
           Richard immediately crashes to the mats.

           --PILATES STUDIO: The lithe RON FLETCHER (53) leads Richard 
           and his fit, female CLASSMATES in balance exercises. Richard 
           watches Ron make a painfully slow and boring transition to a 
           new position. Richard rolls his eyes.

           --DEREK’S RESTAURANT: Richard flits from table to table like 
           a hummingbird. He picks up his tips from tables. Leaves 
           DINERS laughing in his wake.

           --MUSCLE BEACH: Huge JUICEHEADS everywhere. A shirtless, 
           ripped VINCENT GIRONDA (57) screams commands at Richard who 
           struggles to benchpress a bar with no weights on it... 
           Richard glances up Vincent’s shorts.

           --BIKRAM YOGA STUDIO: Richard sweats his balls of with 
           glistening, svelte WOMEN in a hot yoga class. BIKRAM 
           CHOUDHURY (30) “helps” a woman with a chest stretch by 
           groping her breasts. Richard eyes the interaction curiously.

           --MOVIE THEATRE: Richard and Josie sob together, watching 
           Barbra Streisand in THE WAY WE WERE.

           --RICHARD’S KITCHEN: Way too many heads of lettuce in here. 
           Richard, in an incredibly stained KISS THE COOK apron, mixes 
           some dressing. Pours it on a salad. Tastes... Not bad.

           INT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Richard sits among thousands, watching ultra-fit JACK LALAINE 
           (60) speak on stage in front of a banner that bears his name.

                                 JACK LALAINE
                        It matters not what your age is. 
                        It matters not what your physical 
                        condition is. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK LALAINE (CONT'D)
                        If you obey nature’s laws you can 
                        be born again.

           Richard drinks this in. Nods at its profundity.

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Richard gazes at a big piggy bank. There’s a picture of his 
           old, fat self in that Italian meatball costume taped to it. 

           Richard smashes the piggy bank with a hammer -- freeing the 
           loads of cash within.

           EXT. WILSON’S HOUSE OF SUEDE - DAY

           The warehouse space Richard discovered with Josie.

           A beaming REAL ESTATE AGENT hands Richard a set of keys.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        What are you gonna call this place?

                                 RICHARD
                        The Anatomy Asylum.
                             (dead serious)
                        Because I’m fucking crazy.

           INT. DEREK’S RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Richard and Maggie are alone by the meatballs. 

           She stares at a flyer in her hand: a B&W photo of Richard 
           wearing a huge grin, pointing right at us, with a dialogue 
           bubble: LIGHTEN UP AT THE ANATOMY ASYLUM!

                                 RICHARD
                        Will you come?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Money’s tight. I’d need a sitter--

                                 RICHARD
                        Your classes are on the house. I’ll 
                        pay for a babysitter.
                             (let’s get serious)
                        No one’s going to laugh you out of 
                        this class. I started this place 
                        for people like us. 

           She finally meets Richard’s gaze. There’s a glimmer of hope 
           in her eyes.
           INT. RICHARD’S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Barbra Streisand’s A WOMAN IN LOVE gets our juices flowing as 
           Richard gets ready...

           --He hairsprays the heck out of his frizzy afro.

           --Spreads foundation on his cheeks.

           --Pulls on a skintight red leotard.

           --Richard gazes at the three items taped to the top corner of 
           his full length mirror...

           --A photo of him and Josie grinning in their waiter uniforms.

           --A picture of Barbra Streisand lookin’ gorgeous (ripped out 
           of a magazine).

           --A department store portrait of Richard at age ten with 
           Leonard, Shirley, and Lenny -- all beaming. 

           --He checks himself out in the mirror. It’s hard to pull off 
           that leotard. But he is absolutely rocking it.

           Richard stares deep into his reflected eyes. 

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Your first real performance...
                        ...You can help people...

           EXT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - DAY

           The old WILSON’S HOUSE OF SUEDE warehouse has been dolled up, 
           and now bears the name: ANATOMY ASYLUM

           Colorful helium balloons line the walkway, where a small 
           group of WOMEN of various shapes and sizes has gathered. 

           Among them are Josie and Maggie, the largest of the group. 
           She’s all kinds of nervous in a baggie sweatsuit.

           The front door swings open. All heads turn...

           Richard leaps out the door in his red leotard -- vibrating 
           fabulousness. He throws his arms in the air.

                                 RICHARD
                        Welcome to the Anatomy Asylum!
                             (the women cheer)
                        And if you don’t like havin’ fun, 
                        then you best not come in here!
           INT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - STUDIO - DAY

           Floor to ceiling mirrors. Pristine wood floors. A disco ball 
           sparkling above.

           The women have gathered in rows before a glowing Richard. The 
           studio is about one third full.

           Josie’s front row center. She and Richard wink at each other.

           He turns to the record player behind him. 

           Puts the needle down on a record.

           Doubt flits across his face.

           Vinyl static crackles through the studio.

           He turns to face the women. A mischievous smirk on his lips.

           LOCOMOTION by Little Eva blasts through the room.

           Richard strikes a pose -- a true performer.

           The women catcall and wolf whistle.

           He bursts into his first movement -- a thumb pointing, right-
           left-right-left kinda thing.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hitch a ride, girls! 
                        It’s gas, grass, or ass to get in 
                        this car!

           The women giggle and follow along.

           He transitions to another move -- essentially “the twist.”

                                 RICHARD
                        Twist and shout, ladies -- lemme 
                        hear ya!

           The women hoot and holler as they twist.

           He transitions to another move. Then another.

           These are simple, uncomplicated movements. More dancing than 
           the aerobics Gilda Marx taught.

           He glances at Maggie at the end of the back row. She’s 
           huffing and puffing, but keeping up.
                                 RICHARD
                        Are we sweatin’ yet?
                        I wanna get you wet!

           Richard busts out some sexual hip thrusts.

           The women scream like he’s The Beatles.

           MINUTES LATER

           Richard struts through the class like a sassy drill 
           instructor as the women struggle through knee pushups.

                                 RICHARD
                        Up -- down -- up -- down.
                        No baby steps -- get your shit 
                        together!

           MINUTES LATER

           Richard leads the women in a backstroke move. He notices 
           Maggie’s excellent form.

                                 RICHARD
                        Beautiful, Maggie!
                        Everybody do it like Maggie!

           The women look back at Maggie with big grins on their faces.

           Maggie beams at Richard.

           MINUTES LATER

           The women dance in circle. Richard is in the center.

           He strikes pose after pose -- an early adopter of voguing.

           MAURO OLIVEIRA (20), buff and Brazilian in a tank top and 
           short shorts, pokes his head into the room.

           Richard notices. His eyes sparkle.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey, good lookin’!

                                 MAURO
                             (thick Brazilian accent)
                        ...I’m looking for the salsa class.
                                 RICHARD
                        This ain’t it -- but I could use a 
                        little salsa on my burrito.

           Mauro giggles. Scans the class -- looks like fun.

                                 MAURO
                        Is this women only? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Hell no -- it’s for everybody. Get 
                        that tight caboose over here!

           Richard points to the floor in front of him.

           Mauro grins. Dances to the center of the circle with Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Take your shirt off!
                        C’mon -- take your shirt off!
                             (a little bit fierce)
                        Take your fucking shirt off.

           Mauro shrugs and whips his shirt off. The women cheer.

           Richard grabs Mauro’s tank top and flosses his own crotch 
           with it.

           Mauro bursts out laughing.

           KCET NEWS SEGMENT: GRAINY TV STATIC THROUGHOUT...

           THE VERY 1970’S KCET MORNING NEWS LOGO FILLS THE SCREEN.

           INT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - SALAD BAR - DAY

           In the all-white, twinkly-lighted dining area, featuring an 
           extra large salad bar, the burly HUELL HOWSER (30) speaks 
           directly to camera.

                                 HUELL HOWSER
                        It’s the first salad bar in Los 
                        Angeles to have an aerobics studio 
                        under the same roof. But the reason 
                        people are coming isn’t just the 
                        healthy food and upbeat exercise--

           QUICK SHOTS:

           --SALAD BAR: Richard dances on top of the tables as PATRONS 
           munch their salads.
                                 RICHARD
                             (singing)
                        Like a rhinestone cowboy...

           --STUDIO: Richard plays butt bongo on a WOMAN who’s touching 
           her toes in the packed studio.

                                 RICHARD
                             (singing, a la Desi Arnaz)
                        Babalu -- Baaabaaaluuu!

           INT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - SALAD BAR - AS BEFORE

                                 HUELL HOWSER
                        His name is Richard Simmons. And 
                        he’s not just the founder and head 
                        chef of the Anatomy Asylum -- this 
                        bundle of energy teaches every 
                        single aerobics class. His goal is 
                        to make exercise enjoyable for 
                        everyone, no matter their size.

           HUELL HOWSER INTERVIEWS RICHARD:

                                 RICHARD
                        I went to aerobics classes and 
                        fitness centers all over Los 
                        Angeles, and I didn’t see anyone 
                        who was overweight. It seemed like 
                        you had to be in shape already to 
                        even get started. 
                        I knew there were a lot of people 
                        out there who would never find the 
                        power to change their lives unless 
                        someone changed the way we 
                        exercise. 
                        And I knew I had to make it fun -- 
                        ‘cause let’s face it...
                             (turns to camera)
                        If it ain’t fun, it ain’t gonna get 
                        done!

           INT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - SALAD BAR - NIGHT

           Richard mops the floor, lit only be the streetlights outside.

           Between the big, empty dining room and his uncharacteristic 
           slouch, he looks so very alone.
           The front door creaks open. Richard looks up.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Hello...?

           JACKIE SMITH (40), an alpha female in a paisley skirt suit, 
           steps through the doorway.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’ve seen you jumping around on 
                        television.

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh... Yeah, that sounds like me.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m Jackie Smith. Vice President of 
                        Daytime Programming at ABC.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Okay...

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re very funny. I’ve never seen 
                        anyone like you.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well, I guess there isn’t anyone 
                        like me.

                                 JACKIE
                        I want you on General Hospital.

                                 RICHARD
                        The soap opera?

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s right.

           Richard puts down his mop -- overwhelmed. 

           This is an opportunity to perform. He wants it so bad, but...

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve had some bad experiences with 
                        acting.

                                 JACKIE
                             (sly grin)
                        Trust me -- you won’t have to act.
           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Richard, in a form-fitting sweatsuit, is perched on a bench 
           beside BEVERLY (21), a morbidly obese woman. He’s very 
           intense -- almost angry.

                                 RICHARD
                        Get up in the morning and count 
                        your blessings -- and you’ve got 
                        lots of ‘em.
                        How many people love you?
                        How many people count on you?
                        How many people would be lost 
                        without you?
                             (softens his tone)
                        You can lose the weight.
                        Just don’t stop dreaming.
                        ‘Cause if you really dream, you can 
                        get anything you want in life.

                                 BEVERLY
                             (sobbing hard)
                        Okay, Richard. I’ll try. If you 
                        believe in me, I can do anything.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Cut! Moving on!

           We pull way back. This isn’t a park -- it’s a set in...

           SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 7

           The CREW sets up for the next scene.

           Richard grins and hugs Beverly. Who is, of course, no longer 
           crying.

                          RICHARD
                                                         BEVERLY
           Great crying.
                                              Loved your intensity.

           Richard rushes over to Jackie.

                                 RICHARD
                        What’d you think?

                                 JACKIE
                        I think the writers need to give 
                        you more scenes.
                        Oh, and if you have any lady 
                        friends -- thin, pretty -- we’re 
                        casting a new nurse.
                                 RICHARD
                        Really? My best friend Josie would 
                        be perfect.

                                 JACKIE
                        Great. Give her my number.

           Richard’s eyes light up -- everything’s coming together.

                                 JACKIE
                        Friend of mine wants to meet you.

           Jackie beckons to WOODY FRASER (45), a silver fox with the 
           smile of your favorite uncle.

           Woody makes a beeline for Richard. Shakes his hand fervently.

                                 WOODY
                        Pleased to meet ya. Woody Fraser.

                                 JACKIE
                        Woody here created The Mike Douglas 
                        Show.

                                 RICHARD
                        I love Mike Douglas! Those big 
                        asterisks all over his set -- I 
                        need them for my bedroom.

                                 WOODY
                             (chuckles)
                        I’ll send you some.
                        And if you ever think about doing 
                        your own TV show, just lemme know.

           This blows Richard’s hair back -- my own show?

                                 JACKIE
                             (to Richard)
                        Hey -- have you seen what’s in your 
                        dressing room?

           Richard has not. And he loves a good surprise.

           INT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - RICHARD’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Richard stands in the doorway. Stares at the huge sack in the 
           middle of the room -- it’s overflowing with letters.

           A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT passes behind him.
                                 RICHARD
                        Excuse me. I think somebody left 
                        everyone’s fan mail in here. 

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        No -- that’s all for you. You got 
                        as much as Tony and Genie.

                                 RICHARD
                             (holy shit)
                        As much as Luke and Laura?

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        Want me to get rid of it?

                                 RICHARD
                        Get rid of it? I’m going to answer 
                        every single letter.

           DAY TO NIGHT

           Barbra Streisand’s SOMEWHERE makes our souls weep as Richard 
           spends hours going through his fan mail...

           --Richard reads a multi-page letter...

                                 WOMAN #1 (V.O.)
                        Dear Richard, I’m sorry about the 
                        long letter -- but I feel like 
                        you’re the only person I can talk 
                        to. I’ve been overweight since I 
                        was seven years old...

           --He reads another. Getting emotional..

                        ...I’m so big, and my knees hurt so 
                        much, that some days I can’t get 
                        out of bed...

           --Another...

                        ...My grandma always tells me 
                        someone will love me when I lose 
                        weight...

           --Reading through tears...

                        ...My daughter died of heart

           --Reading. More tears...

                                 WOMAN #5 (V.O.)
                        ...Please write back. I need your 
                        help.

           Richard puts the letter down. Pauses...

           And picks up a pen.

           SUNRISE

           Richard signs his name at the bottom of a long letter:

                                    With all my love,
                                     Richard Simmons

           He slides it into an envelope and adds it to the stacks of 
           outgoing mail on the countertop. 

           Richard massages his writing hand. Takes a quiet moment of 
           reflection.

           Something catches his eye... A glittery envelope he missed at 
           the bottom of the empty mail sack.

           He opens it. Inside is a photo of MICHAEL HEBRANKO (30), a 
           sweet, sad-eyed man who’s girth nearly fills the sofa he’s 
           seated on.

           Richard’s shoulders slump -- that poor man.

           He reads the letter...

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        Dear Richard, My name is Michael 
                        Hebranko, and I weight over one-
                        thousand pounds. My father, mother,  
                        and brother are all skinny, but 
                        I’ve always been fat.

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The kids in school tormented me. 
                        When I was nine years old, I 
                        started stealing my aunt’s diet 
                        pills...

           Richard’s eyes widen.

           INT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - STUDIO - DAY

           Richard bounds into the studio. Delightfully manic. Can’t 
           wait to share all his news-- 

           He stops short...

           EVERYONE in the class is weeping.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...What’s wrong...?

           Maggie, who’s lost some serious weight, finds the words...

                                 MAGGIE
                        ...Josie died.

           The breath is sucked out of Richard.

           This can’t be happening. But it is.

           NIGHT

           The lights are low. A small, intimate group of OVERWEIGHT 
           WOMEN, Maggie, and Mauro, Richard’s first male student, is 
           gathered in a circle. All eyes are misty.

           Tears stream down Richard’s cheeks.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s my fault. I can’t believe I 
                        didn’t see it. I wish she’d told me 
                        so I could’ve helped.
                             (a hint of anger)
                        This goes to show that we cannot 
                        take short cuts. 
                        We can’t do what Josie did and jam 
                        our fingers down our throats to 
                        stay thin.
                             (the anger fades)
                        We’re working so hard. And I know 
                        that this time we’re going to make 
                        it -- because we’re doing this 
                        together...
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        We just have to remember the three 
                        rules...
                        Move your body...
                        Watch your portions...
                        And love yourself.

           Richard takes a deep breath. Locks eyes with Mauro.

                                 RICHARD
                        Mauro, with Josie gone, I’m going 
                        to need some help around here. Will 
                        you be my second in command?

                                 MAURO
                        Of course, Richard.

           Richard wipes the tears away. Tries to brighten up.

                                 RICHARD
                        I have a very special announcement 
                        to make tonight... Since starting 
                        here at Anatomy Asylum, Maggie has 
                        lost seventy-five pounds -- I love 
                        you, Maggie.

           Richard rises and claps for Maggie, tears flowing once again. 

           The group joins in on the applause, and the tears.

           Maggie sobs as she runs to Richard and wraps him in a hug.

           One by one, the group members join the embrace.

           INT. RICHARD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Richard has a bigger apartment, but the same full length 
           mirror. With the same items taped to the top corner.

           He stares at the photo of him and Josie.

           He reaches out... And strips the photo off the mirror.

           EXT. NORMA TRIANGLE - NIGHT

           The witching hour. Richard, in a dark coat and baseball cap, 
           wanders past the eclectic mix of West Hollywood homes.

           He turns onto the Sunset Strip. A neon sign stops him cold:

                                     SECOND HAND ROSE
                                     ADULT BOOKSTORE
           INT. SECOND HAND ROSE - MOMENTS LATER

           So much more than books. 

           Richard edges inside... Glances at the sex toys... The kinky 
           outfits...

           And finds himself by the magazine rack. The hot, fit guys on 
           the covers of BLUEBOY, PLAYGUY, and DRUMMER magazine stare 
           out at him...

           He reaches toward one--

           But hears a short, shrill whistle.

           His head whips to the sound. A HOT GUY by the video booths 
           gazes back at him.

           The guy makes the slightest gesture toward a video booth... 
           Disappears inside.

           Richard freezes... Shame creeps across his face.

           He gets the fuck out of there.

           INT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 7 HALLWAY - DAY

           48 hours without sleep has caught up with Richard. 

           But he’s on a mission. In search of someone...

           He spots Woody Fraser -- there he is -- and races over.

                                 WOODY
                        You okay--?

                                 RICHARD
                        I want my own show.
                             (Woody grins)
                        I’ll start every episode with a 
                        skit -- something fun and 
                        outrageous -- bring a little light 
                        into people’s lives -- like a scene 
                        from “Gone With the Wind” where I 
                        play Scarlett.
                        Then I’ll have an exercise segment  
                        -- everyone at home can feel like 
                        they’re right there in my studio.
                        I’ll talk to people with problems --
                        give them advice.
                        And even do a little low-cal 
                        cooking segment.

                        Whaddaya say?

           Woody is impressed... He sticks out his hand--

           Richard mauls him with a hug.

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re my Louis B. Mayer, and I’m 
                        your Bette Davis!

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Richard tiptoes through the door. There’s someone under the 
           covers in bed.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Honey... Honey, are you okay?

           He whips the covers off the bed, revealing a GIRL who looks 
           remarkably like Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST -- her wrists are 
           tied to the bedposts.

           She snarls and screams. Writhes around.

                                 RICHARD
                        Regan, what’s wrong? Look at this -- 
                        who tied you up like this?
                             (unties her wrists)
                        This is so bad for your 
                        circulation.

           Her arms freed, the girl throttles Richard’s neck.

                                 RICHARD
                        Stop -- stop!
                        The power of exercise compels you.
                        The power of exercise compels you!

           Dance music hits.

           We pull way out to reveal that the bedroom is a set in...

           SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 4

           The LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE laughs and applauds.

           Richard and the girl exercise-dance downstage.

           Richard grins into a studio camera.
                                 RICHARD
                        Today I’ll be talking to people who 
                        say they’re demonically possessed. 
                        I hope those demons don’t leap into 
                        me -- it’s already crowded in here.

           ANATOMY ASYLUM COMMERCIAL:

           A closeup shot of Richard appears in the middle of a black 
           screen. He speaks excitedly to camera.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hi, I’m Richard Simmons. My first 
                        Anatomy Asylum in Los Angeles was 
                        the start of something great...

           A red, laser-etched outline of the United States is drawn on 
           the black screen. The rectangle containing Richard shrinks 
           and moves to the Los Angeles area of the map.

                                 RICHARD

                        seventy-two clubs in thirteen 
                        cities, including yours...

           Identical little video boxes containing the same shot of 
           Richard pop up all across the laser-etched map.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Where people like you can look

           INT. MAPLEWOOD MALL - DAY

           A ROWDY CROWD, consisting mostly of overweight women in 
           mostly muted colors, surrounds a stage in the center of this 
           bland, Middle American galleria.

           Epic, Catholic organ music blares through giant speakers...

           Richard, in a hot pink sweatsuit, rises from beneath center 
           stage on a hydraulic platform. His face placid. His arms 
           raised like Jesus blessing his flock.

           Richard surveys the gathering. Flashes that mischievous grin.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hello Minneapolis!

           The crowd goes crazy.

           Women weep. Someone throws their panties.

           The music stops. The crowd hushes.

           Richard grabs a microphone. Drifts around the stage.

                                 RICHARD
                             (sermon-esque)
                        I know some of you want this very 
                        bad. 
                        I know some of you are living in a 
                        body that you don’t want to live in 
                        anymore.
                        Let today -- let right now be your 
                        starting day!

           The crowd cries out in agreement. Arms fly high in the air.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want someone to come up who 
                        promises that they are going to 
                        start now.

           Hundreds of hands wave for Richard’s attention.

           Richard spots JOANIE (60), an overweight woman with big salt-
           and-pepper hair, crying in the front row.
                                 RICHARD
                        You -- c’mon up here.
                             (she stumbles onto stage)
                        C’mere. Why are you crying?

           He gives her a big hug and smooch on the cheek.

                                 JOANIE
                             (thick Minnesota accent)
                        Well I love your show. And I admire 
                        what you’ve done to help people. 
                        And... And I just lost my husband 
                        at Christmas time, and I’ve been so 
                        sad, and all I do is eat. And I -- 
                        this is my last chance -- I really 
                        wanted you to try to help me... And 
                        I know I can do it now.

                                 RICHARD
                        We’re all here to help you.
                             (to the crowd)
                        We’re all here to help her, aren’t 
                        we? Aren’t we?
                             (the crowd cheers)
                        Whaddaya say we dance together, 
                        huh? Hit it!

           Leslie Gore’s IT’S MY PARTY blasts through the mall.

           Richard leads Joanie and the crowd in a fun aerobics dance--

           A PRETTY WOMAN, with a wild look in her eyes, rushes the 
           stage. Grabs Richard.

                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        You saved my life -- I love you -- 
                        I need to be with you.

           Richard is thrown -- he struggles to break free.

           More women storm the stage. Paw at Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Easy, girls -- I love you, but -- 
                        hey, cut it out!

           SECURITY GUARDS rush the stage. Grab Richard.

           The women give chase as security whisks Richard away.

                                 RICHARD
                        Goodbye Minneapolis -- I love you!
           INT. HEBRANKO RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Michael Hebranko, the thousand pound man who wrote to 
           Richard, is sunk in the sofa in this modest two-story home. 

           He blankly watches his chubby son, MIKEY (6), play with 
           Matchbox cars.

                                 MADELINE (O.S.)
                        Honey -- there’s someone here to 
                        see you.

           MADELINE (29), Michael’s overstressed wife, steps into the 
           room. Her eyes are misty.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why’re you crying, babe?

           Richard steps in beside her, with an empathic smile.

           Michael bursts into tears.

           Richard bursts into tears.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish I could get up to hug you.

           Richard leans down. Hugs Michael. Kisses his cheek.

                                 RICHARD
                        Reading your letter was like 
                        reading about my own childhood.
                        I’m going to help you.
                        I’ll call you every day.
                        You’re going to lead a long, happy 
                        life with your family.
                        I promise.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish I had your discipline.

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, I struggle -- trust me. I just 
                        take it one day at a time.
                             (wipes Michael’s tears)
                        What do you say to some exercise?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll try my best.

                                 RICHARD
                        Now, Michael -- I have a camera 
                        crew outside. Is it okay with you 
                        if I bring them in to film?
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                             (Michael is unsure)
                        I don’t want to do anything you’re 
                        not comfortable with. But if 
                        someone who needs help sees you 
                        doing this, they might feel like 
                        they can do it too.

           Michael considers it. Looks to Madeline.

           She nods.

           Michael smiles at Richard.

           LATER

           TV CAMERA POV: GRAINY TV RESOLUTION...

           Richard is in a folding chair, facing Michael.

           He leads Michael in a series of seated aerobics moves: 
           reaching up, a swimming motion, arm circles. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s great, Michael -- you’re 
                        doing so good.
                        Let’s see who can sweat the most.
                             (smiles to camera)
                        I hope you’re working out with us 
                        at home.
                             (to Michael)
                        This is great workout spot -- can I 
                        move in with you?

           Michael giggles. They keep moving.

           I./E. STRETCH LIMO/SUNSET STRIP - DAY

           Richard sings along (loudly) to Barbra’s LOVE THEME FROM A 
           STAR IS BORN on the limo’s sound system.

           Leonard, now a distinguished elder statesman, sips a glass of 
           champagne, unable to hide how impressed he is by the limo -- 
           ooh, there’s a phone in here.

           He spots something out the window...

                                 LEONARD
                        Is that...?

           Richard looks... It’s a gigantic billboard with Richard’s 
           grinning face on it: 
                                 THE RICHARD SIMMONS SHOW
                                 TV THAT MAKES YOU SWEAT

                                 RICHARD
                        There I am -- hi, Dicky!
                             (re: the song)
                        Sing along with me.

           Leonard turns up his nose.

                                 RICHARD
                             (singing)
                        Two lights that shine as one
                        Morning glory and midnight sun
                             (to Leonard)
                        C’mon, Dad -- it’s Barbra.

           Leonard chuckles -- why the heck not.

                                 RICHARD/LEONARD
                        Time, we've learned to sail above
                        Time, won't change the meaning of 
                        one love
                        Ageless and ever, evergreen

           Richard shrieks with glee as the limo blazes into the 
           distance.

           I./E. STRETCH LIMO/HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DAY

           Richard and Leonard’s limo pulls to a stop by a stunning, all-
           white Southern Antebellum mansion, guarded by a tall gate.

                                 LEONARD
                        What’s this place?

                                 RICHARD
                             (his big moment)
                        ...It’s my new house.

           Leonard’s face is unreadable.

           The LIMO DRIVER opens the door. Leonard steps out, with 
           Richard close behind him, eager for dad’s reaction.

           Leonard’s eyes drift over the property...

                                 LEONARD
                        Now this is a house.

           Richard has never beamed brighter.
           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard, so jazzed, drags Leonard inside.

                                 RICHARD
                        They used the outside for a scene 
                        in “Gone With the Wind.”

           Leonard takes it all in. High ceilings. Restored Victorian 
           furniture. Outlandish, colorful artwork. He’s in awe.

           Six Dalmatian pups bound out of the kitchen. They bark, 
           sniff, and leap around Leonard.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to the dogs)
                        No humping -- yes, I’m talking you, 
                        Scarlett.

           Leonard chuckles and pats the doggies.

           Mauro edges in from the kitchen -- a little nervous.

                                 RICHARD
                        Dad, I’d like you to meet Mauro, my 
                        assistant, masseuse, and personal 
                        artist.
                             (gestures around)
                        He did all these paintings.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh -- hi there -- lovely work.

                                 MAURO
                        I’ve heard so much about you.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to Leonard)
                        Lots of space here... Maybe you and 
                        Mom could move in with me.

           Leonard eyes Mauro. Doesn’t respond.

                                 RICHARD
                        You should see Mauro’s bedroom -- 
                        it’s even bigger than mine.

                                 LEONARD
                             (to Mauro)
                        You live here?

           Mauro shifts in his shoes.

           Richard grabs Leonard and drags him back toward the door.
                                 RICHARD
                        Let’s get going. My taping starts 
                        soon.

                                 LEONARD
                        Jeez, Dicky -- we just got here.

           INT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 4 HALLWAY - DAY

           Richard leads Leonard through the pre-show hustle and bustle. 
           Leonard is astonished -- all this for little Dicky.

           Woody hustles over. Hands Leonard a script.

                                 WOODY
                        Here’s your script, Mr. Simmons.

           The blood drains from Leonard’s face.

                                 LEONARD
                        ...My script?

                                 RICHARD
                        I thought it’d be fun to have you 
                        on the show. It’s a great little 
                        skit.

                                 LEONARD
                        I’m not doing it.

           Woody gives Richard a nervous look.

                                 RICHARD
                        Dad, we’re on in five minutes.

                                 LEONARD
                        I’m not doing it!

           The STAFF notice the fuss. Leonard notices them noticing.

                                 WOODY
                        Mr. Simmons, the set is on stage. 
                        We don’t have a backup skit. If you 
                        don’t do this we’re -- pardon my 
                        language -- we’re fucked.

                                 RICHARD
                        Please, Dad?

           Leonard sighs.
           INT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 4 - DAY

           THE RICHARD SIMMONS SHOW POV: Grainy TV static...

           The STUDIO AUDIENCE applauds as Richard, in a bright red 
           sweatsuit, leads Leonard, in a cardigan and perfectly pleated 
           slacks, onto a dressing room set.

           Leonard acts thoroughly impressed by the “dressing room” -- 
           this guy is a performer through and through.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well, you really do have your own 
                        show now, huh?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes, I do.

                                 LEONARD
                        You’re doing really good. I like 
                        it. I’m very proud of you, son.

                                 RICHARD
                        Thanks, Dad.

           Leonard eyes a rack of sweatsuits.

                                 LEONARD
                        But look at all these jogging 
                        suits. When are you going to start 
                        dressing like an adult?

           The audience laughs. Richard feigns being hugely offended.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well, Dad -- maybe I’ll go shopping 
                        and find some adult clothes.

           Richard winks at the camera. Exits.

           Leonard steps toward the sweatsuits. Takes off his cardigan.

           He glances around -- good, no one’s looking.

           Leonard takes a bright green sweatsuit jacket off the rack... 
           And slips it on.

           He looks at the camera with a huge, self-satisfied grin -- 
           what a ham!

           The audience erupts in laughter and applause.

           Colorful text is superimposed on the screen:
                                     WHOEVER YOU ARE
                                 IT’S GOOD TO BE YOURSELF!

           INT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - STAGE 4 HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Leonard steps backstage. Richard rushes toward him.

                                 RICHARD
                        You were great--

           Leonard slaps Richard.

           Richard is stunned -- tears form instantly.

           The backstage bustle screeches to a halt. 

           Woody inches closer -- concerned.

                                 LEONARD
                             (on fire)
                        I said I didn’t want to do it. That 
                        was a complete embarrassment.
                             (Richard is dumbstruck)
                        When’s the play going to be over, 
                        Dicky?
                        What are you really going to do?

                                 RICHARD
                        I--

                                 LEONARD
                        Do you have any friends? 
                        Are you going to get married?

           Richard scrambles for a comeback. He reaches for something. 
           Anything...

                                 RICHARD
                        It just so happens I’m dating 
                        someone... Barbra Streisand.

           This throws Leonard for a loop.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well... Good!

           Leonard storms off. Richard stands frozen -- destroyed -- and 
           a liar.

                                 WOODY
                             (to the staff)
                        Okay, everyone back to work -- 
                        we’ve got a show to do!
           The staff does as they’re told. The tension hangs in the air.

                                 WOODY
                             (approaches Richard)
                        Are you alright?

                                 RICHARD
                             (hard)
                        Get the fuck away from me.
                             (Woody is stunned)
                        Fire whoever wrote that skit.

                                 WOODY
                        ...Okay, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        And get me on every talkshow you 
                        can... I need to win an Emmy.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - OFFICE - SUNSET

           On a table by the window sits a dollhouse -- a striking 
           replica of Richard’s own Antebellum mansion.

           Richard stands before it, holding an open delivery box. His 
           phone is on speaker...

                                 RICHARD
                        Hi, Mom. Is Dad there?

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        ...He’s busy right now, sweetheart.

           Richard reaches into the box. Takes out a doll made in his 
           own image, complete with mischievous grin.

           He places the Richard doll in the dollhouse.

                                 RICHARD
                        He’s been “busy” for months. Did he 
                        get the tape of the show I sent?

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        Yes.

           He places a Mauro doll in the house.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Did he watch it?

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        ...No, Dicky.
           Richard sighs. Places a Woody doll in the house.

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t suppose he told you that I 
                        want you guys to come live with me.

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        He did... It’s not the right time.

                                 RICHARD
                        You can’t be serious. When would be 
                        the right time?

           Richard gazes at the Shirley doll in his hand. Bitterly 
           places it in the dollhouse.

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        ...Our home is in New Orleans...
                        Would you like me to tell Dad 
                        anything for you?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...No.

           Richard takes the Leonard doll out of the box... Throws it 
           into the house.

           The Leonard doll smiles out at him.

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        I hope you’re not working too hard, 
                        baby. You need to remember to take 
                        some time for yourself.

           Richard notices something outside...

           Mauro scurries through the front gate... Into the arms of 
           KEITH (25), sexy and very fit.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I’m fine.

                                 SHIRLEY (ON PHONE)
                        Okay, Dicky. I love you.

           Shirley hangs up.

           Richard watches Mauro and Keith hop into Keith’s Thunderbird 
           and speed off.

           His heart sinks even lower.
           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s very dark... A key turns in the lock. The door creaks 
           open. The lights burst on--

           The room is packed with dolls -- a vast assortment of 
           Barbies, Raggedy Anns and Andys, Polly Pockets galore.

           Richard slogs to a closet. Opens the double doors.

           In the shadowy closet stands a large doll on a pedestal.

           He flicks a light switch -- a spotlight hits the doll...

           It’s Barbra, in a gorgeous red ballgown. It looks exactly 
           like her. This thing must’ve cost $10,000. 

           Richard gazes at the Barbra doll. Sighs.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Richard sneaks toward the hushed laughter in the distance.

           He peeks around a corner. Spies Mauro and Keith tiptoeing 
           down the hall.

           Keith grabs Mauro’s ass. Mauro stifles a giggle. They step 
           into Mauro’s bedroom and close the door.

           Richard creeps to the door... Puts his ear against it...

           Gentle moans and giggles drift out from within.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - FOYER - SUNRISE

           Mauro and Keith share a sweet and passionate kiss.

           Mauro glances around. Opens the door.

                                 MAURO
                             (whispers)
                        See you soon.

                                 KEITH
                             (whispers)
                        We don’t have to be so quiet.

           Mauro smiles -- embarrassed.

           Keith kisses him again. Strides out the door.

           Mauro closes it. Turns...
           Richard is on the landing. Silhouetted against the early sun.

           This startles Mauro. He quickly composes himself.

                                 MAURO
                        Good morning, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        Ready for our morning calls?

                                 MAURO
                        ...Maybe we should take a day off.

                                 RICHARD
                        I can’t do that.
                             (long pause)
                        ...Were you safe last night?

                                 MAURO
                        Excuse me?

                                 RICHARD
                        With your friend.

                                 MAURO
                             (thrown)
                        Oh... Yes, of course.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Good. I can’t lose you.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

           Richard and Mauro sit across the desk from one another. State 
           of the art touchtone phones before both of them.

           Mauro dials number after number. Tells each to, “Please hold 
           for Richard Simmons.”

           Richard has a phone to his ear. He smiles down at a photo of 
           Michael Hebranko, who has made an incredible transformation -- 
           he looks to be in the 300lb range, and wears a shining smile.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m looking at it now, Michael. 
                        You’ve done such an amazing job.

                                 MICHAEL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s all thanks to you, Richard.
                                 RICHARD
                        No. Who was the one sweating? Who 
                        was the one saying no to bad foods? 
                        Who was it?

                                 MICHAEL (ON PHONE)
                             (chuckles)
                        It was me.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want to show your sweet ass off 
                        to the world. You’re coming to Los 
                        Angeles.

           EXT. ANATOMY ASYLUM - DAY

           Richard stands at a podium. A velvet drape hides the Anatomy 
           Asylum marquee above him.

           FANS buzz before him. TV cameras film.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...And before the big unveiling, I 
                        have an huge announcement...
                        The Richard Simmons Show has been 
                        nominated for an Emmy!
                             (the fans cheer)
                        So without further ado, allow me to 
                        show you the new name for my studio 
                        that’ll usher in the next phase of 
                        my crazy fitness journey...

           Richard pulls a rope. The drape falls. The marquee now reads:

                                         SLIMMONS

           The crowd hoots and hollers.

                                 RICHARD
                        Slim -- Simmons -- Slimmons! Get 
                        it?

           INT. SLIMMONS - STUDIO - DAY

           A new lighting grid beams in every color. Duran Duran’s 
           HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF booms through hi-tech speakers.

           The room is filled with PEOPLE of all shapes and sizes, 
           including Mauro and Maggie, who’s toned and glowing.

           Richard stalks down a row of students doing push ups. There’s 
           an impudent edge to the way Richard runs the class.
                                 RICHARD
                        Up -- down -- up -- down.

           A few people struggle and whine.

                                 RICHARD
                        Stop complaining -- you’ve gotta go 
                        home with that body, not me, so 
                        let’s do it!

           MINUTES LATER

           He leads the group in abdominal crunches.

                                 RICHARD
                        Absolutely no farting! You people 
                        eat fucking Mexican food and I have 
                        to suffer!

           This earns some hearty chuckles.

           MINUTES LATER

           The students do lunge after lunge -- sweating buckets.

           Richard stands by the lone oscillating fan in the studio.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want you sweating!

           He turns off the fan. The class groans. 

           Richard’s eye twitches. He dashes to the open door.

                                 RICHARD
                        Turn on me and I’ll close the doors 
                        like Anne Frank!

           An audible gasp from the group.

           MINUTES LATER

           HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF fades away. Richard grins and applauds 
           the class as they applaud him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Now get your sexy bodies outta 
                        here.

           Maggie rushes to him.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Congratulations about your show... 
                        It doesn’t mean you’re going to 
                        close this place, does it?

                                 RICHARD
                        I just changed the name -- why 
                        would I close it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re right -- sorry. I just don’t 
                        think I can do this without you.

                                 RICHARD
                        This place is gonna stay open ‘til 
                        I get hit by a Little Debbie truck.
                        Wanna grab a salad?

           INT. SLIMMONS - SALAD BAR - DAY

           All red and sparkly now. It’s busier than ever.

           Richard and Maggie munch salad at a hightop.

                                 RICHARD
                        Applying to college already? Jeez 
                        Louise, just yesterday your little 
                        girl was a... little girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (chuckles)
                        And I’m... seeing someone.

                                 RICHARD
                        Maggie! You nasty little trollop. 
                        Is he a good one?

                                 MAGGIE
                        He might be the one.
                             (Richard squeals)
                        How about you? Anyone special?

                                 RICHARD
                             (caught off guard)
                        Oh, no. I’m just so busy. It 
                        wouldn’t be fair.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Really? I always thought you and 
                        Mauro...

           Richard looks away like a nervous little boy.
                                 RICHARD
                        No.
                             (forced giggle)
                        Mauro? No.

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Richard watches from the wings as THE TONIGHT SHOW’s glam and 
           fab guest host, JOAN RIVERS (48), delivers her opening 
           monologue to the LIVE AUDIENCE.

                                 RICHARD
                             (sotto)
                        I made it, Josie.

           Woody scurries up behind him.

                                 WOODY
                        Big things happening... Reagan just 
                        lifted the restrictions on TV 
                        commercial time.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Okay. So there’ll be like two 
                        minute commercials now?

                                 WOODY
                        Hour long commercials. Guess who’s 
                        making the first big splash?

           Richard raises his eyebrows -- waits for the answer.

                                 WOODY
                        Jane. Fonda.

                                 RICHARD
                        What’s she selling?

                                 WOODY
                             (get this)
                        Exercise videos.

                                 RICHARD
                        No fucking way.

                                 WOODY
                        Want to get out ahead of this?

           Richard chews on it.

           Richard is in the guest chair beside Joan’s desk, with 
           Michael Hebranko on his other side.

           The audience applauds. We’re back from break.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        We’re back with fabulous fitness 
                        guru Richard Simmons and his 
                        protege, Michael Hebranko. 
                             (to Richard and Michael)
                        Congratulations both of you -- that 
                        weight loss is fantastic -- it’s 
                        just a miracle.

           Richard and Michael beam at each other.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        We’ve got something very special 
                        tonight. We have some people on the 
                        phone -- fans of Richard -- who’ve 
                        been inspired by him and want to 
                        share their stories.
                             (to the caller)
                        Trisha -- you there?

                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                             (tearful and scared)
                        ...Yes...

                                 RICHARD
                        Hi, Trisha. How are you?

                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                             (whimpers)
                        ...Hi, Richard...

                                 RICHARD
                        Thanks so much for calling.

           More whimpers from Trisha.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        You got your hand down your pants? 
                        What’s going on over there?

           The audience laughs.

           Richard senses something serious...

                                 RICHARD
                        Trisha, are you okay?
                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                        ...I’m sorry to do this here, but I 
                        didn’t know how else to talk to 
                        you... I have to kill myself.

           The audience chuckles nervously.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        Gimme a break -- this is a prank.
                             (to someone on set)
                        Hang up on this joker.  

                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t you dare.

           Richard stares into the camera. Knows this is the real deal.

                                 RICHARD
                        Tell me what the problem is, 
                        Trisha. What’s wrong?

                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                        ...I weigh four-hundred-and-twenty-
                        seven pounds. I look like... I just 
                        look like a pig. 
                        My husband left me two weeks ago -- 
                        he said it made him sick to look at 
                        me... 
                        ‘Cause I’m disgusting. 
                        No man wants to be near me... 
                        His gun’s in my hand.

                                 RICHARD
                             (laser focused)
                        Now, Trisha -- I want you to listen 
                        to me...

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - TV ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Mauro watches the show -- transfixed.

                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...When I was a little boy, another 
                        boy who I thought was my friend 
                        attacked me because of what I was. 
                        That was the first time I wished I 
                        was dead...

           INT. SIMMONS RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Leonard and Shirley’s eyes are glued to the show.
                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...When I was nineteen years old, I 
                        lived in Italy. 
                        Everyone there was so beautiful -- 
                        and I was so disgusted by the way I 
                        looked that I starved myself down 
                        to a hundred-and-nineteen pounds in 
                        two and a half months. 
                        When I think back on that now, I 
                        know I was trying to kill myself.

           Leonard and Shirley look at each other -- they had no idea.

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW STUDIO - STAGE - THAT MOMENT

           Woody watches from behind a camera. Eyes fixed on Richard. 
           Not breathing.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I ended up in a hospital, and 
                        someone asked me a question that 
                        changed my life...
                        “Do you want to live, or do you 
                        want to die?”
                        ...And I just chose to live...
                        Are you still with me, Trisha?

                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                        ...I’m here...

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re only here once.
                        God has bestowed you with life.
                        He could have made you a rose that 
                        lasted seven days.
                        Or a butterfly that only lasted 
                        three weeks.
                        But He chose to give you the 
                        highest form of life... 
                        That of a human being.
                        And He gave you the ability to heal 
                        yourself.
                        And I’m here to tell you that it’s 
                        possible.
                        And you’re not alone...
                        I want you to stay on the line, and 
                        give your number to whoever’s 
                        taking the calls. And I’m going to 
                        call you the second I’m done here. 
                        And I’m going to call you tomorrow. 
                        And I’m going to do whatever it 
                        takes... 
                        Can you do that for me, Trisha?
                                 TRISHA (THRU SPEAKERS)
                        ...Yes, Richard.

           Richard exhales.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        ...I just had a coronary. Uh -- 
                        let’s go to break. Go to break.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        We’re clear! Back in two minutes!

           Richard slumps back in his chair. Michael grabs his hand.

           Woody dashes to the exhausted Richard.

                                 WOODY
                        That’s going to get you your Emmy.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I need a break. I’m going to go 
                        home for a while.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Richard gazes up at the bell tower that stretches to the 
           heavens.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - SPORTS FIELD - DAY

           Richard stands on the 50 yard line of the empty field. He 
           gazes down at the spot where Tom attacked him.

           He turns and looks at the bleachers...

           A boy with a frizzy afro, in a khaki school uniform, is 
           slouched there... 

           It’s YOUNG RICHARD. Overweight. Unhappy. Alone. 

           The sound of boys playing football whispers in the wind.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - GYM - DAY

           From a small stage, Richard leads a bunch of MIDDLE SCHOOLERS 
           in an aerobics routine.

           Many are overweight. They’re having fun, but struggling to 
           keep up.
                                 RICHARD
                        C’mon, my children!
                        You can keep up with an old man, 
                        can’t you?
                        Let’s go now -- kids are supposed 
                        to have energy!

           He focuses on two rather overweight kids...

           Three larger children...

           The heaviest boy in the class.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CATHEDRAL SCHOOL - DAY

           Richard strolls down a walkway with the principal, Father 
           Lawanga, who we may remember as Richard’s old PE teacher.

                                 RICHARD
                        Why are the kids so fat?

                                 FATHER LAWANGA
                        You noticed. Well, they took PE out 
                        of the curriculum. And that 
                        cafeteria food...

                                 RICHARD
                        The school got rid of PE?

                                 FATHER LAWANGA
                        No school is doing it anymore.

                                 RICHARD
                             (shocked)
                        No school in the state?

                                 FATHER LAWANGA
                        ...In the country.

                                 RICHARD
                             (beside himself)
                        If these kids don’t get exercise 
                        they’re going to be miserable. 
                        Someone has to do something. 

                                 FATHER LAWANGA
                        ...If God wills it.

           Richard stews on this.
           INT. SIMMONS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Not much has changed since his youth. Richard gazes at the 
           splendid array of food inside the big, white refrigerator.

           The front door creaks open and slams shut. 

           LENNY rushes in. He’s now late thirties and a bit chubby, but 
           still the spitting image of Richard. His expression is grave.

                                 LENNY
                        There you are. I thought you were 
                        flying in this morning.

                                 RICHARD
                        I was teaching a class. What’s 
                        wrong, Lenny?

                                 LENNY
                        Dad’s surgery didn’t go well.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...But it was just kidney stones.

           INT. TOURO INFIRMARY - INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - NIGHT 

           Richard edges inside. Leonard is hooked up to so many 
           machines. So frail.

           Richard nearly crumbles.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Dad?

                                 LEONARD
                             (drugged to the gills)
                        ...Milty...

           Richard sits on the edge of a chair next to Leonard’s bed.

                                 LEONARD
                        How are you?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m okay... I was nominated for an 
                        Emmy.

                                 LEONARD
                        That’s fantastic... I’m sorry I 
                        slapped you.

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s okay... I had it coming.
                                 LEONARD
                        ...Nah...

                                 RICHARD
                        Is there anything I can do for you?

                                 LEONARD
                        Yeah... Pray for me...

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course. I already did on the way 
                        over here.

                                 LEONARD
                        ...Pray with the pope...

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Huh?

                                 LEONARD
                        Are you still dating Barbra?

                                 RICHARD
                        ...Yes.

                                 LEONARD
                        I want you to marry her... Could 
                        you do that?

           Leonard drifts off to sleep. 

           Richard watches Leonard’s heartbeat monitor slowly, weakly 
           BEEP BEEP BEEP.

           He dwells on his father’s words... Comes to a decision.

           INT. ORNATE HALLWAY - DAY

           Richard, his heart racing, follows a silk-suited MAN down a 
           red carpeted floor, past Catholic works of art.

           The man opens the double doors at the end of the hall...

           The light blinds Richard.

           He shields his eyes.

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh God...

           Richard lowers his hands, he is in...
           INT. APOSTOLIC PALACE - PAPAL CHAMBERS - DAY

           Light beams through the tall windows.

           POPE JOHN PAUL II (62) stands before Richard. In his pure 
           white papal vestments he could be God himself.

           Richard is thunderstruck.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        My child, thank you for spreading 
                        your message of health. You do the 
                        world a great service.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...You’re welcome...
                             (getting it together)
                        Your holiness, my father is very 
                        ill. He asked me to pray with you.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        When was your last confession?

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh... Twenty-five-ish years ago... 
                        I’m sorry.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        Would you like to confess your 
                        sins? 

                                 RICHARD
                             (ugh)
                        If you want.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        We can then pray for your father.

                                 RICHARD
                        Okay...
                             (deep breath)
                        Forgive me, father, for I have 
                        sinned.
                        It’s been -- we’ve been over this.
                        ...I don’t always honor the sabbath 
                        day. But I do pray -- quite a bit.
                        ...I curse sometimes -- bad words, 
                        not witch hexes or anything...

           The pope’s eyes penetrate Richard’s soul...

                                 RICHARD
                             (gives in, gets real)
                        There’s been so much gluttony. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        For years, I just ate. And I’ve 
                        gotten better, but I can feel it -- 
                        I can always feel it. Pulling at 
                        me. Every second I’m this close to 
                        stuffing my face with french fries 
                        or something...
                             (getting tearful)
                        There’s something inside me... I 
                        feel -- it’s not lust... It’s like 
                        sadness and anger where lust should 
                        be. But it’s terrible. It burns.
                             (manic)
                        I haven’t honored my parents -- my 
                        father, especially. I was so awful 
                        to him. He wasn’t the nicest guy 
                        either -- but hell -- heck -- he 
                        tried hard, and I was just some fat 
                        little reptile -- eating 
                        everything, and poking at him. 
                        ...And now he’s gonna die...
                        I don’t even know what I’m doing. I 
                        told him I was dating Barbra 
                        Streisand, for crying out loud. 
                        I’m insane -- I think I’m just 
                        insane.
                             (desperate)
                        I’m a complete phony. I always tell 
                        people they can do it -- when I 
                        don’t even think I’ll be able to 
                        make it through the day.
                        These people just count on me -- 
                        it’s so much pressure. If I’m not 
                        available for one second, I think 
                        somebody’s gonna drop dead.
                        And I won’t be able to handle that 
                        if it happens again.
                        I’m tired, father. I’m really 
                        fucking tired...

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        You give of yourself too freely.

                                 RICHARD
                        But isn’t that what Jesus did?

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        And look what happened to him. 
                        This love you give away... You must 
                        keep some inside you.

           Richard tries to digest this.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        Let us pray.
           The pope kneels. Richard falls to his knees. They bow their 
           heads.

                                 POPE JOHN PAUL II
                        Carissimi Jube domne benedicere 
                        Dominus Simmons per patris 
                        discrimen salutis... 

           Richard peeks up at the pope -- looks like good praying.

           INT. PASADENA CIVIC AUDITORIUM - THEATRE - DAY

           The lower level is filled with tuxedo and gown clad SOAP 
           OPERA STARS and TALKSHOW HOSTS. The gallery teems with 
           fervent SOAP FANS.

           Richard, in a tux, squirms in his seat next to Woody and his 
           wife, NORA (42).

           SUSAN LUCCI (36), the picture of daytime TV glamour, stands 
           behind the podium on stage.

                                 SUSAN LUCCI
                        And the winner for outstanding talk 
                        or service series is...
                             (opens the envelope)
                        The Richard Simmons Show!

           The gallery erupts. The soap stars clap politely.

           Richard goes absolutely insane as he rushes onto the stage. 
           Makes Roberto Benigni look like Angela Landsbury.

           He grabs the Emmy statue from Susan -- and practically makes 
           out with her.

           Finally, he takes the mic. On his way to tears...

                                 RICHARD
                        Dad... We won an Emmy.
                        Thank you for being on my show, and 
                        letting me get a little glimpse of 
                        the incredible performer you are.
                        There’s so much I want to say. 
                        There’s so much I want to know 
                        about you.
                        I can’t wait to see you again and 
                        talk to you.
                        Maybe I’ll finally work up the 
                        nerve to ask if I can shake your 
                        hand.
                        ...I’m so sorry, Dad...
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        But I know you’re going to be okay, 
                        because God loves you.
                        I’m going to come straight to New 
                        Orleans and put this Emmy in your 
                        hands.
                        I love you, Dad. 
                        Everything I do is for you.

           The “get off the stage” music plays. The crowd applauds.

           Richard wipes his tears. Stands tall. The weight of the world 
           lifted from his shoulders.

           He scurries into darkness of...

           BACKSTAGE

           ...and is delighted to see Woody. Richard wraps him in a hug.  

           He realizes Woody is crying.

                                 RICHARD
                        Dry those tears. It’s a happy day.

                                 WOODY
                        No, Richard. He’s gone... Your 
                        father died.

           The Emmy slips from Richard’s grasp -- crashes to the floor.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT - BLOSSOM BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Old Hollywood architecture at its finest. Drunk as fuck Emmy 
           AFTER PARTIERS schmooze and flirt.

           Richard, with a dazed, forced smile on his face and his 
           dented Emmy in hand, accepts passing congratulations.

           PHIL DONAHUE (50), white haired and gregarious, bounds over. 
           Gives Richard a good natured slug to the arm.

                                 PHIL DONAHUE
                        Son of a bitch -- I thought I had 
                        that trophy in the bag. Does this 
                        mean I need to start working out on 
                        my show, too?

           Richard doesn’t respond. His glazed eyes are fixed on a woman 
           in a red ballgown weaving her way toward him...

           Phil’s blabbering fades into the background...
           The red woman glides up to Richard... Brushes her hair away 
           from her face...

           It’s her... Barbra. 

           She’s aged ever so gracefully. That youthful gleam in her 
           eyes. That soothing smile on her lips.

                                 BARBRA
                        Well hello, cutie.

                                 RICHARD
                        Barbra... Thank God you’re here.

                                 BARBRA
                        Look at that trophy...
                        I’m so proud of you.

                                 RICHARD
                        But my dad didn’t live to see it.

                                 BARBRA
                        None of us live forever...
                        But I keep making music so my voice 
                        can live on after death.
                        ...You know what you have to do... 
                        You can keep helping people long 
                        after you’re gone.

           She runs her fingers through his frizzy locks.

                                 BARBRA
                        ...And Richard...
                        Save the children.

           Richard’s eyes widen. He understands completely.

           Barbra purses her lips...

           Richard purses his...

           Each mouth drawn toward the other...

           An inch from heavenly connection...

           They--

                                 WOODY (O.S.)
                        Richard!

           Richard snaps back to reality -- Barbra is gone.

           Woody stands beside him -- deeply concerned.
                                 WOODY
                        Phil Donahue said you went 
                        catatonic. Let’s have the driver 
                        take you home.

           Richard’s spine straightens. His eyes are bonfires.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m not going anywhere. 
                        How fast can you get a crew 
                        together? We need to start 
                        shooting.

                                 WOODY
                             (confused)
                        The show’s on hiatus.

                                 RICHARD
                        Not for the show.

                                 WOODY
                             (gets it)
                        ...Oh... I can do it fast.

                                 RICHARD
                        And I need to get PE back in 
                        schools. But not that jock shit -- 
                        know what I mean?

                                 WOODY
                        ...Not really. But -- uh...

           He spots an overweight, balding man nearby.

                                 WOODY
                        Roger -- c’mere a minute.

           The man grins at Woody. Struts toward him.

                                 WOODY
                             (to Richard)
                        He’ll know what to do.

           Richard sizes the man up. This guy drips arrogance, and has a 
           body like a too-full garbage bag.

                                 WOODY
                        Richard Simmons, meet Roger Ailes.

           Richard shakes ROGER AILES’ sweaty paw.

                                 WOODY
                        Roger worked for me on Mike 
                        Douglas.
                                 ROGER AILES
                        Before I left to get a president 
                        elected.

                                 RICHARD
                        Which one?

                                 ROGER AILES
                        Nixon.

                                 RICHARD
                             (slight grimace)
                        ...Great.
                             (steamrolling)
                        I need to get a law passed to get 
                        PE back in the school system.

                                 ROGER AILES
                        I always hated PE.

                                 RICHARD
                        Me too! Wouldn’t it be better if 
                        instead of playing sports we just 
                        danced around?

           Roger stares at him -- completely unimpressed by the idea.

                                 ROGER AILES
                        You’re gonna need to get a bill 
                        passed through congress. Get in

                        representative from California. 
                        Total media whore. Loves 
                        celebrities. But you’ll still need 
                        a petition -- those idiots love 
                        signatures.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes!

           Richard jumps Roger with a hug. Roger wrenches free.

                                 RICHARD
                             (re: Roger’s big belly)
                        If you ever want to give me a call, 
                        please don’t hesitate... I think I 
                        can help you.

                                 ROGER AILES
                        Fuck off.

           Roger stomps off. Woody puts a tender hand on Richard’s arm.
                                 WOODY
                        Maybe you shouldn’t do all this at 
                        once. Take a minute to grieve.

                                 RICHARD
                        There’s no time.
                        God could take me at any moment.

           Richard dashes outside to the...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT - RED CARPET - CONTINUOUS

           Flashbulbs flare. FANS shriek. Richard poses for the cameras.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Richard -- what’s next for you?

           NEWS CAMERA POV:

           Richard flashes a maniacal grin right at us.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m going to do something that’s 
                        never been seen before. I’m going 
                        to reach every person in America --
                        every child in every school. 
                        Richard Simmons is going to save 
                        every overweight person in the 
                        whole wide world!

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Richard stares at the smiling Leonard doll in his dollhouse. 

           Richard wears his emotions now. His being has been shattered.

           The Emmy lies toppled on Richard’s desk. There’s a phone to 
           his ear.

                                 LENNY (ON PHONE)
                        ...All of a sudden he was just 
                        gone...

                                 RICHARD
                        I needed him to hear my speech.

                                 LENNY (ON PHONE)
                        I’m so sorry, Dicky...
                        I’ll start planning the funeral 
                        tomorrow.
                                 RICHARD
                        ...I can’t go.

                                 LENNY (ON PHONE)
                        Dicky--

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll pay for everything. I’ll order 
                        every white rose in New Orleans. 
                        But I’m not coming.

                                 LENNY (ON PHONE)
                        One of these days you’re going to 
                        have to grow up.

           Lenny hangs up.

           Richard screams -- guttural -- primal.

           He claws at his hair -- his neck.

           Agony. Rage. Like an angel cast out of heaven.

           He collapses into his chair. Draws heavy, wheezing breaths.

           Richard stares outside. Clouds drift past the waning moon.

           The moon disappears. The darkness turns to the pink sky of...

           SUNRISE

           Richard stares at his dollhouse...

           The Leonard doll is gone.

           In front of the house sits a small, distinguished urn.

           There’s a note beside it:

                                  A LITTLE PIECE OF DAD
                                        LOVE, MOM

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The size of an airport hangar. Woody has assembled a team of 
           PRODUCERS, CREW, and PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS.

           There’s a nervous energy. Woody’s eyes are on the doors.

           They swing open. Light floods in. A silhouette appears...
           A woman with a big hairdo, in a long, thick coat. This bad 
           bitch struts inside...

           It’s Richard, in a half-black, half-white wig and Dalmatian 
           fur coat -- Cruella De Vil.

           The staff gape at him.

                                 PRODUCER/GAFFER/PA
                        Sorry for your loss./ My 
                        condolences, Richard./ I’m so 
                        sorry.

                                 RICHARD
                        Fuck it.
                        Welcome to my church.
                        There are no limits to what we can 
                        do here.
                        We are going to provide every 
                        person in America with the tools 
                        they need to live a healthy 
                        lifestyle.
                        We are going to inspire, educate, 
                        and sell.
                        And we’re going to have the time of 
                        our fucking lives doing it.
                        This is the new frontier.
                        I’m buying my airtime now.
                        And everybody’s gonna see me.

           INT. RICHARD’S ROOM / INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Barbra’s PAPA CAN YOU HEAR ME rips at our heartstrings as we 
           intercut between a studio being assembled and Richard putting 
           on his new armor...

           --RICHARD’S ROOM: He slowly, methodically spreads foundation 
           on his face. Covers the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth.

           --WAREHOUSE: Three sets are built at once: a kitchen, an 
           exercise studio, and a talk show set.

           --RICHARD’S ROOM: He sprays bald spot concealer on his 
           thinning crown.

           --WAREHOUSE: Telephones are placed on row after row of desks.

           --RICHARD’S ROOM: He pulls on a pair of red-and-white striped 
           dolphin shorts.

           --WAREHOUSE: A huge digital SALES TRACKER is mounted on a 
           wall.
           --RICHARD’S ROOM: He sprays his legs with PAM ‘til they 
           glisten like a basted ham.

           --WAREHOUSE: Five state of the art TV cameras are wheeled in.

           --RICHARD’S ROOM: He pulls on a red tank top. It glitters 
           with Swarovski crystals, and reads: FAREWELL TO FAT

           --WAREHOUSE: The studio lights blast on.

           --RICHARD’S ROOM: Richard, ready for sparkly battle, stares 
           at himself in a full length mirror... He looks amazing. 
           Magical. One of a kind... 

           But his eyes are dead.

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDIO - DAY

           The warehouse has become a studio that would make Paramount 
           drool.

           The rows of AUDIENCE MEMBERS murmur with anticipation.

           Richard, with a sharklike focus, finds his mark in the middle 
           of the talk show set.

           Woody stands beside one of the cameras trained on Richard.

           Woody thrusts a finger toward Richard--

                                 WOODY
                        Action!

           A mask of a lively grin crashes onto Richard’s face.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to camera)
                        Isn’t it time to deal with the 
                        problems in your life? 
                        Isn’t it time to deal with the 
                        things that are happening to you?

           He holds up a DEAL-A-MEAL food card wallet.

                                 RICHARD
                        Well it’s time to Deal-A-Meal!

           The audience cheers--
           QUICK SHOTS:

           --The rows of phones are now manned by OPERATORS. Their 
           switchboards light up. They pick up their phones.

           --The digital sales tracker is at 0... It flickers to 1... 
           2... 3 -- the numbers begin to move lighting fast -- into the 
           hundreds -- hundreds of thousands -- millions--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SLIMMONS - STUDIO - DAY

           Richard is sickly skinny. His afro is a rat’s nest. Dark 
           circles mar his eyes.

           Richard attempts to lead an aerobics CLASS. But he’s spent. 
           Every movement is labored.

                                 RICHARD
                             (near deadpan)
                        Right and left and right and...

           Richard grinds to a stop -- defeated. He beckons to Mauro.

           Worry dances across Maggie’s face.

           Mauro rushes to Richard.

                                 MAURO
                        Are you feeling alright?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m fine. Take over for a minute.

                                 MAURO
                        Of course.
                             (to the class)
                        Uh -- who’s ready to go swimming?
                        Let’s do the backstroke!

           Richard slogs out the door.

           INT. SLIMMONS - RESTROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Richard gazes at the three black diet pills in his hand...

           He exhales. Pops them. Swallows ‘em dry.
           INT. RICHARD’S STUDIO - HALLWAY - DAY

           Richard, in a purple zoot suit, stalks down a hallway lined 
           with men in SUITS.  

           Woody follows close behind. His concerned gaze locked firmly 
           on Richard.

           THE ROSEANNE SHOW POV:

           Richard, with amphetamine gusto, forces ROSEANNE BARR (48), 
           at peak annoying, to simultaneously bite into a cheeseburger 
           with him in a disturbing reimagining of LADY AND THE TRAMP.

           The LIVE AUDIENCE cheers and catcalls.

           He tosses the burger aside and plants a big, wet, never-
           ending kiss on her lips.

                                 ROSEANNE BARR
                        Nooo! Urgh--

           She finally wrenches free.

           He giggles. She shrieks and shrieks and shrieks.

           MINUTES LATER

           Richard is seated beside Roseanne. They’ve finally made it to 
           the interview portion -- and it’s gotten contentious...

                                 ROSEANNE BARR
                        Diets have never ever worked for 
                        me, and I think the majority of 
                        people they don’t work for either. 
                        And I can’t exercise--

                                 RICHARD
                        What do you mean you can’t 
                        exercise?

                                 ROSEANNE BARR
                        I don’t want to--

                                 RICHARD
                        You don’t want to, fine--

                                 ROSEANNE BARR
                        And I resent you calling me lazy 
                        for that.
                                 RICHARD
                        I think you’re lazy. And I want to 
                        get PE back in school so these kids 
                        don’t have the childhoods we did.

                                 ROSEANNE BARR
                        Well I don’t think exercise is 
                        going to help kids lose weight.

           Richard is done with this bullshit. He turns to the camera.

                                 RICHARD
                        You watching at home. I need you to  
                        go to Richard Simmons dot com, and 
                        sign my petition.

           INT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - NIGHT

           Richard, in a coat and baseball cap, skulks down an aisle. 
           His greedy eyes scan food item after delicious food item.

           He stops at an end-cap display.

           It is filled with Richard Simmons food products -- every 
           package bears his grinning face: one calorie salad spray, low 
           fat cheese puffs, fat free buttery toffee popcorn, etc.

           He’s drawn to the candy bar rack. Glances around...

           Grabs a SNICKERS. Rips it open. Devours.

           3 MUSKETEERS. Down his throat.

           MOUNDS. Inhales it.

           He ditches the wrappers behind the Kotex boxes.

           EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard rushes out. Heads for the shadows.

           A digital muzak version of Barbra’s YOU DON’T BRING ME 
           FLOWERS blasts out of his pocket -- startles him.

           He takes out his bulky flip phone. Answers.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes?

           A knife in Richard’s gut.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I can’t -- I have all these 
                        appearances lined up--

                                 LENNY (ON PHONE)
                        Dicky--

                                 RICHARD
                        You don’t understand -- it’s for 
                        the kids. I have some very 
                        important things to do--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE ED SULLIVAN THEATRE - NIGHT

           Richard, in an elaborate turkey costume and headdress, jumps 
           up and down on THE LATE SHOW stage.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to the audience)
                        Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

           The AUDIENCE cheers and rises.

           DAVID LETTERMAN (50) rolls his eyes from behind his desk.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want PE to be fun for kids. 
                        Dancing -- laughing -- sweating.
                        Like this!

           PAUL SHAFFER’S BAND breaks into TUTTI FRUTTI.

           Richard shakes his tail feathers to the delight of the crowd.

           He backs his gyrating behind toward David, finally rubbing 
           his ass on Letterman’s shoulder.

           David grabs a fire extinguisher from behind his desk -- 
           shoots a massive plume of white smoke at Richard.

           Richard shrieks and stumbles. The audience howls.

           Richard gags and coughs as the fire extinguisher smog swirls.

           He falls to his knees. The coughing fit won’t stop.

           The audience stops cheering.
                                 DAVID LETTERMAN
                        ...Shit.

           INT. PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL - HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard, in a hospital gown, lies in bed -- wheezing.

           A DOCTOR stands over him.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Asthma and a fire extinguisher 
                        aren’t a good mix.
                        But I’m more concerned about your 
                        test results. Elevated liver 
                        enzymes -- your blood pressure is 
                        through the roof.

                                 RICHARD
                        When can I get back to my normal 
                        routine?

                                 DOCTOR
                        There’s nothing normal about your 
                        routine. You have to take better 
                        care of yourself.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...I will. There’s just one more 
                        thing I have to do.

           The doctor gives him a skeptical, stern look.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Simmons...
                        Do you want to live, or do you want 
                        to die?

           That question again... Richard averts his eyes.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mauro rubs his oiled hands up Richard’s bare legs. 

           Richard is lying on his front on a massage table. A towel 
           covers his butt.

                                 MAURO
                        I’ve never felt you this tense. You 
                        need to slow down.

                                 RICHARD
                        You need to not tell me what to do.
           Mauro gazes at the back of Richard’s frizzy head... Makes up 
           his mind.

                                 RICHARD
                        I just need a few thousand more 
                        signatures--

                                 MAURO
                        Turn over.

                                 RICHARD
                             (turning over)
                        --Once I go on Howard Stern my 
                        petition’ll be golden--

           Mauro kisses Richard on the lips.

           Richard freezes.

           Mauro stares into his eyes... Slips his hand beneath 
           Richard’s towel.

                                 MAURO
                             (whispers)
                        You’re wearing yourself out...
                        I’m worried about you...
                        Just relax...

           Tears form in Richard’s eyes. He blinks them down his 
           temples.

           Mauro’s hand moves up and down beneath the towel.

           Richard quietly sobs.

                                 MAURO
                        ...It’s okay...

           Mauro lowers his head for another kiss--

           Richard turns away.

                                 RICHARD
                        Please leave.

           Mauro’s eyes go wide. He whips his hand out from under the 
           towel.

                                 MAURO
                        I’m so sorry. We don’t have to do 
                        anything. I just wanted you to feel 
                        better.
                                 RICHARD
                        ...I need you to move out. I’ll pay 
                        for an apartment. But you can’t 
                        stay here.

                                 MAURO
                        You’re tired. Let’s talk about it 
                        in the morning.

                                 RICHARD
                        No.

           Richard still can’t look at Mauro.

           Mauro is devastated. He takes one last look at Richard... 

           And drags himself out the door.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Richard stares at the smiling Mauro doll in the dollhouse.

           He takes it in his hand...

           Tosses it in the trash.

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDIO - BOARDROOM - DAY

           Richard sits at the head of a long table. His blank eyes 
           stare straight ahead.

           Woody is next to him. The suits take up the other seats.

                                 SUIT #1
                        United wants you on their in-flight 
                        safety video.

                                 SUIT #2
                        Richard Simmons frozen dinners--

                                 SUIT #3
                        A Richard Simmons theme park -- I 
                        mean the rides create themselves--

                                 RICHARD
                        No.

           All the eyebrows raise.

                                 RICHARD
                        We’re shutting down. You all can 
                        go.
           No one moves.

                                 WOODY
                        You heard him -- get the hell outta 
                        here.

           The suits stand. Glare. And filter out.

           Richard gives Woody a sad smile.

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re fired too, Woody.

           Woody lays his hand on Richard’s. Chuckles...

                                 WOODY
                        I know.

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Richard takes the Woody doll out of the dollhouse.

           DAY

           Richard looks like he’s been sitting here for hours. Because 
           he has. His desk is covered with photos of overweight people.

           He holds a photo. It’s him and Joanie, the lady he brought on 
           stage at the Minneapolis mall. 

           Richard speaks into the phone...

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m sorry, Joanie. I’m glad my 
                        calls helped you -- but I just 
                        can’t do it anymore.

                                 JOANIE (ON PHONE)
                             (crying)
                        I’m gonna miss you.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll be thinking about you.

           Joanie hangs up.

           Richard rubs his eyes. Picks up another photo...

           It’s Michael Hebranko and Richard on the set of THE TONIGHT 
           SHOW, grinning with their arms around each other.

           A smile flits across Richard face.
           He dials a number. It rings...

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 RICHARD
                        Madeline? It’s good to hear your 
                        voice -- it’s been so long. It’s 
                        Richard.

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        ...I know.

                                 RICHARD
                        Is Michael there?

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        ...Michael is dead, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                             (heart plummets)
                        ...What happened?

                                 MADELINE (ON PHONE)
                        You stopped calling... He gained it 
                        all back.

           Richard searches for words. But none come.

           Tears flirt with his eyelids as his gaze drifts across the 
           photos on the table.

           EXT. SLIMMONS - DAY

           Maggie leads the first CLASS of the day up the walkway.

           There’s a sign tacked to the door...

                          SLIMMONS IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

           Maggie’s heart breaks.

           She turns and plods back toward the street.

           INT. NEW AMSTERDAM THEATRE - NIGHT

           Richard, front row center in the sold out theatre, watches 
           Barbra sing LOVE THEME FROM A STAR IS BORN.

           She spots him. Winks. Sings right to him.

           He is in awe.
           INT. NEW AMSTERDAM THEATRE - BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Richard races down the busy hallway... He spots a closed 
           door, with Barbra’s autograph in gold on it.

           He steels himself. Opens the door. Ducks inside.

           INT. NEW AMSTERDAM THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard stares at Barbra, who wears a delighted smile.

                                 BARBRA
                        Richard -- it’s so nice to finally 
                        meet you.

                                 RICHARD
                        I love you.

                                 BARBRA
                        I love you too, doll. You’re so 
                        hilarious.

                                 RICHARD
                             (deep breath)
                        When I was a kid, I was miserable.
                        I was fat. Lonely...
                        My father hated me...
                        But one day I heard your voice, and 
                        it felt like you were singing just 
                        for me.
                        All of a sudden I wasn’t so alone.
                        You didn’t look like other girls...
                        And I definitely didn’t look like 
                        other boys.
                        ...You saved my life...

           He drifts to Barbra.

           She takes his hand -- genuinely touched.

                                 RICHARD
                        One of the last things I ever told 
                        my dad was that I was dating you...
                        ...I don’t want to be a liar 
                        anymore...
                        I know I’m nothing special...
                        But I think I’m just a good example 
                        of just being myself.
                        And so are you.
                        ...Maybe I can make things right...

           Richard gets down on one knee.
           Richard takes a Tiffany ring box out of his pocket.

           He stares deep into Barbra’s wide eyes.

           And opens the box to her. The five carat diamond engagement 
           ring sparkles.

                                 RICHARD
                        Barbra Joan Streisand, will you 
                        marry me?

                                 BARBRA
                             (stunned)
                        ...Richard...
                        Aren’t you gay?

           Richard remains frozen a long moment.

           His head lowers. His eyes find the ground.

           Richard rises. Trudges out the door--

           But he remembers something. Turns back...

                                 RICHARD
                        I met you once when I was little...
                        You said if I wanted to be a 
                        performer there was one thing I 
                        needed to remember...
                        What is it?

           An angelic twinkle lights up Barbra’s eyes... Somehow she 
           knows exactly what he’s talking about...

                                 BARBRA
                        Don’t give the audience everything.
                        ...Save some of you for yourself...

           This washes over Richard... He nods.

           INT. THE HOWARD STERN STUDIO - DAY

           HOWARD STERN (45), with his Samson hair and dark shades, sits 
           behind his console. ROBIN QUIVERS (47), his sidekick, is 
           perched in her glass booth.

           They’re grilling Richard, who hasn’t slept all night and has 
           made some deal with the devil that’s giving him the power to

                        want, and yet you refuse to get

           Richard is seated, with perfect posture, in the front row of 
           pews. He gazes up at the giant crucified Jesus on the stage.

           His hair is a mess. His eyes bloodshot.

           The door swings open. Lenny pushes Shirley, now ninety years 
           old and frail, but still glamorous, in a wheelchair up to 
           Richard.

           Lenny glares at Richard and sits a couple rows back.

                        He is -- and he loves you. He had a 
                        hard time of it as a performer. He 
                        just didn’t want to see you get 
                        hurt... But he would tell everyone 
                        in town that his son was on 
                        television. Once he said that his 
                        finest performance was being your 
                        father.

           This should comfort Richard... But it doesn’t.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        This was forwarded to the house...

           Shirley hands Richard an envelope... With a CONGRESSIONAL 
           SEAL on it.

           Richard opens the letter. Reads...

                        never took a PE class in my life.
                        I was overweight and a little 
                        lethargic. A little short.

                        jock.
                        It’s important that you have your 
                        health.
                        And our children right now do not 
                        have it...

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

           Richard’s speech is up on the big screen. PEDESTRIANS watch 
           from the street below.

                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...Every school that I’ve been in, 
                        I put the kids’ music on.
                        I get them going. 
                        They feel great...

           INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Two FRAT GUYS rip bong hits while watching Richard’s speech 
           on YouTube.

                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...And when you’re feeling great 
                        about yourself.
                        When you have self esteem and self 
                        respect for yourself, there’s 
                        nothing you can’t do...

           INT. LA FITNESS - DAY

           A YOUNG WOMAN watches the speech on her phone while running 
           on a treadmill.

                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...I’m still not a jock.
                        But I’m fit! And I’ve dedicated my 
                        life to this...
           INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

                                 RICHARD
                        ...And I hope you know there’s no 
                        other way to do this.
                        Or our kids will get more sick...
                        And they’ll keep feeling bad about 
                        themselves...
                        And our children will die young...
                             (near tears)
                        What have we done?!
                        What have we done to the kids of 
                        the United States of America?
                        This is wrong!
                        We can’t have one kid feel lousy 
                        about himself and get made fun of 
                        because of their weight.
                        We have to support them!
                        I do not want any child in America 
                        to have my childhood -- because it 
                        was taken away from me, because I 
                        just wasn’t good enough...
                             (straightens his spine)
                        Well I’m good enough now.
                        And I’ve -- I’m fifty years old -- 
                        and I’ve devoted my life to this.
                        And I will devote my life to this 
                        until the day I die...

           Things become slightly grainy.

           We pull out to reveal that Richard’s speech is being played 
           on a television in...

           INT. RICHARD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Tiny beams of daylight poke through the few tears in the 
           aluminum foil taped over the windows.

           The TV provides the only other light in the room.

                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        ...And I hope that one day, every 
                        kid gets to feel the self esteem 
                        and self respect that I have.

           A wingback chair faces the television. Richard’s frizzy, 
           thinning afro peeks out from above it.
                                 RICHARD (ON TV)
                        God bless you all.
                        And God bless the children of the 
                        United States of America.
                        Thank you very much.

           The crowd in the Capitol Building applauds--

           The TV cuts to static.

           The static hiss grows louder and louder and louder--

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           TEXT APPEARS:
