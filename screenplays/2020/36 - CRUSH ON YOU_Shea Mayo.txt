           EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

           A clearing in the woods. Moonlight sifts through treetops, 
           soft and ethereal. A puffy little owl hoots. 

           And are those... flower petals softly falling like snow?

           Is it just me, or are these woods prettier than your average 
           woods? It’s like a Victorian fairy painting on a greeting 
           card in a New Age bookstore. 

           A barefoot young woman in pajamas, BRIDGET (19, looking like 
           the girl in the fairy painting) tiptoes through the woods. 

           POV BEHIND A TREE: Someone, or something, watches Bridget 
           step into the clearing, unseen...

           The unseen figure slowly approaches Bridget from behind...

           Stepping closer, and closer, and closer, until --

           Bridget whips around, startled. She stares up at the unseen 
           figure, still shrouded in darkness, despite the moonlight. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        You scared me. 

           The dark figure takes another step forward. Bridget steps 
           back. The figure steps forward, she steps back. She keeps 
           backing away until she’s backed right up against a tree. 

           Bridget’s breathing is rapid, she’s trembling, transfixed, 
           terrified, or, actually, wait a sec... turned on? 

           Let’s go with the latter, because suddenly, Bridget and the 
           dark figure --

           MAKE OUT AGAINST THE TREE. HOT. HEAVY. FAIRYTALE SEX FOREST.  

           After several intense beats, Bridget pulls away. The dark 
           figure whispers something in her ear, and she smiles.

           But something isn’t right.

           Bridget puts her hand to her ear and immediately wishes she 
           hadn’t -- IT’S GONE, nothing more than a gaping, OPEN WOUND.

           BLOOD begins to pour from her head like running water through 
           a nightmarish faucet. 

           She holds her hand over the fleshy wound but it’s no use, 
           she’s quickly SOAKED IN BLOOD. 

           Bridget lets out a glass-shattering SCREAM --
           INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Bridget JOLTS AWAKE in her bed, drenched in sweat. She holds 
           her hand to her ear -- it’s still perfectly intact. 

           She catches her breath and shakily reaches for a glass of 
           water on her night stand. She gulps, gulps, until the glass 
           is empty. She turns to nuzzle back to bed when she notices... 

           A drop of BLOOD on her pillowcase. Bridget touches the spot 
           of blood. She flips the pillow over and goes back to sleep. 

           TITLE OVER BLACK: CRUSH ON YOU

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A windowless office with a small couch, surrounded by one, 
           two, three TISSUE BOXES for easy access. 

           Pamphlets line the shelves, with stock photos and punchy 
           fonts that say things like “Let’s Talk: Speaking Up” and 
           “From Victim to Survivor” and “Stop It Now!” 

           Sitting stiffly on the couch is INDI (20, tanned, tattooed, 
           Florida trashy-pretty -- pretty in the panhandle, trashy in 
           this office). She’s one of those girls who doesn’t “need” to 
           wear makeup, but she does, lots of it, because she likes it. 

           As Indi waits, she adjusts her denim cutoffs, picks a wedgie. 

           After a rap on the door, two college ADMINISTRATORS enter the 
           office, a man and a woman. The male administrator holds a 
           thick file folder. They each pull up a chair across from her. 

                                 MALE ADMINISTRATOR
                        Hi, Indi. Thanks for dropping back 
                        in today.

                                 INDI
                        Sure.

                                 MALE ADMINISTRATOR
                        This will be quick, we just have a 
                        couple things for you to sign. 

           He slides a couple papers and a pen across the coffee table 
           in front of Indi. She begins to read them over. 

                                 MALE ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Just reiterating everything we’ve 
                        already gone over. 

           Indi ignores him, her eyes glued to the page. 
                                 MALE ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Just acknowledging that the Title 
                        IX investigation will close without 
                        moving forward. 

           Indi picks up the pen to sign, then pauses.

                                 INDI
                        So if I sign this, he’s off the 
                        hook?

           The female administrator finally chimes in -- 

                                 FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR
                        This does not mean that you’re 
                        acknowledging he did nothing wrong. 

                                 INDI
                        Just that you can’t do anything 
                        about it. 

           Indi scribbles her signature. The male administrator’s phone 
           RINGS and he rises from his chair. 

                                 MALE ADMINISTRATOR
                        Pardon me --
                             (smiles on his way out)
                        Indi, you enjoy the rest of your 
                        summer.

           Indi does not return the smile. Later, dude. 

                                 FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR
                        This might not be the outcome you 
                        wanted, but I hope this is closure. 

           After a strained beat, Indi slowly stands to go.

                                 FEMALE ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        I know it doesn’t feel like it, but 
                        it’s -- it will be a lot easier on 
                        you this way. 

                                 INDI
                        Uh huh.

           Indi opens the door, sashaying out of the office in her 
           shorty shorts, no further fucks to give. 

           EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - SAME TIME

           A small campus, brick and ivy, brochure-beautiful. We glimpse 
           the highlights: a soccer field, a bell tower, the dorms. 
           This campus is nestled in the woods, secluded by a thick 
           forest of pines. The school looks isolated and expensive. 

           The quad is totally empty, except for two young women hanging 
           around the steps of the administrative building --

           SAMANTHA (20, put together and petite) keeps her eyes on the 
           entrance. Samantha is dressed like someone who can afford to 
           buy all her clothes from Anthropologie, because she can, and 
           she does.

           GABBY (20, spunky in athleisure) does cardio steps on the 
           stairs. Her long dark ponytail swings back and forth, her 
           forehead beaded with sweat. Samantha glances over to Gabby. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can smell your B.O from here.  

                                 GABBY
                        I sweat when I’m anxious! 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You sweat when you compulsively 
                        exercise when you’re anxious. 

           Gabby hops off a step.

                                 GABBY
                        Do you think they’ll fire him?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        They better. I don’t wanna see that 
                        pile of shit on campus again. Even 
                        if he’s just cutting our grass. 

           Indi pushes through the front doors of the administrative 
           building. Takes a deep breath, and bounds down the stairs. 

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

                                 GABBY
                        How’d it go?

           Side by side, the trio of girls makes their way across the 
           quad. They walk and talk. 

                                 INDI
                        Working at a women’s college, you’d 
                        think the administration would care 
                        about us ladies a little more.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What did they say?
                                 INDI
                        They said, “We’re bullshit. Blah 
                        blah bullshit. Bullshit this and 
                        bureaucracy that, bloop bleep!”

                                 GABBY
                        But what happens next?

                                 INDI
                        Nothing.

           Gabby and Samantha fall silent. They can’t tell if Indi is 
           pissed or relieved. They exchange a quick look behind her 
           back. Maybe she’s both? Samantha shrugs. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Can we eat? I’d slit your throat 
                        for a sandwich.

                                 GABBY
                        Mine or hers?

                                 INDI
                        I love you both equally, don’t make 
                        me choose.

           Gabby puts her arm around Indi’s shoulder.

                                 GABBY
                        But you love me a little more, 
                        because I bought the twenty-four 
                        pack of Bud Light for tonight.

                                 INDI
                        Oh hell yeah.
                             (sniffs Gabby)
                        No offense but you stink. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No offense but I told you so! 

                                 GABBY
                        That’s what I get for working on my 
                        fitness!

           Gabby playfully puts her armpit in Indi’s face and she gently 
           pushes her way. Gabby goes for Samantha next. 

           Indi looks up and notices a puffy OWL with deep black eyes 
           perched in a tree. Weird to see in the daytime.

           Samantha shrieks, ducking out of Gabby’s way as Indi laughs.
           EXT. QUAD - A LITTLE LATER

           Indi, Gabby, and Samantha are sprawled out on a blanket, 
           wearing bikini tops and enjoying a picnic. Indi lays into a 
           sub sandwich, shredded lettuce falls into her cleavage. 

           A few girls mill about the quad here and there. It’s summer, 
           so campus is pretty dead.  

           Samantha reads a text on her phone, brow furrowed. 

                                 INDI
                        Whatcha looking at?

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (distracted)
                        Just a text from Mark.

           Indi snatches the phone out of Samantha’s hands. She holds it 
           out of reach as she reads the text. Shows it to Gabby.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Give it back!

           As Indi tosses the phone back to Samantha --

                                 INDI
                        Your boyfriend is way too good 
                        looking to be this insecure. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (cradling her phone, 
                              missing the point)
                        He is super good looking. 

                                 GABBY
                        Is he still being a giant derp?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Do you blame him? I just told him.  

                                 INDI
                        Told him what?

           Samantha and Gabby share a knowing smile... 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mark’s flipping his lid because I’m 
                        not going home this summer. I 
                        decided to stay on campus with you 
                        and Gabby.

                                 INDI
                        Are you for real real?
                                 SAMANTHA
                        For really real.

           Indi dives across the blanket, planting a hug on Samantha.

                                 INDI
                        I love this bitch so much!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        And she loves you!

                                 INDI
                        And she’s the only one with a car! 

                                 GABBY
                        Now we can have the best summer 
                        ever. We can go wherever we want, 
                        just the three of us.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        This is gonna be The Lettuce Hearts 
                        Club summer of no boys allowed.

                                 GABBY
                        No boys need apply. 

           Indi sits up straight, puts her hand over her heart.

                                 INDI
                        Three hearts are better than one. 

           Gabby and Samantha follow Indi’s lead, hands over hearts, 
           their version of secret handshake.

                           GABBY
           And a lettuce heart is never 
           a lonely heart.
                                                        SAMANTHA
                                              And a lettuce heart is never 
                                              a lonely heart.

           As Indi smiles at her ride or dies, she notices BRIDGET 
           shuffling across the quad in the distance. 

           Noticeably, Bridget’s wearing PAJAMAS -- and she looks like 
           shit. Dark circles under her eyes, an inflamed breakout on 
           her chin, the corners of her mouth are dry and crusted. 

           Gabby flips over like a rotisserie chicken, allowing the sun 
           to hit her bare back. She sees Bridget and nudges Indi.

                                 GABBY
                        Am I nuts, or does Bridget look 
                        like she’s been mainlining heroin?
                                 INDI
                        Something is definitely going on... 
                        when we started our independent 
                        study in the spring, she was always 
                        riding me to do more research and 
                        shit. Now I’m the one who has to 
                        drag her lazy ass to the library.   

           Samantha turns around to take a look at Bridget.

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (an affront to God)
                        Is that loungewear?

                                 INDI
                        Just say pajamas. 

                                 GABBY
                             (nudges Indi again)
                        It’s kinda like when you wore 
                        nightgowns as dresses freshman 
                        year, only worse.

                                 INDI
                        Shut up.

           Indi watches Bridget, looking so sad wearing PJs in public, 
           in broad daylight. She calls out to her --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Bridget! Do you wanna come sit 
                        with us?

           Bridget looks over in a daze, as if she’s suddenly remembered 
           that there are other people in the world.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh, hi. Oh, no thank you.

           Bridget smiles weakly as she meanders past their blanket and 
           out of earshot...  

                                 GABBY
                        Trainspotting, am I right?

           INT. INDI’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The girls are cozied up in Indi’s dorm room. The room itself 
           is old, charming, quaint. Dark wooden floors and a bay window 
           overlooking the quad. But the decor is, uh, eclectic. 

           Orange and purple string lights, POSTERS for classic SLASHER 
           MOVIES, books stacked all over the floor.  
           An 80s ITALIAN HORROR MOVIE flickers on a TV, a gross-out 
           classic. Indi is laser-focused, a Bud Light in one hand a 
           Tastykake in the other. Gabby half-watches, Samantha cringes. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        This is too disgusting for human 
                        eyes.

           ON TV: A woman looks at a bleeding cut on her cheek. The cut 
           begins THROBBING, then BURSTS OPEN in an EXPLOSION OF PUSS. 

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        How are you eating right now?

                                 INDI
                             (mouth full)
                        The iron stomach of a horror whore.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Can we watch something a little 
                        more... palatable?

                                 INDI
                        Big word, bitch!

                                 GABBY
                        Ooh, how about the one with Ryan 
                        Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr.? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Cruel Intentions?

                                 INDI
                             (without missing a beat)
                        I Know What You Did Last Summer.

                                 GABBY
                        Jennifer Love Hewitt has 
                        breathtaking boobs.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        They’re too big for her body type.

                                 GABBY
                        Can we watch JLove instead?

                                 INDI
                        No way, y’all said I get to choose.

           ON TV: Eyes glowing, a demon-zombie hybrid tears open a 
           woman’s neck with a set of seriously 80s acrylic nails. 
                                 GABBY
                        I love movies where celebrities 
                        fall in love. Freddie Prinze Jr. 
                        and Sarah Michelle Gellar are a God 
                        tier couple, ordained by Aphrodite 
                        herself.

           The 80s demon-zombie foams at the mouth, an AQUAMARINE SLIME. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Ryan Phillippe is a girlfriend 
                        beater though.

                                 GABBY
                        No he’s not.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yes he is.

                                 GABBY
                        Shut up, really?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Google it. Read the internet, 
                        literally just read the internet.

                                 INDI
                        Oy! I’m actually trying to pay 
                        attention to the movie, mmkay. 

           Gabby and Samantha cut the chit chat. All three girls watch 
           the TV. As an ill-fated woman onscreen runs and screams --

                                 GABBY
                             (still can’t believe it)
                        Never meet your sex icons. 

           A LITTLE LATER

           Indi’s room is illuminated by the soft light of the TV as the 
           credits roll. Gabby is passed out on a puny air mattress on 
           the floor, softly snoring.

           Indi and Samantha are snuggled on Indi’s bed together. 

                                 INDI
                        Thanks for sleeping over. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Of course! How are you feeling 
                        though? You seem way too chill... 
                        be honest with me. 
                                 INDI
                        I feel dumb. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You shouldn’t.

                                 INDI
                        I thought that coming forward was 
                        the hard part. Like, hello, I did 
                        the right thing. I thought our 
                        school would swoop in and take it 
                        from there. I didn’t know the hard 
                        part was never over...
                             (shrugs)
                        And now I feel dumb.

           Samantha shakes her head, heated.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t believe the school won’t do 
                        more. They should protect you.

                                 INDI
                        Oh well, guess a girl’s gotta 
                        protect herself.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        “Oh well”? While I admire your 
                        laissez-faire attitude, what are 
                        you gonna do if you run into him?

                                 INDI
                        I don’t know, Sam! It’s not like I 
                        have a guidebook on how to handle 
                        this horseshit.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I know what I’m gonna do if I run 
                        into him --
                             (stifles a yawn)
                        Impale him in the Adam’s apple.

                                 INDI
                        So specific it’s scary. 

           Samantha struggles to keep her eyes open, fading fast, but 
           she chuckles to herself. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Just trying to make you proud, my 
                        little horror whore.  

           Indi strokes Samantha’s hair as she closes her eyes.
                                 INDI
                        Honestly, I don’t know what the 
                        fuck I’m gonna do... 
                             (long beat)
                        The one thing I do know is I can’t 
                        do it without you guys.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Three hearts are better than one...

                                 INDI
                        And a lettuce heart is never a 
                        lonely heart...
                             (looks down)
                        Sam?

           Samantha is sound asleep. Indi tucks the blanket around her, 
           then slowly sits up in bed, careful not to wake her.

           She mutes the TV and FaceTimes her sister, saved as THE CUTE 
           ONE in her contacts. Her phone rings for a couple beats 
           before DAKOTA (18, adorable in her Hooters uniform) answers. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Indiana!

           Indi adjusts the volume on her phone, lowering it.

                                 INDI
                             (hushed voice)
                        Hi, baby! I’m glad you’re awake.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        I just got off work. 

           Indi’s iPhone screen jostles up and down as Dakota walks 
           around, revealing random glimpses of the room they used to 
           share back in Florida.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        That old man who always comes in 
                        and only orders a Caesar salad 
                        tipped me fifty dollars tonight. 

                                 INDI
                        Did you have to show him a tit?

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Nuh-uh, you’re gross. 

                                 INDI
                        Did you show him the bigger one?
                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Just you wait, once I get my boob 
                        job they really will be perfect.

                                 INDI
                        Dakota, you’re perfect already.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Okay, miss motivational meme.
                             (shrugs)
                        I think boob jobs are empowering 
                        when you pay for it with your own 
                        money.

                                 INDI
                        I think Gloria Steinem said the 
                        same thing.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Don’t know her.

           Dakota props up her phone and starts removing her makeup. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)(CONT’D)
                        You should be saying, “Thank you, 
                        old man. Order more Caesar salads, 
                        old man.” Tips like that are paying 
                        for my flight to come visit!

                                 INDI
                        I can’t wait.
                             (somber beat)
                        I’m dying to see you.

           Dakota stops what she’s doing. The mood shifts.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Why don’t you just leave that piece 
                        of shit school and come home?

                                 INDI
                        Because I love this piece of shit 
                        school -- and I hate home.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        So do I...

                                 INDI
                        And that’s why we’re getting you so 
                        the fuck out of Florida one day.

           A loud BANG is heard on the phone, followed by --
                                 INDI AND DAKOTA’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Oww, goddamnit! Dakota! Help me 
                        make this fucking frozen pizza! 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Shit, I gotta go. 

                                 INDI
                        Is she drunk?

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Is autoerotic asphyxiation sexy?

                                 INDI
                             (laughing)
                        Dakota! 

                                 INDI AND DAKOTA’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Dakota! 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Text me tomorrow.
                             (air kiss)
                        Love you, bye!

                                 INDI
                        Love you more --

           Dakota hangs up, disappearing from Indi’s iPhone. 

           Indi sits in the dark and stares at the TV. The credits have 
           rolled, replaced by ambient wallpaper.  

           After a sullen beat, she nuzzles up beside Samantha, leaving 
           the TV on, bathing the room in soft blue light as she sleeps.

           EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

           Barefoot and in her pajamas, Indi wanders across the quad. 

           The campus is eerie. The campus is quiet. 

           Indi lies down on the grass in the middle of the quad and 
           starts making snow angels, minus the snow. Lawn angels. 

           POV INDI: She waves her hand across the sky and a glorious 
           SHOOTING STAR with a RAINBOW TAIL appears in its wake. You 
           won’t find that shooting star in any astronomy textbooks. 

           Indi is LUCID DREAMING. She smiles up at the sky, content 
           with her creation.

           Suddenly, a DARK, SHADOWY FIGURE appears over Indi. 
           Startled, she stands and looks around --

           But nobody’s there. She shakes off the heebie-jeebies and 
           carries on with her dream.

           EXT. EDGE OF CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Indi skips around the edge of campus, on the threshold of the 
           woods. Late night mist floats on the horizon. 

           Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a dark figure coming 
           right toward her... 

           Spooked, Indi starts to run away, only to be met with a 
           powerful flashlight FLOODING HER IN LIGHT. She panics and 
           tries to bolt, but the figure holding the flashlight --

           GRABS HER in his arms. Indi kicks and screams and -- 

           The dark figure lets her go, like he’s spooked by her. 

           Indi jerks away, falling to the ground. 

                                 DARK FIGURE
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean 
                        to frighten you! 
                             (then, slowly)
                        I’m not gonna hurt you. 

           As Indi gets up, half ready to run, the dark figure lowers 
           his flashlight. She gets her first good look at him...

           Homeboy is handsome. He is the man of your actual dreams. For 
           me, he is Hugh Jackman digitally de-aged à la The Irishman. 

           For you, dear reader, he is whatever dreamboat floats your 
           boat. Indi blushes like a babydoll.

                                 INDI
                        I thought you were turning this 
                        into a nightmare.

           The dark figure cracks a smile. He is very fucking hot.

                                 DARK FIGURE
                        Wouldn’t dream of it.
                             (extends a manly hand)
                        My name is Cal.

           Indi accepts Cal’s hand, her own delicate hand encased in his 
           firm handshake. Their hands start to GLOW, E.T. style.
                                 CAL
                        What are you doing out here alone 
                        at night, sweetheart? 

                                 INDI
                        Whatever I want.

                                 CAL
                        What’s your name?

                                 INDI
                        Indiana.

                                 CAL
                        Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

                                 INDI
                        Quit calling me sweetheart.

                                 CAL
                        Why?

                                 INDI
                        It’s offensive?

                                 CAL
                        I’m sorry, Indiana. You just look 
                        sweeter than stolen honey.

           Cal smiles again. If he’s winning Indi over, she’s not ready 
           to show it yet. She keeps walking. He tags along. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        You from around here?

                                 INDI
                        I go to school here.

                                 CAL
                        I live in there.

           Cal points at the darks woods surrounding campus. Indi puts 
           her hands on her hips, flirtatiously combative.

                                 INDI
                        You don’t live anywhere. You’re 
                        just a dream character.

                                 CAL
                        What’s a dream character?

                                 INDI
                        A character. In my dreams. And 
                        sometimes they’re sexy, like you.
                                 CAL
                        Thanks, but I’m real.

                                 INDI
                        If you say so, sexy.
                             (stops walking)
                        Check this out. 

           Indi stares down Cal, holding her ground, something to prove.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Go away.

                                 CAL
                        You go away.

                                 INDI
                        This is my dream. 

                                 CAL
                        How do you know it’s not my dream?

                                 INDI
                        I’ll show you.

           Indi raises her hand and smacks Cal upside the head.

                                 CAL
                        Ouch!

                                 INDI
                        Shit. My hand was supposed to go 
                        through your head. Like Casper.

           Indi stares at Cal, perplexed. Cal stares back. Indi breaks 
           first. She keeps walking, he follows.

                                 CAL
                        What are you doing right now?

                                 INDI
                        I’m lucid dreaming and you’re 
                        crashing the party.

           Cal grabs Indi by the arm and pulls her to a stop. 

                                 CAL
                        We can take this party elsewhere.

           Cal grips her arm, pulls her close. He looks into her eyes, 
           cups her face in his hands. He strokes his thumb across her 
           mouth. Indi opens her lips and he slides his thumb between 
           them. He traces her bottom lip with his thumb and...
           GOES IN FOR THE KISS --

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Nestled beside Samantha in bed, Indi begins smiling in her 
           sleep. Her eyes flutter beneath closed lids. 

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - BACK TO DREAM WORLD

           Indi and Cal are now passionately MAKING OUT, rolling around 
           in the grass like they’re on the beach in From Here to 
           Eternity. Cal slips a hand into Indi’s cotton shorts. 

           She lets out a perfect little moan. 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Indi shifts slightly in bed, in the throes of one very wet 
           dream. Samantha wakes up, readjusts beside her. 

           Gabby lets out an especially LOUD SNORE. Samantha puts the 
           pillow over her head in frustration.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - BACK TO DREAM WORLD

           Flush with anticipation, Indi lies in the grass beneath Cal. 

                                 CAL
                        Be mine forever.

                                 INDI
                        What?

           Cal pulls down her shorts, they’re about to start banging --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Cal does. Indi pulls up her shorts. She shimmies out from 
           under Cal. He looks confused.

                                 CAL
                        What’s wrong?

                                 INDI
                        I’m not trying to do -- this -- 
                        right now. 

                                 CAL
                        Not even in your wildest dreams?
                                 INDI
                        Not even.

           Cal stares at Indi, like he can’t believe his ears. Suddenly 
           self-conscious, she pulls her knees to her chest.

           Cal abruptly stands and walks away. Indi calls after him --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           But Cal doesn’t respond as he disappears through the trees.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Okay bye! 

           The sound of an ALARM begins to ECHO across campus, like it’s 
           coming from high in the sky. 

           Indi shields her ears and looks up --

           INT. INDI’S ROOM - MORNING

           Indi WAKES in bed. The alarm continues to sound, only now it 
           emanates from her phone. She reaches across Samantha, waking 
           her up as she silences the alarm. 

           Indi traces her bottom lip with her thumb...

           Samantha stretches, cranky. She throws her pillow at Gabby, 
           who’s still snoring. Gabby stirs on the air mattress, slowly 
           sits up, nice and relaxed. 

                                 GABBY
                        Good morning! 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You snore like a six hundred pound 
                        man on My 600-lb Life.

                                 GABBY
                        My what?

                                 INDI
                             (cracks her neck)
                        I need coffee. 

           EXT. QUAD DAY - DAY

           Harsh afternoon sunlight drenches campus. Eyes obscured by 
           three pairs of dark sunglasses, the girls cross the quad. 
                                 INDI
                        I had the weirdest goddamn dream 
                        last night...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Nobody likes hearing about other 
                        people’s dreams unless they’re sex 
                        dreams. 

                                 INDI
                        It kinda was?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Unless it’s a sex dream about the 
                        other person. Did you sex dream 
                        about me?

                                 INDI
                        You wish.

                                 GABBY
                        I slept like a baby.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Nobody asked you, stega-snoreus.

                                 GABBY
                        And nobody made you drink a billion 
                        Bud Lights. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        And nobody made you --

           Suddenly, an OWL SWOOPS PAST the girls, trapping a field 
           mouse in its talons. The girls SHRIEK and SCATTER.

                     SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
           Oh my god, eww!
                                                          GABBY
                                              Nope, nope, nope!

           The owl brings its catch into a nearby tree and begins to 
           tear the mouse apart. Indi watches the owl, watches it eat.

                                 INDI
                        I’ll catch you guys later. I need 
                        to meet Bridget in the library.

                                 GABBY
                        Adios.
                             (watching the owl)
                        Lo siento, Stuart Little.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Jeez, Gabs, don’t look at it!
           Samantha pulls Gabby in the opposite direction. 

           INT. LIBRARY - LATER

           Indi and Bridget sit with a stack of books at a reading table 
           in the library. Bridget looks like she smells, and Indi looks 
           like she’s pretending not to notice.  

                                 INDI
                        I just finished Norse Gods and 
                        Giants and added my thoughts to our 
                        notes. Did you finish D'Aulaires’ 
                        Book of Greek Myths yet?
                             (no response)
                        Bridget?

           Indi stares at Bridget -- Bridget picks at her cuticles. 

                                 BRIDGET
                             (eyes down)
                        I’m almost done.

                                 INDI
                        You go, girl. 

           Indi sorts through their stack of books.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Can you grab the book on Icelandic 
                        Sorcery? I can add that one to... 
                        my to do list, and you can keep 
                        going with the Greek Myths.  

           Bridget vaguely nods and zombie shuffles away, off to fetch 
           the book. Indi pantomimes shooting herself in the head.

           SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

           Bridget has not returned. Indi types on her computer, but she 
           stops when she hears a faint VOICE. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Bridget?

           Indi looks up and looks around, but there’s no one in sight.

           Silence.  

           She returns to her computer, only the sound of her fingers 
           tapping the keyboard until she hears the VOICE again, softly 
           muttering. She gets up to follow the sound... 
           INT. LIBRARY STACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Indi walks down a narrow row of books, following the strange 
           VOICE. She peeks around a corner -- the row is empty. 

           She moves onto the next row -- that one’s empty, too. 

           She walks all the way down to the last row, turns the corner, 
           and sees --

           Lying on the floor, TWISTED into an INHUMAN shape, eyes 
           tightly closed, BRIDGET MUTTERING in her sleep. 

           Straight up Exorcism of Emily Rose.

                                 INDI
                        Bridget?!

           Indi runs down the row of books to Bridget and gently shakes 
           her awake. Bridget SNAPS OUT OF IT.

           Bridget blinks up at Indi, then takes in her surroundings, 
           confused. She wipes drool from her mouth with the back of her 
           hand and slowly, painfully sits up.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Where am I?

                                 INDI
                        You’re still in the library.
                             (beat)
                        Were you asleep?

           Indi notices that Bridget’s cheek is BRUISED.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Shit, are you all right? 

           Bridget touches her cheek, then winces in pain. She shakily 
           stands, shrugging off Indi’s help.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’m not feeling well. Can you work 
                        without me today? 

                                 INDI
                        Sure... do you want me to walk you 
                        back to your dorm?

                                 BRIDGET
                        No!!
                             (softens)
                        No. That’s okay. I’m okay. It’s 
                        okay, sweetheart. You’re okay...
           Bridget quickly hurries down the aisle, around the corner and 
           out of sight. 

           Indi’s left reeling. Huh?!?!?!

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gabby and Indi are pre-gaming in Indi’s room with Malibu, 
           Diet Coke, and pizza. 

           Gabby eats pizza in Indi’s bed. She picks all the cheese off. 

           Indi does her makeup in the mirror. Her eyelashes are thick 
           with mascara. She glances over her shoulder at --

           Another HORROR MOVIE flickering on TV, this time a creature 
           feature about killer slugs. 

           ON TV: A “teen” couple in their mid-twenties notices their 
           bed is surrounded by slugs, mid-boning sesh. The naked girl 
           makes a run for it but immediately slips and falls in slugs.

           Indi LAUGHS at this unsavory combo of tits and slugs.

                                 GABBY
                        Why can’t we just listen to music 
                        while we get ready, like normal 
                        college girls?

                                 INDI
                        Because this is better.

           Finished with her makeup, Indi goes for the pizza. She plops 
           a gooey piece of cheese into her mouth.   

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Did you know there’s a special spot 
                        in hell for people who pick the 
                        cheese off their pizza?

                                 GABBY
                        I don’t think so, since actually 
                        dairy is the devil?

                                 INDI
                             (mouthful of cheese)
                        Thank you, Satan!

           Gabby goes to Indi’s bathroom. She pees with the door open, 
           talking to Indi from the toilet. 
                                 GABBY
                        How many people are gonna be at the 
                        bonfire?

           ON TV: The boyfriend feigns an attempt at rescuing his naked 
           girlfriend. Blood spurts, her eyeball hangs loose, she dies.

                                 INDI
                             (talking to the TV)
                        Hero move, bad boyfriend! 

                                 GABBY
                        Huh?

           Sound of the TOILET FLUSHING, then Gabby washing her hands.

                                 INDI
                        All of Jen’s friends -- so every 
                        townie between the ages of twenty 
                        and thirty, probably. 
                             (teasing)
                        Why, thinking bout boys?

           Gabby makes her way to Indi’s vanity and browses her makeup 
           collection, trying to act casual.

                                 GABBY
                        No, I’m not, and even if I was, I 
                        wouldn’t be, because no boys 
                        allowed.

                                 INDI
                        Such devotion to the cause.

                                 GABBY
                        Besides, those boys don’t like me 
                        as much as they like you.

                                 INDI
                        The townies only like me because 
                        they know I’m one of them. 

                                 GABBY
                        You mean white?

                                 INDI
                        I mean white trash.

           Gabby stares at her reflection in the mirror, twirling her 
           long dark hair. Indi joins her at the vanity. 
                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Trust me. Those boys are just 
                        intimidated by your gorgeous good 
                        looks and rocking swimmer’s body 
                        and big fat brain and because 
                        you’re basically a star on the flag 
                        of Texas. 

           Gabby finally cracks a smile. Indi smiles back, then checks 
           her phone.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Ah shit, it’s almost nine o’clock. 
                        Where’s Samantha?

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi and Gabby approach Samantha’s door. Indi KNOCKS. 

                                 INDI
                        Hello? Sam?
                             (knocks again)
                        Anybody alive in there?

                                 GABB
                        Maybe she’s not in her room.

           Indi tries the doorknob -- it’s unlocked. 

                                 GABBY
                        Okay, invasion of privacy, psycho. 
                             (hushed voice)
                        What if she’s masturbating or 
                        something?

                                 INDI
                        Like right this moment?
                             (Gabby shrugs)
                        Her vibrator is really loud, we 
                        would hear it. 

           Indi opens Samantha’s door...

           INT. SAMANTHA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They let themselves into Samantha’s room. It’s dark.

                                 INDI
                        Samantha?

           Indi hits the lights -- Samantha is passed out in bed. She 
           slowly fusses, lazily waking.
                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Awwww, Sam. Sleepy baby! Are you 
                        feeling okay?

           Samantha rubs her eyes, disoriented, and sits up in bed. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey, guys... I’m wrecked, I think 
                        it’s a slow-creeping hangover. 

                                 GABBY
                        Do you feel up for going out 
                        tonight? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Not really... would you hate my 
                        guts if I bailed?

                                 INDI
                        Nah, sleep it off. I’ll see you 
                        tomorrow for Salon Sunday. 
                             (flashes her nails)
                        Mani-pedi, baby.

           Samantha smiles, nods, yawns. Gabby and Indi make their way 
           to the door. As they go --

                                 GABBY
                        Feel better, lil lettuce.

                                 INDI
                        Lights on or off?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Off please.

           EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

           A breezy, moonlit summer night. A raucous bonfire blazes on a 
           campground in the Vermont woods.

           A dozen young people are gathered around the fire, drinking 
           and laughing. A mixture of guys and girls, these are the 
           TOWNIES, not fellow students. 

           Indi and Gabby emerge from the treeline. JEN (22, cute and 
           cheerful) jumps up to greet them. She gives Indi a big hug.

                                 JEN
                        Hi, ladies! 
                             (looks between them)
                        Where’s the rich one?
                                 INDI
                        Samantha? She’s not feeling well.

                                 JEN
                        Boooo! Primadonna! Cooler’s full of 
                        beers, help yourselves. You’re just 
                        in time, we’re about to play Drink, 
                        Drink, Shot. Come on over! 

           Jen smacks Indi on the butt and rejoins the group sitting 
           around the fire.

           As Gabby and Indi grab two cans of beer from the cooler, Indi 
           spots a boy in the shadows... 

           For a moment, HE LOOKS LIKE CAL, and her heart stops -- but 
           as the boy steps into the light of the fire, Indi sees he’s 
           just some random. She exhales.

           A LITTLE LATER 

           Everybody’s sitting around the fire playing DRINK, DRINK, 
           SHOT (Duck Duck Goose, but with drinking).

           A drunk GUY walks around the circle and touches the other 
           players on the head, saying --

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        Drink... drink... drink...
                             (taps Jen on the head)
                        Shot!

           Jen jumps up and chases the drunk guy -- she touches him 
           before he reaches his seat. 

           Drunkie takes a shot of bottom shelf bourbon straight from 
           the bottle. Now it’s Jen’s turn.

           Jen jogs in place, ramping up, when some GUYS approach the 
           fire.  Indi sees the guys through the flames -- among them is 
           DUSTIN (22, standard white guy, attractive but unremarkable). 
           Indi freezes. 

                                 INDI
                             (under her breath)
                        Shit.

                                 GABBY
                        What?
                             (notices Dustin)
                        Shit. Seriously, Jen? 

           Jen waves to the guys, still jogging in place.
                                 DUSTIN
                        Jen, we warming up for something?

                                 JEN
                        Drink, Drink, Shot! Pull up some 
                        chairs! 

           The guys sit on the opposite side of the fire from Gabby and 
           Indi, thank god. Jen walks around the circle.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        Drink... drink... drink...

           A LITTLE LATER

           The game is still going strong. Indi watches the glow from 
           the flames play across Dustin’s face... she gets tapped on 
           the head and drinks her beer. 

           The girl circling the fire eventually taps Dustin and says --

                                 TOWNIE GIRL
                        Shot!

           Dustin leaps from his chair -- he easily catches the girl and 
           she swigs from the bottle of bourbon. Now it’s his turn.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Drink... drink...

           Getting closer and closer to Indi...

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Drink... drink... drink...

           Until finally... he stands right behind her. Indi tenses up 
           as Dustin puts his hand on her shoulder and says --

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Shot.

           Indi takes a deep breath, then gets up to chase him -- but 
           she barely jogs, and he easily beats her back to his seat.

           Indi hears a couple of Dustin’s buddies laughing. She sips a 
           quick shot from the bottle of bourbon and returns to her seat 
           without a word. Dustin starts another turn.

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Drink... drink... drink...

           As Dustin walks around the fire again, Gabby reaches over and 
           holds Indi’s hand. 
           INT. DORM HALLWAY - LATER

           Gabby and Indi walk down their hall. Gabby stops in front of 
           her bedroom door but Indi takes her arm. 

                                 INDI
                        Can you sleep over again. Please?

           Gabby puts her arm around Indi’s shoulder and they walk down 
           the hall to Indi’s room together. 

           EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

           FULL ASS MOON. The HOOTING of an OWL. The campus is quiet and 
           still, crowded by the dark woods. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Samantha wanders down a dark school hallway. She follows the 
           muffled sound of DREAMY MUSIC...

           INT. GYM - MOMENT LATER 

           The campus gym is decked out like the high school dance in 
           Grease. Streamers, balloons, a disco ball. MOON RIVER wafts 
           through invisible speakers.  

           Samantha looks around in awe. Standing in the center of the 
           court, CAL slowly spins around to face her. 

                                 CAL
                        Back for more?

           Cal is dressed nicely, less casual than he was in Indi’s 
           dream. He’s even wearing glasses, but hot. 

           He extends a hand, which Samantha elegantly accepts. He spins 
           her into a slow dance. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh dream maker.

                                 CAL
                        You heart breaker.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I love this song. It’s so pretty 
                        and classic.

                                 CAL
                        Just like you.
           Cal LIFTS Samantha above his head, spins and sets her back 
           down, smooth as silk. Even better than Ryan Gosling and Emma 
           Stone doing Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

           Because you know Samantha is a Dirty Dancing girl.

           A spotlight hits them, wrapping Samantha in an artful beam of 
           light. She rests her head on Cal’s chest. 

           Cal holds Samantha close as they sway back and forth on the 
           dance floor. He whispers in her ear...

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Can I tell you a secret?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You can tell me anything. 

           The music SLOWS and WARPS, the lights shift from BLUE to RED.

                                 CAL
                        I’ve got a crush on you.

           Cal spins out Samantha, then pulls her back in close. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        You’re like no girl I’ve ever met.
                             (hypnotic)
                        Be mine forever.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m yours. Forever.

           The music returns to normal and the lights shift back to 
           BLUE. Cal twirls Samantha into a dip.

                                 CAL
                        Do you have a crush on me?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I definitely do.

           Cal lifts Samantha into a kiss. 

           EXT. GYM - DAY

           Beautiful weather. Birds are chirping their birdsongs. Indi 
           and Gabby are nursing their hangovers. 

                                 GABBY
                        I hope I don’t puke in the pool.

           Indi unlocks her bike from a rack beside the campus gym.
                                 INDI
                        Samantha’s meeting me in town, do 
                        Salon Sunday with us! Just pretend 
                        you’re sick. 

                                 GABBY
                             (swallows a burp)
                        Not sure I need to pretend.

           Gabby’s considering, until her cheery TEAMMATE bristles past 
           them on her way into the gym.  

                                 TEAMMATE
                        Hey, girl! See you inside?

           Gabby nods weakly. Indi laughs as she climbs on her bike.

                                 INDI
                        Welp, you snooze you lose!

           Indi waves and bikes away. Gabby slowly walks into the gym.

           INT. ROSIE’S NAILS - DAY

           Indi walks into a cute but crummy little nail salon in town 
           and smiles at the salon’s ancient owner ROSIE (adorable old 
           lady, blue eyeshadow, pink lips). Rosie rises to greet Indi.

                                 ROSIE
                        How’s my little muffin?

                                 INDI
                        She’s ready for some fucking Salon 
                        Sunday, Rosie! 

                                 ROSIE
                             (chuckles)
                        Your language, muffin. You swear 
                        like a sailor! 

                                 INDI
                        Must be my love of the ocean.

           Indi follows Rosie as she shuffles to the back of the salon, 
           showing her to two empty massage chairs. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        My friend should be here any 
                        minute. Mind if I wait for her?

                                 ROSIE
                        You got it, muffin. I’ll save the 
                        seat next to yours.
           Rosie winks as Indi climbs into her massage chair. She turns 
           that shit on and settles in.

           INT. ROSIE’S NAILS - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           Indi gently vibrates in the massage chair, head resting on 
           her fist. Still no Samantha. 

           The salon’s busier now, teeming with activity. There’s a few 
           ladies waiting for their appointments upfront. 

           One of the manicurists approaches Indi’s chair --

                                 MANICURIST
                        Mind if I get going on your toes, 
                        sweetie pie?

                                 INDI
                        Oh. Sure. 

           The manicurist begins to fill the basin with hot water. Indi 
           pulls out her phone. She fires off a text to Samantha --

                                 INDI (TEXT) (CONT’D)
                        Yer late for Salon Sunday! U OK?

           No three dots, no responding. Waits a beat.

                                 INDI (TEXT) (CONT’D)
                        Helloooooooo? Salon? Sunday? SOUND 
                        FAMILIAR? BITCH? U OKAY BITCH?

           Rosie shuffles over to Indi apologetically.

                                 ROSIE
                        Sorry, muffin. Need the chair.

           Indi scowls as an unfashionable random parks her big ass in 
           Samantha’s spot. Indi waits a beat, then CALLS Samantha.

           It rings, rings, ringing, rings, goes to voicemail.

                                 INDI
                             (leaving a message)
                        Oy! Where are you? I know you 
                        didn’t forget what time our 
                        appointment is, because it’s the 
                        same time every week. Jeez! I’m 
                        gonna bite your nipple off when I 
                        see you later.
                             (beat)
                        Hope everything’s okay! Hate you, 
                        love you, bye!
           Indi hangs up. The random in the chair beside Indi stares at 
           her, alarmed. Indi makes a face at her -- and what?

           INT. SAMANTHA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Samantha steps into her room holding a giant paper bag. She 
           feels her phone buzz in her pocket -- VOICEMAIL FROM INDI. 

           Samantha stares at her phone, then turns it off, guilty. She 
           unloads a package wrapped in plastic, opens it and unfolds --

           BLACKOUT CURTAINS. Samantha puts them right over her regular 
           curtains, crudely hanging them with a hammer and thumb tacks.

           Next, she takes a WHITE NOISE MACHINE out of the bag. She 
           sets it up, turns it on, kicks off her shoes, gets into bed. 

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - LATER

           Indi knocks on Samantha’s door. No answer. She tries the 
           doorknob -- it’s locked. She presses her ear to the door...

           Hears, ever so faintly, the sound of... rain? What da fuck?

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi’s snuggled up in bed, half-asleep. A black and white 
           HORROR MOVIE plays on her TV with the volume low.  

           Suddenly, a big brown COCKROACH skitters across her arm. She 
           stirs in bed, but doesn’t wake up. After a beat, another bug 
           rustles across her bare stomach. 

           A roach crawls around her neck and up her chin, resting on 
           her cheek. Indi brushes the bug off her face, still asleep.  

           On the TV, a giant monster towers over fleeing townspeople, 
           their screams tiny and quiet. Indi shifts in bed. 

           All of a sudden, a DOZEN BUGS crawl up Indi’s legs, her hips, 
           her chest. She slowly wakes up and YELPS, swatting the bugs 
           away as fast as she can -- but they just keep coming. 

           The bugs are EVERYWHERE, twitching, hissing, creeping all 
           over Indi, sticking to her fingers and palms and wrists as 
           she tries to brush them off. 

           A fat roach crawls right into Indi’s OPEN MOUTH. She bites 
           down, crunching on bug, its creamy yellow mush squeezing 
           between her lips as she tries to spit it out.  
           In a blind panic Indi jumps out of bed and flings herself at 
           her light switch, but as the lights goes on --

           She’s back in bed, lights off. The bugs are GONE. Trembling, 
           Indi looks down at her legs and stomach -- no bugs. 

           She rips the blanket off her bed -- no bugs. 

           Indi quickly turns on every light in her room. She scrambles 
           to her mini fridge and pulls out a giant bottle of Diet Coke. 

           Cautious, Indi perches on the edge of her bed. She turns up 
           the volume on her TV and begins chugging soda. After several 
           gulps, she puts the bottle in her lap and stares at the TV. 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - MORNING

           Indi is still on the edge of her bed. The bottle of soda 
           rests in her lap, empty. She’s watching Vanderpump Rules and 
           looks exhausted. 

           Her phone ALARM goes off and she jumps. She shakily grabs her 
           phone and silences it. 

           INT. CAMPUS BOOKSTORE - MORNING

           Indi pulls a 2 liter bottle of Diet Coke from a shelf in the 
           little grocery section of the bookstore.

           She notices Samantha browsing the medicine aisle nearby. 

                                 INDI
                        Samantha. 

           Samantha looks up at the sound of her name. She sees Indi and 
           sets down a box of pills.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hi. Good morning.

                                 INDI
                        Are you sick?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hmm? Oh, no. Just looking for 
                        Midol. My uterus is screaming.

           Indi takes a box of Midol from the shelf and hands it over. 

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.
           They walk across the store to the cashier together. 

                                 INDI
                        Is that why you missed Salon Sunday 
                        yesterday? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hmm? Oh, no, you know what? I am so 
                        sorry. You know Laura? From campus 
                        outreach? Since I’m not going home 
                        for the summer, she asked if I’d 
                        help her with this like, community 
                        kids’ camp a couple towns over? We 
                        left first thing in the morning, 
                        guess the day got away from me.

                                 INDI
                        I tried texting and calling you...

           The CASHIER rings up Samantha’s Midol. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry, I spaced. 
                             (changing the subject)
                        Here, let me get that for you.

           Samantha puts the Diet Coke on the counter. Indi nonchalantly 
           adds a couple of candy bars. As Samantha pays the cashier --

                                 INDI
                        You don’t even like kids. 

           EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi and Samantha exit the bookstore. The sun outside is 
           bright and oppressive. 

                                 INDI
                        So are you like, super committed?

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (caught off guard)
                        What do you mean, committed to who?

                                 INDI
                        The kids’ camp. I thought you were 
                        staying on campus so we could have 
                        free time to spend time together. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh, I mean, I am. And we will! 
                        Plenty of time, I promise.  
                                 INDI
                        Okay. What are you up to now? Wanna 
                        grab breakfast?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t right now? But I’ll see you 
                        later! Because it’s...

           Samantha begins to cross the quad. She calls back --

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Dollar Draft Beer Night!

                                 INDI
                        Dollar Draft Beer Night...

           Indi watches Samantha walk across the quad in the direction 
           of the woods. Where is she going?

           INT. INDI’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi’s version of dolled up -- skimpy sundress, sandals, dark 
           lipstick, heavy eyeshadow, flat ironed hair.  She touches up 
           her hair in the mirror, then finishes a bottle of Diet Coke. 

           She’s about to hit the lights on her way out the door, then 
           stops to think. She leaves the lights on. 

           EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

           Indi, Gabby, and Samantha ride their bikes through the town 
           near campus, a small farming community surrounded by dense 
           Vermont woods. It’s the kind of town with one stoplight. 

           They ride their bikes up to a divey pizza joint, not 
           bothering to lock them up before they head inside. 

           INT. A LITTLE BITE OF ITALY - CONTINUOUS

           A Little Bite of Italy is the only pizza place in town, and 
           the pizza’s not that good. But it’s a busy night and the bar 
           is teeming with locals. The crowd is almost entirely male. 

           Every guy in the joint turns to look as Indi, Gabby, and 
           Samantha settle into a booth. 

                                 INDI
                        First round’s on me, ladies.

           Indi smiles at her friends and walks to the end of the bar, 
           trying to avoid the crowd. 
           At the other end of the bar, DUSTIN notices Indi. He crosses 
           the bar and sidles up beside her.  

                                 DUSTIN
                        Look what the cat dragged in. 

           Indi ignores him. He looks her up and down as he takes a swig 
           of his beer. 

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Can I buy you a drink?

                                 INDI
                        No thanks, I know better than to 
                        booze it up around you. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Always with the smart mouth...
                             (checks out her ass)
                        Smart ass.

           Indi finally gets the bartender’s attention. 

                                 INDI
                        Pitcher please, three glasses.

           Dustin sips his beer, nods toward Gabby and Samantha. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        You sure spic and span over there 
                        won’t let me buy them a drink?

           Indi clenches her jaw as the bartender brings over her 
           pitcher of beer. She slaps down a five dollar bill. 

                                 INDI
                        Thanks.

           Indi quickly walks back to the booth -- Dustin watches her 
           body beneath her scant cotton dress as she goes. 

           BACK IN THE BOOTH

           Rattled, Indi unstacks three glasses and begins pouring beer. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Dustin’s here.

                                 GABBY
                        Are you kidding? 
                             (craning her neck)
                        Why does he keep showing up where 
                        he knows you hang out?
                                 INDI
                        I don’t know, to play nice? It’s 
                        like he thinks we’re still friends.

           Indi glances over at Samantha -- she’s not even paying 
           attention. So much for impaling Dustin in the Adam’s apple.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                             (raises her pint)
                        Cheers to The Lettuce Hearts Club.

           Samantha snaps out of it. She and Gabby raise their pints.

                                 GABBY
                        Cheers.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Cheers. 

                                 INDI
                        Here’s to us and not to them. 

           The girls clink glasses and drink their beers. Samantha eyes 
           Indi as she sips her pint. After a measured beat --

                                 SAMANTHA
                        If there’s no boys allowed, then 
                        why did we still come out tonight? 

                                 INDI
                        Because we come here every Monday 
                        night. It’s Dollar Draft Beer --

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Beer Night, we know. I just think 
                        it’s funny that we used to come 
                        here so you could get shitfaced and 
                        flirt with losers, but now it’s no 
                        boys allowed. 

           Indi sets down her beer. She looks to Gabby for support, but 
           Gabby averts her eyes, silently sipping. 

                                 INDI
                        What the fuck is your problem? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry, you’re the only one who 
                        can ever be in a bad mood?

                                 INDI
                        No, but --
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Indi’s having a hard time so we 
                        have to do whatever she wants? 
                             (meanly mimicking)
                        “The Lettuce Hearts Club, no boys 
                        allowed.” Give it a rest, we’re not 
                        all as hopeless as you. 

           Indi goes beet red, her cheeks hot and flushed. She looks to 
           Gabby, desperate for back-up.

                                 INDI
                        Gabs...

                                 GABBY
                        I mean, she is kinda right.

                                 INDI
                        About which part?!

                                 GABBY
                        Like, I always gotta be your wing 
                        woman and your babysitter -- but I 
                        can’t have fun if you’re not?

                                 INDI
                        Where is this coming from? 
                             (to Samantha)
                        Did Mark say something to you?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Who?

                                 INDI
                        Mark. Your boyfriend?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mark is... he’s not my boyfriend 
                        anymore.

                                 INDI
                        Wait. Y’all broke up?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Look, I know we made this no boys 
                        allowed agreement for the summer, 
                        but... I met someone new.

                                 GABBY
                        What?

                                 INDI
                        What! 
                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s really early, and I didn’t 
                        even wanna tell you... except I 
                        really like him.

                                 INDI
                        How? When? Where!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I thought you guys would be happy. 
                        You hated Mark. 

                                 INDI
                        I mean, sure, but that doesn’t mean 
                        we want you to dump him and rebound 
                        at the speed of light! 
                             (flummoxed)
                        Gabriela, anything to add?

           Gabby remains silent. Samantha stands to go, sorry not sorry. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You can finish your summer of no 
                        boys allowed without me.

           Indi’s jaw drops as Samantha saunters out the door. A few men 
           turn to watch her leave -- Indi sets her sights on Gabby.

                                 INDI
                        Thanks for nothing, asshole.

           Gabby stares back at her, unfazed. Suddenly, Indi hears the 
           sound of a MAN LAUGHING. She wheels around --

           But no one appears to be laughing. She turns back to Gabby.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear that?

           Gabby just stares at her blankly. After a beat, Indi hears it 
           again, the same joyless LAUGHTER. She stands to turn around. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        What’s so fucking funny?

           Several men stop their conversations to stare at her. Indi 
           looks to Gabby -- the same blank look is on her face. 

           Indi hears MORE LAUGHTER. She frantically whips back and 
           forth, trying to find the culprit. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Did I tell an amaaaazing joke? Ha 
                        ha? Then what is so funny?!
           Men have stopped to stare. The only sound is a game on TV. 

           Indi makes pleading eye contact with Gabby -- but there’s 
           nothing behind her eyes, just the same blank expression, no 
           sympathy or solidarity to be found.

           Tears gather in the corner of Indi’s eyes. She notices Dustin 
           across the room, smirking with a buddy. 

           Indi turns back to Gabby, and ice blossoms in her veins. 

           Gabby is smiling. 

           Indi snatches her purse and rushes out the door. Waiting a 
           beat longer than she should, Gabby gets up to follow her.

           Once the girls are gone, the men in the bar resume their 
           chatter, business as usual. Bitches be crazy.

           INT. SAMANTHA'S ROOM - LATER

           Samantha slams her door in frustration. She kicks off her 
           shoes and plops onto her bed. 

           After a beat, she picks up a little box on her desk. She 
           opens the box and pulls out a bottle of SLEEPING PILLS. 

           Samantha considers the bottle of pills for a beat. She twists 
           the cap and shakes one, two, three into her hand. 

           Without hesitation, she swallows the pills. 

           Samantha turns on her trusty white noise machine and climbs 
           into bed, fully clothed, with a smile. We drift out into...

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Indi trudges down the hall to her room, slams the door. 

           Several beats later, Gabby moseys on down the hall to her own 
           room, across from Indi’s. She pauses in her doorway --

                                 GABBY
                        Sleep tight.

           And closes the door behind her.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - NIGHT

           Back in dreamland and the stars are bright! Smiling serenely, 
           Gabby descends the bleachers beside the soccer field. 
           She glides down the aluminum steps, as self-assured and 
           graceful as a freshly crowned prom queen. 

           An eerie assortment of MASCOTS line the field -- a wolf, a 
           tiger, a bear, a crocodile. All animals that could eat you.

           The mascots do the spooky scary skeletons dance, and it’s 
           more unsettling than any teen on TikTok. 

           The dancing mascots part ways to reveal CAL standing in the 
           center of the field -- the prom king to Gabby’s queen.  

           He looks buffer than we’ve seen him, or maybe this is just 
           the first time his beefy man muscles are ON FULL DISPLAY. 

           Gabby runs across the field and jumps into Cal’s arm, 
           wrapping her legs around him à la a bitch on The Bachelor. 

           They MAKE OUT HARDCORE. 

           After several beats of this erotica, Gabby comes up for air 
           and Cal begins to bench press a bitch, easily lifting her 
           above his head. Gabby erupts in a squeal of giggles -- 

                                 GABBY
                        Ahhh, put me down, you’re gonna 
                        drop me! 

                                 CAL
                        If I dropped you, I’d catch you.

           And with that, Cal drops Gabby, then catches her, cradling 
           her, gently setting her down on the grass. She gazes up into 
           his eyes, worshipful.

                                 GABBY
                        You were right. It felt good to 
                        tell her what I think for once.

                                 CAL
                        Somebody had to. 

                                 GABBY
                        Indi’s not smart enough to notice 
                        how I really feel. She’s only got a 
                        couple brain cells to rub together. 

                                 CAL
                        She’s gonna be --

           Cal points his thumb and finger at Gabby’s face like a gun. 
           He winks, and shoots.
                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Dead from two in the head.

                                 GABBY
                        Two brain cells. 

           Cal and Gabby break out in laughter -- Cal’s laugh sounds 
           mean-spirited and familiar. As he stops laughing, he smiles.

                                 CAL
                        I can see right through you like a 
                        shard of glass, Gabby. 

                                 GABBY
                        That sounds like a bad thing...

                                 CAL
                        It’s not, because it means I’m the 
                        only one who can see who you really 
                        are inside. Your friends don’t see 
                        you. I’m the only one who does. The 
                        only one who can.

           Gabby kisses Cal hard on the mouth, and he shoves her down on 
           the grass. Climbs on top of her, lovingly caresses her face.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        You’re like no girl I’ve ever met.
                             (hypnotic)
                        Be mine forever.

                                 GABBY
                        I’m yours.

                                 CAL
                        And I have a crush on you.

           Cal kisses her softly, cradling her head in his hands.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        No more girls’ night out, okay?

                                 GABBY
                        Okay.

                                 CAL
                        Let me see that smile.

           Gabby smiles, sweet but sinister. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        That’s my girl. 

           Cal gets up off the ground. He extends a hand to Gabby.
                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           Gabby takes Cal’s hand and he helps her up. He brushes the 
           grass off her back like a doting boyfriend. 

           Holding hands, Cal leads Gabby toward the dark woods...

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi is curled up in bed, crying. She hasn’t bothered to 
           remove her makeup and mascara runs down her cheeks in black 
           streaks. She sniffles softly. 

           Another episode of Vanderpump Rules plays on her TV. Scheana 
           is whipping Ariana into a frenzy. 

                                 ARIANA (ON TV)
                        Snob ass bitch!

           Indi wipes a mascara tear from her eye. She touches her wet 
           cheek, then looks down at her hand, disconcerted -- 

           Her fingers are WET WITH BLOOD. 

           Indi jumps up from bed and runs to her mirror.

           She gasps --

           She’s crying INKY RED TEARS OF BLOOD. 

           Frantic, Indi runs to her bathroom and grabs a handful of 
           toilet paper, trying to stanch the bleeding from her eyes. 

           The toilet paper quickly soaks with blood. Indi begins crying 
           harder when suddenly --

           She hears that same cruel, uncaring LAUGHTER. 

           IT’S COMING FROM RIGHT BEHIND HER.

           Indi spins around to face her tormentor, but nobody’s there. 

           The laughter has stopped. And she’s alone. 

           She looks back to her reflection in the mirror and now the 
           blood is gone, too. She cries plain, watery tears. 

           Indi tries to take a deep, calming breath -- but she soon 
           starts GAGGING. Blood pools in the corners of her mouth. 

           She claws at her throat, GASPING for air. Her lips are now 
           slick with blood.
           Then, fingertips first, a man’s HAND EMERGES from inside her 
           mouth. Her teeth begin to WIGGLE LOOSE, COATED IN BLOOD. 

           The THUMB traces Indi’s lips. The fingertips push across her 
           tongue and slowly begin PULLING TEETH, dropping them out of 
           her mouth like pebbles.  

           The hand keeps pushing out of her mouth, past her bloody 
           lips, stifling her screams, making room for ANOTHER HAND as 
           the rest of her TEETH FALL OUT. 

           Indi’s shoulders heave as the hands become ARMS, forcing 
           their way out of her mouth, reaching in opposite directions, 
           between her mangled gums, blood gushing as --

           LAUGHTER ERUPTS ALL AROUND HER. Countless male voices 
           laughing at her expense. HIDEOUS, MOCKING LAUGHTER.

           Indi’s mouth stretches wider and wider, impossibly wide, as 
           the arms keep REACHING OUT from deep inside her throat. 

           The corners of her mouth begin to split open, bloody, flesh 
           ripping, and --

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - DAWN

           Indi wakes up standing in front of her mirror, crying, 
           choking. She touches her lips, her teeth -- no blood. 

           She looks around, shell-shocked. Was she sleepwalking? 

           Outside her window, it’s still dark, but with the earliest 
           hints of dawn. 

           Indi runs to her mini fridge, yanks the door open. She cracks 
           open a can of Red Bull and quickly downs it. She crunches the 
           can and immediately reaches for another one, chugging it. 

           Hands shaking, Indi turns the volume on TV all the way up. 

           She sits on the floor -- no way she’s getting too comfortable 
           -- and waits for the sun to rise. 

           OUTSIDE HER WINDOW, the sun rises in fast forward, high in 
           the sky, moving from east to west. 

           The day comes and goes. Indi’s eyes remain glued to the TV. 

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           It’s dark outside now. Indi YAWNS as one candy-colored 
           episode of Adventure Time ends and the next one begins.
           Indi’s head lolls to one side, but she snaps awake. Tries 
           turning up the volume -- it’s already as high as it will go. 

                                 CAL (O.S.)
                        Aren’t cartoons for children?

           Indi nearly JUMPS out of her skin. CAL IS IN HER ROOM.

           SHE’S DREAMING AND SHE DIDN’T KNOW IT.  

                                 INDI
                        Fuck, dude! You scared me.

                                 CAL
                        It hasn’t been easy, you don’t 
                        scare easily.

                                 INDI
                        It... it’s been you the whole time?

           Cal sits beside Indi on her bed. She instinctively springs 
           up, moving away from him.  

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        You get off on scaring girls?

                                 CAL
                        Only the ones I don’t like.

           Indi closes her eyes tightly, balls up her fists.

                                 INDI
                        This is only a dream, this is only 
                        a dream, this is only a shit suck 
                        dream and you know you’re dreaming. 

           Indi opens her eyes -- Cal is still there. 

                                 CAL
                        I would’ve been nice to you, if 
                        only you’d let me. 

                                 INDI
                        Who cares?! Just leave me alone!

           Cal looks Indi up and down, lasciviously sizing her up.

                                 CAL
                        Your hair is too long. It makes you 
                        look lowbred. I don’t like it.  

                                 INDI
                        I’m not about to take beauty tips 
                        from a butt-hurt jerk in my dreams. 
                                 CAL
                        Cut your hair.

                                 INDI
                        Suck a D. 

                                 CAL
                        I said, cut your hair. 

           Without even realizing it, Indi’s now standing in front of 
           her mirror, the scissors from her desk in hand.  

           She slowly raises the scissors to her long, beautiful hair...

           AND CUTS OFF A HUGE CHUNK. 

           Cal laughs hysterically as Indi starts hacking at her hair 
           with the scissors, as if in a trance. When she finally stops 
           cutting, her hair is a CHOPPED UP MESS. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Much better.
                             (leans back in bed)
                        Now cut off your finger. 

           Without hesitation, Indi puts her pointer finger between the 
           blades of the scissors. Starts to squeeze the handles.

           A loud cartoon EXPLOSION goes off on TV -- 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Indi WAKES UP in front of her mirror. She looks down at her 
           BLEEDING FINGER and immediately DROPS THE SCISSORS. 

           That’s when she notices her appearance in the mirror --

           She’s given herself a BUSTED, BOTCHED HAIRCUT. NOT HER HAIR! 

                                 INDI
                        What the fucking fuck!!!

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi has stuffed her mangled hair into a baseball hat. She 
           walks across the hall to Gabby’s room and KNOCKS on the door.

           She keeps KNOCKING, LOUDLY, until the door swings open --

                                 GABBY
                        What do you want?!
                                 INDI
                        Hi, I’m -- I’m sorry to bug you, so 
                        late, but... can you sleep over?

                                 GABBY
                        I can’t. I have plans. 

                                 INDI
                        Tonight? With who?

                                 GABBY
                        A boy.

                                 INDI
                        What! The hell! Is going on?!

                                 GABBY
                        Why, are you surprised I met a guy 
                        who actually likes me?

                                 INDI
                        Kind of!

           Gabby tries to shut the door in Indi’s face --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Wait! I didn’t mean it like that. 

           Indi holds the door open -- Gabby’s losing patience.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        I just meant like... you and 
                        Samantha both meet mystery guys? 
                        All of a sudden and out of nowhere? 
                        Like literally where? Don’t you 
                        think it’s a little weird...

                                 GABBY
                        I think it’s weird how much you 
                        hate boys. 

                                 INDI
                        I don’t... hate boys. That much.

                                 GABBY
                        And I don’t care anymore.

           Gabby pushes aside Indi’s hand and closes the door.

           INT./EXT. CAMPUS - MONTAGE

           -Indi trudges across the quad, looking worse for the wear, 
           rocking a brand new bob haircut.  
           -Indi and Bridget work at a table in the library. Indi closes 
           her eyes, nods off... SNAPS AWAKE. She wipes some drool from 
           her mouth, looks over at... Bridget, SLEEPING, head resting 
           on the table. Indi rolls her eyes and keeps working.

           -Indi unloads an assortment of ENERGY DRINKS on the checkout 
           counter in the bookstore. As the cashier rings her up, Indi 
           bites her nail, twitchy. The cashier openly stares. 

           -Indi watches TV in her room, energy drink in her lap. Her 
           eyes start to flutter closed... an ALARM on her phone GOES 
           OFF. She jumps, spilling the energy drink all over her bed. 

           END MONTAGE. 

           EXT. QUAD - MORNING

           Indi drags her zombified ass across the quad, Morning of the 
           Living Dead. She spots a girl up ahead, LAURA (21, pretty and 
           polished). Indi calls out to her --

                                 INDI
                        Hey, Laura! Wait up!

           Laura stops and turns around. She grimaces at Indi’s tragic 
           appearance, practically pinches her nose shut.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey... Indi.

                                 INDI
                        Hey! Next time you see Samantha, 
                        can you tell that dumb bitch I 
                        really need to talk to her?

                                 LAURA
                        Why would I see Samantha?

                                 INDI
                        She told me you two philanthropists 
                        are doing some campus outreach dumb 
                        shit whatever.

                                 LAURA
                        Okay first of all, rude. Second of 
                        all, I’m continuing my charity work 
                        but not with Samantha. Didn’t she 
                        go back to San Fran for the summer?

                                 INDI
                        No she -- she decided to stay on 
                        campus. She’s here. She’s doing 
                        poor kids’ camp. With you!
           Indi points wildly, looks like she’s out of her goddamn mind.

                                 LAURA
                             (slowly backing away)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, sweetheart.

                                 INDI
                        Camp! For the kids! KIDS’ CAMP!
                             (beat)
                        Don’t call me sweetheart! 

           Laura quickly walks away. Indi shouts at her --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        It’s offensive! 
                             (then, mumbles to herself)
                        Quit calling me sweetheart. It’s 
                        offensive...

           We basically see the light bulb go off in Indi’s head. Ding! 

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi walks down an empty hallway, stopping to read the girl’s 
           name on each door she passes. 

           Finally, she reaches a door at the end of the hall. A cute 
           little sign says: BRIDGET. She timidly knocks on the door. 

                                 INDI
                        Hello? Bridget?

           She knocks again, a little harder this time. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Bridget, it’s Indi. 

           Silence. Indi looks up and down the hall. Nobody’s around to 
           see her. She turns the doorknob... the door is unlocked...

           INT. BRIDGET’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi slips into Bridget’s dark and quiet room. She can’t see 
           much, but she can sure smell it -- 

           The room STINKS, a rancid stench.  She immediately puts her 
           hand over her nose and mouth. 

           Indi fumbles in the dark for a light switch on the wall, and 
           when she finally flips the switch, she stops in shock. 
           Bridget’s room is a WRECK. 

           Clothes spill from open drawers, a trash can is on its side, 
           the walls are scuffed with strange, dirty marks. 

           Bridget is passed out in bed, a tangled nest of pillows and 
           blankets. Indi tiptoes toward her, around the mess...

                                 INDI
                        Bridget?

           Bridget looks squalid. Her hair is greasy and matted, her 
           lips dry and cracked. Dark and hollow circles under closed 
           eyes. And she’s even thinner than the last time Indi saw her.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Bridget, uh -- are you awake?

           But Bridget is fast asleep, her breathing deep and steady.

           Indi looks over her shoulder at the door, considers leaving, 
           but then steels herself, claps loudly --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Bridget! Wake up, girl!

           Bridget AWAKES with a PAINED GASP, sucking in air as she 
           shoots up like the Bride of Frankenstein, scaring Indi -- 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Shit, fuck, dick, lick!

           Bridget’s voice is hoarse, she struggles to speak...

                                 BRIDGET
                        Indi? How are, why are, you here?
                             (looks around)
                        Oh no...

           Bridget starts sobbing, a keening moan. Indi panics -- 

                                 INDI
                        What’s wrong?!

                                 BRIDGET
                        He’s gonna --
                             (sob)
                        Be so --
                             (sob)
                        Maaaaaaad! 

                                 INDI
                        Who’s gonna be so mad?
                                 BRIDGET
                             (wailing)
                        My boyyyyyyyfriiiiiieeeeend!

                                 INDI
                        Who is your boyfriend? Does he --
                             (MORE SOBS)
                        Are you guys long distance?

                                 BRIDGET
                        He lives in there...

           Bridget weakly lifts a finger and points out her window. 

                                 INDI
                        The Humanities building?

                                 BRIDGET
                             (whispers)
                        ...the woods.

           A look of recognition flickers across Indi’s face. The woods?

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        I have to fall back asleep!

           Bridget retreats under a pile of sheets and blankets. After a 
           beat, Indi carefully sits on the bed. 

                                 INDI
                        Bridget... no guy is worth this 
                        typa stress. 

           Bridget slowly peeks her head out from under the covers. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        He’s so controlling. He says he 
                        misses me when I’m awake.

                                 INDI
                        When you’re away?

                                 BRIDGET
                        Awake...

           Bridget turns over on her side, facing away from Indi.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        I know he sees other girls, but I 
                        just love him too much to care...
                             (beat)
                        He’s my crush.
                                 INDI
                        Bridget, that’s bullshit. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’m so tired...

                                 INDI
                        You should be.
                             (beat)
                        Fuck this dude.

           Bridget is silent. Indi sits, waiting, ready to listen. But 
           after a beat, Indi hears Bridget SNORING -- she fell asleep. 

           Indi chews her lip, unsure of what to do. Eventually, she 
           sighs heavily and stands to go.

           Indi weaves around the mess on the floor, picking her way 
           toward the door, hitting the lights on her way out. 

           EXT. QUAD - DUSK

           The sun is setting and shadows abound. As Indi stalks across 
           the quad, she hears an OWL HOOTING. She looks up at -- 

           That same pesky owl stares at her from its perch in a tree.

                                 INDI
                        Quit eyeballing me, bitch. 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi slams her door. She marches her ass to the bay window 
           and pulls out her phone in a tizzy. She FaceTimes THE CUTE 
           ONE, her sister Dakota. 

                                 INDI
                        Pick up, you little brat. Pick up!

           Dakota finally appears on Indi’s phone screen. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hi, seester.

                                 INDI
                        Dakota! Oh my god, thank god.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Did you cut your hair?!

                                 INDI
                        Oh. Yeah... you don’t like it?
                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        It’s short.

                                 INDI
                        I KNOW! 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        You okay?
                             (beat)
                        You’re lookin’ a little keyed up.

                                 INDI
                        I’ve been having trouble sleeping.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        You should smoke weed before bed. 

                                 INDI
                        I really wish you could visit 
                        sooner. I need a friend.
                             (tears up)
                        I need my sister.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Indiana...
                             (concerned beat)
                        What about your friends?

                                 INDI
                        What about them?! I don’t have 
                        them! 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        If they’re actin’ shady you gotta 
                        talk some sense into those bitches. 
                             (takes a hit)
                        Sisters before misters.

                                 INDI
                        There are no misters! Dakota, we go 
                        to a women’s college! 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Okay! Chillax! Then what’s their 
                        deal?

           Indi hears far-off SHOUTING from somewhere outside. She looks 
           out her window, strains to listen. 

           More SHOUTING. That’s when Indi sees it --

           The SILHOUETTE OF A GIRL, STANDING ON THE BELL TOWER on the 
           quad. The girl on the tower stumbles close to the edge. 
                                 INDI
                        Dakota, I gotta go --

           Indi quickly hangs up, darting out her door.

           EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi runs for the bell tower. She looks up and recognizes the 
           silhouette of the girl high above -- IT’S BRIDGET. 

           Bridget is shouting, arms waving, but her EYES ARE CLOSED. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        I love you! I love you! I love you! 

           Bridget is nearly naked, in nothing but panties and socks. BE 
           MINE FOREVER is scrawled in RED MARKER across her chest. 

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        I love you! I’ll do anything for 
                        you! You’re my crush and I’m yours!

           Bridget teeters dangerously close to the edge. Indi stops at 
           the foot of the bell tower, helpless, terrified.  

           She dials 9-1-1, puts her phone to ear, shivering, craning 
           her neck to look up at Bridget. 

                                 9-1-1 OPERATOR (ON THE PHONE)
                        9-1-1, what’s your emergency?

                                 INDI
                        I’m at Bolin College, there’s a 
                        student on the bell tower. I’m -- I 
                        think she’s going to jump. 

           Up above, Bridget reaches out with open arms, as if she’s 
           expecting a hug. Eyes still closed, she’s smiling. 

                                 BRIDGET
                        I’ll never wake up!

           ON THE BELL TOWER

           Bridget’s toes inch over the ledge. She goes for the 
           invisible embrace, arms outstretched --

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        This is what you wanted. 

           ON THE GROUND BELOW

           Indi’s eyes go cartoon-character wide with horror.
                                 INDI
                        Hurry!

           But before Indi has time to blink, Bridget stretches out one 
           leg, stepping into the void --

           Falling forward, with no one there to catch her, and --

           Indi SHUTS HER EYES tightly. 

           We hear only the THUD on brick. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. TOWN - DAY

           Indi rides her bike through town. She rides slowly -- she 
           looks dead tired. 

           She ditches her bike in the gravel parking lot outside the 
           pizza joint. 

           INT. A LITTLE BITE OF ITALY - MOMENTS LATER

           The restaurant is empty, well past the lunch crowd. A few 
           dreary locals sit and day drink at the bar. 

           Indi grabs an empty stool at the end of the bar. The 
           BARTENDER sets down a coaster to greet her.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Not used to seeing you here before 
                        sundown, chickadee. And where are 
                        your little girlfriends?

                                 INDI
                        I’m riding solo. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Alright, what’re we having?

                                 INDI
                        You got any Red Bull?
                             (off his expression)
                        Just a coffee please. Sugar! No 
                        cream.

           The bartender goes off to fetch her coffee. 

           The little bell over the door JINGLES and in walks EARL (late 
           20s, local burnout, beanie even though it’s summer). He spots 
           Indi at the bar and joins her. 
                                 EARL
                        Indi, you’re a sight for sore eyes. 
                        Looking gorgeous as always.

           Indi does not look gorgeous. Indi looks like total shit. But 
           no girl is safe from low-key harassment, not even the ones 
           who look disgusting right now.

           INT. SEDAN - A LITTLE LATER

           In the driver’s seat of a crummy sedan, EARL smokes the dregs 
           of a cigarette. Indi climbs into the passenger seat and shuts 
           the door. He stamps out his cigarette, rolls up his window.  

                                 INDI
                        How much did you bring?

                                 EARL
                        How much do you want?

                                 INDI
                        How much do you have?

           Earls pops open his center console. 

                                 EARL
                        I’ve got the 20 milligram, the 30 
                        milligram, a ton of XR. 

                                 INDI
                        I don’t need the XR. Can I get 
                        like, thirty thirties?

                                 EARL
                        Damn, sweets. You got summer school 
                        or something?

                                 INDI
                        Or something.

                                 EARL
                             (rummaging around)
                        Your friend came to see me the 
                        other day. 

                                 INDI
                        My friend?

                                 EARL
                        Yeah, kinda hot? 
                             (off Indi’s blank stare)
                        Not the short one, the other one. I 
                        think she’s Mexican? I dunno. 
                                 INDI
                        Gabby?

                                 EARL
                        Sure. Sold her Ambien. I was like 
                        knock yourself out, señorita. 

           Indi looks troubled by this little factoid. Earl hands her a 
           bottle of ibuprofen. She quickly opens the cap -- the bottle 
           is full of creamsicle orange ADDERALL. 

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        You wanna count ‘em?

                                 INDI
                        Dude, I can’t even count higher 
                        than ten right now. 

           Indi pockets the pills. She pulls three crumpled fifty dollar 
           bills out of her jean shorts and hands them over. 

           Earl gives her back one of the fifties. 

                                 EARL
                        Midsummer discount. 

                                 INDI
                             (genuinely grateful)
                        Thanks, man. 

           Indi smiles weakly, then opens the car door. Before she can 
           go, Earl casually puts a hand on her bare thigh.

                                 EARL
                        Wanna smoke a spliff?

           So much for that friendly discount. Indi doesn’t turn to make 
           eye contact with Earl. 

                                 INDI
                        I gotta study.

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - LATER

           Indi sits at her desk and crushes an orange pill on a paper 
           plate. She cuts a line and snorts it like a pro. 

           EXT. BELL TOWER - LATER

           Indi walks past the bell tower. A wimpy memorial has been set 
           up near the spot where Bridget fell, a sad shrine of teddy 
           bears and flowers wilting in the hot sun. 
           Indi lingers for a moment. She notices a photo of Bridget 
           from her high school graduation -- eyes bright, cheeks rosy.

           Looks nothing like the girl she was near the end. 

           INT. LIBRARY - LATER

           Indi walks up to the help desk in the library. A student 
           LIBRARY ASSISTANT working her summer job reads a magazine. 

                                 INDI
                        Excuse me?

           The library assistant glances up from her Us Weekly.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Do we have any like, you know --
                             (floundering)
                        Umm, errr, religious? Books. 

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT
                        You wanna read a bible?

                                 INDI
                        Oh, umm, no. More like, any books --
                             (embarrassed)
                        About demons. And stuff. Like that.  

           The library assistant doesn’t bat an eye. She returns to her 
           magazine, coolly flips a page.  

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT
                        Check the occult-slash-paranormal 
                        collection.

                                 INDI
                        There’s a whole collection?

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT
                        What, you think you’re the first 
                        girl at this school to go through a 
                        Wiccan phase? 

           Indi stares at the library assistant without blinking.

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Third floor. 

           INT. LIBRARY - THIRD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi scans the shelves, reading the spines of books in the 
           aforementioned OCCULT/PARANORMAL section. 
           The book titles all contain words like ASTROLOGY, GHOSTS, 
           MYSTICISM, WITCHCRAFT, RITUAL, DIVINATION...

           DEMONOLOGY. Indi gathers as many books as she can carry. 

           INT. LIBRARY - READING ROOM - LATER

           Sprawled out at a table in the dimly lit reading room, Indi 
           dives into the books. 

           She picks up a heavy book titled THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF DEMONS & 
           DEMONOLOGY. First thing’s first.

           She opens the book and begins flipping pages. She stops on a 
           gruesome PAINTING, spread across two pages like a centerfold:

           A handsome MAN slicing the throat of a sleeping woman. She’s 
           merely the cherry on top of a pile of DEAD WOMEN.

           The painting sends a chill down Indi’s spine. She turns the 
           page, comes upon an entry for INCUBUS -- scrunches her face.

                                 INDI
                        Like the nu metal band?

           She begins reading --

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        An incubus is a demon in male form 
                        who, according to myths and 
                        legends, lies upon sleeping women 
                        in order to --

           Indi looks up from the page, absorbing what she’s just read.

                                 INDI
                        Bone them...

           Her eyes return to the page, rapidly scanning what’s next --

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        Salacious tales of incubi have been 
                        told for centuries. Some traditions 
                        hold that repeated sexual activity 
                        with an incubus may result in the 
                        deterioration of health, mental 
                        state, or even death.

           Indi swallows hard.

           She pushes the encyclopedia aside and opens her laptop, 
           navigating to a search engine. She types the word INCUBUS. 
           She scrolls past the results for “Incubus Rock Band” and 
           begins clicking through a series of articles, eyes racing 
           over haunting images -- winged demons atop sleeping women. 

           Indi chooses another book from the pile. She rubs her eyes 
           and keeps going. She perks up as she reads --

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        Kalu Kumara is a demonic eros -- a 
                        disease demon whose favorite target 
                        is beautiful girls. He attacks 
                        through dreams so pleasurable that 
                        his victims may not even know that 
                        they’re being attacked --

                                 INDI
                        Or may not care. 

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        Kalu Kumara manifests to women via 
                        ecstatic, --

                                 INDI
                        Erotic dreams.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        His target may wish never to wake 
                        from this beautiful rapture, and 
                        therein lies the danger. He is not 
                        frightening -- unless he wishes to 
                        be -- but he drains his victim’s 
                        life essence. His attacks are 
                        accompanied by malaise, wasting, 
                        anorexia -- not because she’s 
                        worried about weight or appearance, 
                        but because the victim can’t be 
                        bothered to eat. Her only desire is 
                        to sleep all the time --

                                 INDI
                        In hopes of once again receiving a 
                        visit.
                             (beat)
                        Shit.

           Indi rubs her eyes again. The sky outside the library windows 
           has turned to dusk, a lavender glow. 

           Indi starts to nod off, almost imperceptibly, but she snaps 
           awake when she hears --

                                 BRIDGET (O.S.)
                        I’ve got a crush on you.
           She looks around the reading room, but nobody’s there.

                                 BRIDGET  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Crush on you. Crush you.

           Indi stands from the table, follows the sound of the voice...

           Indi wanders through the library. The bookshelves seem higher 
           now, the aisles longer. She peeks around a corner and sees -- 

           BRIDGET, HALF-NAKED, BLOODY, HER FACE SMASHED IN. She smiles 
           at Indi with broken teeth and split lips.

                                 BRIDGET (CONT’D)
                        He’s my crush.
                             (spits up blood, smiles)
                        He’s gonna crush you.

           CAL STEPS OUT from behind a bookshelf and joins Bridget. He 
           puts his arm around her protectively, holding her tight. His 
           white sleeve soaks with her blood. He WINKS at Indi as she -- 

           Chokes on a scream and backs away, out of the aisle.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Over here.

           Indi turns to see a MYSTERY GIRL in a pale blue dress, 
           beckoning her to the stairwell.

                                 MYSTERY GIRL
                        Follow me!

           The mystery girl darts into the stairwell and Indi quickly 
           follows suit, leaving Cal and bloody Bridget behind. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           The library only has four floors, but the stairwell looks 
           like it stretches up forever. The mystery girl pops her head 
           over a landing high above.

                                 MYSTERY GIRL
                        This way, follow me!

           Indi runs up the stairs, follows her out a door and onto --

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DUSK

           Indi steps onto the soccer field. The killer MASCOTS lie on 
           top of one another in BLOODY AND BATTERED HEAPS. 
           The mystery girl stands atop a pile of their bodies, wielding 
           a red emergency axe like the patron saint of fucking shit up. 

           As Indi gets her first good look at the girl, she sees that 
           she’s actually wearing a pale blue hospital gown. 

                                 MYSTERY GIRL
                        Sister before misters, am I right?

           In awe of this mystery girl, Indi nods her head --

           INT. LIBRARY - READING ROOM - NIGHT

           Nodding herself awake. She sits up straight, giving herself a 
           tiny slap on the cheek. 

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        Find what you’re looking for?

           Indi jumps in her seat, startled to see the library assistant 
           standing in the doorway. Indi nods a quick yes. 

                                 LIBRARY ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Cool beans. 
                             (as she goes)
                        Library closes in twenty minutes. 

           Indi quickly hops on her laptop. She types BOLIN COLLEGE GIRL 
           IN HOSPITAL into the search engine. 

           She clicks on the top result and sees a photo of --

           THE MYSTERY GIRL. She reads the headline: BOLIN COLLEGE 
           SENIOR STILL IN COMA AFTER TRAGIC ACCIDENT. 

           Indi continues to scan the article -- “another chapter in the 
           dark history of Bolin College girls.”

           Indi furrows her brow, a perplexed frown. And off her look...

           INT. LIBRARY - ARCHIVES - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi sits at a MICROFILM READER. She flips through several 
           BLACK AND WHITE ARTICLES until finally, she stops --

           HEADLINE: STUDENT DROWNS UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES.

           Indi reacts, reads the caption under the photo of a pretty 
           girl: “Elizabeth Link, prior to her drowning, 1972.”

           She keeps flipping, finds another article --
           HEADLINE: FRESHMAN GIRL RUNS CAR OFF ROAD, POLICE SUSPECT 
           CRASH INTENTIONAL. Another photo of a pretty girl, another 
           caption: “Annabelle Esposito, 1956.”

           Keeps flipping, further back in time, finds another --

           HEADLINE: BOLIN GIRL FOUND HANGING IN THE WOODS, SPRING 
           MARRED BY TRAGEDY. Photo, caption: “Daisy Dawson, 1928.”

           Indi gathers her stuff and hightails it out of there. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Indi approaches a nurses station in the local hospital.

                                 INDI
                        What time do visiting hours begin?

           The nurse looks up from some paperwork, surprised to see Indi 
           standing there, and taken aback by the sight of her. Indi’s 
           not looking too hot. 

                                 NURSE
                        Six-thirty a.m. 
                             (beat)
                        Are you alright?

           But Indi can’t be bothered to answer.

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi takes a seat in the empty waiting room. She checks out 
           her surroundings -- coast is clear. She does a key bump of 
           orange powder and settles in for the long night ahead. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAWN

           Indi’s head lolls to the side. She almost nods off, but 
           catches herself. She checks her phone -- 6:20. 

           Indi gets up to stretch her legs. She cracks her neck, 
           wanders out of the waiting room.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi bends over a water fountain and begins to drink, 
           parched, when she hears a familiar voice from down the hall --

                                 SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                        Clear! 
           Followed by the sound of cackling LAUGHTER, then --

                                 GABBY (O.S.)
                        Clear!

           Indi slowly walks down the hall, following the voices toward 
           an open door. She looks through the doorway...

           INSIDE A HOSPITAL ROOM

           SAMANTHA AND GABBY shock each other’s hearts with a 
           DEFIBRILLATOR. They take turns. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Clear!

           SHOCK, SPASM.

                                 GABBY
                        Clear!

           SHOCK, SPASM.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Be still my heart!

           SHOCK, SPASM.

                                 GABBY
                        Be mine forever! 

           SHOCK, SPASM. Gabby and Samantha turn to look at Indi at the 
           same time. They speak in unison, like The Shining twins --

                                 SAMANTHA/GABBY
                        He’s gonna crush you.

           IN A QUICK FLASH, Indi sees Gabby and Samantha BATTERED AND 
           BROKEN, THEIR FACES SMASHED IN, THEIR BLOOD SMEARED ON THE 
           FLOOR AND WALLS. They smile at Indi and then --

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           INT. NURSES STATION - MORNING

           Indi stands at the nurses station. She stares at a very 
           bewildered nurse. The nurse repeats herself. 

                                 NURSE
                        Can I help you?
                                 INDI
                        I’m here for visiting hours. 

           The nurse passes Indi a sign-in sheet.

                                 NURSE
                        And who are you here to see?

           Indi hesitates -- she realizes she doesn’t know the mystery 
           girl’s name. Stops, thinks, goes for it --

                                 INDI
                        Coma girl?

           INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

           The nurse shows Indi to a room in the ICU. 

                                 NURSE
                        She doesn’t get many visitors these 
                        days. It’s nice of you to stop by. 

           Indi smiles politely as the nurses leaves her alone in the 
           room. She gazes down at the hospital bed. 

           Coma girl, aka JANE (early 30s, pale blue hospital gown) lies 
           asleep in the bed. Or rather, in a coma. Indi takes a seat in 
           the chair at her beside.

           Jane looks older than she did in Indi’s dream, and paler, but 
           she’s still recognizable. 

                                 INDI
                        Hey there, Jane. I don’t know if 
                        you can hear me yet...

           Indi lies back in the chair, getting comfortable. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Gonna try something out, just gimme 
                        a minute.

           She closes her eyes, falling asleep...

           INT. WHITE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi opens her eyes -- she’s in a white room, bright and 
           sterile. Nicer than a hospital room, more like a hotel suite. 

                                 INDI
                        Jane...?
           Jane is seated on the perfectly made bed. She looks as young 
           and vibrant as she did in the dream.

                                 JANE
                        Welcome to my safety zone.

           Indi gets up from the chair, tries to look into the hallway --

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you can’t leave the room!
                             (beat)
                        It’s not safe out there.

                                 INDI
                        Okay.

                                 JANE
                        Only in the safety zone. 

           Indi sits down and Jane relaxes. There’s something off about 
           her. She’s got the peculiar, sedated vibe of a Stepford wife. 

                                 INDI
                        Jane... is the safety zone how you 
                        hide from Cal?

           Jane’s expression shifts, but she quickly recovers with 
           another creepy smile. Her voice is shaky and careful. 

                                 JANE
                        Boys! Who needs them? 
                             (shakes her head)
                        Can’t live with them, can’t live --

           Jane’s eyes glaze over. She loses herself for a moment. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t live, can’t live -- 
                             (stutters)
                        Can’t leave. I can’t leave my 
                        safety zone. 

                                 INDI
                        What happened with you and Cal?

                                 JANE
                             (wistful sigh)
                        Bad breakup... 
                             (perks up)
                        But it’s okay! He can’t find me 
                        here. I’ll never leave, and he’ll 
                        never find me!
                                 INDI
                        How did you create a safety zone? 

                                 JANE.
                        I’m in a coma! Now he can’t touch 
                        me.

           Yikes. Indi leans forward, trying to get Jane to focus.

                                 INDI
                        Jane -- Cal is, um, dating my best 
                        friends. Both of them. 

                                 JANE
                        Of course he is! Boys are dirty 
                        dogs and devil pigs and everything 
                        is their fault.

                                 INDI
                        Facts. But how do I save my best 
                        friends from his bullshit? 

                                 JANE
                        You don’t. Let me tell you an 
                        ending to this story. The only 
                        ending... boy meets best friend, 
                        and romance ensues. But there is no 
                        light at the end of this tunnel of 
                        love. Only darkness. There’s your 
                        friends smearing “I love you” in 
                        their own poop on the walls. Or 
                        your friends eating a bottle of 
                        sleeping pills for breakfast, or 
                        jumping off a bridge. 

                                 INDI
                        Or a bell tower...

                                 JANE
                        Would you like to know what makes 
                        Cal so wicked?
                             (Jane waits, Indi nods)
                        It’s not only the threat of bodily 
                        harm. It’s the terror of not being 
                        believed over and over and over 
                        again. You know that saying -- the 
                        prettiest trick of the devil is to 
                        make us believe he doesn’t exist? 
                        It’s not quite true... a devil like 
                        Cal? All he wants is attention. His 
                        prettiest trick is convincing a 
                        girl he exists... and making sure 
                        nobody believes her. 
           Indie lets this sink in, mind racing. She shakes her head.

                                 INDI
                        My best friends are two of the 
                        greatest bitches I know. And they 
                        don’t take shit from anyone, 
                        especially not piece of shit 
                        demonic boyfriends. 

                                 JANE
                        Cal is not your average piece of 
                        shit. He’s one hell of a guy in the 
                        worst way. And your friends’ bodies 
                        no longer belong to them. 

           Jane’s expression shifts and her creeptastic smile returns. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t save them. And if they 
                        were really your best friends... 
                        they’d want you to save yourself. 

           Indi rises from the chair, stands tall.

                                 INDI
                        Yeah, fuck that.

           INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - CONTINUOUS

           Indi wakes up. Jane is back in bed, lying still, dull and 
           listless. Indi walks up to her bedside, squeezes her hand. 

                                 INDI
                        I’m sorry this happened to you, 
                        Jane. And I’m sorry nobody was 
                        there for you.
                             (beat)
                        But my best friends’ bodies don’t 
                        belong to bad guys.

           Indi tenderly drops Jane’s comatose hand, then goes.  

           EXT. QUAD - DAY

           Indi shuffles across the quad, dazed but determined. She 
           hears HOOTING. She stops, looks up at THAT STUPID OWL --

                                 INDI
                        Who, the fuck, do you think you’re 
                        hooting at?! 

           The owl’s coal-black eyes bore down on her. 
           As Indi glares up at this obnoxious fucking owl, DAKOTA joins 
           her side. Dakota looks up, eyes squinting in the sun.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Isn’t seeing an owl during the day 
                        bad luck or whatever?

           Indi notices her sister beside her and immediately melts. She 
           pulls her into a tight hug. 

                                 INDI
                        You’re here, you’re here!
                             (lets go)
                        Are you really here?

                                 DAKOTA
                        Yeah bitch I’m here! 
                             (swag)
                        Delta Basic Economy.  

           Indi hugs her sister again. She notices the owl staring down 
           at them. She whispers in Dakota’s ear...

                                 INDI
                        Come on, let’s go inside.

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Indi shepherds Dakota into her room and locks the door behind 
           them. Dakota tries to mask her reaction to the MESS.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Laundry day?

           Dakota steps over a mound of dirty clothes.

                                 INDI
                        What? Oh, yeah, sorry it’s like a 
                        flophouse in here. I would’ve 
                        tidied up if I knew you were 
                        coming.

                                 DAKOTA
                        I wanted to surprise you...

                                 INDI
                        And I am so fucking glad you’re 
                        here! You have no idea. None.

           Indi kisses Dakota on the cheek, then sits down at her desk. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Make yourself comfortable. 
           Dakota weighs her options. She discreetly clears a spot on 
           Indi’s bed, which is covered in random shit. No way anybody’s 
           been sleeping on it lately. 

           At her desk, Indi crushes an Adderall.  

                                 DAKOTA
                        What are you doing?

                                 INDI
                        Don’t judge me. 

           Indi cuts a line and snorts it. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Indiana! What are you, taking the 
                        SAT later?

           Indi rubs under nose, sniffing up. She turns her desk chair 
           around to face Dakota. 

                                 INDI
                        We need to talk. 

                                 DAKOTA
                             (goofy smile)
                        Oooh, sounds serious.

                                 INDI
                        I mean it, Dakota. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Okay! I’m all ears. 

           Indi drags her chair to the bed, leans in close to Dakota...

                                 INDI
                        I’ve been having bad dreams.

                                 DAKOTA
                        I told you -- you need to smoke 
                        weed before bed. I smoke basically 
                        every night and I never dream.

                                 INDI
                        No no no, you don’t get it. Every 
                        time I fall asleep, there is... 
                        somebody there waiting for me. 

                                 DAKOTA
                             (raises her eyebrows)
                        Okay, Nancy in Nightmare on Elm 
                        Street.
                                 INDI
                        I’m not, fucking, around.

           The intensity in Indi’s voice wipes the smile right off 
           Dakota’s face. Joke’s over.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Indiana... maybe you should talk to 
                        someone.

                                 INDI
                        I’m talking to you!

                                 DAKOTA
                        Someone above my pay grade. 

                                 INDI
                        Why bother?! I can’t run, I can’t 
                        hide, I can’t stay awake forever. 
                             (beat)
                        And I can’t abandon my friends. 

           Indi looks into her sister’s eyes, trying to read her 
           reaction, hoping for the best, waiting for the worst --

                                 DAKOTA
                        How can I help?

           Indi smiles, then nods with steely determination.

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           It’s dark outside now. Music blasts. Indi has cleared a spot 
           on her floor and laid out all her RESEARCH for Dakota. 

                                 INDI
                        We’re safe when we’re awake. And I 
                        think he’s only listening when 
                        we’re asleep.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Sure...
                             (no it doesn’t)
                        Makes sense. 

                                 INDI
                        But Gabby and Samantha -- they want 
                        to sleep all the time. And they’re 
                        wasting away right in front of me.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Can’t you just... give a bitch a 
                        Red Bull?
                                 INDI
                        This is serious, Dakota! Another 
                        girl on campus already died.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Hold up. For real?

                                 INDI
                        Her name was Bridget. She jumped 
                        from the bell tower and I couldn’t 
                        help her. I saw her fall. I heard 
                        her hit the pavement. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Holy shit, dude! No wonder you’re 
                        having like... a mental breakdown. 

                                 INDI
                        I’m not having a breakdown because 
                        of what happened to Bridget! What 
                        happened to Bridget is because Cal.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Cal?

           Indi opens one of the books and shoves it at Dakota.

                                 INDI
                        Cal. Kalu Kumara. It’s so fucking 
                        on the nose I wanna puke. Blergh!   

                                 DAKOTA
                        Please don’t puke.

           Indi bites a nail as she watches Dakota read. 

                                 INDI
                        The exhaustion, the injuries, the 
                        weight loss, it all makes sense. 

                                 DAKOTA
                             (pokes her stomach)
                        Maybe I should meet Cal.

                                 INDI
                        Dakota!

                                 DAKOTA
                        I’m kidding! 
                             (closes the book)
                        Okay, if you say this is what’s 
                        happening, then... I believe you.
                                 INDI
                        Thank you.
                             (watery eyes)
                        It feels really fucking good to be 
                        believed.

           After a beat, Indi quickly wipes a tear from her eye. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        So what do we do?

           INT. SAMANTHA'S ROOM - DAY

           It’s the middle of the day, but the room is dark behind the 
           blackout curtains. Samantha is sound asleep. Her room is not 
           as bad as Bridget’s was, but it’s getting there.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        I need to reach them in their 
                        dreams, but stay away from Cal. 

                                 DAKOTA (V.O.)
                        And how can you do that?

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        You’ll have to watch me sleep, and 
                        wake me up if I look... distressed. 

                                 DAKOTA (V.O.)
                        “Distressed”?

           INT. DINING HALL - DAY

           Indi hides under a table in the campus dining hall. She 
           whispers straight to camera --

                                 INDI
                        Trust me. This fucker loves to see 
                        a damsel in distress.

           ACROSS THE DINING HALL 

           Cal and Samantha enjoy a LAVISH MEAL, laid out all over their 
           table like a royal banquet. Cal feeds Samantha a strawberry. 

           UNDER THE TABLE

           Indi watches this dream PDA with contempt. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Gimme a break. 
           She crawls on her hands and knees from under one table to the 
           next, moving closer to Samantha and Cal.

           Indi thinks she’s being stealth as fuck, when suddenly --

                                 CAL (O.S.)
                        Indi!

           Indi freezes. She slowly peeks her head above the table to 
           see Cal and Samantha staring right at her. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you join us for dinner?

           Indi stands, trying to play it cool, and strolls over to Cal 
           and Samantha’s table. She takes a seat at the opposite end. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What are you doing here? I’m on a 
                        date.

                                 INDI
                        You’re dreaming.

           Cal rubs Samantha’s shoulder, soothing her. 

                                 CAL
                        She’s probably hungry, babe. 
                             (to Indi)
                        Help yourself.

           Indi ignores Cal, maintains her focus on Samantha.

                                 INDI
                        Samantha, we need to talk. 

                                 CAL
                        There’s plenty to eat.

                                 INDI
                        I’m not hungry!

           Cal motions to the spread of food on the table -- as soon as 
           Indi breaks her focus, she sees that all the platters are now 
           heaping with ORGANS and INTESTINES, BLOOD AND GUTS GALORE.

           Indi tries to push back her chair, away from the table, but 
           she can’t move -- leather straps now hold her arms and legs 
           in place, her chair bolted to the floor.

           Cal lifts a BLEEDING, BEATING HEART from a silver platter, 
           red and sumptuous. He brings the heart to his mouth and takes 
           a bite. He CHEWS as BLOOD DRIPS from his chin. He offers the 
           heart to Samantha -- she takes a HUGE BITE. 
                                 CAL
                        Eat your heart out, babe. 

           Indi struggles against her restraints. This shit’s gross.

                                 INDI
                        Samantha, listen to me! 

           With sudden ferocity, Cal is upon Indi. He takes a fistful of 
           NECROTIC INTESTINES and shoves it into her mouth.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                             (squirming, gagging)
                        Samantha --

                                 CAL
                        It’s rude to talk with your mouth 
                        full, Indi.

           Cal grabs a rotten, oozing liver and shoves it into Indi’s 
           mouth. She gags and chokes, blind with tears.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Order what you want but eat what 
                        your order.

                                 INDI
                             (spits out maggots)
                        Fuck you, lame ass!

           Cal shoves another fistful of nasty into Indi’s mouth. Her 
           chest heaves as she begins to vomit -- first just blood, then 
           her own INTESTINES, slithering out of her mouth like snakes --

           INT. INDI’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dakota SHAKES Indi AWAKE. She spits up vomit onto her chest. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Holy crap, Indi! 

           Indi wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. 

                                 DAKOTA (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 INDI
                        Demon doing demon shit.

                                 DAKOTA
                        You almost choked on your own vomit 
                        like Jesse’s goth girlfriend! 
                                 INDI
                        Are you invoking the twelfth 
                        episode of the second season of 
                        Breaking Bad right now, bitch?!

                                 DAKOTA
                        She died, it happens!

                                 INDI
                        That’s not the only way it happens.

           Indi flies out of bed, paces back and forth like a lunatic. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        It didn’t work. I can’t hide from 
                        him if he’s always with them! 

                                 DAKOTA
                        So how do you separate them?

                                 INDI
                        I don’t know.

           Indi stops pacing. She bites a nail as she thinks. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Maybe if I find them first, before 
                        Cal, as soon as they fall asleep...
                             (gears turning)
                        I can get to them before he does. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        You gotta risk it for the biscuit.

           INT. GABBY'S ROOM - MORNING

           Gabby passed out in bed. After a few silent beats, an ALARM 
           CLOCK GOES OFF from somewhere outside her room. She slowly 
           stirs, sits up in bed, bleary-eyed...

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Gabby steps into the hallway, follows the sound of the alarm 
           to a closed door down the hall...

           INT. EMPTY DORM ROOM - SAME TIME

           Indi and Dakota are holed up in an empty dorm room, cleared 
           out for the summer. An alarm BLARES from Dakota’s phone. 

           Suddenly, a sharp KNOCK on the door. 
                                 GABBY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, would you mind turning 
                        off your alarm? Some of us are 
                        trying to sleep in! 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Oops, my bad!

           Dakota stops the alarm. Indi lies back on the bare mattress 
           as Dakota presses her ear to the closed door and listens...

           After a beat, she hears the sound of Gabby’s door SLAMMING 
           down the hall. 

           Dakota turns to give Indi the signal, but Indi’s already 
           falling asleep...

           INT. SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

           Gabby swims laps. The pool lights are a swirl of neon colors. 

           Indi comes barreling up to the side of the pool. She spots 
           Gabby swimming and DIVES --

           UNDERWATER

           Indi swims through the neon-tinted water toward Gabby. She 
           yanks on Gabby’s ankle and --

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           The girls both pop their heads out of the water. Gabby wheels 
           around to see Indi treading water behind her.

                                 GABBY
                        What the -- how did you get here?

                                 INDI
                        Gabby, we need to talk. Now.

                                 GABBY
                        I don’t wanna talk to you. 

           Gabby starts swimming to the pool ladder -- but Indi grabs 
           her ankle again. 

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        Knock it off!

                                 INDI
                             (splashes Gabby)
                        We don’t got a lot of time, bitch! 
                                 GABBY
                             (splashes Indi)
                        You’re the bitch! 

                                 INDI
                             (splashing)
                        We need to talk about Cal.
                             (they stop splashing)
                        That’s right. I know all about your 
                        new mans.

                                 GABBY
                        What about him?

                                 INDI
                        Did you know he’s dating you and 
                        Samantha?
                             (beat)
                        And he was dating Bridget. 
                             (beat)
                        And... he tried to date me.

           Gabby stares at Indi. They tread water in silence. Then --

                                 GABBY
                        Why is everything always such drama 
                        with you? You’re so pathetic. 

           Gabby keeps swimming to the ladder, refusing to hear this.

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re trash, Indi!

           As Gabby begins to climb the ladder, a HAND reaches down to 
           help her up -- it’s CAL.

           Indi stops... slowly begins to swim backward. 

           Cal puts his arm around Gabby. They stare down at Indi in the 
           pool as she backs away. 

           Suddenly, Indi bumps into a piece of floating GARBAGE. She 
           looks around wildly and sees that the pool is filled to the 
           brim with FLOATING, STINKING TRASH -- 

           Indi’s swimming in a giant, wet DUMPSTER. She begins to sink 
           in the garbage like quicksand. 

           Cal slowly walks the perimeter of the pool. Indi fights her 
           way toward a ladder, sinking, struggling to breath. 

                                 CAL
                        You can take the girl out of the 
                        trash... 
           Before she even realizes what’s happening, Cal has Indi by 
           the hair -- he pulls her right out of the pool. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        But you can’t take the trash out of 
                        the girl.

           Cal lets go of Indi’s hair, throwing her on the concrete. She 
           lands with a painful thud.  

           The wind already knocked out of her, Cal swiftly kicks Indi 
           in the stomach. She curls on her side, whimpering.  

           Cal yanks Indi’s head up by her hair again. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this how you like it? Rough?

           Indi begins crying as Cal twists her hair tighter. He lifts 
           her head, about to bash her skull on the concrete when --

           INT. EMPTY DORM ROOM - DAY

           Indi wakes up, sobbing, as Dakota pulls her into a hug. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        I got you, you’re safe, I got you.

           Dakota holds Indi tight, stroking her hair. Indi weeps into 
           her sister’s shoulder. 

                                 INDI
                             (through sobs)
                        It’s not working. They won’t listen 
                        to me! He’s got them! 

           Dakota continues to rock her sister back and forth, her sobs 
           slowly trickling to sniffles. 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi lies in bed, fully clothed, catatonic. Dakota watches 
           her, worried.

                                 DAKOTA
                        I don’t know what’s going on, but 
                        you can’t keep doing this. 

                                 INDI
                        I told you what’s going on.
                                 DAKOTA
                        You need to get some rest. You’re 
                        losing it. And I’m tired --

                                 INDI
                        I thought you believed me?

                                 DAKOTA
                        I do! But you can’t --

                                 INDI
                        I can! 
                             (sits up, eyes wild)
                        This fucker thinks I’m basic? 
                        Thinks I’m scared? Uh-uh, I’m a 
                        motherfucking final girl and demons 
                        ain’t shit. 

           Indi lies back down, determined, deranged. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        You know what to do. 

           Dakota gives Indi a pleading look, but Indi shuts her eyes on 
           Dakota’s concern. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Indi wanders down the hallway of a school building. The hall 
           is lined with empty classrooms. They look dark and dangerous. 

           She spots a DIM LIGHT glowing from a classroom at the end of 
           the hall. Follows it through an open door...

           INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           JANE is at the front of the classroom. She’s writing SAFETY 
           ZONE over and over and over again on a chalkboard. Frenzied 
           and maniacal, she doesn’t even notice Indi standing there. 

                                 INDI
                        Jane?

           Jane keeps scrawling, faster and faster.

                                 JANE
                        He’s gonna teach us a lesson. 

                                 INDI
                        Help me, Jane. We need to stand up 
                        to him. We can do it together.
           From somewhere in the hallway, GLASS SHATTERS. Jane stops 
           what she’s doing. She slowly sets down the chalk.  

                                 JANE
                        Hide.

           Jane darts under the teacher’s desk at the front of the 
           classroom. Indi makes a dash for a table in the back. 

           UNDER THE TABLE

           Indi half-sees Cal walk into the classroom. He drags the red 
           emergency AXE behind him, scraping it against the floor.

           Cal checks out Jane’s handiwork on the chalkboard, sniggers. 

           The next thing Indi hears is Jane SCREAMING as Cal pulls her 
           out from underneath the desk. 

                                 CAL
                        What’s it gonna take to learn your 
                        lesson, Indi?

                                 JANE
                        Please, I tried to warn her. 
                        Please, don’t hurt me!! 

           Indi leaps out from under her hiding spot --

                                 INDI
                        Leave her alone!

           Cal smiles when he sees Indi. He drops Jane like a sack of 
           potatoes -- she cowers down on the ground.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve made your point, you’re more 
                        powerful than us. I get it!

                                 CAL
                        I don’t think you do.

           Cal raises the axe over his head and swings it down in a 
           crushing blow, striking Jane and SPLITTING OPEN HER CHEST. 

                                 INDI
                        Nooooooo!

           Jane gurgles blood as Cal reaches inside her chest and 
           crudely rummages around. He finds what he’s looking for --

           JANE’S HEART, BEATING in his hand. He locks eyes with Indi. 
                                 CAL
                        Try this shit again, and I will 
                        crush you like the pest you are. 

           CAL CRUSHES JANE’S HEART IN HIS HAND, until it’s just bloody 
           pulp in his fist. Indi LURCHES AT HIM --

                                 INDI
                        Noooooo --

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - DAWN

           Indi shoots up in bed, knocking Dakota back. 

                                 INDI
                        Nooooooooo!

           Dakota grabs Indi by the shoulders, shakes her. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Indi, enough! 
                             (shakes her again)
                        That’s enough.

           Indi pushes Dakota off her. Gets up and puts on her shoes. 

                                 DAKOTA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?!

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Pulling Dakota by the arm like a toddler, Indi marches up to 
           the nurses station, startling the nurses. 

                                 INDI
                        We’re here to visit Jane Russell. 

           The nurses exchange glances. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        It’s visiting hours, right? We’re 
                        here for a visit! 

                                 NURSE
                        Sweetheart, I’m so sorry...
                             (beat)
                        Jane passed away.

           Indi drops Dakota’s arm in shock. She shakes her head. 

                                 INDI
                        When...?
                                 NURSE
                        Last night. She went peacefully in 
                        her sleep.

                                 INDI
                        THAT’S WHAT YOU THINK!!!!

           Indi turns on her heels and stampedes out the front doors of 
           the hospital. Dakota simply stands there, flabbergasted. The 
           nurses all stare at her, flabbergasted.

                                 DAKOTA
                        I’m -- we’re so sorry. Thank you, 
                        uh, for letting us know. 
                             (bows her head)
                        Condolences. I mean -- you know 
                        what I mean. 

           Dakota gets the hell out of there. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dakota steps out of the automatic doors and looks around.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Indi?

           It’s a beautiful sunny day. Chirping birds, gentle breeze, 
           and Indi nowhere to be found -- her bike is gone. 

                                 DAKOTA (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be kidding me.

           Dakota’s shoulders slump. Looks like she’s walking back.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - BLEACHERS - LATER

           Indi slouches under the bleachers, cigarette in one hand and 
           Diet Coke in the other, looking the worst she’s looked. She 
           takes a long drag. After a beat, Dakota finds her sister. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        That was a real dick move, leaving 
                        without me. 

                                 INDI
                        Sorry.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Since when do you smoke? 
                             (beat)
                        Gimme some. 
           Indi passes it over. Dakota takes a drag, makes a face. 

                                 DAKOTA (CONT’D)
                        Menthols? Okay, trashy. 

                                 INDI
                        Don’t call me that. 

           Dakota hands back the cigarette. They slouch in silence.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Who’s Jane Russell?

                                 INDI
                        Coma girl. Or at least, she was.
                             (takes one last drag)
                        Now she’s dead girl.  

           Indi stamps out the cigarette. She drinks the rest of her 
           Diet Coke and crunches the can. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, I need more caffeine. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        No you don’t. You need sleep. I’m 
                        worried about you!

                                 INDI
                        You should be. 

           Indi begins to walk across the soccer field -- Dakota follows 
           after her. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Just take a little power nap, 
                        you’ll feel better. Please?

                                 INDI
                        I won’t feel better. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Do it for me. I’ll feel better.

           Indi doesn’t respond. They walk in silence. Eventually --

                                 INDI
                        I took this class freshman year 
                        with the best professor. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Was he hot?
                                 INDI
                        No, he’s a dorky old man. But he’s 
                        the first person who ever treated 
                        me like I’m smart. How fucked up is 
                        that? 

                                 DAKOTA
                        I think you’re smart... you’re the 
                        smartest person I know.

                                 INDI
                        My professor used to say, 
                        “helplessness is an arrow in the 
                        quiver of a pretty girl.” 

                                 DAKOTA
                        I don’t get it. 

                                 INDI
                        It means a man will always 
                        underestimate you, because he never 
                        thinks you’re as strong as you are. 
                             (beat)
                        But what if he’s right.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Your professor?

                                 INDI
                        No, the man. Men. What if I’m not 
                        strong?
                             (slowly stops walking)
                        What if I don’t have what it takes 
                        to be like, the perfect final girl? 
                             (sinks)
                        I’m just a normal girl. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Trust me, you’re not normal.
                             (smiles)
                        You’re a weird little bitch, who’s 
                        pretty much my hero. 

           Indi smiles weakly, then yawns woozily. 

                                 DAKOTA (CONT’D)
                        Please take a nap. Power nap, 
                        twenty minutes. And I’ll be with 
                        you the whole time. 

           Indi considers. After a long beat, she finally relents --

                                 INDI
                        Fine, but you better set a timer. 
           INT. INDI'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Curtains drawn, Indi changes into comfier clothes. Dakota 
           packs a bowl. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Don’t want dreams? Done and done.

                                 INDI
                             (shakes her head, unsure)
                        I don’t know if that’s a good idea.

                                 DAKOTA
                        It’s a great idea! You’ll finally 
                        rest in peace.

                                 INDI
                        That’s morbid. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Bad choice of words. 

           Dakota lights the bowl and takes a hit, warming it up for 
           Indi. She passes it over. Indi hesitates, then takes a hit.

                                 INDI
                             (exhales smoke)
                        Dreamless sleep, here I come.

           Indi crawls into bed and Dakota tucks her in. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Twenty minutes, okay? I mean it. 

                                 DAKOTA
                             (lifts her phone)
                        Timer set. 

           Indi sinks into the pillow and closes her eyes. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FROM THE BLACK, WE HEAR --

                                 CAL
                             (sing-songy)
                        Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my 
                        darrrrr-ling Da-ko-ta.

           CLOSE ON: Indi, eyelids fluttering. The image is hazy, gauzy, 
           the glow of a half-formed memory. The screen goes dark, then 
           fades up again, like remembering bits of pieces of a drunken 
           blackout, but artistically rendered. 
                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        You are lost and gone forever.
                        Dreadful sorrow, Dakota...

           Cal fades in and fades out like bad reception on an old TV.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        Ruby lips above the water,
                        blowing buuuuubbles soft and fine. 
                        But your sister’s not a swimmer...

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Indi gently wakes. She sits up in bed and looks out the 
           window -- it’s dark outside. 

                                 INDI
                        Dakota?

           Indi yawns and stretches. She reaches down to a power cord on 
           the floor and hits a switch, illuminating the string lights.  

           She sees Dakota passed out on the twin air mattress. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Oy! What happened to power napping?

           Dakota’s doesn’t flinch. Indi pushes Dakota with her foot.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Dakota?

           Indi gets up from bed and kneels beside Dakota. She tries 
           shaking her awake -- but she won’t wake up. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Dakota --

           She shakes her harder, almost violently now.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Dakota!

           But it’s no use. Dakota is out cold. 

           On the brink of hysterics, Indi rests her head on Dakota’s 
           chest, ear over her heart. Listens...

           Dakota’s chest slowly rises and falls -- she’s breathing. 

           Indi’s breathes a sigh of relief, but her relief is quickly 
           overshadowed by her confusion. 
           Indi slowly gets up. She watches Dakota steadily breathe in, 
           breathe out, deep in her slumber. 

           Then a tune pops into Indi’s head, urgent and instant, like 
           remembering the words to a song you can’t believe you forgot. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        You are lost and gone forever.
                        Dreadful sorrow, Dakota...

           The blood drains from Indi’s face.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuuuuck. 

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - LATER

           Music blares. Indi has moved Dakota into her bed, flat on her 
           back, serene as Sleeping Beauty. 

           Indi looks wired, sprawled out on the floor among a half 
           dozen open books. Flipping through pages, eyes rapidly 
           scanning. She looks like she’s cramming for midterms. 

           If only.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        Kalu Kumara is believed to be an 
                        ancient prince who plotted to steal 
                        his father’s throne. When his 
                        attempt failed, he took his own 
                        life -- but was punished by 
                        returning to this world as a demon, 
                        destined to lurk in shadow, instead 
                        of being allowed to pass on. Kalu 
                        Kumara is an embittered spirit.   

                                 INDI
                        You salty little asshole.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time, he didn’t have to 
                        invade dreams -- devotees came to 
                        him. Now he spends his days waiting 
                        in the dark, only targeting girls 
                        and women. Though this fate is his 
                        punishment, it is his victims who 
                        are truly punished. 

                                 INDI
                        NO DOY!
           Indi rips opens a bag of chocolate-covered espresso beans --  
           half of them go flying, but she doesn’t give a fuck. She eats 
           a heaping handful right out of her sweaty palm.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        If dream attacks occur, a specially 
                        trained shaman can drive Kalu 
                        Kumara out and prevent his return.

           Indi grabs her laptop nearby and opens a search engine. She’s 
           typing “how to become shaman???” when her phone goes off.  

           It’s the FaceTime ringtone -- she picks up her phone -- THE 
           CUTE ONE WOULD LIKE TO FACETIME.

           Indi immediately slams her laptop shut, silencing the music 
           so only the RINGING phone is heard. She answers...

                                 INDI
                        Hello?

           Indi winces as she hears a roaring blast of STATIC, breaking 
           in and out, then -- 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Indi?

           Dakota appears on Indi’s iPhone, but she looks glitchy like a 
           hologram, or a weak distress signal. 

                                 INDI
                        Dakota! Where are you?

           Eyes ablaze, Indi looks from the sleeping Dakota in bed 
           nearby back to the grainy Dakota on her phone screen. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        He brought me home, Indi.

                                 INDI
                        Where?!

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        The woods. He lives in this --

           The phone cuts in out and out, super staticky. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        There’s a treehouse, this 
                        treehouse. 

                                 INDI
                        Get out of there! Why won’t you 
                        wake up?!
                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        I can’t... I’m in his dreams. 

                                 INDI
                        What do you mean?!

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        He’s asleep right now, but he could 
                        wake up any minute. 

           MORE STATIC. 

                                 INDI
                        Dakota, tell me what to do!

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        You have to come get me, or I’ll 
                        never wake up. 

                                 INDI
                        I can’t. I tried and I couldn’t! 
                        He’s too powerful and I’m not 
                        strong enough. 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        You are! And you’re --
                             (static)
                        Three times as powerful together.

                                 INDI
                        Three times...? Are you talking 
                        about Gabby and Samantha? 

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        You have to come here, to where he 
                        lives. This is where he sleeps, and 
                        this is where he --

                                 INDI
                        Dreams.

           Dakota fervently nods. She looks offscreen, fearful.

                                 DAKOTA (ON THE PHONE)
                        Oh no, he’s waking up...
                             (back to Indi)
                        Remember, he doesn’t know that you 
                        know he sleeps --

           A ROAR OF STATIC, then Indi’s phone abruptly dies. 

                                 INDI
                        Dakota? Shit!
           Indi throws her phone across the room. It shatters. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Shit!! 

           Indi scampers across the floor, fumbling to retrieve her 
           broken phone -- but it’s toast. 

           She crawls back to her pile of books, frenetically flips 
           pages in search of something -- she stops, reads.

                                 INDI (V.O.)
                        An embittered, evil spirit is most 
                        vulnerable in its lair, behind 
                        closed doors. Only by penetrating 
                        the demon’s lair can you share its 
                        dream space. While dreaming, demons 
                        of this kind exude a life force 
                        that can be both given and taken.  

           Indi stands, pacing, thinking, biting a nail. After a beat --

                                 INDI
                        Gotta risk it for the biscuit.

           She lies down on the air mattress, closes her eyes, and 
           plunges through her fatigue into instant, deep sleep.

           EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

           Samantha wanders across the quad, dressed to the nines. The 
           sky is dark and spangled with stars. 

           POV BEHIND A TREE: Someone, or something, watches Samantha 
           cross the lawn. We hear heavy breathing, in, out, in, out...

           The unseen figure rapidly approaches Samantha from behind --

           AND THROWS A BURLAP SACK OVER HER HEAD. 

           INT. BLACKBOX THEATRE - NIGHT

           The BURLAP SACK is removed to reveal GABBY. She’s tied to a 
           chair in a small, empty blackbox theatre. Looks over to see --

           SAMANTHA tied up in a chair beside her. 

                                 GABBY
                        What are you doing in my dream?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Excuse me? This is my dream!
           THE LIGHTS GO OUT -- A PROJECTOR SCREEN FLICKERS ON. 

           Like a retro home movie, footage of GABBY, SAMANTHA, and INDI 
           dances across the screen. They look happy, giddy, laughing, 
           goofing around. 

           They look like best friends. 

           After a beat, INDI steps out from the darkness, in front of 
           the screen. The light of the projector shines on her face.

                                 INDI
                        That’s The Lettuce Hearts Club. 
                        Look familiar?

           Gabby and Samantha squirm in their chairs, but they watch the 
           movie. Indi points to the screen --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        That’s my best friend Samantha, and 
                        that’s my best friend Gabby. And 
                        this is who we are. 

           The movie continues to play. The girls watch in silence. 

           Onscreen, the three of them huddle together like they’re 
           posing for a selfie. As they smile, the movie ends. 

           Indi steps behind Gabby and Samantha’s chairs. She changes 
           the reel in the projector and a new home movie begins --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        This is Cal.

           CAL AND SAMANTHA ON A DATE, then --

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Look familiar?

           CAL AND GABBY ON A DATE. Incriminating footage. Then --

           CAL AND BRIDGET. 

           CAL AND JANE. 

           Then Cal and countless other girls we don’t recognize, the 
           movies playing in rapid succession, one after the other. 

           Indi steps in front of the projector screen to face Gabby and 
           Samantha, obscuring their view. Puts her hand over her heart.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Three hearts are better than one.
                           GABBY
           And a lettuce heart is never 
           a lonely heart.
                                                        SAMANTHA
                                              And a lettuce heart is never 
                                              a lonely heart.

                                 INDI
                        Because lettuce hearts will always 
                        have each other. Because we don’t 
                        let guys come between us and we 
                        don’t let shitheads have their cake 
                        and eat it too.

           Gabby and Samantha shift in their chairs uncomfortably -- but 
           they’re paying attention to Indi. 

                                 GABBY
                        I’ve never understood that 
                        expression. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It means you can’t eat a cake and 
                        then continue to have that same 
                        cake so you can eat more later. 

                                 GABBY
                        Oh. Yeah.

                                 INDI
                        Time’s up, Cal.

           Indi switches off the projector. The theatre is dark for a 
           beat, until she hits the LIGHTS. 

           Indi begins untying Gabby and Samantha as their eyes adjust 
           to the brightness. Once they’re freed, they slowly stand.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Now what?

           They stand still, looking at one another, silent...  until 
           Indi pulls Gabby and Samatha into an AWKWARD THREE-WAY HUG. 

           They resist at first -- then give in, bashful, apologetic. 

                                 GABBY
                        I’m sorry!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No I’m sorry! I’m such a bitch! 

                                 GABBY
                        So am I!

                                 INDI
                        That’s right.
           The girls separate. Indi takes each of them by the hand.

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        We’re bad bitches from hell and 
                        nobody can fuck with us.
                             (beat)
                        Not actual hell. 

                           GABBY
                                                        SAMANTHA
           No, no.
                                              I mean, of course not.

                                 INDI
                        Listen -- Cal’s got my sister. 

           Samantha and Gabby’s expressions sink.

           EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls cross the quad as Indi fills them in. 

                                 INDI
                        Here’s what’s up -- our dream world 
                        is Cal’s real world. But Dakota 
                        told me that Cal sleeps, too. And 
                        if you can sleep...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You can dream. 

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls have reached the soccer field. They’re quickly 
           approaching the threshold of the woods. 

                                 INDI
                        He isn’t expecting this. Cal thinks 
                        girls are sweet and passive and in 
                        constant peril. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Damsels in distress.

                                 GABBY
                        Well... let’s show him how passive 
                        aggressive we can be. 

           Indi pulls them to a stop at the treeline. She joins hands 
           with Gabby and Samantha and closes her eyes, bows her head.  

                                 INDI
                        Dear Lord, grant us the girl power 
                        to crush this prick. 
           And with that, our trio of heroes disappears into the woods. 

           EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

           We’re back to the woods of the very beginning, the fairy 
           painting, awfully pretty for such a total fucking nightmare. 

           Indi leads the way. She’s lucid dreamed herself a flashlight. 

           As the girls make their way through the dark and dense 
           terrain, they start to notice OWLS in the trees. 

           At first, just a couple. Then a couple more. Then there are 
           dozens, following them with their watchful, GLOWING EYES. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Indi...

                                 INDI
                        Just ignore them. 
                             (shouts up at the trees)
                        Y’all dumbass demonic bad news 
                        birds! 

           Gabby sticks close to Indi’s side.

                                 GABBY
                        They’re giving me the living 
                        creeps.

                                 INDI
                        Imagine they’re the Hooters owl. 

           Gabby shuts her eyes tightly, then reopens them --

           And just like that, the trees are now filled with stuffed 
           animals that look just like THE HOOTERS LOGO. Gabby smiles. 

                                 GABBY
                        All gurgle and no guts. 

                                 INDI
                        Now that you know you’re dreaming, 
                        you can make shit happen. It 
                        doesn’t work on Cal, but...
                             (motions to the owls)
                        Looks like it took care of his 
                        little friends. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (half-joking)
                        Can we dream ourselves up some 
                        deadly weapons?
           EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS - A LITTLE LATER

           HELL YEAH THEY CAN! NOW OUR GIRLS GOT BAMF WEAPONS --

           Samantha carries a PICK AXE --

           Gabby holds a MACHETE --

           Indi has a BOW AND ARROWS like Katniss freaking Everdeen, 
           fuck yeah.  

           They traipse through the woods, eyes trained forward, until 
           eventually they spot a SOFT LIGHT peeking through the trees 
           in the distance...

           EXT. TREEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls stand at the foot of an enormous BUR OAK TREE. In 
           the tree is a closed door. Light warmly glows through glass 
           windows in the tree’s trunk. 

                                 INDI
                        When Dakota said Cal lives in a 
                        treehouse, I didn’t think she meant 
                        like a fucking Keebler elf. 

                                 GABBY
                        This is where Cal lives?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Cal never brought us home.

                                 INDI
                        Let’s go... 

           The girls quietly fan out around the tree like a SWAT team. 

           BELOW A WINDOW

           Indi crouches down. She carefully peers inside...

           POV INDI: CAL is asleep in a twisty, tangled NEST BED. He 
           tightly spoons DAKOTA, his captive little spoon.   

           Indi signals for Gabby and Samantha. They join her beneath 
           the window. Peek above the windowsill, quiet as mice... 

           INT. TREEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside, the treehouse warmly glows. It looks cozy and 
           fantastical -- like Fantastic Mr. Fox could live here. 
           Too bad somebody else lives here.

           The treehouse is silent except for the crackle of burning 
           wood in a fireplace. We hear another sound, the door slowly 
           CREAKING open...

           One after the other, the girls slip inside. Indi carefully 
           closes the door behind them. They collectively hold their 
           breath, waiting to see if Cal wakes up -- he doesn’t. 

           After the girls exhale a sigh of relief, they take in their 
           surroundings, awestruck.  

           Wooden shelfs are built into the walls of the hollow trunk, 
           floor to ceiling. The shelves are lined with KNIK KNAKS and 
           TRINKETS, belongings that clearly hold sentimental value.  

           As Indi examines the shelves -- the jewelry, the ceramics, 
           the photos, the seashells -- it dawns on her... 

                                 INDI
                        These are souvenirs. 

           Gabby and Samantha exchange a frightened glance while Indi 
           shifts her focus to --

           THE NEST BED

           She walks right up to the foot of the bed, a giant bird’s 
           nest, where Cal spoons her sleeping sister. 

           Indi watches them sleep, peaceful as a happy couple... she 
           tiptoes to Gabby and Samantha. They huddle up, whispering. 

                                 GABBY
                        Why don’t we kill him in his sleep?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Can’t I just --
                             (raises her pick axe)
                        Butterfly pin his ass?

                                 INDI
                        Although that would be metal as 
                        fuck, I’m not sure that would work. 
                        And we can’t risk waking him up. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So what can we do?

                                 INDI
                        Rude boy wants to enter our dreams 
                        without asking? Let’s enter his. 
           Gabby and Samantha share another worried look -- they can’t 
           muster Indi’s certainty. 

                                 GABBY
                        But Cal will have the home court 
                        advantage.

                                 INDI
                        Just stick to our plan. 

           After a long beat, they each nod in affirmation. Indi smiles.  

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Lettuce Hearts Club on three.

           The girls silently count to three together, then whisper --

                                 INDI/SAMANTHA/GABBY
                        Lettuce Hearts Club! 

           They break. 

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           The most beautiful fucking garden you’ve ever seen. Flowers 
           for days, sunshine for years. 

           Cal and Dakota sit at a little table on a GAZEBO, a pitcher 
           of lemonade between them. Cal raises a frosted glass. 

                                 CAL
                        Cheers to my new favorite girl. 

           Dakota raises her glass. Sugary sweet smile.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Cheers to my new man.

           They CLINK glasses, they sip lemonade. As Cal gazes out over 
           the garden, soaking in the view, Dakota’s SMILE DROPS. She 
           pantomimes barfing.  

           As Cal looks back in Dakota’s direction, HER SMILE RETURNS. 

                                 INDI (O.S.)
                        Hey, Kalu!

           Cal and Dakota whip their heads around to see our trio of 
           HEROES, THE LETTUCE HEARTS CLUB, standing in the garden, 
           brandishing their weapons. 

           Dakota lights up -- Cal drops his glass of lemonade. 
                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Ah shit, I’m sorry. Or do you 
                        prefer Cal?

           Cal jumps up from his chair, knocking over the table. 

                                 CAL
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 INDI
                        Becoming your worst nightmare. 

           Cal swiftly grabs Dakota, holds her by the neck --

                                 CAL
                        Didn’t I tell you to cut this shit 
                        out?

                                 INDI
                        Let her go!

           Cal throws Dakota off the gazebo and she crumples to the 
           ground like a rag doll. 

                                 CAL
                        Don’t worry, I’m not going to hurt 
                        my darling Dakota... 

           Cal descends from the gazebo with a wicked smile.

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        I need to save her for later. 

           Cal prowls toward them... Gabby and Samantha shrink further 
           behind Indi with each menacing step... 

           They’re wavering, weapons quivering. Indi stands tall for as 
           long as she can, until finally --

                                 INDI
                        Go!

           The girls scatter. Cal licks his lips like a cartoon wolf... 

           EXT. ROSE GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Gabby flees through a maze of towering rose bushes. She stops 
           around a corner to catch her breath. Listens closely...

           After a long beat, she JUMPS OUT from behind the corner and 
           SWINGS HER MACHETE AT CAL -- he JUMPS BACK as the machete 
           grazes his stomach, nearly slicing him wide open. 
                                 CAL
                        Nothing says “I love you” like 
                        several dozen roses. And I do love 
                        you, Gabby. Don’t be like this.

                                 GABBY
                        Your corny ass better shut up.

           Gabby tries again, but Cal nimbly ducks out of the way --

           And starts laughing. But Gabby’s not backing down. She swings 
           the machete again, and again, and --

           Cal ducks each blow as Gabby hacks up the rose bushes. She 
           raises the machete above her head and as she brings it down --

           Cal grabs her wrist, twisting it, BREAKING IT. Gabby CRIES 
           OUT in pain as her machete drops to the ground. 

           Cal yanks Gabby by her long ponytail and drags her through 
           the maze of red roses. 

           EXT. TRANQUILITY POND - MOMENTS LATER

           Cal pulls Gabby out of the rose garden by her hair as she 
           valiantly tries to resist, and fails. 

           He drags her to a tranquility pond and HOLDS HER HEAD 
           UNDERWATER -- Gabby thrashes and splashes -- but Cal is too 
           strong -- he doesn’t budge, until --

           A PICK AXE COMES DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER, EMBEDDING DEEP IN HIS 
           SKIN. He reflexively releases his grip on Gabby and she 
           BURSTS UP for air. 

           With an anguished grunt, Cal slowly pulls the bloodied pick 
           axe out of his shoulder and turns to see -- SAMANTHA.

                                 CAL
                        What’s wrong with you girls? I love 
                        you, and all I want in return is to 
                        be worshipped. Is that so wrong?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Ummmmmm, yeah.

           Cal lunges at Samantha -- and she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS with 
           the force of a thousand self defense classes. 

           Cal clutches his groin in agony. Not even demons are immune 
           to a dick punch. It’s a direct hit!

           Samantha pushes past Cal and helps Gabby up from the pond -- 
           But Cal HAMMERS GABBY’S HEAD with the butt of the pick axe.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Gabby!

           As Samantha moves to help her fallen friend, she gets a butt 
           of an axe to the head next. 

           EXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Cal drags Gabby and Samantha through the dirt behind him. He 
           calls out, taunting --

                                 CAL
                        Oh Indiaaaaanaaaa! 

           He looks around the garden. The only sound is chirping birds. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        What’s a matter? Too scared to save 
                        your gal pals?

           Indi steps out from behind a hedge, arms raised in surrender. 

                                 INDI
                        Don’t hurt them. You can have me.

                                 CAL
                        I can have all of you. 

                                 INDI
                        I’m sure you could, but it’s not 
                        like the good old days. 

           Indi walks toward Cal slowly, hands where he can see them... 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        I bet women used to throw 
                        themselves at you. 
                             (beat)
                        Now you have to fuck chicks in 
                        their sleep. 

           Cal drops Samantha and Gabby. They lie motionless behind him. 

                                 CAL
                        Shut your mouth or I’ll --

                                 INDI
                        What? Fuck it? 
                             (snickers)
                        While I’m sleeping?
           Cal clenches his fists, he shoots daggers at Indi -- but she 
           flashes her bitchiest power-bitch smile. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                        Demon or not, you’re just a loser 
                        with low self esteem who wants 
                        girls to like you. 

           Suddenly, Indi RISES OFF THE GROUND. Cal raises a clenched 
           fist and she DANGLES in the air helplessly. 

                                 CAL
                        And you’re just a stupid fucking 
                        slut who deserves every bad thing 
                        that’s ever happened to her. 

           Cal squeezes his fist tighter and Indi CRIES OUT IN PAIN. 

                                 CAL (CONT’D)
                        You think I can’t simply crush your 
                        heart in your chest? Think again.
                             (smiles)
                        Ooh wait, that’s right. You’re not 
                        the sharpest tool in the shed.  

           Indi kicks her feet, suspended in air, struggling to breath, 
           but she still manages to eke out --

                                 INDI
                        Neither are you, dipshit. 

           Cal’s expression barely has time to change when GABBY AND 
           SAMANTHA POUNCE ON HIM --

           They each hold back an arm as Indi falls to the ground and 
           LANDS ON HER FEET --

           Cal struggles against Gabby and Samantha’s grips, but the two 
           of them are stronger than he could’ve imagined. 

           Cal locks eyes with Indi as --

           SHE RAISER HER BOW AND ARROW, AIMING DIRECTLY AT HIM. 

                                 INDI (CONT’D)
                             (LOVING THIS SHIT)
                        You give love a bad name. 

           THE ARROW GOES FLYING AND SHOOTS CAL RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART. 

           Cal lets rip a PIERCING SHRIEK and with a WHOOSH OF WIND --
           INT. TREEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Indi, Samantha, Gabby, and Dakota BURTS AWAKE in the 
           treehouse. Dakota pushes Cal off of her --

           HIS HOWLS STILL ECHOING AS --

           INT. INDI'S ROOM - MORNING

           Indi and Dakota BURST AWAKE in the safety of Indi’s room. 

           Sunlight shines through the window, a heavenly glow. 

           As they realize where they are, Indi springs up from the air 
           mattress and runs to her door. She flings it open to find -- 

           GABBY and SAMANTHA standing in her doorway, smiling. Indi 
           pulls her best friends inside the room, VICTORIOUS --

                                 INDI
                        Girl power for the win!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Girls rule, boys drool!

                                 GABBY
                        Demons drool! 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Sleep tight, sucker! 

                                 INDI
                        Boy, BYE!

           The girls embrace in one big cuddle puddle, girl power ftw. 

           EXT. CAMPUS GATES - DAY

           Dakota walks with Indi through the front gates of the campus, 
           rolling her suitcase behind her. A Lyft idles on the street.

                                 DAKOTA
                        Do you remember that joke you used 
                        to tell me when we were young? 

                                 INDI
                        Refresh my memory.

           Dakota smiles and waves at the Lyft driver, then motions for 
           “one minute.” He gives a friendly nod. She tees up her joke --
                                 DAKOTA
                        There are three boys on the 
                        playground. A genie comes down and 
                        says, “I want to grant each of you 
                        a wish.” The first boy says, “I 
                        want to be ten times smarter than I 
                        am.” The genie says, “Poof! You’re 
                        ten times smarter than you were.” 
                        The second boy says, “I want to be 
                        a hundred times smarter than I am.” 
                        The genie says, “Poof! You’re a 
                        hundred times smarter.” The third 
                        boy says, “I want to be a thousand 
                        times smarter than I am.” And the 
                        genie goes... 

                                 INDI
                        Poof! You’re a girl.

           The sisters break into peals of LAUGHTER. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        Never have I ever gotten that joke 
                        more than I do now. 
                             (giggles)
                        Girls go to college to get more 
                        knowledge.

                                 INDI
                        I love you, smartypants. 

           Indi hugs Dakota, squeezing her tightly for several beats 
           before finally letting go. 

           The driver pops open the trunk and Dakota lifts her suitcase 
           inside. She slams the trunk, smiles at Indi. 

                                 DAKOTA
                        See you in my dreams.

                                 INDI
                        I hope not.

           Dakota climbs into the back seat. She waves through the 
           window as the Lyft drives away. 

           Indi waves back, keeps waving until the car is out of sight. 

           EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

           The quad is teeming with girls, students arriving back on 
           campus for the start of the school year. 
           Girls are gathered in clusters, having picnics on blankets, 
           reading in the grass, catching up with their friends after a 
           summer apart. 

           Gabby and Samantha hang around the stone steps of the 
           administrative building. Gabby uses the stairs to do box 
           jumps while Samantha keeps her eyes peeled --

           She spots Indi crossing the quad. 

           Samantha slaps Gabby on the butt and they head off together, 
           crossing the lawn to meet Indi.

                                 INDI
                        Hi, cuties!

                                 GABBY
                        Aww, I’m gonna miss Dakota. Do you 
                        think she’ll apply here next year?

                                 INDI
                        I think she’d rather do court 
                        mandated community service than go 
                        to a school without boys. 

                                 GABBY
                        That’s fair. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Ooh! They have “welcome back, 
                        bitches” cupcakes in the dining 
                        hall right now. 

                                 INDI
                        Ooh! I would slit your throat for a 
                        cupcake right now.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mine or hers?

                                 INDI
                        Mmmmm -- 
                             (pretends to think)
                        Neither! Let’s go get some! 

           The Lettuce Hearts Club makes their way across the quad among 
           all the other girls, BFFs once more. 

           Indi looks up and notices a puffy OWL with deep black eyes 
           perched in a tree... 

           SHE FLIPS THE BIRD. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
