           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - TWO BRIDGES, MANHATTAN - DAY

           TITLE: TWO BRIDGES, MANHATTAN

           The sweltering heat of a New York summer. A neighborhood 
           populated by working class families, busy and loud. 

           We focus on an eight story red brick apartment block, KIDS 
           playing in the water of a broken fire hydrant outside. 

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE - GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT 1B - SAME 

           THRU TINTED WINDOW - the kids play, but their laughter does 
           not filter through. Quiet in the bubble of apartment 1B. 

           RUBY, 36, wearing sweats and no makeup, rips the plastic film 
           off a mac n’ cheese dinner. The microwave display reads 
           5:10PM as she drops it inside and it spins around to cook.

           Ruby walks back to sit at her laptop on the kitchen table, 
           her every move smooth and efficient.  

           The living and kitchen space are combined as one. Tastefully 
           decorated but with hardly any ‘stuff’, a handful of books on 
           the shelf, limited kitchenware for solo living. A few FRAMED 
           PHOTOS of Ruby and a MAN, 30s - conspicuous by his absence.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: scrolling through grocery store delivery 
           slots. Lots of times free all day, but Ruby chooses 2AM.

           Suddenly - a KNOCK at the door. Ruby looks to it, uneasy. 

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Hello? It’s Matt, I live across the 
                        hall...?

           INT. CORRIDOR - RUBY’S APARTMENT BLOCK

           MATT, 28, Ruby’s obese neighbor, stands outside her front 
           door holding a GRAY CAT. He talks through the door. 

                                 MATT
                        I’m sorry, I don’t know your name-

                                 RUBY (O.S.)
                        What do you want?

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE - GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT 1B

           Ruby peers through the spy hole in the door. The door is 
           covered in locks - clear she has no intention of opening it.
                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        I found your cat.

                                 RUBY
                        It’s not mine.

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        It’s been out here all day, are you 
                        sure you haven’t lost yours?

           Ruby scowls, annoyed.

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t have a cat. Why do you 
                        think I have a cat?

           INT. CORRIDOR - RUBY’S APARTMENT BLOCK

           Matt hesitates before fumbling his answer - doesn’t want to 
           admit he thought Ruby was a lonely cat lady.

                                 MATT
                        Uh... because... um... 

           A NURSE and his KID appear at the end of the corridor, coming 
           home from work/school. The Nurse unlocks his apartment door, 
           the cat jumps out of Matt’s arms and pads over to them. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Never mind!

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE - GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT 1B

           Ruby TUTS, unimpressed. She heads back to her laptop and hits 
           order on her 2AM grocery delivery slot.

           The microwave PINGS, she retrieves the mac n’ cheese, 
           sprinkles bacon bits on top, grabs a fork from the drawer. 

           She carries her dinner over to a full length storage 
           cupboard, opens the door and steps inside.

           IN THE DARK CUPBOARD - Ruby pushes through winter coats all 
           the way to the back. She presses her thumb on an LED PANEL - 
           it LIGHTS UP GREEN and the cupboard back wall swings open. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby shuts the back wall of the cupboard behind her. She 
           walks down a short flight of stone steps and enters a brick 
           walled basement converted into a secret high tech ops room. 
           A sleek 3 screen computer set up faces a wall of 8 screens, a 
           desk with a gaming chair and a mini-fridge beneath.

           In the corner is an exercise space - weights, a punching bag, 
           a treadmill and a dartboard with knives embedded in it. 

           Ruby collapses into the gaming chair and announces herself.

                        Ruby, gemstone code JL167A. 

           The computer and all the wall screens turn on. 

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: the U.S. Department of Defense LOGO.

           Ruby’s fingers race across the keyboard and - 

           ON WALL SCREENS: a range of LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEEDS pop up in 
           BANGALORE, INDIA. It’s night on the other side of the world.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Ruby pulls up a FILE and DIALS IN to a 
           secure connection. 

           She eats dinner throughout this sequence.

                        OK Ruby, take us through it.

           ON WALL SCREENS: Ruby throws up the FILE. Each piece of 
           evidence pops up as she mentions it - SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE 
           from home, public and private cameras, DRONE FOOTAGE, online 
           transactions, emails, apps, AUDIO from phone conversations...

           A flood of online intel - Ruby has access to everything.

                                 RUBY
                        Evidence packet coming to you now. 
                        Target is a successful Indian 
                        businessman, Mitesh Sura, 58.

                                 RUBY (CONT'D)
                        He owns several textile factories 
                        in downtown Bangalore, making 
                        clothes for American stores. But 
                        the most lucrative part of his 
                        business is the heroin he imports 
                        to the U.S. in his shipments, 
                        hidden amongst the Levi’s and 
                        Forever 21. I hacked into the DEA’s 
                        system, their investigation 
                        estimates that Sura’s shipments are 
                        accountable for 12% of America’s 
                        heroin supply. They’ve been trying 
                        to nail him through official 
                        channels for 3 years, but nothing 
                        sticks. 

           ON WALL SCREENS: various PHOTOS of MITESH SURA, a MAP of his 
           factory locations, CCTV from inside his factories, the DEA 
           investigation paperwork, IMAGES and VIDEO of heroin busts.

                        Sura has a wife, but spends more 
                        time fucking prostitutes than he 
                        does her. Right now, he’s driving 
                        to his favorite Bangalore brothel.

           ON WALL SCREEN: a hacked, LIVE VIDEO STREAM of Sura from his 
           cell phone, mounted to the dash in his Mercedes.

                        Ladies and gentlemen?

           Ruby leans back and waits for it... then waves her hand as if 
           conducting the committee’s responses, a well worn routine.

                                 ALL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE (FROM SPEAKER)

                                 RUBY
                        Commencing operation.

           She hits a computer key, and a phone call begins to RING -

           INT. MERCEDES - BANGALORE, INDIA - NIGHT/SAME

           MITESH SURA, 58, Armani suit, drives through the night. His 
           cell phone mounted to the dash starts to RING. He looks -

           ON CELL SCREEN: the name ARJUN PATEL calling. 

           Sura swipes to answer it. Before he has time to speak -
                                 ARJUN PATEL (FROM PHONE)
                             (in Hindi, panicked)
                        Mitesh, there is a serious problem 
                        at the Old Kasai Road factory - you 
                        need to come now! Fuck! 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: an AUDIO FILE of Arjun’s voice finishes 
           playing. Ruby hits a key to hang up.

           ON WALL SCREEN: Sura’s CELL VIDEO FEED, he swears under his 
           breath and turns the wheel to change course for the factory. 

           Ruby scoops bacon bits onto her fork, talks through food.

                                 RUBY
                        That was the voice of Sura’s right 
                        hand man, Arjun Patel. I cut the 
                        words together from his phone 
                        conversations and online gaming, 
                        then edited for pace and pitch. 
                        He’s too emotional for Warcraft. 

           She chuckles to herself. 

           INSERT CUT: ARJUN PATEL, 25, in his living room playing MMO. 
           He wears a headset, yelling: “fuck!” and “serious problem”.

           INSERT CUT: Ruby in her living room, gaming against Arjun on 
           the other side of the world. Calm as she beats him.

           INSERT CUT: Arjun walks down an Indian street talking on his 
           cell phone, he says the words: “Mitesh” and “Old Kasai Road”.

                        And now, we watch. 

           Ruby types to change all the wall screen video feeds -

           ON WALL SCREENS: exterior and interior CCTV FEEDS of the Old 
           Kasai Road textile factory in Bangalore. Sura’s Mercedes 
           pulls up outside, he gets out and hurries into the factory. 

           INT. OLD KASAI ROAD FACTORY - BANGALORE, INDIA - NIGHT/SAME

           Sura rushes in. The factory is dirty and old, in such a poor 
           state that it’s condemnable. The lights are all on but 
           there’s no one around. 

           He hears a WHISTLING NOISE and follows it, into -
           INT. MACHINE ROOM - OLD KASAI ROAD FACTORY

           A small room full of old machinery and corroded pipes. A 
           VALVE STEAMS and WHISTLES dangerously under immense pressure.  

           Sura sees it - fuck! - and runs to the valve, taking off his 
           jacket as he goes. He uses his jacket to protect his hands as 
           he struggles unsuccessfully to turn the valve off. 

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        I hacked into the public water 
                        processing plant’s computerized 
                        mainframe and increased the flow to 
                        Old Kasai Road for the last hour - 
                        pressure high enough to blow the 
                        factory’s old pipes. I also amended 
                        some of the factory’s deliveries 
                        online to be left in this room.

           BARRELS OF PROPANE GAS line an entire side of the room.

           Sura notices the barrels as Ruby mentions them and his eyes 
           widen, realizing the danger he’s in. The WHISTLE CRESCENDOS 
           as the steam pressure hits critical. 

           Sura sprints for the door - too late. The MACHINERY EXPLODES, 
           the propane barrels triggering a FIREBALL. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           ON WALL SCREENS: the FACTORY SURVEILLANCE FEEDS flicker and 
           cut to black with the explosion, an aerial DRONE FEED shows 
           the entire factory EXPLODE. 

           Ruby finishes the last of her mac n’ cheese. Unfazed and 
           totally chill - a cold blooded assassin, just doing her job.

                                 RUBY
                        Textile factories in Bangalore are 
                        so badly maintained, there’s 
                        virtually no safety laws. Accidents 
                        like this happen all the time. 

                                 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE #2 (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Thank you, Ruby. Elegant and 
                        efficient work, as always-

                                 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE #3 (FROM SPEAKER)
                        A good cover, but I’m curious. If 
                        the target spent so much time with 
                        prostitutes, why didn’t you pick 
                        that scenario for the job? It seems 
                        both obvious and believable-
                                 RUBY
                             (matter of fact)
                        The target’s wife married up from a 
                        lower caste, if he died in disgrace 
                        she would never recover from the 
                        shame in Indian society. Her life 
                        would be over as well as his.

           A beat as the oversight committee absorb this.

                                 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE #1 (FROM SPEAKER)
                        An unusual consideration, but an 
                        assassin who gives a shit is 
                        certainly one they’ll never see 
                        coming. 

           A few chuckles from the committee, but it’s true. Ruby does 
           care. She might be cold blooded, but she’s warm hearted too. 
           Ruby ignores the comment, uninterested in their perspective.

                        Hold on.

           ON WALL SCREENS: an array of minimized feeds are thrown up - 
           the WEST VILLAGE, NEW YORK - just 3 miles away. The man from 
           her photos, SCOTT, makes dinner in a suburban kitchen. VIDEO 
           FEEDS both inside and outside the house and along the street. 

           Ruby smiles fondly, watching Scott shake bacon bits onto his 
           mac n’ cheese, having the same thing as her for dinner. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Mac n’ cheese... what did you have?

           Ruby “Mmms”. She rubs anxiously at her wedding ring, the 
           first time we’ve noticed it. Something on her mind.
                                 RUBY
                        I can see him looking at dating 
                        apps. He hasn’t joined any, but 
                        he’s clearly thinking about-

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Is he safe?

                                 RUBY
                        Of course he is, I’m watching over 
                        him. Any word yet on who put out 
                        the hit?

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        No.

           A serious beat. A big decision. 

                                 RUBY
                        It’s been 6 months. I think it’s 
                        time. He doesn’t know why I left- 

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        And that’s for his own good. He can 
                        never know about your work Ruby, or 
                        that your identity was compromised, 
                        how much danger he was in. 

                                 RUBY
                        He won’t.

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Don’t forget, I let you move from 
                        the CIA to be a home specialist in 
                        the Gemstone Initiative as a favor, 
                        so you could protect him-

                                 RUBY
                        I know. But if I don’t go back soon-

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Be patient. Give it another 3 under 
                        surveillance to be sure it’s safe. 
                        You don’t want to put him - or you - 
                        at risk by going back too early. 

           Ruby stews. Impatient, but his logic is sound. Coming around - 

                                 RUBY
                        I could be home for our first 
                        anniversary...

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        What a great gift that’ll be. 
           Ruby finally acquiesces and changes the subject. 

                                 RUBY
                        What’s for dessert?

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Tiramisu.

                                 RUBY
                             (rolls her head back, yum)
                        Uh. I want that! 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Ruby trains in the exercise corner, working out her 
           frustration to Britney Spears’ WORK BITCH. A mix of boxing, 
           Krav Maga and graceful flexibility - a formidable fighter if 
           she ever left her apartment.

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE - GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT 1B - NIGHT

           Ruby lies on the sofa in her sweatpants, watching TV. 
           Illuminated only by the light from the screen.

           ON TV: a collection of HOME SECURITY CAMERA RECORDINGS of 
           Ruby and Scott in the West Village house together. Ruby 
           paints a nursery room. They have sex in the hallway. In the 
           bathroom, Ruby reads a pregnancy test result - disappointed. 
           Scott holds her from behind.

                                 SCOTT (ON TV)
                        Don’t worry, it’ll happen. We’re 
                        gonna be a little family, trust me. 

           ON TV: his hands run down Ruby’s body, he kisses her neck. 

           On the sofa, Ruby watches the foreplay unfold. Her fingers 
           trail across her neck, copying what Scott’s doing on screen. 
           Remembering his kisses, imagining...

           INSERT FLASHBACK: in the morning light, Ruby and Scott wake 
           up together, teasing each other and kissing in bed.

           On the sofa, Ruby’s fingers trail over her breast, down...

           INSERT FLASHBACK: Scott fucking her in a hot tub. 

           On the sofa, Ruby’s fingers reach her waistband... then stop. 
           She EXHALES. Turns the recording off, done torturing herself. 

           Ruby heads back into the kitchen area and returns with a pint 
           of ice cream. She changes inputs on the TV -
           ON TV: THE BACHELOR or similar starts to play.

           Ruby watches, devours the entire pint through the night.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Still dark, the early hours of the morning. Ruby lies asleep 
           on the sofa, the ice cream pint empty beside her. The sound 
           of THE BACHELOR still plays quietly on TV.

           Suddenly - a loud BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! 

           Ruby’s eyes snap open. She races off the sofa and towards the 
           sound - through the full length cupboard and into -

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           ON WALL SCREENS: all the CCTV feeds in and around Scott’s 
           house are still up. A feed of the backyard FLASHES RED.

           Ruby silences the alarm, her eyes scouring the live streams. 
           After a moment, her gaze stops and widens off - 

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: a masked, armed BURGLAR stalks 
           through the shadows. Hunting for valuables to steal.

           Ruby’s eyes flick up to -

           ON WALL SCREENS: LIVING ROOM FEED: Scott lies fast asleep on 
           the sofa. Oblivious to the danger.

           She types rapidly.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SCOTT’S HOME - WEST VILLAGE, NY - NIGHT

           In darkness, Scott sleeps peacefully on the sofa, hugging a 
           cushion. Suddenly illuminated by the light of the TV as it 
           turns on. The VOLUME RISES RAPIDLY - the sound of a LOCAL 
           NEWS STATION. Scott begins to wake. 

           INT. KITCHEN - SCOTT’S HOME

           The Burglar looks towards the sound, just one room away. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SCOTT'S HOME

           Scott squints at the TV, confused. He reaches out for the 
           remote, turns the TV off and lies back down to sleep.
           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby stares at what Scott just did in disbelief.

                                 RUBY
                        No! 

           Her fingers fast on the computer keys again. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SCOTT'S HOME

           Silence as Scott tries to get back to sleep. Suddenly - the 
           sound of a CAR ALARM from outside. He GROANS and gets up.

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby watches Scott get off the sofa.

                                 RUBY
                        Yes!

           ON WALL SCREENS: LIVING ROOM FEED: Scott pads over to the 
           window and looks outside. EXTERIOR FEED: his car alarm is 
           going off. LIVING ROOM FEED: Scott uses his car keys to turn 
           off the car alarm from inside and heads back to the sofa.

           Ruby clasps her hand over her mouth - this fucking guy. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SCOTT'S HOME

           In the darkness, Scott pads back towards the sofa. He hears a 
           NOISE from the kitchen and stops. On high alert.

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby pales, watching Scott sense the danger. 

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: the Burglar freezes, realizing 
           he’s drawn attention. He pulls a GUN from his waistband. 
           LIVING ROOM FEED: Scott creeps slowly towards the kitchen.  

           Ruby types fast, throws everything she has at the situation -

           EXT. SCOTT'S HOME - WEST VILLAGE, NY

           Suddenly - the ALARMS of every single parked car on the 
           street start going off - LOUD with LIGHTS FLASHING.
           INT. SCOTT'S HOME - WEST VILLAGE, NY

           All the lights in Scott’s home turn on simultaneously. 

           In the living room - Scott stops moving. Someone’s definitely 
           in the house.

           In the kitchen - the Burglar’s eyes snap up at the lights, 
           then over to the back door. His escape, just ten feet away. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby’s eyes fixed to the screens.

                                 RUBY
                             (on breath)
                        Leave... just leave...

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: the Burglar heads for the back 
           door, but knocks over a pan and it CLANGS to the floor. 
           LIVING ROOM FEED: Scott hears it, and runs to the kitchen.

           Ruby watches in horror.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        No! What are you doing?! Don’t be a 
                        hero... fuck! 

           INT. KITCHEN - SCOTT'S HOME

           Scott runs in, sees the Burglar nearing the back door -

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey!

           The Burglar turns to Scott. 

           Scott sees the gun in the Burglar’s hand and immediately 
           RUSHES at him - makes a grab for the gun!

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby stands frozen as she watches her husband grapple with 
           the Burglar. Nothing more she can do. 

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: Scott shoves the Burglar up 
           against a wall and slams his hand against it repeatedly, 
           trying to make him drop the gun.
           INT. KITCHEN - SCOTT'S HOME

           Scott SLAMS the Burglar’s hand against the wall a final time - 
           he drops the gun and it skitters away under the fridge. 

           The Burglar punches Scott in the face and he stumbles back. 

           Scott recovers quickly and charges at the Burglar, TACKLING 
           him backwards over the kitchen table -

           They slide over the table together and hit the floor on the 
           other side with a SICKENING CRACK - the Burglar lands on his 
           neck with Scott’s weight on top of him. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby stares, on tenterhooks.

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: Scott shakes the Burglar - his 
           head lolls unnaturally. Definitely dead. Scott pushes up to 
           his knees and gets his breath back.

           Ruby EXHALES and does the same. Can’t believe what just 
           nearly happened. She types to turn off all the car alarms on 
           the street now that he’s safe. 

           Suddenly, something catches her eye -

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: ANOTHER INTRUDER creeps out 
           from the laundry room behind Scott. The Intruder has a KNIFE.

           All the color drains from Ruby’s face, watching -

           ON WALL SCREENS: KITCHEN FEED: Scott on his knees by the dead 
           Burglar. The Intruder stalks up behind Scott and STABS HIM IN 
           THE BACK. Scott collapses and the Intruder flees.

           Ruby’s hand flies up to her mouth. A brief moment in horror, 
           before she starts typing. A CALL RINGS and is answered -

                                 MALE VOICE (FROM SPEAKER)
                        911, what’s your emergency-

                                 RUBY
                        I need an ambulance, my husband’s 
                        been stabbed!
                             (regains some composure)
                        1040 Barrow Street, request 
                        priority medical assistance, 
                        authorization alpha bravo sugar 6.

           Ruby rushes to leave. She pulls open the mini-fridge under 
           her desk -
           IN FRIDGE: guns, vehicle keys, chocolate and cans of mojito.

           She grabs a handgun and a set of motorbike keys.

                                 MALE VOICE (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Code cleared. ETA ten minutes.

           Ruby runs out. 

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - TWO BRIDGES, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           FOUR YOUTHS hang out on a step, they joke and drink together.

           30 FEET AWAY DOWN THE STREET - Ruby bursts out of her block.

           The Youths spot Ruby and watch - an odd sight, her urgency.

                                 YOUTH #1
                             (to Youth #2)
                        Hey man, she live in your block?

           They watch Ruby rip the cover off a Kawasaki Ninja sport 
           motorbike, climb on and speed away. Strange and intriguing.

           Youth #2 shakes his head, puzzled.

                                 YOUTH #2
                        Never seen her before...

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Ruby rides fast from Two Bridges to the West Village on the 
           other side of Manhattan island. Just three miles away from 
           Scott, but separated by the bustle of 300,000 New Yorkers. 

           She weaves through traffic, passes PEDESTRIANS, surrounded by 
           bright lights and noise - the city that never sleeps. 

           As she zooms down streets, across intersections and through 
           traffic lights, we notice some of the city’s 2000 public CCTV 
           cameras that she rides past. Watching her. 

           Exposed and out in the open for the first time in six months. 

           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SCOTT'S HOME - WEST VILLAGE - SOON AFTER

           Ruby rides fast over the cobblestones of a deserted alley. 

           She stops, dumps the bike and heads through a metal gate to 
           enter the house via the back door, just like the Burglar did.
           INT. KITCHEN - SCOTT'S HOME

           Ruby runs in through the back door, gun in hand. It’s bright - 
           all the lights are still on. 

           She sees the Burglar’s body by the kitchen table, a pool of 
           blood next to it from where Scott collapsed. But no Scott. 

           A bloody trail leads away from the pool - Scott’s dragged 
           himself somewhere else. Ruby follows the trail, through -

           I/E. ENTRANCE - SCOTT'S HOME

           - the living room to the open front door. 

           Scott lies across the threshold. He bleeds out on the front 
           step, the ‘Welcome Home’ mat stained crimson.

           Ruby rushes to Scott, drops to her knees beside him and turns 
           him onto his side.

           Scott’s pale - lost a lot of blood. Borderline conscious. 

                                 RUBY
                        Scott!

           She puts pressure on the knife wound near his spine. There’s 
           so much blood. She looks into his eyes, distraught.

           Scott’s eyes narrow up at Ruby, a confused happiness - is 
           this real... or am I dying?!

           WITH THE INTRUDER

           From behind a fence in the front yard, the Intruder watches 
           Scott and Ruby on the front step. Just 20 feet away.

           The bloody knife in his hand gleams, catching the light of a 
           street lamp. He stealths along the fence, towards Ruby and 
           Scott, when suddenly -

           An AMBULANCE WAILS down the street, lights flashing, speeding 
           towards Scott’s house. 

           The Intruder turns and runs away.

           BACK WITH RUBY

           As Scott passes out. She shakes him, desperate.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Scott! Scott! Come back to me, I’m 
                        here, I’m here...
           TWO PARAMEDICS hurry out of the ambulance and rush up to the 
           front step with their medical kit.

           Ruby pushes herself back against the front door, covered in 
           blood as she watches the Paramedics work.

           RUBY’S POV: in shock, all sound is MUFFLED. They take Scott’s 
           vitals. “Sir, sir can you hear me?” “He’s crashing”. They 
           inject him with something. Pull a gurney from the ambulance.

           The Paramedics haul Scott onto the gurney and whisk him away 
           towards the ambulance. As they move -

                                 LEAD PARAMEDIC
                        Looks like a stab wound, put a call 
                        in to NYPD en route.

                                 JUNIOR PARAMEDIC
                        Copy that.

           This shakes Ruby out of it. She needs to go. She slips in her 
           husband’s blood as she rises and heads back inside.

           INT. KITCHEN - SCOTT'S HOME

           Ruby beelines for the dead Burglar and frisks through his 
           clothes. All he has is a CELL PHONE. She takes it and leaves. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - RUBY’S APARTMENT BLOCK

           The gray cat paws at grocery bags that have been left outside 
           Ruby’s front door. The 2AM delivery slot she ordered earlier.  

           Ruby lets herself into her apartment, not noticing either. 

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE - GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT 1B

           Ruby stands just inside the open door, shellshocked.

           The gray cat winds itself around Ruby’s ankles, rubbing her. 

           Ruby looks down, coming to her senses off the cat. Realizing 
           with horror that she’s left the door wide open. She quickly 
           picks up the cat and dumps it outside. Drags the groceries 
           into her apartment, SLAMS the door and secures all the locks. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM - SOON AFTER

           ON WALL SCREENS: a range of CCTV FEEDS inside and outside 
           MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL pop up, including the ambulance bay.
           Ruby sits and watches, pale-faced.

           ON WALL SCREENS: Scott’s ambulance WAILS into the bay. The 
           Paramedics hurry out - wheel Scott’s gurney into the ER - met 
           by NURSES and a DOCTOR. The Paramedics hand him off. 

           Ruby watches them talk on the silent feeds. We punch in on 
           their lips and SUBTITLE their speech ON SCREEN, understanding 
           what Ruby does as she lipreads. 

           ON WALL SCREENS: Lead Paramedic: “Stab wound, looks pretty 
           deep. Two units of O neg en route, still crashing”. They 
           bustle to stabilize him. 

           Ruby’s bottom lip wobbles. The life of the man she loves 
           hanging by a thread. 

           She pulls the dead Burglar’s cell phone from her pocket and 
           connects it with a cable to a black box on her desk. 

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: an algorithm runs, hacking into and 
           decrypting the cell phone. The phone’s call list and text 
           messages appear on screen. 

           Just one result - a text message.

           TEXT MESSAGE: her husband’s address, sent from an UNKNOWN 
           NUMBER. The text has gone to a group of two, this phone and 
           one other number - the Intruder who got away.

           A true burner phone. Ruby types fast and brings up -

           ON WALL SCREENS: a GLOBAL GPS MAP. The Intruder’s cell phone 
           number is in a search box, the map triangulates the phone’s 
           location. Zeroes in on America, East Coast, Manhattan, 
           finally stops on Koreatown. On the other wall screens - feeds 
           from all the PUBLIC SECURITY CAMERAS in that area pop up.

           Ruby’s eyes scan them urgently, until she spots -

           ON WALL SCREENS: an EXTERIOR FEED - the Intruder walks across 
           a bright surface parking lot. No longer masked - white, 20s. 

           On another wall screen, Ruby plays back the RECORDING of the 
           Intruder stabbing Scott in the kitchen and compares them - 
           same clothes, same body movement - definitely him.

                                 RUBY
                        Got you.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Ruby types a message to the Intruder’s 
           phone, masquerading as the same UNKNOWN NUMBER that sent 
           Scott’s address. It reads: ROCKEFELLER BUILDING, 10TH FLOOR.
           EXT. SURFACE PARKING LOT - KOREATOWN - NIGHT

           The Intruder’s cell phone BEEPS in his jacket pocket. He 
           pulls out his phone, stops walking and reads the message -

           ON CELL SCREEN: under the text with Scott’s address, another 
           text from the same number: ROCKEFELLER BUILDING, 10TH FLOOR.

           No reason not to trust it. He pockets his phone, keeps on 
           walking then stops, realizing. He turns around, to see -

           200 YARDS AWAY - the Rockefeller Building stands like a 
           monolith against the bright New York night. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           Ruby leans back in her chair with her eyes fixed to the 
           screens. Hands to her face, anxious.

           ON WALL SCREENS: half of the screens focus on FEEDS of the 
           Intruder and his movements towards Rockefeller. The other 
           half focus on the hospital, what’s happening with Scott. 

           Ruby lipreads the hospital staff, their words SUBTITLED ON 
           SCREEN for us again.

           ON WALL SCREENS: in the ER, Scott is now shirtless and 
           covered in tubes. DOCTOR: “He’s stable, let’s get him up to 
           surgery”. STAFF wheel him away, leaving behind an exhausted 
           NURSE and a YOUNG TRAINEE. TRAINEE: “What are his chances?” 
           NURSE: “I’ve seen worse recover, and better die. 50/50”.

           Ruby INHALES SHARPLY, living a nightmare. She leans forward, 
           minimizes the hospital feeds and turns her attention back to 
           the Intruder. She types fast.

           INT. LOBBY - ROCKEFELLER BUILDING - NIGHT

           CLOSE on the brass elevator wall panel as the Intruder hits 
           the UP button. 

           He steps back and waits. Five elevator doors in front of him. 
           He glances around, definitely alone. Checks his watch: 
           4:14AM. No wonder.

           An elevator to his far left BINGS and the door opens. He 
           heads over, doesn’t pay attention to the sign outside -

           SIGN: a PHOTO of Manhattan’s stunning skyline, along with the 
           text: TOP OF THE ROCK OBSERVATION DECK - 67 FLOORS IN UNDER 
           50 SECONDS! 9AM - 9PM.
           INT. TOP OF THE ROCK ELEVATOR, ROCKEFELLER BUILDING

           The Intruder hits the button for the 10th floor and the doors 
           close. The elevator ascends, triggering a COLORFUL LIGHTS AND 
           EFFECTS SHOW on all the elevator walls and ceiling:

           The metal framework of the elevator shaft zooms past, a 
           starry night sky above - as if the elevator itself is 
           transparent. Image overlays of American history swoop across 
           the walls - the moon landing and Obama’s inauguration. 

           The elevator comes to a stop and the show ends.  

           The Intruder steps up to the door, expecting it to open. It 
           stays closed. He looks at the button panel - floor 9 lit up.

           He hits 10. Nothing. He pushes it repeatedly - still nothing.

                                 INTRUDER
                             (on breath)
                        Fuck sake...

           He hits the HELP button. It RINGS. After a moment -

                                 HELP VOICE/RUBY (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Hello, how may I help you?

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           ON WALL SCREENS: a CCTV FEED of the Intruder in the elevator. 

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Ruby has remote access to the Rockefeller 
           building’s entire security and elevator system. A GRAPHIC 
           shows the elevator stuck on floor 9 out of 67.

           Ruby seethes at the Intruder on screen as they chat. Hides 
           the anger in her voice from the man who stabbed her husband.  

                                 INTRUDER (FROM SPEAKER)
                        I’m stuck on the ninth floor.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll get 
                        someone out right away. How many 
                        people are in the elevator?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                                 INTRUDER
                        Just me.

                                 RUBY
                        And what’s your name?
                                 INTRUDER
                        Karl. Karl Hudson.

                                 RUBY
                        OK Karl, is there a family member 
                        you’d like me to call, let them 
                        know where you are?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        No. Just get me out of here.

                                 RUBY
                        Anyone who’s expecting you that I 
                        should tell?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        No.

                                 RUBY
                        Are you sure about that?

           Karl takes pause. Starting to realize... there’s something 
           not right about this. Something in her voice. 

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        What’s your name? 

                                 RUBY
                        Ruby.

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                             (dawning on him)
                        Ruby...

           Ruby watches his reaction - clear he knows her name, who she 
           is. Not just a burglary gone wrong after all.

           Karl rushes to pull out his cell phone.

                                 RUBY
                        Don’t waste your time, I jammed it 
                        already.

           He mouths “fuck” and looks all around for a camera. Finds it. 

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        Let me out of here, right fucking 
                        now bitch-

           Ruby shuts her eyes, blinks them open wide and hits a key.

           IN THE ELEVATOR - it suddenly ascends 10 floors at high 
           speed, complete with light show. Karl grabs a handrail and 
           looks around, fearful. 
           The elevator stops abruptly and he JOLTS to keep his footing, 
           before it reverses and descends 10 FLOORS FAST, halting so 
           suddenly that Karl SLAMS into the floor with the force - 
           blood spatters from his mouth, his lip busted. 

           Ruby watches Karl struggle up to his feet on screen.

                                 RUBY
                        What were you doing in my house?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        Fuck you-

           She hits a key.

           Karl braces himself as the elevator zooms up again at speed. 
           The light show plays - girders whizzing past fast to meet the 
           sky. Even without acrophobia it’d be enough to make you sick.

           ON BUTTON PANEL: floor numbers light up briefly as the 
           elevator speeds past them - from 9 up to 40. It stops 
           suddenly, then reverses fast down to 20 and brakes hard -

           Karl SLAMS into the floor again, YELLS OUT in agony and 
           grasps his elbow. A brutal torture, each elevator ride the 
           equivalent of being in a car crash.

                                 RUBY
                        Stop wasting my time. Why did you 
                        attack my husband? 

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        I don’t give a fuck about him-

           The elevator speeds up again. On the button panel it reaches 
           floor 60 - getting higher and higher each time - stops, then 
           reverses back down fast. 

           It descends at such speed that Karl rises a little off the 
           ground - experiencing weightlessness. The elevator hits 45 -

           CLOSE on Karl’s face as it MASHES into the floor on impact - 
           blood spurts from his mouth along with a tooth. This is only 
           going to get messier. He struggles up to his knees.

                                 RUBY
                        Let’s not be rude about my husband, 
                        shall we? Now answer the question-

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                             (breathless)
                        It’s not about him, it’s about you! 
                        We attacked him to flush you out. 
                        Someone wants you dead.
           Ruby reels. 

                                 RUBY
                        Who?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        I don’t know.
                             (rushes, sensing her about 
                              to torture him again)
                        I don’t know, I promise! I don’t... 

           Ruby watches him on screen. Decides he’s telling the truth.

                                 RUBY
                        How were you paid?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        It’s all online, on account-

                                 RUBY
                        Give me your account number.

           He hesitates. Ruby tilts her head.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Give me your account number, or 
                        I’ll kill you. 

           Karl grits his teeth and gives it up.

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        782 865 487, Caymans.

           Ruby types fast. 

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Karl’s banking information pops up. She 
           scrolls through the transactions.

                                 RUBY
                        How much?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        Ten grand. That’s all you’re worth.

           He spits blood out onto the elevator floor, defiant.

           Ruby’s focus remains on screen as she finds the transaction. 

                                 RUBY
                             (matter of fact)
                        Actually it’s what you’re worth - I 
                        mean look where you are right now. 
                        You’re seriously overpriced. 
           Karl fumes - fuck this bitch.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: the 10k transaction and the bank account 
           it came from - nameless, empty. A search runs, from this 
           account to another account to another account - hunting 
           through all the ghost accounts to try and find the source.

           Ruby sits quietly, watching it run.

           In the elevator - Karl looks around, unnerved.

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        So, are you gonna let me go?

           Ruby reaches out and hits a key on her computer.

           In the elevator - bland ELEVATOR MUSIC starts to play. Karl’s 
           expression drops - she’s basically put him on hold. 

           At her desk, Ruby leans forward - found something.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: finally, a bank account with a name: WOLF 
           FORCE SECURITY. She googles it quickly, a webpage appears for 
           Wolf Force Security - a private security firm. She searches 
           through the webpages, finds the owner’s name - BRETT ASHER.

           She hits a key to cut off the elevator music.

                                 RUBY
                        Karl, do you work for Wolf Force 
                        Security?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                             (confused)
                        No.

                                 RUBY
                        Ever heard of them?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        No! 

                                 RUBY
                        How about a Brett Asher, do you 
                        know him?

                                 INTRUDER/KARL
                        No, I’ve never heard of him. All I 
                        got was the money and the address, 
                        that’s it, that’s everything! 

           Ruby stares at Karl on the wall screen, appraises him. 
           Decides he’s telling the truth.
           Karl clutches his broken elbow painfully. Blood drips from 
           his mouth. He leans against the elevator wall. 

                                 INTRUDER/KARL (CONT’D)
                        That’s all I know. Please... let me 
                        out... are you, gonna let me go?

           Ruby “pffts”, almost laughs.  

                                 RUBY
                        Karl, did you forget you stabbed my 
                        husband?!

           She hits a computer key -

           Karl GASPS as the elevator suddenly DROPS FAST. His feet lift 
           off the ground with the speed of the descent, he holds tight 
           to the handrail and watches the button panel in dread -

           ON BUTTON PANEL: from 45, descending at such speed that the 
           floor lights barely blink as he passes them - not stopping.

           INT. BASEMENT - ROCKEFELLER BUILDING 

           Concrete walls, basic security lighting outside the bank of 
           elevator doors. Quiet... a FAST WHIRRING, getting LOUDER - 

           SMASH! An elevator door EXPLODES OUTWARDS as the elevator 
           with Karl inside CRUSHES into ground level. A high impact 
           fall from the 45th floor - no way he survived.  

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           ON WALL SCREENS: all the Rockefeller Building feeds are 
           wiped, replaced by the Mount Sinai hospital feeds again. 

           Ruby works fast. Dispassionate, got what she needed. She hits 
           a key to make a call, it RINGS ONCE and is answered -

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Ruby?!-

                                 RUBY
                        Mellor you were right - I’m still 
                        compromised. Scott was attacked 
                        tonight, but they were after me-

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Is he alright? Are you OK?

           Ruby winces, having to make it real by saying it out loud.
                                 RUBY
                        He’s at Mount Sinai, in surgery. 
                        And no, I’m not OK, but I’m safe.

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER)
                             (urgent)
                        Ruby, two other Gemstones were 
                        killed tonight. It’s not just you 
                        who’s in danger - it looks like 
                        someone’s coming after you all. 

           Ruby’s expression slackens - fuck. 

                                 MELLOR (FROM SPEAKER) (CONT’D)
                        I just hired a new Gemstone - Jade - 
                        not in the system yet. I’ll assign 
                        her to keep watch over Scott at the 
                        hospital but Ruby, you need to find 
                        out who’s behind this and fast-

                                 RUBY
                        I already found the money trail. 
                        Payment came from a private 
                        security firm called-

           Suddenly - all the POWER GOES OUT IN THE BASEMENT. 

           Ruby freezes in the darkness.

           The SOUND of a generator and a second later, all the POWER 
           COMES BACK UP. 

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - TWO BRIDGES, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           ON TABLET SCREEN: STILL IMAGES of Ruby’s motorbike speeding 
           through the city, zoomed-in shots of the license plate.

           The tablet lowers, to REVEAL Ruby’s motorbike by the curb. 

           A HEAVILY ARMED FIVE MAN TEAM led by KAI, 28, Chinese 
           American, stealth towards Ruby’s apartment block. They wear 
           masks, night vision goggles and earpieces - elite pros.

           All the lights are out in Ruby’s block - except for Ruby’s 
           apartment. Conspicuous with its emergency back up power.

           The plan to flush her out in the open has worked. 

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           In the stillness, Ruby rises. Picks up her gun from the desk. 
           She opens a desk drawer and retrieves a pair of HIGH TECH 
           LOOKING AVIATOR GLASSES. She puts them on and moves quickly 
           and quietly back into her apartment. 

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE

           Ruby emerges from the full length cupboard into her 
           apartment. She flicks off all the lights. 

           She pushes a button on the side of her aviator glasses -

           GLASSES VIEW: the apartment is in green-tinged NIGHT VISION. 
           We look to the front door - all the locks still safely on. 

           Ruby treads silently over to the tinted front window, where 
           we watched the kids playing in the broken fire hydrant 
           earlier. She stops close to the window and watches -

           GLASSES VIEW: THRU WINDOW - Kai, armed and masked, on the 
           other side, examining the window and the frame.

           EXT. WINDOW, RUBY’S APARTMENT

           Kai is reflected in the window as he studies it - it’s tinted 
           glass so he can’t see in, only Ruby can see out. Suddenly he 
           freezes, sensing her on the other side.

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING SPACE

           In the darkness, Ruby watches Kai through the window, 
           curious. Her gun down by her side. 

           THRU WINDOW - Kai takes a step back. Stands still. Then in a 
           flash he raises his gun and SHOOTS at the window!

           Ruby doesn’t even flinch. The round PUNCHES an imprint on the 
           glass, but nothing more. Bulletproof. She watches -

           THRU WINDOW - Kai’s lips move, giving an instruction. Not 
           subtitled for us, but a second later -

           Behind Ruby, an entire section of the wall next to the front 
           door EXPLODES in a cloud of plaster and dust!

           Ruby jolts and SPRINTS for the cupboard door as LASER SIGHTS 
           search for her in the dust cloud. She races through -

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           - and down the steps. 
           Ruby grabs a black backpack from under her desk and swings it 
           onto her shoulders as she darts to the exercise space. 

           She hauls up a hatch in the floor and descends -

           INT. ABANDONED SEWER TUNNELS

           - a few rungs down a ladder into darkness, pulling the hatch 
           closed and twisting to lock it behind her, just as -

           INT. BASEMENT TECH OPS ROOM

           - a GRENADE rolls across the tech room floor towards the 
           hatch. The hatch closes a second before the grenade hits and - 

           INT. ABANDONED SEWER TUNNELS

           - EXPLODES, caving in the locked hatch and destroying it as 
           Ruby drops from the ladder, SPLASHES down into the tunnel 10 
           feet below and runs. 

           [NOTE: In this sequence, we switch between the very dim light 
           in the tunnels and Ruby’s night vision through her aviators.]

           Ruby flees through the secret, real-life labyrinthine tunnels 
           beneath Manhattan. New York’s manmade underground runs as 
           deep as the Chrysler building is tall - layers of thousands 
           of interconnected pipes, sewers and subways - a haphazard 
           catacomb of abandoned infrastructure going back 100 years. 

           Ruby’s RACING FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the tunnels. Soon chased by 
           LASER SIGHTS in the darkness. 

           SHOTS FIRE at Ruby, embed in the walls as they just miss her.

           20 FEET BACK - the last of the five man team drops down into 
           the tunnel. They hustle after Ruby. 

           GLASSES VIEW: jolting with the sprint - a FLUORESCENT MARKER 
           daubed on the wall up ahead.

           Ruby runs to it. There’s a ladder just above the marker - a 
           trail she has left for herself. As she starts climbing up she 
           PUNCHES a small black box fixed to the wall beside it -

           CLOSE on the BLACK BOX as a RED LED TIMER lights up and 
           starts counting down from 20 SECONDS - an EXPLOSIVE.

           HIGH ANGLE on Ruby as she climbs up the ladder towards us. 
           She reaches the top as MERC #1 reaches the base and FIRES, 
           just missing her as she pulls herself into the next tunnel. 
           The five Mercs rush up the ladder to follow Ruby. 

           CLOSE on the black box on the wall, the timer counting down 
           9, 8, 7... as beside it, the Mercs rush to climb up the 
           ladder. Two, three, four of them make it up safely as 3, 2, 1 
           - the charge EXPLODES -

           MERC #5 is BLOWN BACK off the ladder - the ladder and 
           surrounding wall COLLAPSE onto him in the darkness as he 
           YELLS OUT, caught in the blast.

           Now they are a four man team.

           INT. VARIOUS ABANDONED ACCESS TUNNELS

           Ruby runs. 

           There is no let up, barely time for her to breathe. 

           The four Mercs are close on her tail, sometimes just a hair’s 
           breadth away. A frenetic chase in the darkness, red laser 
           sights relentlessly hunting her down. 

           QUICK CUTS - Ruby follows her fluorescent markers, darting 
           left and right through the labyrinth. She races up and down 
           ladders between Depression-era access tunnels, hitting the 
           ladder charges each time to try and escape her pursuers.

           THREE MORE EXPLOSIONS from Ruby’s ladder charges are peppered 
           with GUNFIRE from the Mercs in between. The Mercs hurry 
           faster, becoming fraught on the ladders - no choice but to 
           follow Ruby’s booby-trapped trail or risk losing her. 

           TWO MERCS are caught in the ladder blasts - leaving just Kai 
           and Merc #1 chasing Ruby down. Merc #1 shoots -

           INT. ABANDONED SPIRAL SERVICE STAIRCASE

           - and CLIPS Ruby in the arm as she ducks through a doorway, 
           YELPING at the hit. The doorway opens to the top of an 
           abandoned 100 year old spiral staircase, she races down.

           The stairs wind so tightly that Ruby slides her shoulder 
           against the wall as she descends.

           Her wet shoes slipping on the metal steps.

           INT. ABANDONED SERVICE TUNNEL

           Ruby bounds off the last step and out into a service tunnel.
           She takes a hard left, swinging down to descend a ladder that 
           leads to a tunnel below. She hits the black box on the wall - 

           CLOSE on black box - the LED countdown stays blank. Broken. 

           Ruby curses under her breath and hurries down the ladder.

           INT. DRAINAGE PIPE

           Ruby emerges from the ladder into the drainage pipe below. 
           She bends over to run, the pipe just 5 feet in diameter. Her 
           fingers trailing the wet curved brickwork.

           GLASSES VIEW: up ahead, a fluorescent marker at the base of 
           an offshoot pipe that leads upwards.

           Ruby reaches it, braces herself against the inside bricks on 
           both sides of the steep pipe and hauls herself up. 

           INT. STEEP PIPE

           The pipe is a dark and claustrophobic two feet across. Ruby 
           struggles to accommodate her backpack in the tight space, 
           reaches up and grabs a depression in the brickwork - crude 
           handholds she’s made in the pipe. 

           Suddenly - a hand reaches in behind her, grabs her backpack 
           and hauls Ruby backwards! 

           INT. DRAINAGE PIPE

           Ruby lands hard in the low water of the pipe she just came 
           from. Merc #1 stands over her, reaching for his gun.

           On the ground - Ruby KICKS UP, blocking him from getting it. 

           She rises and they fight - hand to hand, close quarters in 
           the 5ft across space - Ruby bends a bit but the Merc has to 
           bend a lot to fight. Fast, tactical hits landed by both pros. 

           Their feet slip and slide in the low water, Ruby maneuvers 
           around the Merc as they fight to get around to the exit pipe.

           With her back to the exit pipe, she hears Kai’s footsteps OS 
           splashing towards them. Soon it’ll be two against one - she 
           needs to get out of here fast. 

           Ruby reaches back, braces her forearms inside the steep pipe 
           and KICKS OUT WITH BOTH FEET - hitting the Merc square in the 
           chest - kicking him hard into the wall opposite and LAUNCHING 
           HERSELF BACKWARDS into the steep pipe at the same time. 
           INT. STEEP PIPE

           Ruby braces her elbows across the brickwork and fights the 
           Merc with her feet - KICKING and STOMPING, with every force 
           she shunts herself further up the pipe to freedom.

           She looks up - the pipe exit just 5 feet above her. 

           Merc #1 leans inside the pipe with his gun, but Ruby kicks 
           out and SLAMS his wrist into the bricks, making him drop it. 

           She turns and tries to drag herself up to the exit, but the 
           Merc grabs her backpack again, YANKS her back a few feet.

           Ruby’s NAILS DRAG painfully down the brickwork. 

           She spins back, shrugging off her backpack to get free. 

           INT. DRAINAGE PIPE

           Ruby’s backpack splashes down into the pipe below. The Merc’s 
           torso is out of view, up inside the pipe as Kai reaches him. 

           INT. STEEP PIPE

           Ruby braces her knee against the Merc’s shoulder as he 
           scrambles to get into the pipe - almost on top of her.

           Ruby lets him come closer. In the two feet across space, she 
           wraps her legs around the Merc’s neck and TWISTS SHARPLY -

           CRACK! Ruby snaps his neck to an impossible angle. His body 
           falls limp in the grip of her legs. 

           She releases him and STOMPS down on his body, wedging him 
           inside the pipe. She drags herself up and out -

           INT. ABANDONED CITY HALL SUBWAY STATION

           - onto the curved platform of the abandoned, century old city 
           hall station, directly below city hall. In the dim light - 

           Broken brass chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings, 
           Spanish Guastavino tile arches all along the platform. A 
           pinnacle of Romanesque revival architecture and one of the 
           most beautiful abandoned railway stations in the world. 

           Ruby hurries to her feet. Blood drips down her arm from where 
           the bullet clipped her.
           INT. DRAINAGE PIPE

           Kai tugs hard at the Merc’s body, splashing it down into the 
           water. He climbs quickly into the steep pipe after Ruby. 

           INT. ABANDONED CITY HALL SUBWAY STATION

           Ruby gets a few feet down the platform before she stops - 
           turns off the sound of Kai climbing up the pipe after her. 

           She rushes back and quickly flattens herself against the wall 
           beside the pipe. As Kai emerges -

           Ruby PUNCHES down hard at the base of his neck - sending Kai 
           face first to the floor. 

           Kai has a gun in his hand - she STAMPS down on his hand then 
           twists her foot, sending the gun SPINNING AWAY, out across 
           the platform and down onto the inactive track.

           Kai rises quickly and BODY SLAMS Ruby against the wall. 

           They fight each other, unarmed, on the curved platform. Both 
           elite and trained, but Kai is well-practiced - Ruby is rusty, 
           rushing up to speed against him.

           Lightning fast hand to hand and foot to foot, Ruby’s style is 
           graceful - but Kai’s is even more so, almost balletic. He 
           jump spin kicks her in the face, SMASHING off her aviators.

           Suddenly - a WINDY RUMBLE starts up - a train approaching. It 
           gets LOUDER, the wind WHIPPING along the platform, tearing at 
           their clothes and their hair as they fight, until - 

           20 FEET AWAY at the end of the platform - a subway train 
           speeds past. It’s the downtown 6 - an open active track 
           running perpendicular to the abandoned city hall station.

           Up on the platform, white light from the passing train’s 
           windows illuminates the fight like a strobe, making mirror 
           balls of the broken chandeliers above them. 

           Their fight like a beautiful flick book, caught in a gale.

           Ruby blocks Kai’s kicks, each one forcing her back towards 
           the platform edge. He finally lands a KICK to Ruby’s chest 
           and she FLIES BACK into the air with force, PLUMMETS - 

           - to land hard on the inactive train tracks below. 

           Ruby CRIES OUT in pain as her spine hits the metal bars, RATS 
           as big as rabbits scatter on her impact. 
           Kai stands on the platform edge. He smirks down at Ruby on 
           the tracks, watching her turn painfully onto her stomach.

           DOWN ON THE TRACKS - Ruby’s eye catches the gun she kicked 
           out of Kai’s hand earlier. Just 5 feet away in the gravel.

           She scrambles for it. 

           UP ON THE PLATFORM - Kai sees Ruby going for the gun. He 
           backs away quickly, just moments before - 

           DOWN ON THE TRACKS - Ruby grabs the gun, spins onto her back 
           and FIRES up at Kai - 

           UP ON THE PLATFORM - Kai ducks away to the recesses just in 
           time. Ruby’s SHOTS ECHO, SMASHING into the tiles. 

           The downtown 6 finally finishes passing, plunging them back 
           into dim light. The train brakes SQUEAL and the CLACKS SLOW 
           OS, the 6 coming to a stop further down the active line.

           Ruby rises fast, breathing hard, and levels the gun up at the 
           platform - but Kai is nowhere to be seen. 

           She runs to the end of the inactive line and turns hard left - 

           INT. ACTIVE TRAIN TUNNEL/BROOKLYN BRIDGE PLATFORM

           - into the active train tunnel and after the 6.

           50 FEET AHEAD - the 6 is stopped at the Brooklyn Bridge 
           platform. On the tracks running in the opposite direction - 
           the HEADLIGHTS of an oncoming train, heading Ruby’s way. 

           Up on the platforms - just a handful of PEOPLE, shift workers 
           and the homeless. None of whom care less, as -

           Ruby leaps across the tracks and up onto the other side.

           INT. ABANDONED CITY HALL SUBWAY STATION

           Kai slides off the platform and sprints down the inactive 
           tracks after Ruby. He reaches the end of the line, skids on 
           the gravel as he stops quickly - 

           A train RUSHES PAST on the active line, heading the opposite 
           direction to the 6. He watches, as -

           THRU TRAIN WINDOW - Ruby leans against a train pole in an 
           empty car, getting away. 
           INT. RABIN’S DINER - LOWER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN - 6AM

           RUTH RABIN, late 70s, bustles behind the counter. This is her 
           place, and it looks very much like the famous Katz’s Deli - 
           classic, Jewish, no-nonsense charm. 

           A FEW GROUPS and PEOPLE at tables, just starting to get busy.

           Ruth turns away from the counter and yells to the kitchen -

                                 RUTH
                        We get the bread delivery yet? 
                        We’re nearly out of sourdough-

           Her grandson, DAVID, 17, sticks his head through the doorway.

                                 DAVID
                        Not yet Safta, I’ll call ‘em! 

           He disappears back into the kitchen. Ruth senses someone take 
           a seat at the counter behind her and turns - her expression 
           falls in recognition.

           Ruby sits across the counter. 

           She has a split lip, a graze on her face and the obvious 
           bulge of an arm bandage under her shirt from where the bullet 
           clipped her in the tunnels. She looks exhausted. 

           For a moment, neither of them says a word. Ruth picks up a 
           coffee pot, pours black coffee into a plain white mug and 
           places it on the counter in front of Ruby. 

           Ruby picks it up. Then looks Ruth directly in the eye -

                                 RUBY
                        I’d like to order off menu please.

           CLOSE on a folded piece of paper as Ruby slides it across the 
           counter towards Ruth.

           Ruth holds eye contact with Ruby. Doesn’t touch the paper.

                                 RUTH
                        How are you expecting to pay?

           Ruby places a black, faceless credit card down on top of 
           piece of the paper. Ruth keeps her eyes on Ruby, shouts back -

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna need a ‘to go’ bag!

           Ruth slides the paper and credit card off the counter.
                                 RUBY
                        Can I get a booth first?

           Ruth appraises Ruby as David reappears. She hands him the 
           paper and the credit card. David takes it with a fleeting 
           glance at Ruby, knows what this means. Ruth leans in to him -

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll have a cream cheese bagel and 
                        a bloody Mary-
                             (glances at Ruby)
                        Two bloody Marys-

                                 RUBY
                        And a Reuben, hold the sauerkraut.

                                 RUTH
                             (to David)
                        Bring it up to the booth.

           David nods obediently and rushes off. 

           INT. STAIRS - RABIN’S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby follows Ruth up the wooden stairs. Ruth grabs the 
           banister for support, slow going at her age. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS - RABIN’S DINER

           Ruth leads Ruby upstairs into an empty restaurant space, more 
           seating for overspill from downstairs. 

           She shuffles over to a nondescript door, unlocks it WITH HER 
           THUMBPRINT and they head inside.

           INT. BOOTH - RABIN'S DINER

           A small room consisting of a single booth. The walls right up 
           against the backs of the two red plastic benches that sit on 
           either side of a bolted down table.

           Ruby and Ruth slide onto the benches and sit opposite each 
           other. As the door closes behind them and LOCKS LOUDLY -

           The light in the booth BRIGHTENS as the room SEALS. We notice 
           now that the walls are soundproofed - a clandestine box for 
           secret purposes. Ruby’s injuries look worse in this light. 

           Alone together, Ruth’s tone shifts to that of a no-nonsense 
           grandmother, caring but often too tough with the truth.
                                 RUTH
                        What happened to you?

                                 RUBY
                        My place is burned - both the 
                        apartment and the house. Someone’s 
                        going after the Gemstones. I need 
                        to find out who.

           Ruth glances at Ruby’s wedding ring, a fleck of blood on it.

                                 RUTH
                        How’s Scott?

                                 RUBY
                        Alive. 

           Ruth gives a small sigh of relief. She leans back as the door 
           opens and the room lights dim back down. 

           David enters carrying a tray with their bloody Marys, food 
           and Ruby’s credit card, along with a black backpack that 
           looks identical to the one she lost in the tunnel.

                                 RUTH & RUBY
                        Thank you, David / Thanks.

           He gives a polite smile and nod, then leaves. The room LOCKS 
           LOUDLY and the light brightens again. 

           Ruby ignores the tray and starts to unpack the backpack. 

           Ruth bites into her cream cheese bagel and watches her work.

           Ruby pulls out a state of the art laptop, a tablet, cell 
           phone, a handgun with clips and magazines and two ziploc bags 
           full of data sticks and SD cards - an entire new tech set up. 

           And now we get it - imagine if James Bond’s Q was Ruth Bader 
           Ginsberg - that’s who Ruth is. She talks Ruby through it.

                                 RUTH
                             (points at ziplocs)
                        You got your usual plug n’ plays - 
                        black ops algorithms to hack into 
                        all the private and government 
                        servers you might need - police, 
                        aviation, security systems, 
                        hospitals, banks etc. And those are 
                        your bugs, malware to infect and 
                        disable your opponent’s tech. 
                        Couple of updates from your last 
                        kit, but it’ll all be familiar. 
           Ruby opens the laptop. She digs into one of the ziplocs, 
           pulls out a data stick and plugs it in.

           ON LAPTOP: a rush of code from the data stick. Ruby’s 
           fingertips quick across the keys. We glimpse the words: MOUNT 
           SINAI HOSPITAL before the screen fills with CCTV FEEDS. 

           Ruth sips her bloody Mary then crunches on the celery stick, 
           watching Ruby. Can’t see the laptop screen but it’s obvious 
           what she’s doing.

           ON LAPTOP: Scott’s name searches through the hospital 
           database, brings up his MEDICAL FILE and his ROOM’S CCTV FEED 
           - Scott lies in bed, unconscious and covered in tubes. In the 
           corner, a woman, late 20s, sits facing the door. This is 
           JADE, the new recruit Mellor assigned to protect Scott.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        How’s he doing?

                                 RUBY
                             (reads off screen)
                        Surgery went well, but they put him 
                        in an induced coma to recover. Just 
                        waiting now, to see if he pulls 
                        through...

           Ruby rubs her face with her hands. It’s been a hell of a 
           night. She grabs her bloody Mary and drinks half of it.

                                 RUTH
                        And what if he doesn’t.

                                 RUBY
                        He will.

           Ruby digs into the Reuben. Makes a face and starts to 
           deconstruct the sandwich, pulling out the sauerkraut. 

                                 RUTH
                        And then what? You stay in the 
                        game, he’ll always be in danger. 
                        Took me 20 years at DARPA to figure 
                        out I needed more than this.  

           She gestures at the tech with her celery stick. 

           Ruby glances up, her mouth too full of Reuben to talk, so 
           Ruth keeps going, qualifying what she’s just said.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        At my age, I’m happy to freelance, 
                        keep you good guys fighting the 
                        good fight-
                                 RUBY
                             (chewing)
                        Ruth, you should see the kids 
                        working there now. You were always 
                        too good to let go- 

                                 RUTH
                        But a trail of dead bad people is 
                        not what you want to leave behind. 
                        I built this place when I started 
                        my family - this is my legacy - for 
                        them. You should be thinking about 
                        what yours is gonna be - you’re 
                        only getting older.

           Ruby ignores Ruth’s harshness. Resolute.

                                 RUBY
                        I know what my future is. I’m doing 
                        what I need to, to make it happen.

           Ruby shuts the laptop and repacks the backpack.

                                 RUTH
                        If you survive. They’ll find you, 
                        Ruby, now you’re out in the open. 
                        In our world, there’s nowhere to 
                        hide. 

           Her gaze rests heavily on Ruby - wondering if this is the 
           last time she’ll see her alive.

           EXT. ROCKEFELLER BUILDING - DAY

           A long queue of frazzled TOURISTS snakes along the side of 
           the building. A few canopies erected along the line to shield 
           them from the blazing sun.

           A SIGN at the front reads: TOP OF THE ROCK RESERVATIONS.

           A BRATTY BOY, 9, waits near the front wearing a sunshine 
           state baseball cap and playing a game on his cell phone. 
           Impatient Tourists complain behind him. He glances up, off - 

           At the building entrance - TWO EMTs accompanied by TWO COPS 
           wheel out a gurney with a black body bag strapped to it. The 
           Intruder, Karl, that Ruby killed in the elevator last night.

           The Bratty Boy looks up to his SUNBURNT MOM, moans -

                                 BRATTY BOY
                        They got the body out, how much 
                        longeeerrr?
                                 SUNBURNT MOM
                        I don’t know honey, but we’re 
                        definitely getting a refund. 

           EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE ROCKEFELLER BUILDING

           Across the street, Kai watches the body bag gurney being 
           loaded into the back of an ambulance. Dressed in jeans and a 
           check shirt, he could be anyone in New York city. Only the 
           sharpness in his eyes gives him away. 

           He pulls out his cell and makes a call. As it’s answered -

                                 KAI (INTO PHONE)
                        There is a mess. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (FROM PHONE)
                        So clean it up.

                                 KAI (INTO PHONE)
                        Atlas like things discreet. They 
                        are very unhappy-

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (FROM PHONE)
                        And you’re calling me to whine 
                        about it. I’m not your mom, or your 
                        therapist. I did my job - gave you 
                        all the information you needed - 
                        this is not my problem.

                                 KAI (INTO PHONE)
                        But if Ruby lives, she could be. 
                        You know the deal.

           A pause at the end of the line. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (FROM PHONE)
                        I’ll find her real time location-

                                 KAI (INTO PHONE)
                        -and I’ll activate whoever’s 
                        closest.

           He hangs up and walks away.

           EXT. TRAIN - ALLEGHENY MOUNTAINS - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY

           TITLE: PENNSYLVANIA

           An eight car train speeds through the Allegheny Mountains, 
           forested and lush against a gray rainy sky. 
           INT. PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN - DAY

           A tiny, dated space with a single bed that runs along the 
           length of the window. Ruby sits up on the bed, her back 
           against the wall. Legs stretched out, laptop on her knees.

           THRU WINDOW - rain spatters against the glass as the imposing 
           mountains pass by. An impressive view despite the weather.

           But Ruby’s focus is only on her laptop.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: webpages about Wolf Force Security, a PHOTO 
           of the owner BRETT ASHER who paid for the attack on Scott. 
           He’s a bro, 40s, looks like John Cena on steroids. 

           Ruby reaches into her backpack, retrieves a ziploc bag and 
           fishes out a data stick. Inserts it into the laptop.

           A SHRIEK of LAUGHTER OS through the wall behind Ruby, from 
           the next car down. LOUD WOMEN’S VOICES, sounds like they’re 
           playing a drinking game. Ruby ignores them.  

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: Asher’s home address in Cincinnati. His 
           email account is open, along with his cell phone records and 
           contacts list. Ruby zooms in on a MAP of his large home. 

           A notification from the data stick pops up: PRIVATE SECURITY 
           ALGORITHM LOADING, replaced by a SCHEMATIC of Asher’s house 
           showing the layout and all the security features.  

           Suddenly - the wall behind Ruby BANGS, jolting her forward. 
           More LAUGHTER and DRUNK SHOUTING OS.

                                 DRUNK WOMAN (V.O.)
                        LOUISE?! I’m telling your fiancé! 

           We hear Louise PROTEST through continuing CACKLES.

           Ruby stops typing and her eyes narrow. Fuck sake. She looks 
           out of the window a moment then rises, taking a break. 

           INT. FOOD CAR - TRAIN - SOON AFTER

           Ruby steps up to the counter in the food car, next in line. 
           She browses what’s on offer - some sad sandwiches, wilted 
           salads and range of crappy wines. 

           The SERVER, 21, makes eye contact with Ruby -

                                 RUBY
                        Coffee please. 

           He turns to get it. Ruby gazes around, her eyes settling on - 
           Above the sliding door connecting the food car to the next 
           car down, a RED LED ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN. 

           ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN: the words scroll across: 
           CINCINNATI UNION TERMINAL... 49 MINUTES...

           INT. NEXT CAR DOWN FROM THE FOOD CAR - TRAIN

           A BALD MAN, 30s, sits in a half-empty car. He feels his cell 
           vibrate and pulls it from his pocket. Looks at the screen.

           ON CELL SCREEN: PRIORITY TARGET above a PHOTO of RUBY. Below 
           it, the details of the train they are both currently on.

           The Bald Man studies the photo, then leans out from his seat 
           to look down the aisle -

           THRU CAR DOOR WINDOW - Ruby waits for her coffee.

           INT. FOOD CAR - TRAIN

           Ruby takes her coffee from the Server. As she turns away, her 
           eyes sweep across the door to the next car down, just as -

           The doors slide open and the Bald Man walks through. 

           Ruby makes eye contact with him - the briefest of moments but 
           that’s all she needs to know that she’s been found. She 
           pauses, then turns back to the counter, thinking fast.

                                 RUBY
                             (to the Server)
                        Can I get a bottle of the rosé... 
                        do you have any champagne?
                             (off his nod)
                        That too.

           She sips her coffee as the Server runs her card. He hands it 
           back and places the champagne and rosé on the counter. Ruby 
           picks up the bottles and leaves her coffee behind. 

           She walks slowly back towards her cabin with a bottle in each 
           hand, sensing the Bald Man following her. 

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           Ruby carries the bottles down the empty corridor. The train 
           JOLTS and she pauses momentarily to steady her footing. 

           10 FEET BACK - the Bald Man stops too. He turns and looks out 
           of the window, pretends like he’s admiring the view.
           Ruby side-eyes the door to her private cabin, then walks 
           straight past it. Through the sliding doors to the next car -

           INT. OBSERVATION CAR - TRAIN

           Ruby enters the observation car - floor to ceiling windows 
           along the whole car to sightsee the awesome mountain view. 

           A BACHELORETTE PARTY of SIX LOUD WOMEN, 40s, wear sashes and 
           tiaras and drink wine. Whatever the collective noun for a 
           group of KARENS is, this is it. They are the women Ruby could 
           hear earlier. Just a few other PASSENGERS in the car.

           Ruby strolls towards the Karens. She hesitates, seeing -

           Through the doors up ahead - a SCRAWNY MAN enters. He sees 
           Ruby and stops. Clear he’s another threat. 

           Ruby half-turns, hearing the doors behind her slide closed - 
           the Bald Man is in the car too. Danger in both directions.

           The Karens erupt into LAUGHTER. Ruby makes a beeline for 
           them, putting on a huge smile with her eyes wide.

                                 RUBY
                        Louise?! Louise, I knew it was you!

           The Karens look up at Ruby as she approaches. LOUISE looks 
           confused, trying to place who Ruby is.

                                 LOUISE
                        Hi...

                                 RUBY
                             (eyeing Louise’s sash)
                        You’re getting married?! No way. Oh 
                        my God, how have you been?! It must 
                        be, like, YEARS since we took that 
                        class together!

           Ruby takes a seat at the Karens’ table. 

           In the aisle at opposite ends of the car, the Bald Man and 
           Scrawny Man stand still, thrown a curveball. The Scrawny Man 
           sits down hurriedly in the closest empty seat. 

                                 LOUISE
                             (still unsure)
                        Ah, good. Yeah, how are you and...

           Louise eyes Ruby’s wedding ring. A few of the Karens exchange 
           looks - who is this woman?
                                 RUBY
                        Scott. He’s sick right now, I’m 
                        heading to Cincinnati to try and 
                        figure it out. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Oh I’m sorry.

           A brief silence. Ruby indicates their drinks.

                                 RUBY
                        What are you drinking? 

                                 A KAREN
                        Prosecco-

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, no! Here, I have a rosé, and 
                        champagne. I was gonna take them to 
                        a friends’ for dinner, but this is 
                        your bachelorette! 

           Ruby puts the bottles on the table and starts opening them.

           In the aisle - the Bald Man watches Ruby and stews. He takes 
           a seat near the door at the opposite end of the car from the 
           Scrawny Man. Can’t do anything without making a scene, but 
           Ruby can’t escape either. 

           Back with Ruby and the Karens:

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                             (to Louise)
                        It’s the least I can do, if you’re 
                        getting married!

           Ruby’s face scrunches up in excitement as she ends her 
           sentence on a SQUEAL. 

           The Karens exchange looks - still not sure who Ruby is, but 
           if they’re getting free champagne - she can stay. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           ON ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN: the words above the door 
           scroll across: CINCINNATI UNION TERMINAL... TEN MINUTES...

           The Karens are wasted. The champagne and rosé are empty, Ruby 
           now wears a BACHELORETTE SASH too. She listens to their 
           CHATTER, one eye on the Scrawny Man she can see sitting 
           further down the car along the aisle.

           Behind her, the Bald Man rises and walks down the aisle past 
           the Karens, glancing at Ruby as he goes. Getting impatient. 
           Ruby waits until he is 6 feet away, then calls out -

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           As the Bald Man turns - she raises her cell phone and SNAPS a 
           PHOTO of him. He spins and hurries away, unprepared for that.

           Ruby leans in to the Karens. To Louise, nodding after him -

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        That guy was totally checking you 
                        out. 

           The Karens GIGGLE and crane their necks to stare at the Bald 
           Man down the aisle.

                                 VARIOUS KARENS 
                        Hey sweetie! / Hush! / I’ve never 
                        had a bald guy... 

           He takes a seat further down the car close to the Scrawny 
           Man. His eyes on Ruby, clearly frustrated. 

                                 RUBY
                             (to Karens)
                        I’ve gotta use the restroom. 
                             (to Louise)
                        If he walks past again, you’ve 
                        gotta kiss him-

                                 LOUISE
                        What?!

                                 RUBY
                        This is your bachelorette, you 
                        can’t say no.

                                 DRUNK KAREN
                        If you don’t, I will.

           The Karens LAUGH and JOKE together as Ruby rises and heads 
           back along the car towards her cabin.

           The Scrawny Man watches Ruby get up and prepares to follow.

           The Bald Man does the same, but freezes, seeing -

           The Karens all staring at him with thirsty eyes. 

           INT. PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           Ruby races into her cabin, locks the door behind her. 
           She quickly connects her phone to her laptop on the bed then 
           packs everything else into her backpack.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: the PHOTO of the Bald Man appears. A 
           GEOMETRIC OVERLAY scans his face, then runs it at lightning 
           speed through an IMAGE DATABASE to discover his identity. 

           Ruby hears the laptop BING, finding a match. She turns her 
           attention to it.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: a PHOTO of the Bald Man in combat uniform, 
           his name below it: OWEN PENG. Alongside it, a SCHEMATIC of 
           the train’s cars with seat numbers and the train’s ELECTRONIC 
           DISPLAY MESSAGING SYSTEM. 

           Ruby searches her backpack for a data stick and inserts it to 
           the laptop fast.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: a notification from the data stick pops up: 
           POLICE ALGORITHM LOADING. The CINCINNATI POLICE DATABASE 
           appears. She inserts Peng’s PHOTO into a WARRANT FOR ARREST. 

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           At Ruby’s door, the Scrawny Man stops and looks around - he’s 
           alone. He pulls a gun and reaches for the door handle.

           INT. PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           CLOSE on the door handle as it slowly turns. 

           Ruby’s eyes snap up from her laptop to the door. She 
           continues to touch type watching the handle turn back up - 
           the man discovering the door is locked. She’s out of time.

           Ruby shuts her laptop and moves it out of the way - whips off 
           her bachelorette sash - winds it around her hands and presses 
           herself flat against the wall beside the door. 

           A second later - the Scrawny Man KICKS down the door and 
           rushes into the cabin, gun raised! 

           Hidden beside the door, Ruby ELBOWS him hard in the face as 
           he enters -

           His arms fly up as she attacks and he FIRES instinctually - 
           the WINDOW SHATTERS and WIND BLOWS through the cabin, the 
           CLACK of the train loud OS. 

           In one fluid move, Ruby twists the bachelorette sash around 
           the Scrawny Man’s neck, turns and FLIPS him over her back - 
           LAUNCHING him high over the bed and OUT of the broken window -
           EXT. TRAIN - OHIO RIVER BRIDGE

           - the Scrawny Man SLAMS against the side of the train, hangs 
           from the window with the bachelorette sash around his neck. 
           His hands grasp desperately at the sash as he chokes. 

           PULL BACK to see the train speeding across a bridge, 300 feet 
           above the fast-flowing Ohio river. The last crossing before 
           entering the city. It’s still raining.

           The Scrawny Man dangles helplessly. His eyes bulge, seeing -

           The river far below his kicking feet - the bridge is old and 
           is little more than a framework of metal to carry the tracks. 

           INT. PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           Ruby braces her foot against the window frame and pulls back 
           hard on the sash, strangling him as he hangs outside.

           EXT. TRAIN - OHIO RIVER BRIDGE

           The Scrawny Man begins to lose consciousness, his hands drop 
           down to his sides. His body JERKS as Ruby tugs on the sash 
           from inside the train, checking he’s a dead weight. 

           Suddenly - he drops. 

           His body slips down the side of the train, rebounding off  
           girders on its descent through the framework of the bridge - 

           The bachelorette sash trails in the wind like a pretty bow 
           around the Scrawny Man’s neck as he falls 300 feet... his 
           body PLUNGES into the Ohio river.

           INT. PRIVATE SLEEPER CABIN - TRAIN

           Ruby opens her laptop, types a bit then hits ENTER. She packs 
           it up and leaves, swinging the backpack onto her shoulders.

           INT. FOOD CAR - TRAIN

           ON ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN: the words above the door 
           scroll across: CINCINNATI UNION TERMINAL... ARRIVING...

           Suddenly the screen blanks and the words change to -

           ON ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN: OWEN PENG SEAT 45J... WANTED 
           FELON DO NOT APPROACH... OWEN PENG SEAT 45J...
           The Server behind the counter looks up, double takes at the 
           message now scrolling above the door in shock.

           INT. VARIOUS CARS - TRAIN

           The same message is displayed on the messaging screens above 
           all the doors between all the cars. PASSENGERS start to 
           notice and look around at the seat numbers, disturbed. 

           EXT. PLATFORM - CINCINNATI UNION TERMINAL 

           50 feet from the platform - the train slows, pulling into the 
           station. PEOPLE wait with umbrellas in the rain to board. 

           INT. OBSERVATION CAR - TRAIN

           Ruby enters, makes eye contact with the Bald Man/Peng. He 
           rises menacingly, but then spots, above her head behind her -

           ON ELECTRONIC MESSAGING SCREEN: OWEN PENG SEAT 45J... WANTED 
           FELON DO NOT APPROACH... OWEN PENG SEAT 45J...

           He pales. 

           A few PASSENGERS close by throw him nervous glances - his 
           seat number - 45J. They get up and hurry to the exit doors.

           The train comes to a stop. 

           THRU TRAIN WINDOWS - on the platform, THREE COPS rush towards 
           the train, one on a radio, the others pulling their guns - 
           the Cincinnati warrant Ruby put out for Peng’s arrest.

           Peng sees the Cops through the window and glares at Ruby. She 
           smirks. He turns and runs off down the aisle, barging roughly 
           through Passengers to escape.

           The drunk Karens slowly gather their stuff to get off the 
           train. Ruby calls out to them as she heads for the door.

                                 RUBY
                        Hey, have an amazing weekend! Matt 
                        doesn’t deserve you.

           She grins and winks at Louise before she steps out into the 
           rain. Louise and the Karens look to each other - aww.

                                 VARIOUS KARENS
                        She was lovely / I’m gonna find her 
                        on facebook / you should invite her 
                        to the wedding!
           EXT. STREET/ASHER’S HOUSE - OAKLEY, CINCINNATI - NIGHT

           A rich, quiet suburb. Every house is large with yards 
           surrounded by fencing/walls, individual homes masquerading as 
           a community. It’s no longer raining but the ground is wet.

           Ruby strolls up to a metal gate outside the largest home on 
           the street. The house is modern architecture at its ugliest, 
           all sharp angles and glass - Brett Asher’s home. 

           She glances down at her tablet. 

           ON TABLET SCREEN: a SCHEMATIC of Asher’s house, overlaid with 
           its state of the art security system. Ruby taps: PERIMETER, 
           then: GATE, and -

           The gate in front of her slides open. Ruby has control.

           She walks through and up the asphalt driveway, passing a 
           small GUARD HOUSE to her right - dark and empty. As she nears 
           the house, Ruby slows and taps on the tablet again - 

           ON TABLET SCREEN: Ruby taps then drags a DRONE FEED to 
           overlay the house schematic. It shows 3 HEAT SIGNATURES - 
           thermal imaging revealing 2 people in different rooms inside 
           the house, and Ruby out on the driveway.

           Ruby heads around the back of the house into darkness. CCTV 
           and security lights are mounted to the walls - all inactive. 

           INT. KITCHEN - ASHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dark in the showroom-like kitchen.

           THRU THE BACK DOOR WINDOW - Ruby appears. She taps on her 
           tablet and the door CLUNKS, unlocking. She enters silently.

           Ruby shuts the door behind her, glances down at the tablet -

           ON TABLET SCREEN: 3 red dots all in different rooms.

           Ruby keeps half an eye on the tablet to avoid the two people 
           as she stealths through the kitchen and into the house.

           INT. HALLWAY - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Every wall is painted white. Everything pristine, no clutter, 
           a few pieces of expensive tasteless art up on the walls.

           Ruby creeps down floating wooden steps to the basement.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - ASHER’S HOUSE

           REX, 7, watches TV. A cute, shy kid, eyes glued to his show.

           ON HUMONGOUS TV SCREEN: a kid’s show with horses and girl 
           characters, something like SPIRIT: RIDING ACADEMY.

           INT. WINE CELLAR - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Ruby stealths down to the wine cellar. State of the art and 
           entirely glass, even down to the racks. Hundreds of bottles. 

           She browses the wine and picks out a shiraz. Grabs a 
           corkscrew and opens the bottle. She sips it and tilts her 
           head, appraising the wine - it’s good. 

           Ruby leans her tablet up against the rack, taps rapidly on it 
           with one hand as she takes another sip. 

           ON TABLET SCREEN: the SMOKE ALARM SYSTEM of the house. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Rex GIGGLES at his show on TV. 

           Suddenly - the smoke detector above an archway to another 
           room FLASHES RED and BEEPS LOUDLY. Rex looks to it, just as -

           His dad, BRETT ASHER, 40s, enters through the archway. Sweaty 
           and wearing only a towel, just finished a workout. Even more 
           of a muscle-bound bro in real life than in the pictures. 

           Asher looks up at the alarm, puzzled. Then looks to Rex -

                                 ASHER
                        Where is everyone? Did you see Joe?

           Rex shakes his head quickly. 

           Asher spots what’s on TV and scowls. He storms over to Rex.

                                 ASHER (CONT’D)
                        I told you to stop watching this 
                        crap! This show isn’t for you!

           INT. WINE CELLAR - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Ruby has found a wine glass and now drinks her shiraz from 
           it. She listens to Asher cruelly YELL at his kid upstairs. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Asher grabs the TV remote from the table and changes channel.

           ON HUMONGOUS TV SCREEN: the kid’s show is replaced by NFL.

                                 ASHER
                        You’re not getting this back until 
                        I can trust you to be a man. 

           Rex is forlorn but silent, he knows better than to talk back. 

           Asher carries the TV remote back over to the BEEPING smoke 
           detector and stares up at it, annoyed.

           But then it stops beeping. 

           Seconds later - an alarm further down the corridor in the bg 
           starts to FLASH and BEEP.

           Asher frowns at it, confused. He heads towards it.

           INT. CORRIDOR/HALLWAY - ASHER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Asher arrives at the BEEPING smoke detector and looks up at 
           it. As soon as he stops moving, it stops beeping.

           Seconds later - another detector starts BEEPING OS. Asher 
           follows the sound, rounds the corner to see -

           At the base of the wooden steps that lead to the wine cellar, 
           a smoke detector FLASHES and BEEPS.

           He pads barefoot down the steps, following the BEEPING smoke 
           detectors like a breadcrumb trail - all the way to Ruby. 

           INT. WINE CELLAR - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Ruby swirls her shiraz in the glass. Asher appears, still 
           carrying the TV remote. She smiles off his shocked face. 

                                 RUBY
                        Good evening, Brett Asher.
                             (off his muscles)
                        Impressive.

           It’s true, he’s a fucking mountain. Asher places the TV 
           remote down, stops 6 feet away from Ruby. Jaw set firm.

                                 ASHER
                        What did you do to my guys?
                                 RUBY
                        I didn’t do anything. You sent them 
                        an email giving them the night off.
                             (re. the wine)
                        This is really good. Do you want a 
                        glass, while we talk?

                                 ASHER
                        I’m not talking to you. Get the fu-

                                 RUBY
                        You will. Because I have questions, 
                        Brett.

           Asher picks up the corkscrew. He slides the spike between his 
           fingers and makes a fist with it.

                                 ASHER
                        If you don’t leave, then your pain 
                        is your fault.

           Ruby EXHALES and shakes her head at him, disappointed. She 
           places down her wine glass, just as Asher LUNGES at her! 

           Ruby side steps quickly and blocks, deflecting the corkscrew - 

           It PLUNGES into the cork of a huge SALAZAR CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE 
           lying on its side in a rack. 

           Ruby circles back around Asher as he yanks the corkscrew out 
           of the Salazar - the cork POPS OUT with it and CHAMPAGNE 
           FOUNTAINS OUT, showering over both of them.

           Asher looks at the corkscrew in his hand, blunted with the 
           cork stuck on it. Glares and throws it to the ground. 

           He squares up to Ruby as the champagne shower fizzes out to a 
           steady stream. Champagne bubbles down his hard torso - he’s 
           still wearing only a towel.

           Asher grabs a bottle of wine and wields it like a bat.

           Ruby slides out a larger Magnum bottle from the rack.

           Asher swings his bottle down towards Ruby’s head as she 
           raises the Magnum to block it - both bottles SMASH, showering 
           Ruby in alcohol and SHATTERING to pieces on the wet ground. 

           Ruby keeps hold of the broken neck of the Magnum - now a 
           razor sharp glass weapon. She spins and crouches, lashes out - 

           Swiping a DEEP BLOODY LINE across Asher’s torso. He YELLS in 
           pain, clutching his stomach.
           Asher outmatches Ruby in both size and strength - but she’s 
           nimble. His bare feet slip on the booze-soaked floor, he 
           readjusts his towel and grabs another bottle.

           So does Ruby. 

           He attacks - she blocks - SMASH - Ruby SLICES Asher - he 
           attacks - she blocks - SMASH - Ruby SLICES Asher - on repeat. 

           Ruby lands slices all over Asher’s body after each block - 
           his muscles now defined by bloody red ribbons. 

           CLOSE on Asher’s feet as they are cut to bits on the glass. 

           He limps, YELLS, loses his towel, fighting naked now but he 
           doesn’t care anymore.

           Ruby wields the broken glass, drenched in red wine from where 
           each of Asher’s blows has broken above her head. 

           Asher hauls down an entire wine rack towards Ruby - she 
           SLIDES out of the way just in time - HUNDREDS SMASH - red 
           wine SLOSHES across the cellar floor like a tsunami. 

           Ruby lands more strategic cuts -

           QUICK CUTS - CLOSE on a slice inside Asher’s thigh - CLOSE on 
           his arms sliced - CLOSE on a slice on the inside of his other 
           thigh - suddenly BLOOD PUMPS OUT as she hits an artery.

           Asher YELLS and collapses. His expression screams furious 
           defiance - knows he’s beaten and fucking hates it. 

           On the cellar floor - blood from his leg pumps out at speed, 
           mixes with the pools of red and white wine, outlining the 
           glass shards hidden in the liquid as he bleeds out. 

           Ruby stands over him.

                                 RUBY
                        Who’s trying to kill me?

                                 ASHER
                        It’s too late. You’re already dead.

           She lands another slice across his chest and he YELPS.

                                 RUBY
                        And so are you, so there’s no need 
                        to keep secrets anymore. Why are 
                        they after the Gemstones? 

           Asher grits his teeth. 
                                 ASHER
                        You girls should be more careful 
                        whose toes you step on.

           Ruby LUNGES DOWN with the razor sharp glass -

           CLOSE on Asher’s foot as Ruby severs his little toe. 

           Asher SCREAMS. Ruby repeats his own words back to him -

                                 RUBY
                        Your pain, is your fault.

           Asher glares, reaching for his wine-soaked towel, just a few 
           feet away. He pushes the towel down on his thigh wound and 
           drapes the rest of it up over his groin. Off this -

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a little too late for modesty. 
                        I’ll ask you one more time, slowly - 
                        who is trying to kill me?

           Asher grimaces, hating this but doesn’t want to lose another 
           toe - or any other part. He works to control his breathing.

                                 ASHER
                        Atlas... are everywhere. You won’t 
                        escape them.

           Ruby crouches down to eye level. Finally getting somewhere.

                                 RUBY
                        Who are Atlas?

                                 ASHER
                        So many Gemstones were easy to 
                        find, got regular lives beyond 
                        their work. But not you. Your job 
                        is all you have. You don’t have a 
                        life. 

                                 RUBY
                             (bla bla bla)
                        And that’s why you attacked Scott, 
                        my last known contact. I get it - 
                        I’m not new at this. Who are Atlas?

           Asher just smirks. Knows he’s dying and is prepared to be 
           stubborn to the bitter end. 

                                 ASHER
                        How is Scott, by the way?

           Ruby glowers, raises the glass shard again -
                                 ASHER (CONT’D)
                        You wanna know how we found him? 
                        The irony of it...? You were sold 
                        out, by another Gemstone.

           Ruby blanches. That can’t be true. She reels for a moment. 

                                 RUBY
                        Who...? Who?!

           But Asher’s breathing slows. So much blood on the floor. In 
           his last moments, he goes to raise his middle finger at her. 

           Like lightning, Ruby slashes out and SLITS his throat. 

           She rises, rattled by his last words. 

           She grabs her tablet and moves to leave. Pauses on her way 
           out, spotting the TV remote Asher confiscated from his kid.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - ASHER'S HOUSE

           Rex watches NFL glumly. He turns towards a sound, to see -

           Ruby, standing in the archway, drenched in red wine. 

           Rex’s mouth drops open. 

           Ruby heads over to him, wiping down the TV remote on her 
           pants. She holds the remote out to Rex and smiles -

                                 RUBY
                        You watch whatever you like.

           Rex breaks into a shy smile and takes the remote from her. 
           Ruby ruffles his hair affectionately and walks away. 

           We stay on Ruby as she hears the channel change - SPIRIT 
           NEIGHS in the bg. She smiles wider. 

           Cold blooded. Warm hearted. 

           INT. KITCHEN, MELLOR’S LUXURY HOME - WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           TITLE: WASHINGTON, DC

           MELLOR, 50s, a huge man with a kind face, squints at a cook 
           book propped open on the counter. A spoon in his hand. 

           ON PAGE: an éclair recipe in a famous chef’s patisserie book.
           He turns to the counter, covered in utensils and ingredients. 
           Spoons choux pastry mixture from a bowl into a piping bag.

                                 RUBY (O.S.)
                        You bake when you’re stressed?

           Mellor’s expression falls, realizing he’s not alone. His 
           focus stays on the pastry mixture.

                                 MELLOR
                        This isn’t baking. It’s patisserie.

           He turns to face Ruby. She sits across the island, backpack 
           at her feet. She gazes around his state of the art kitchen.

                                 RUBY
                        This is exactly how I imagined it.

                                 MELLOR
                        How’d you get in?

                                 RUBY
                        I got some new software from Ruth.

           Mellor bobs his head, that makes sense. He leans back against 
           the counter, finishes spooning the pastry mixture from the 
           bowl into the piping bag as they talk. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        The Initiative has a leak. A 
                        Gemstone secretly working for a 
                        group called Atlas.

                                 MELLOR
                        I know.

           Surprise flits across Ruby’s face. Replaced by annoyance.

                                 RUBY
                        And you didn’t think I might need 
                        to know that going in? That this 
                        whole thing is an inside job from 
                        one of our own people-

                                 MELLOR
                        Whoa, whoa, no. The Initiative is 
                        sound, we don’t have a mole. But we 
                        do have a traitor.

           Mellor steps forward and pushes his right thumb down onto the 
           flawless white counter top of the kitchen island. 

           CLOSE on his thumb as the white surface below glows GREEN. 
           A secret panel in the island top slides open. Mellor reaches 
           in and glides out a TABLET SCREEN on an articulated arm like 
           an Anglepoise, angles it so they can both see. Flips it on. 

           ON TABLET SCREEN: PHOTOS of an athletic WOMAN in her late 50s 
           - in combat gear - clandestine on the street - wrestling 
           training - dressed up at a glitzy event. This is SAPPHIRE.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        Her name is Sapphire. She was one 
                        of my most formidable recruits, 
                        right back when the Initiative 
                        started. She’s an all-rounder, the 
                        best assassin of her generation - 
                        still is. So good that she’s one of 
                        the few in your line of work who 
                        got the luxury of retiring, left 
                        the initiative 2 months ago. Except 
                        she didn’t retire - she decided to 
                        go private, and now she’s leaking 
                        all our secrets, including the 
                        identities of the Gemstones. 

                                 RUBY
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MELLOR
                        We weren’t sure who she was working 
                        for, needed you to confirm the link 
                        to Atlas.

                                 RUBY
                        And who are Atlas-

                                 MELLOR
                        Grab that tray, will you? Rip some 
                        parchment paper onto it, in there.

           Mellor indicates with the spoon to direct Ruby to where 
           things are, then drops the spoon into the empty bowl. 

           Ruby rises, opens a cupboard and pulls out the parchment 
           paper, rips a sheet and lines a tray with it. 

           Mellor twists the full bag in his hands, prepares to pipe out 
           the choux pastry mixture onto the tray as they keep talking.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        All we know is that they’re a 
                        criminal organization made up of 
                        some of the world’s richest and 
                        most powerful people - the 1%. 
           Mellor starts piping out a row of 6 inch long pastry mixture 
           that will cook into éclairs. A careful hand, a steady eye.

           Ruby picks up the empty pastry bowl, slides her finger around 
           the inside to scoop up the leftover mix.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        Fraud, murder, drugs - the tax 
                        evasion we hear about on the news 
                        is the tip of the iceberg for these 
                        people, but we’ve got no idea who 
                        they are or how they operate. Only 
                        found out they existed when Topaz 
                        took out an oil baron, turned out 
                        he was a member. Then Opal killed 
                        an Algerian royal, discovered he 
                        was in Atlas too- don’t eat that.

           He pauses piping to look Ruby in the eye. She freezes, her 
           finger in her mouth, eating the pastry mixture.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        These kinds of people are the 
                        reason the Gemstone Initiative was 
                        created in the first place - the 
                        problems they cause can’t be solved 
                        through official channels - require 
                        a short circuit solution. We need 
                        you to find Sapphire, find out as 
                        much as you can about Atlas, then 
                        kill her.

           Mellor turns back to finish his piping. Ruby dumps the bowl 
           and heads back to sit on her stool at the kitchen island.

                                 RUBY
                        Why me?

                                 MELLOR
                        Opal, Amethyst, Tourmaline and 
                        Peridot are dead. You’re the best 
                        Gemstone I have left.

           Suddenly - the sound of a CHILD CRYING fills the kitchen. 

           Mellor and Ruby look to the island tablet screen, to see -

           ON TABLET SCREEN: the photos of Sapphire are replaced by a 
           LIVE VIDEO FEED of a TODDLER, 3. In her bedroom, she WAILS, 
           wearing pajamas and toddling fast to the door. She exits.

           The CRYING is loud through the speaker but can be heard 
           faintly too - coming from inside the house - getting louder.
           Mellor bristles. 

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        CONCHITA!

           He picks up the tray full of pastry mix, slides the tray into 
           the oven and SLAMS it closed, just as -

           The door pushes open and the CRYING TODDLER enters nervously, 
           seeking comfort from a nightmare.

           Ruby watches the girl look at her dad, Mellor, knowing she’s 
           in trouble, then at Ruby. A moment in their eye contact, 
           before she decides to toddle towards Ruby, just as -

           A door to a different room opens and the nanny, CONCHITA, 45, 
           rushes in. She keeps her eyes down as Mellor berates her.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this your job? I’m not paying 
                        you to be interrupted-

                                 CONCHITA
                        Sorry, sorry sir.

           Ruby bends down for the Toddler as she closes in, but 
           Conchita picks her up and swoops her away. She gives Ruby an 
           apologetic look and exits. Over the girl’s receding CRIES -

                                 RUBY
                        How’s your ex-wife?

                                 MELLOR
                        Uh. I assume fine, haven’t had a 
                        call from the facility in a while.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MELLOR
                        I’m not.

           ON TABLET SCREEN: the LIVE VIDEO FEED shows Conchita enter 
           with the Toddler and start settling her back into bed. 

           Mellor turns off the tablet and glides it back into the 
           island counter top. It closes flawlessly, completely hidden. 

           He turns to the counter and starts breaking chocolate into a 
           glass bowl. Ruby watches him, thinking. 
                                 RUBY
                        If Sapphire’s as good as you say 
                        she is, if I come through this 
                        alive, it’s my last job. I’m out, 
                        for good-

                                 MELLOR
                        Done.

           Ruby shoots him a look - he agreed to that fast.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        Once all the Gemstones are dead, 
                        who do you think they’re coming for 
                        next? 

           Ruby’s lips curl into a thin smile, appreciating Mellor’s 
           honesty of self-preservation.

           Suddenly - in Ruby’s backpack at her feet - her cell phone 
           starts BEEP BEEP BEEPING. 

           In Mellor’s pocket, his cell phone does the same.

           They both pull their phones out and look at the screens.

           ON RUBY’S CELL SCREEN: an ALARM FLASHES - MOUNT SINAI.

                                 MELLOR (CONT’D)
                        The hospital...

                                 RUBY
                        Scott.

           Ruby rushes up, grabbing her backpack. After her -

                                 MELLOR
                        You’ll never get there in time! 
                        Just let Jade deal with it-

           - but Ruby’s already out the door.

           EXT. SUBURBS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Ruby’s BMW speeds through the quiet suburbs of Southeast 
           Washington DC.

           I/E. RUBY’S BMW - MOVING

           Driving, Ruby reaches out to her cell phone mounted on the 
           dash, taps the screen to make a call. 
           THRU WINDOWS - the green of Fort Circle Park rushes by, 
           replaced by the Anacostia freeway. She accelerates.

                                 DIEGO (FROM PHONE)
                        Hey beautiful, I always knew you’d 
                        call-

                                 RUBY
                        Diego, I need a ride.

                                 DIEGO (FROM PHONE)
                             (tone serious now)
                        Business class or personal?

                                 RUBY
                        Business.

                                 DIEGO (FROM PHONE)
                        Copy that. When?

                                 RUBY
                        Now.

           Ruby turns the wheel hard right.

           The BMW exits the freeway, takes the tight curve of the exit 
           ramp at speed. Her tires threaten to lift off the road. 

           Ruby immediately turns a hard left into -

           EXT. BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE - WASHINGTON DC

           Ruby’s BMW speeds through the wire mesh gates, in the process 
           of being opened for her by TWO SOLDIERS.

           TITLE: BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE

           She speeds across the compound, past the barracks and 
           SCREECHES to a halt outside an aircraft hanger.

           Ruby exits quickly, popping the trunk. She rushes back and 
           grabs a duffel bag out of it, SLAMS the trunk to see -

           DIEGO, hotshot pilot, 28, jogging over. He goes to hug her 
           but she holds her hand out - no. They hustle to the hangar.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m married now, Diego.

                                 DIEGO
                        So not even a hug? You look great-
                                 RUBY
                        Don’t sound so surprised.

                                 DIEGO
                        Ha! Still need to work on my lines 
                        for you, huh? So where to?

           INT. AIRCRAFT HANGAR - BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE

           They enter. The hangar houses a variety of military aircraft.

                                 RUBY
                        Mount Sinai, Manhattan.

           Diego leads her towards a helicopter.

                                 DIEGO
                        We’ll be there in 40 minutes-

                                 RUBY
                             (strain in her voice)
                        Diego, we don’t have that time.

           Diego stops. A gleam in his eye as he smiles wide -

                                 DIEGO
                        Better take the new bird then. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - MANHATTAN - DAY

           JADE, late 20s, the new Gemstone Mellor assigned to protect 
           Scott, runs full pelt down the corridor pushing Scott, 
           unconscious on a gurney, ahead of her through the CHAOS.

           A FIRE ALARM SOUNDS, water rains down from the sprinkler 
           system. PATIENTS and STAFF panic as they rush to evacuate.

           Suddenly - GUNFIRE. People SCREAM.

           Jade glances back quickly through the sprinkler rain, to see -

           TWO GUNMEN dressed as doctors pursuing her. 

           Jade grips the gurney tight and runs harder. A nasty SLASH 
           WOUND on her arm already - we’re joining her mid-fight. 

           CLOSE on the gurney wheels as they SLICE through pools of 
           water at speed. Locking up and SLIDING for a hard turn.

           Jade shoves Scott’s gurney into a service elevator. She 
           spins, pushing the button for the BASEMENT and FIRING SHOTS 
           back at the Gunmen as the elevator doors slide closed.
           EXT. SKY HIGH ABOVE PHILADELPHIA - DAY

           A silver Eurocopter X3 - the world’s fastest helicopter - 
           cuts through the sky.

           I/E. EUROCOPTER X3 - FLYING

           In the back, Ruby preps for the inevitable battle ahead. 

           Wearing a headset, she loads a gun from her duffel, then 
           turns to her laptop, open on the seat.

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: CCTV FEEDS from the hospital flicker and 
           pause, struggling to load. A glimpse of Jade wheeling Scott’s 
           gurney through a basement corridor towards the morgue.

                                 RUBY
                        Come on come on come on...

           In the pilot seat, Diego is energized by the adventure. He 
           glances down at the complex instrument panel -

           ON INSTRUMENT PANEL: an LED DISPLAY reads: 261mph.

                                 DIEGO
                        I just broke my speed record, from 
                        when we were back in Kandahar! 

           He glances back, sees Ruby frustrated at her laptop.

                                 DIEGO (CONT’D)
                        We’re too fast and too high for the 
                        internet! Wheels down in five.

           INT. MORGUE - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - MANHATTAN

           HIGH ANGLE on Scott, lying unconscious on a morgue tray as he 
           slides fast into a metal body locker. 

           Jade SLAMS the locker door, hiding Scott quickly amongst the 
           many lockers that line a whole side of the morgue in rows. 

           She looks around fast.

           CLOSE on a tray of autopsy tools - Jade grabs an amputation 
           knife and a scalpel, just as -

           The two Gunmen burst through the morgue doors! 

           Jade’s face screws up in fury, she lets out a BATTLE CRY and 
           lunges forward to attack. 
           EXT. HELIPAD - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

           15 floors up, the Eurocopter descends to land on the helipad. 

           The helicopter door slides open, Ruby braces herself in the 
           doorway then LEAPS down the last 10 feet to the helipad - no 
           time to lose. The duffel slung across her back, gun in hand.

           She sprints across the roof to the stairway door.

           INT. FIRE STAIRS - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

           Ruby CLATTERS down the metal stairs, reaches a door that 
           leads into the hospital and rushes through.

           INT. CORRIDORS/CHILDREN’S WARD - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

           The sprinklers and alarm are now off. Everyone has evacuated. 
           Silent and still. Water pools on the laminate floor.

           Ruby’s shoes SPLASH through the puddles as she hurries 
           through the deserted hospital on high alert. 

           The white corridor walls alongside her give way to CHILDREN’S 
           ARTWORK - paintings and drawings done by young patients. 

           Ruby turns a corner into a ward and stops, seeing -

           A SICK BOY, 10, lying in a hospital bed hooked up to a 
           complicated machine. Completely alone, he WHEEZES, terrified.

           Ruby lowers her gun.

                                 RUBY
                        Are they coming back for you?

           The Sick Boy nods vigorously.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, there’s not really a 
                        fire.

           His gaze lingers on her gun. She glances to it, explains -

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s just for bad guys.

           The Sick Boy nods in relief - oh, that’s OK then. 

           Ruby hurries on.
           INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

           Ruby enters the basement corridor through a stairway door. 
           Yellow lighting and bare concrete walls, no one around. The 
           door ECHOES as it shuts behind her. 

           Up ahead - a sign above double doors reads: MORGUE.

           Ruby stealths down the corridor towards the doors, the last 
           images she saw of Scott on her laptop video feed.

           She stops at the doors. Steels herself. Bursts through -

           INT. MORGUE - MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL

           - and is immediately attacked by Jade! Ruby FIRES - Jade 
           deflects the gun and PUNCHES - Ruby blocks and switches to 
           defense, realizing who Jade is from Scott’s video feed.

                                 RUBY
                        Jade?

           They both stop. Take a step back from each other, each 
           realizing who the other person is. 

                                 JADE
                        You Ruby?

           Ruby surveys the morgue - sees the dead bodies of the two 
           Gunmen dressed as doctors, bloody on the tiled floor. Bullet 
           dents in the metal of the body locker doors.

                                 RUBY
                        Where’s Scott?

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Jade opens a locker door and slides out Scott on his body 
           tray - unconscious, but safe and sound.

           Ruby’s fingers rush to check Scott’s pulse - still as she 
           counts it. Satisfied, she leans over him, kisses his 
           forehead, cradles his face in her hands with love.

           Jade watches Ruby, curious.

                                 JADE
                        You two meet on the job?

                                 RUBY
                        At the grocery store.
                             (off surprised look)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUBY (CONT'D)
                        Not everything is about work... 
                        didn’t use to be.

                                 JADE
                        First time I’ve met another 
                        Gemstone. Not even sure how many of 
                        us there are. 

           Ruby keeps her eyes on Scott. 

                                 RUBY
                        How many of us there are left. 

           A heavy beat. Ruby takes a last loving moment with Scott, 
           then turns to Jade, back to business.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Did you report the alarm as false-

                                 JADE
                        Yes-

                                 RUBY
                        Because you’ll need time for clean 
                        up-

                                 JADE
                        I know how this works.

           Jade gestures to the bodies as proof. 

           Ruby absorbs this. Gives an explanation by way of an apology -

                                 RUBY
                        Mellor said you were new. First 
                        time I’ve met another Gemstone too. 
                        Thank you.

                                 JADE
                        Just doing my job. I’ve got this, 
                        until it’s over.

           A moment of mutual respect, a potential friendship ahead.

                                 RUBY
                        What’s your specialism?

                                 JADE
                        Chemistry. You?

                                 RUBY
                        Home specialist.

           Jade looks at Ruby with a raised eyebrow - really?! 
           She winces at her arm wound, the deep slash we saw earlier.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 JADE
                        Need stitches.

                                 RUBY
                             (deadpans)
                        Maybe you should get yourself to a 
                        hospital.

           Jade shoots Ruby a look - great, so you’re a comedian too.

           INT. RABIN’S DINER - LOWER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           David, Ruth’s grandson, finishes sweeping the floor. He’s 
           alone, the diner closed for the night. 

           He turns off a RAPID KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK at the door. Puzzled, 
           he heads over. Opens the door, to reveal -

           Ruby standing outside in the darkness.

                                 DAVID
                             (borderline speechless)
                        I’m sorry, my grandma’s asleep-

           Ruby holds out her black credit card.

                                 RUBY
                        I need the booth for the night. 

           INT. BOOTH - RABIN'S DINER - SOON AFTER

           Alone in the booth, the lights are bright as Ruby reaches 
           over the table, grabs a light fitting and PULLS PART OF THE 
           WALL DOWN to reveal -

           A sleek, high tech computer and screen set up, like the one 
           in Ruby’s apartment but better. She sits and types fast.

           ON SCREEN: Sapphire’s Gemstone FILE comes up, some of the 
           same PHOTOS we saw back in Mellor’s kitchen. Her kill history 
           going back 30 years and skills list - weapons, martial arts, 
           endurance and capability test scores - all so high. 

           Ruby scans Sapphire’s skills list and rubs her wedding ring 
           absentmindedly. Apprehensive - this woman is really good. 

           Wondering if she’ll make it out alive... 
           Ruby gets to work. 

           ON SCREEN: Ruby brings up a WORLD MAP, overlays Sapphire’s 
           last known locations and starts trying to find her.

           INT. RABIN'S DINER - MORNING

           Ruth and David bustle behind the counter handling early 
           morning orders, mid-conversation.

                                 DAVID
                        About 10PM, just after 10-

           Ruth waves her hand - alright, don’t tell me anymore.

                                 RUTH
                        Fine. Send her up a Reuben, coffee 
                        and a bloody Mary, and remember - 
                        no sauerkraut! Don’t think I didn’t 
                        notice last time-

                                 RUBY (O.S.)
                        Can I get that to go?

           Ruth looks over, to see Ruby standing at the bottom of the 
           stairs, energized. 

           EXT. OPEN AIR GROUND PARKING LOT - COLORADO AIRPORT - DAY

           TITLE: COLORADO, ROCKY MOUNTAINS

           Ruby walks across the airport parking lot. The air is clear 
           and clean in the bright sunshine. A plane cuts across the 
           snow-capped mountain landscape behind her, coming in to land.

           Ruby gets into a black Land Rover and drives off. 

           I/E. LAND ROVER - ROCKY MOUNTAIN ROADS - DAY 

           Ruby drives through winding mountain roads. A green and rocky 
           landscape - it’s summer, the only snow is high up the 
           mountains. Few cars on the road off season.

           THRU WINDSHIELD - up ahead, a small river bridge that leads 
           into a quaint mountain village. 

           Before she drives over the bridge, Ruby reaches out to her 
           cell phone mounted to the dash -

           ON CELL SCREEN: she pushes: ACTIVATE. It changes to: PENDING.
           EXT. MOUNTAIN VILLAGE

           Ruby’s Land Rover crosses the bridge and drives slowly into 
           the village. It’s a former Victorian mining town, a Telluride 
           look-a-like in a canyon surrounded by 14,000ft high peaks. 

           She drives down the main street - colorful historic buildings 
           with clapboard storefronts, the whole village just ten blocks 
           square. Ruby pulls into a parking space and gets out.

           EXT. GUARD HOUSE - MOUNTAIN VILLAGE - DAY 

           A small and windowless concrete building sits on the 
           riverbank, a few hundred feet back from the village proper.

           INT. GUARD HOUSE

           THREE GUYS sit at a wall of surveillance screens. On the 
           other side of the room, an extensive weapons store and a 
           kitchenette, where Kai makes himself a green tea. 

           ON SCREENS: CCTV COVERAGE of the entire village, interior and 
           exterior feeds. Serious overkill for such a small place.

                                 GUY #1
                        I got something.

           Kai walks to him. Watches as he plays back and explains -

           ON SCREEN: Ruby’s Land Rover, just caught by the CCTV before 
           she crossed the bridge. Clear it’s her in the driver’s seat.

                                 GUY #1 (CONT’D)
                        I ran the plates, the car’s 
                        unregistered. 

           Kai grins wide - he’s got her. To everyone -

                                 KAI
                        Get me a lock on her real time 
                        location. Let’s move!

           Kai stalks back towards the weapons store with purpose.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - MOUNTAIN VILLAGE - DAY

           Ruby strolls down the street, taking in the village. Her eyes 
           linger on a YOUNG FAMILY as they pass her on the sidewalk. A 
           reminder of what she’s doing this for. 

           She heads for a small POST OFFICE and enters -
           INT. POST OFFICE - MOUNTAIN VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A traditional, old-world post office - wooden walls and a 
           wooden floor that CREAKS. A small, unmanned counter with an 
           open door to the mailroom behind it. No customers.

           Ruby browses a wall of mailboxes, searching for one in 
           particular. She finds it -

           ON MAILBOX: the address: 1070 MOUNTAIN TRAIL ROAD. 

           The blandest of addresses for Sapphire to hide behind. The 
           keyhole is dusty compared to the mailboxes around it.

                                 CRANKY POSTMASTER (O.S.)
                        You don’t have any mail.

           Ruby turns, to see a CRANKY POSTMASTER, female, 65, appear 
           behind the counter from the mailroom. 

                                 RUBY
                        Nothing at all?

                                 CRANKY POSTMASTER
                        Nope. Not for the last 2 months, 
                        not even junk. We all assumed that 
                        house was empty. You from the city? 
                        Guess it’s your second home.

           The Postmaster doesn’t hide her disapproval. Ruby ignores it.

                                 RUBY
                        Have you been up there recently? 

                                 CRANKY POSTMASTER
                        No need. My knees aren’t what they 
                        used to be and your house is a ski 
                        to reach, even at this time of 
                        year. You’re gonna have to keep 
                        coming down here to get your mail. 
                        Leave your phone number and we can 
                        give you a call - if you ever get 
                        anything, that is-

                                 RUBY
                        No thanks. I won’t be here long.

           She smiles courteously at the Postmaster and heads out.

           INT. GUARD HOUSE

           CLOSE on a box of tranquilizer darts as it’s ripped open. 
           Kai and GUY #1 load the darts into guns. In the bg, the two 
           other Guys sit at screens, searching for Ruby. GUY #2 spins -

                                 GUY #2
                        Found her! She just left the post 
                        office.

           Guy #2 and GUY #3 hustle over from their screens and rush to 
           weapon up. Kai leads the way to the door.

                                 KAI
                        Remember, no kill shots. Atlas want 
                        her alive. 

           Kai grabs the door handle, but as he goes to turn it we hear 
           the DOOR LOCK CLUNK. All the LIGHTS GO OFF in the same 
           moment, like he’s triggered something...

           Confused, Kai shoves the door, but it won’t budge. 

           The Guys back off and scan their surroundings - guns up, 
           sensing danger.

           Suddenly, from behind Kai - the sound of a SEXY MOAN.

           Kai’s expression falls, turning to see -

           ON SCREENS: the CCTV feeds are quickly plastered over with 
           DICK PICS, covering them up completely. PORN AUDIO plays, a 
           WOMAN’S VOICE purrs, “you like that, baby? I know you do...”

           Kai glares in shock at the screens.

           Suddenly - the same VOICE from Kai’s pocket. He pulls out his 
           cell phone, playing the PORN AUDIO, and -

           ON CELL SCREEN: a slideshow of DICK PICS. 

           He looks up to see the three Guys pull their cell phones out 
           too, the same thing happening to theirs.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - MOUNTAIN VILLAGE

           Ruby strides with purpose along the sidewalk. She hears her 
           cell phone PING, pulls it out to see -

           ON SCREEN: the word: PENDING flips to: ACTIVATED.

           She smirks, knowing what’s happening in the Guard House. She 
           pockets her phone and pushes through a door -
           INT. REI STORE - CONTINUOUS

           - into the biggest REI store you’ve ever seen. Two floors of 
           equipment - ski, bike, camp, climb, kayak - this store has 
           everything. A big open space in the middle of the store, 
           stairs lead up to the open second floor that balconies around 
           on all sides above. 

           Just a FEW CUSTOMERS mill about, it being off season.

           Ruby beelines for the ski section and rifles through the ski 
           suits. A SPECTACLED SALES CLERK, female, 18, bounces up.

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        Hi there! Can I help you?

                                 RUBY
                        I need a white ski suit in a 6. 

           In the bg - a NOSY MANAGER, 40s, eavesdrops. 

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        Of course! We just got in a Moncler 
                        Grenoble in white - it’s the 
                        warmest but it’s so lightweight. I 
                        can get it from the back for you-

                                 RUBY
                        Yes please. I also need ski boots 
                        to match, and skis too. I’m kinda 
                        in a hurry.

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        Awesome, yeah! So you need 
                        everything? What’s your budget?

                                 RUBY
                        My boss is covering this.

           The Nosy Manager in the bg hears this and his ears prick up - 
           a big sale. He hurries over to them. 

                                 NOSY MANAGER
                             (rude, to Sales Clerk)
                        I’ll take it from here.
                             (syrupy, to Ruby)
                        So, are you here from out of town-

                                 RUBY
                        Nope. We’re good.

           She levels a stare at him. The Nosy Manager’s expression 
           falls as he gets the message and fucks off. 
           INT. GUARD HOUSE

           The PORN AUDIO is LOUD now. With their tech compromised, Kai 
           kneels and plugs a cable from an old landline phone into the 
           wall. He lifts the receiver and listens, but it’s dead. 

           He throws the phone down in frustration. Rushes over to the 
           weapons store and grabs a belt of GRENADES. To the 3 Guys - 

                                 KAI
                        Blow the wall!

           INT. REI STORE

           Ruby wears a white ski suit with matching boots. She browses 
           the skis as the Sales Clerk fills her in - she might be only 
           18, but she’s clearly the most knowledgable person here.

           The Clerk pulls out a set of long, white skis. 

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        These are the new version of the 
                        G3s - 6 feet long with a short 
                        early tip and tail rise - a good 
                        all rounder as well as for steeper, 
                        more variable terrain. They also 
                        have these nifty magnetic contact 
                        strips on the inside, so they snap 
                        together, easier to carry.

           She SNAPS the magnetic strips together and lifts the skis 
           onto her shoulder with a smile, showing how easy it is. 

                                 RUBY
                        Great! I’ll take them.

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        Are you sure you want white ones? 
                        You don’t want a bit of color in 
                        your outfit? So if there’s an 
                        accident, you’ll be easier to see-

                                 RUBY
                        I’m a very good skier.

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                             (puzzled, but no doubt)
                        ...OK.

           EXT. GUARD HOUSE

           Quiet and still outside the Guard House. Suddenly - KABOOM!
           A 6 foot square hole suddenly BLASTS out the side of the 
           building, concrete DUST EXPLODES everywhere.

           Kai runs out through the dust cloud, followed by the 3 Guys, 
           all armed. They sprint up the river bank to the village.

           INT. REI STORE

           Ruby waits at the counter as the Spectacled Sales Clerk 
           finishes ringing up her purchases. The Nosy Manager seethes 
           in the bg. Ruby taps on the card payment screen to pay. 

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        There’s not many people on the hill 
                        this time of year, gotta go pretty 
                        high up the mountain to reach the 
                        snow. Be careful on the slopes-

                                 RUBY
                        I will.

           She smiles - how sweet this kid is concerned about her 
           safety. Ruby slides two twenties across the counter to her.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Have a great day.

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        You too.

           They share a smile. Ruby picks up her skis and boots and 
           turns towards the door to leave, just as -

           Kai and the 3 Guys race through the door, breathless and 
           armed. They stop as they see her.

           Ruby’s smile falls in the same moment they turn their weapons 
           on her - she drops her things and DIVES over the counter as 
           they OPEN FIRE.

           The few Customers and Nosy Manager run to find safety.

           Behind the counter - Ruby pulls her gun and shelters with the 
           terrified Sales Clerk. Bullet holes pepper the counter wall 
           behind them.

           With Kai as he YELLS at the 3 Guys, annoyed -

                                 KAI
                        Cease fire! I said wound only!

           They stop and switch to dart guns, creep towards the counter. 
           Behind the counter - Ruby peers through a bullet hole in the 
           counter wall, to see -

           THRU BULLET HOLE - Kai and the Guys stealth past a display of 
           camping gas canisters. Kai gestures for them to split up. 

           Ruby aims her gun through the bullet hole and FIRES -

           BANG BANG BANG - her bullets hit the gas canisters and the 
           canisters EXPLODE - flinging the two closest Guys to the 
           floor and KILLING Guy #3. The others run to hide.

           To the Sales Clerk -

                                 RUBY
                        Stay here.

           The Clerk gives Ruby a look - as if I’m going anywhere.

           Ruby peers up over the counter top, to see -

           A small FIRE in the canister display, no one in sight. 

           She ducks back behind the counter, steels herself, then 
           CHARGES OUT - 

           Ruby FIRES as she runs across the store towards a display of 
           CARGO BOXES. DARTS chase her - 

           A dart hits a CUSTOMER hiding behind a bike rack - he passes 
           out almost instantly. 

           Ruby’s gun CLICKS, empty as she reaches the cargo box display 
           - the kind you mount on a car roof or pull behind a trailer - 
           and takes cover. She scans fast for a new weapon - eyes on -

           A climbing display close by - CRAMPONS.

           Across the store - Kai rises from his hiding place, Guy #1 
           and Guy #2 do the same. Kai gives hand signals, indicates 
           them to pincer Ruby - he’s going upstairs. 

           Kai pads up the stairs as the two Guys advance on Ruby.

           Ruby pushes her back up against a cargo box as she prepares 
           herself to fight - she winds a pair of rubber crampons around 
           her fists, spikes out - MAKESHIFT KNUCKLEDUSTERS. 

           Ruby’s eyes snap right - hearing a Guy close to the display 
           on the other side.

           She doesn’t wait. 
           Ruby rushes around the cargo box - blocks Guy #1’s gun as he 
           FIRES a dart - she PUNCHES him in the face over and over - 
           the crampon spikes cutting his skin into a bloody mess. 

           Guy #1 drops the gun and recoils, hands to his face as -

           Guy #2 FIRES a dart from behind Ruby - she ducks just in time 
           and commando rolls across the floor, picking up Guy #1’s 
           discarded gun, she comes up to kneeling and FIRES -

           Guy #2 dives for cover behind a cargo box - 

           CLOSE on the box as Ruby’s darts embed in the plastic. 

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR 

           Kai reaches the top of the stairs and runs around the balcony 
           railing, looking down for the best vantage point.

           ON THE GROUND FLOOR 

           Ruby’s dart gun CLICKS, empty. In the bg, Guy #1 recovers - 
           she half-turns off the SOUND of him pulling a large knife 
           from a sheath.

           Can’t deal with both Guys at the same time.

           She dumps the gun and runs to Guy #2, hiding behind the cargo 
           box - attacks him before he has chance to raise his gun. She 
           KICKS and PUNCHES him relentlessly - forcing him to back up -

           Her last PUNCH so hard that Guy #2 falls back into an OPEN 
           CARGO BOX - she KICKS the lid closed and LOCKS IT. 

           The box SHAKES as he tries to escape from inside.

           Ruby spins, just as Guy #1 SWIPES at her with his knife - 
           cutting a bloody slice into her arm. She YELLS OUT in pain.

           Ruby fights him one on one - the blade of the knife SHRINGING 
           off the metal spikes of Ruby’s crampon knuckledusters.

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR 

           Kai takes up position at a railing, aims down at the fight -

           FROM ABOVE - Ruby and Guy #1 move fast, hard to get a shot.

           ON THE GROUND FLOOR

           Ruby blocks Guy #1 and backs onto the stairs to gain a height 
           advantage against him - she throws in some SPINNING KICKS to 
           his head as well as CRAMPON FIST BLOWS.
           ON THE SECOND FLOOR 

           Kai runs to reposition - Ruby and Guy #1 now in full view.

           ON THE STAIRS

           Ruby lands a kick square to Guy #1’s chest - he STUMBLES down 
           a few steps as Ruby turns and SPRINTS up the stairs.

           Guy #1 recovers and races after her.

           CLOSE on the steps as Kai’s DARTS embed in them - near misses 
           as Ruby reaches the top of the stairs - grabs a display rack 
           of colorful KAYAKS at the top and hauls it down - tipping -

           EIGHT KAYAKS ride down the stairs - straight at Guy #1!

           He stops in his tracks off the sight, just as -

           A stray DART hits him in the back - Guy #1 collapses, rides 
           unconscious down the stairs with the flow of the kayaks.

           WITH KAI 

           As he curses at his stray shot - he’s more a hand to hand 
           guy, less a marksman. He runs around the balcony railing 
           towards Ruby, who stands near the top of the stairs. 

           WITH RUBY 

           Seeing Kai coming, 30ft away around the railing and closing 
           in fast. He raises his gun, has a clear shot right at her.

           Ruby’s eyes widen. She looks around quickly - spots - 

           BOULDERING CRASH PADS just along the balcony.

           She runs for them - GRABS a crash pad - swings it sideways 
           and TACKLES the railing with it - 

           The railing SNAPS as Ruby SMASHES through it, FALLING 20ft -

           To land on the ground floor below. 

           Ruby OOFS on impact - the crash pad keeps moving - SLIDES OUT 
           over the wooden floor with the momentum of the fall - finally 
           coming to rest in a display of tents.

           WITH KAI

           Looking down over the railing, as Ruby slides on the crash 
           pad under the balcony across the store, disappearing from 
           view. He runs for the stairs to head down after her. 
           ON THE GROUND FLOOR

           Ruby recovers. She rips off her crampon knuckledusters, now 
           tangled and ill-fitting. Looks up from the crash pad, to see -

           THRU OPEN TENT DOOR - the Nosy Manager clutches his knees to 
           his chest, scared and hiding in the tent. He wears a bicycle 
           helmet for protection. Off it - 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Good idea.

           Ruby rises.

           Kai hits the bottom step, checks his gun - empty - dumps it.

           Ruby and Kai square off in the empty space in the middle of 
           the store. They glare at each other, in recognition from 
           their tunnel fight back in New York.

                                 KAI
                        Just the two of us again.

                                 RUBY
                        Don’t get any ideas. I’m spoken 
                        for.

           She LUNGES at him and they fight - again, both expert martial 
           artists but Kai is more balletic. He uses the open space to 
           his advantage, hones mercilessly in on Ruby’s arm wound.

           The Sales Clerk peers out from behind the counter and watches 
           the fight nervously. 

           Kai KICKS Ruby’s knees out and she FALLS into a climbing 
           display, ropes and carabiners go flying. 

           CLOSE on her hands as she GRABS a climbing rope, SPINS around 
           and up to her knees, just as -

           Kai SPRAYS Ruby in the face with BEAR SPRAY. 

           On her knees, Ruby COUGHS and CHOKES, rubbing her red eyes 
           furiously. She scrabbles on the floor for anything to use as 
           a weapon, but she can barely see. Clear she’s beat.

           Kai drops the bear spray. Grins as her torments her -

                                 KAI
                             (mimicking the porn audio)
                        You like that, baby, huh?

           The Sales Clerk looks anxious. She spots a SNOWBOARD a few 
           feet away out in the open. Hurries up and towards it.
           Kai PUNCHES Ruby in the jaw - her face HITS the floor, blood 
           spatters out of her mouth. Suddenly - 

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           The Sales Clerk SLIDES the snowboard across the floor fast - 
           it shoots straight into Ruby’s hands and in one fluid move -

           Ruby grabs the snowboard firmly and rises, spinning -

           She SMASHES Kai hard around the face with the snowboard. It 
           CRACKS in two with the force and Kai goes down, knocked out.

           Ruby stands over him. Drops the broken snowboard pieces.

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah. I like that very much.

           She falls back to her knees as the Sales Clerk rushes over 
           with a bottle of water. Ruby tips her head back and the Clerk 
           pours water into her eyes to wash the bear spray out. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Suddenly, a NOISE from across the room -

           The cargo box FLIES OPEN - Guy #2 finally managing to break 
           out. He pulls a knife and scans wildly for his target -

           Back across the room with Ruby as she grabs a SKI POLE and 
           THROWS it with force like a javelin -

           CLOSE on the ski pole as it PUNCHES into Guy #2’s eye. He 
           falls back into the box and the lid shuts on top of him.

           Ruby blinks through the water in her eyes, recovering from 
           the bear spray. She rises, and moves slowly to the counter. 
           Picks up her skis and ski boots.

           PULL BACK to see the store’s devastation, like a tornado hit 
           it. The Clerk watches Ruby go, shellshocked. Calls after her -

                                 SPECTACLED SALES CLERK
                        Be careful on the slopes...

           Ruby stops and smiles - the same thing she said earlier.

                                 RUBY
                        I will.

           Ruby heads out.
           EXT. ROAD - MOUNTAIN SIDE - DAY

           Ruby wears her ski suit and backpack. She pops the trunk of 
           her Land Rover. Parked as high as she can get up the 
           mountain, the village far below.

           A DRONE WHIRS as it rises from the trunk - Ruby watches it 
           fly up 100 feet above her - small against the blue sky.

           Ruby looks to her cell phone, strapped to her arm.

           ON CELL SCREEN: the DRONE VIDEO FEED shows Ruby and her car 
           below - a wide aerial view to alert for danger around her.

           Her skis CLIP together over her shoulder and she sets off.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN SIDE - LATER

           A red sun sets on the colossal mountain. Ruby is just a pin 
           prick, skiing past clumps of snowy trees at 10,000ft. The 
           drone follows high above her. 

           EXT. FOREST - SAPPHIRE’S CABIN - DUSK

           Ruby skis through trees. Her breath clouds, freezing at this 
           altitude. She glances at her cell phone on her arm -

           ON CELL SCREEN: the DRONE VIDEO FEED shows a CABIN, 50 feet 
           ahead. Nothing around it for miles.

           Truly remote. Ruby skis up to a stop by a copse of trees. 

           She clicks her boots out of her skis. SNAPS the skis together 
           magnetically and buries them lightly in the snow. Crouches 
           behind the trees and scopes out the cabin.

           20 FEET AWAY - a 1900s former mining CABIN, one and a half 
           stories, just 800 sq feet. Remodeled and self-sufficient - 
           solar panels, a satellite dish and antenna on the roof. The 
           cabin backs onto an ICEFALL. A FROZEN RIVER 30ft below it.

           Ruby taps on her cell strapped to her arm, and -

           ON CELL SCREEN: the DRONE VIDEO FEED switches to thermal 
           imaging. The cabin is amber against the surrounding blue. Two 
           red heat signatures inside the cabin, one flickers - looks 
           like a person sitting in front of a fireplace. Sapphire. 

           Ruby rises, pulling a gun. She stealths towards the cabin.

           In the snow - a single pair of footprints, tracks that lead 
           all the way up to the cabin. Must be Sapphire’s. 
           Ruby moves slowly. She steps carefully in the footprints so 
           as not to leave any tracks of her own. 

           CLOSE on the footprints as Ruby steps in them, the snow 
           CREAKS beneath her feet. One step, two steps, three steps - 

           Suddenly - the ground beneath her gives way! Ruby FALLS - 

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT

           - 15 feet down into pitch black. Ruby hits the hard bottom - 
           the sound of her painful YELL and her ski boots hitting 
           something METAL, then Ruby scrabbling about in the darkness.

           A FLASHLIGHT suddenly illuminates Ruby from above - Ruby 
           spins her gun up fast and FIRES - BANG BANG BANG! The light 
           disappears, as -

                                 SAPPHIRE (O.S.)
                             (Texas accent)
                        Whoa, whoa!

           A moment in the dark, before the flashlight shines down again 
           on Ruby - a LIQUID SPATTERS down onto Ruby’s face with it.

           Ruby raises her gun again to shoot, but -

                                 SAPPHIRE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Keep shootin’, you’re gonna go up 
                        in flames.

           Ruby hesitates. She wipes the liquid from her cheeks and 
           smells it - gasoline. Fuck. She lowers her gun. 

                                 SAPPHIRE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You gonna stop?

           Ruby curses under her breath.

                                 RUBY
                        Yes.

                                 SAPPHIRE (O.S.)
                        Alright then. 

           The liquid stops dripping. 

           Up at the shaft opening - a WOMAN, 50s, appears. This is 
           SAPPHIRE, who we’ve seen already in photos. She’s Texan, like 
           a brunette assassin version of Dolly Parton.

           Ruby looks up at her adversary for the first time. Sapphire 
           smiles down at Ruby from her position of safety 15 feet up.  
                                 SAPPHIRE (CONT’D)
                        Ruby. Nice to meet you. I’m 
                        impressed you made it this far. 
                        How’d you find me?

           Ruby doesn’t answer. She quickly assesses her surroundings 
           now lit by the flashlight, thinking how to get out of this -

           She’s at the bottom of an old abandoned mine shaft, flecks of 
           gold in the icy soil around her. The bottom is just a few 
           feet wide, much wider at the top. Part of a rusty BUCKET and 
           other detritus discarded from 100 years ago beneath her feet.

           Up at the shaft opening - Sapphire lights a cigarette. Grabs 
           a hose from beside her and TRICKLES GASOLINE down on Ruby. 
           The GLOW from her cigarette a real threat. She asks again.

                                 SAPPHIRE (CONT’D)
                        How did you find me?

                                 RUBY
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        If you want to be invisible you 
                        have to hide in plain sight, use 
                        other people as camouflage. This 
                        cabin’s off the grid entirely, no 
                        power, no mail - by trying to make 
                        yourself disappear, you just made 
                        yourself stand out more.

           Sapphire bobs her head - ah-ha. She takes a drag on her 
           cigarette, then walks Ruby through her options.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        Now, I know what you’re thinking - 
                        can I climb out? Well, you could 
                        brace yourself against the sides, 
                        get halfway up. Too wide after 
                        that, risk falling back down, 
                        breakin’ something. I doubt you 
                        have any newfangled tech in that 
                        backpack to get you out of this. 
                        Nope, you’re on your own now 
                        darlin’. By my count, you got one 
                        bullet left. So, you can either 
                        freeze to death - unless the wolves 
                        get you first - or you can use that 
                        last bullet. I’d prefer to go 
                        quickly, but you? Maybe you wanna 
                        take some time, reflect on your 
                        life, people loved and lost, was 
                        all of this worth it? I’ll be back 
                        in the morning, see what you chose.
           Sapphire goes to leave.

                                 RUBY
                        No! Wait! Wait-

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        Goodnight darlin’.

           The flashlight beam disappears as Sapphire walks off, leaving 
           Ruby in complete darkness.

           We hear Ruby RUMMAGING about and a moment later, she’s lit by 
           the cold white light of a SNAPPED LIGHT STICK in her hand. 

           The light reflects off the gold flecks in the mine shaft’s 
           soil walls. Ruby fumes for a beat, then - 

                                 RUBY
                        Fuck!!!

           INT. LIVING SPACE/KITCHEN - SAPPHIRE’S CABIN

           Sapphire enters her cabin. It’s basic. The downstairs is all 
           one room, the kitchen and living space separated by a 
           counter. Stairs lead up to the mezzanine loft bedroom above.

           She unplugs a space heater from an inflatable doll sitting up 
           in front of a roaring fire - the two heat signatures Ruby saw 
           - then heads into the bathroom. 

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT

           In the harsh light of the light stick, all of Ruby’s tech 
           hits the ground as she tips out her entire backpack. The 
           rusty bucket and mine detritus beneath.

           Ruby searches through everything - all she has is next gen 
           tech and weapons. She looks at the cell phone on her arm - no 
           signal down here. 

           Sapphire was right, she’s on her own. 

           INT. BATHROOM - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           Sapphire draws a bath and lights some candles. She wears a 
           plush red bathrobe, warm and comfortable.

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT

           Ruby shivers, staring up - 
           The opening at the top of the shaft is definitely too wide to 
           brace her body across. 

           She taps on her cell then aims it up at the shaft opening - 

           ON CELL SCREEN: the phone camera and the ‘measure’ function. 
           She taps on one side of the shaft opening then moves her 
           phone across, it settles on 6’1”. 

                                 RUBY
                        6 foot 1...

           Suddenly - an idea dawns on her. She rushes into action. 

           QUICK CUTS - Ruby uses her knife to destroy her tablet and 
           pull out wires. Twists the wires together to form one long 
           wire. She winds the long wire tight around the rusted metal 
           bucket, leaves the tail of the wire dangling at both ends. 

           She pulls the battery out of her laptop, and connects each 
           end of the wire to the laptop battery’s contacts with band 
           aids from her medical kit - one positive, one negative. 

           As soon as she makes the connection - the metal bucket 
           CRACKLES with electricity - Ruby’s made an ELECTROMAGNET. 

           She disconnects the battery so as not to electrocute herself, 
           then braces against the sides of the shaft. She starts 
           climbing as high up as she can get with the electromagnet.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           Sapphire relaxes in the bubble bath. She sips a glass of wine 
           and reads a book, something like White Fragility. 

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT

           Ruby gets halfway up the mine shaft - as high as she can 
           safely brace herself. She RAMS the side of the bucket into 
           the shaft wall, wedges it so she doesn’t have to touch it. 

           She connects the wire back to the battery again and the metal 
           CRACKLES, becoming a powerful electromagnet.

           EXT. FOREST - SAPPHIRE’S CABIN - NIGHT

           CLOSE on the snow where Ruby lightly buried her skis earlier. 
           Suddenly - the snow shifts. The ski tips poke out - magnetic, 
           and six feet long. 

           They begin to slide to the mine shaft. 
           INT. BATHROOM - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           Sapphire works through her nighttime skincare regime at the 
           mirror. Her long robe tied with a jiu-jitsu knot. 

           EXT. FOREST - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           The skis slide closer to the shaft opening, gaining speed. 

           EXT. ABANDONED MINE SHAFT

           With her back and feet braced halfway up the shaft, Ruby 
           exhales in frustration - no way of knowing if this is 
           actually working. Suddenly, her eyes light up, seeing -

           At the shaft opening - the tips of the skis! They slide, tip 
           down and drop -

           Right at Ruby - she quickly catches the skis as they fall. 
           She reaches out and yanks the wire from the electromagnet.

           Braced awkwardly, Ruby clips her boots into the skis, then 
           twists her body into an upright position - pushing down and 
           jamming the skis across the shaft so she’s standing up.

           Ruby climbs up the shaft by kicking her skis into the soil 
           walls, they brace her across the shaft as it widens, beyond 
           what she’d be able to reach. Steady progress towards the top.

           INT. LIVING SPACE/KITCHEN - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           Sapphire enters from the bathroom. Texting on her satellite 
           cell as she moves to the kitchen.

           ON SATELLITE CELL SCREEN (AS SHE TYPES): Ruby’s done. 

           She drops her cell into her bathrobe pocket, opens a kitchen 
           cupboard and grabs a mug. 

           EXT. FOREST - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           The SOUND of Ruby struggling. A moment later, her head 
           appears at the shaft opening. She’s near the top. 

           Ruby takes a moment, looks down at her skis - flexing and 
           braced at their limit, as far up the shaft as they can reach. 

           Suddenly - she LEAPS up - pushing her boots out of the skis - 
           clawing her way up the last of the soil wall until she 
           finally escapes and lands on the snow. 
           Ruby lies on the ground and gets her breath back. 

           INT. LIVING SPACE/KITCHEN - SAPPHIRE'S CABIN

           Sapphire places a mug of milk into the microwave and turns it 
           on - the mug spins around with a minute to heat. 

           She moves to the fireplace and tosses on a log. Quiet, just 
           the CRACKLING of the FIRE. But still, Sapphire’s expression 
           changes. She doesn’t turn around as she senses Ruby -  

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        You thought of a better use for 
                        that bullet?

           Ruby stands just inside the closed door. The gun in her hand.

                                 RUBY
                        Yep.

           Sapphire turns to her.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        Do you really wanna kill me that 
                        badly? You could’ve just gone back 
                        down the mountain, I would’ve 
                        thought the wolves got you.

           On Ruby’s arm, her cell phone VIBRATES. She ignores it.

                                 RUBY
                        My husband’s in a coma because of 
                        you-

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        In this line of work, I was 
                        surprised you had one.

                                 RUBY
                        Delete our data. Whatever you’ve 
                        shared with Atlas, take it all 
                        back.

           Sapphire gives her an incredulous look. Perches on the arm of 
           a worn armchair by the fire.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        You really think I can do that, put 
                        the genie back in the bottle?

                                 RUBY
                        If you’re as good as I think you 
                        are, yes.
           Sapphire smiles thinly, clear Ruby’s right. But still - 

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        You chose this job. It comes with 
                        consequences, for you and your 
                        family.

                                 RUBY
                        Do it, and I’ll let you live. You 
                        can enjoy your retirement-

           Sapphire TSKS.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        Does this look like the kinda place 
                        I’d retire? In this job they’ll 
                        never let you go, you keep killin’ 
                        till the killin’ kills you. But 
                        Atlas, they’re gonna give me 
                        everything I want, a whole new life 
                        - I only get it when every single 
                        one of you Gemstones is dead. Wish 
                        it weren’t so, but...

           She shrugs, the Gemstone’s deaths unfortunate but inevitable. 

           Ruby raises the gun at Sapphire. Determined, her jaw set 
           firm. She’s come this far, she can’t accept this. Not about 
           to give up now. 

           A moment as they stare each other down, until suddenly -

           PING!

           Ruby SPINS towards the sound - the microwave across the room.

           In the distraction - Sapphire SPRINTS the short distance to 
           the kitchen and DIVES over the counter - Ruby FIRES - 

           CLOSE on Sapphire’s robe - a bullet hole punches through the 
           fabric as she flies through the air over the counter -

           Landing hard on the other side. She braces herself back 
           against the counter, out of sight, stretches out with her 
           foot and opens the fridge door.

           By the front door - Ruby pulls a clip from inside her jacket 
           and reloads her gun. She strides to the kitchen just as -

           Sapphire grabs a gun from inside the fridge and spins on the 
           floor, FIRING as Ruby rounds the counter -

           Ruby recoils fast. She runs for cover, dives behind the sofa.
           PULL BACK to see the whole open kitchen and living space as 
           they both unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS at each other. 

           Both the sofa and the counter make ODD PINGS as the bullets 
           hit them - no shots penetrate.

           With Ruby - crouched behind the sofa as one of Sapphire’s 
           bullets goes wide - hitting the window behind her -

           Which does not break. 

           ON THE WINDOW - an IMPACT MARK on the glass - bulletproof 
           just like Ruby’s old apartment was. 

           Ruby stares at it, realizing - the sofa and counter are 
           shields, neither of them can be hit. She stops firing.

           With Sapphire - behind the counter, as she stops firing too. 

           Ruby and Sapphire take a breath, before they both have the 
           same thought in the same moment -

                                 SAPPHIRE (CONT’D)
                        You wanna fight-

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah.

           WIDE - they rise simultaneously from behind their shields. 

           A second, before they honor the agreement, drop their guns. 
           Sapphire steps out from the counter - fighting in her robe. 
           Ruby steps out from the sofa - fighting in her ski suit.

           Ruby’s expression sets hard, determined. So does Sapphire’s. 

           They CHARGE at each other - 

           Sapphire hits the hardest, TACKLING Ruby and LAUNCHING them 
           back over the sofa onto the rug in front of the fireplace. 

           Unlike the graceful martial arts fighting of Ruby and Kai, 
           this is up close and personal - Sapphire’s favored style is 
           wresting, she’s an elite jiu-jitsu fighter.

           On the rug by the fire, Sapphire beats the shit out of Ruby. 

           Ruby blocks against Sapphire’s close quarter blows but they 
           are relentless - barely space to protect herself, let alone 
           attack. A brutal onslaught by a more experienced fighter.

           Ruby stretches out for a log - she manages to grab it, uses 
           it to block Sapphire’s blows. She pushes herself backwards, 
           up to her feet again. All Ruby can do is block.
           But she’s not fast enough.

           Sapphire PUNCHES Ruby in the face - her nose EXPLODES with 
           blood as her head CRACKS back and FRACTURES a wall mirror 
           behind her. 

           Lightning fast, Sapphire spins Ruby around and gets her in a 
           strangle hold, pushes her hard up against the mirror.

           IN THE MIRROR - both their faces fractured across the smashed 
           glass. Sapphire’s is menacing, Ruby’s is bloody and bruised. 
           Behind them, in the reflection, a WINDOW that overlooks the 
           icefall at the back of the cabin. A bright, full moon.

           Ruby’s cell on her arm VIBRATES again. It’s ignored.

           Sapphire shoves Ruby painfully up against the mirror. Their 
           faces close, Sapphire speaks to Ruby’s reflection. 

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        You surprised me. Getting here, 
                        getting this far... but your form, 
                        every move you make is predictable. 
                        I know you, because I used to be 
                        you. And you can’t beat me.

           Ruby glowers at Sapphire’s reflection in the mirror - but 
           knows she’s right. Sapphire is the better fighter. If Ruby’s 
           going to win, she needs to do something truly drastic. 

           And Ruby has an idea. 

           She gathers herself, then braces her foot up against the 
           mirror and EXPLODES backwards, pushing them both across the 
           room as she turns, SHOVING Sapphire towards -

           The WINDOW that backs onto the icefall.

           Sapphire’s expression morphs with horror, realizing too late 
           as Ruby SMASHES them both through the window -

           EXT. ICEFALL - SAPPHIRE’S CABIN

           - Ruby and Sapphire FLY OUT into the freezing night air with 
           a SHOWER OF GLASS - they land at the top of the icefall and 
           SLIDE OUT -

           Illuminated by the bright full moon, both women scrabble to 
           try and find a hold on the ice and rock as they slide at 45 
           degrees, then vertically down the icefall.

           CLOSE on Sapphire’s hands as she manages to grab onto a large 
           rock protruding from the ice flow. She dangles by both hands. 
           CLOSE on Ruby’s ski glove as she manages to find a hand hold 
           in a rock depression. She dangles by one hand.

           Sapphire hangs a body length above Ruby. 

           Ruby looks down - the frozen river 30ft below. 

           Sapphire glares down at Ruby, then spots -

           Level with her, to her right - a sharp ICICLE the length of a 
           freeze pop hangs down from the icefall. Directly above Ruby. 

           Sapphire shifts her grip, holding onto the rock with one hand  
           as she reaches out for the icicle. She breaks it off -

           The ICICLE falls 6 feet, HITS Ruby in the shoulder and stabs 
           her like a knife - she CRIES OUT, just managing to hold on. 

           But for Sapphire, the stretch of breaking the icicle makes 
           her lose her grip on the rock and she falls -

           Right past Ruby, seconds after the icicle hits her.

           Sapphire’s fingers frantic on the ice - she manages to find a 
           hold, hangs on with one hand 20 feet above the frozen river. 

           Ruby is now 10 feet above Sapphire.

           CLOSE on their hands and feet, slipping, struggling to 
           maintain their grip on the ice and rock. 

           Ruby looks down at Sapphire, then all around her. Thinking of 
           the same idea. She looks up, and starts to climb up the 
           icefall. But she’s not heading for the cabin. 

           A few feet above Ruby, a MASSIVE ICICLE the size of a traffic 
           cone, pointing straight down at Sapphire.

           Sapphire sees what Ruby’s planning to do and looks around 
           desperately for another handhold, somewhere to swing to.

           Ruby reaches the massive icicle and HITS OUT, trying to smash 
           it off the icefall. But it won’t budge. Too hard and too big. 

           CLOSE on Sapphire’s foot, briefly finding a new hold... then 
           slipping off.

           Ruby grits her teeth and HITS out again, but nothing. She 
           looks down, knows what she has to do. 

           Ruby swings out and launches herself at the icicle, SNAPPING 
           it off but in doing so, PLUMMETING down after it.
           Sapphire looks up just in time - the huge icicle THUMPS her 
           square in the chest - a bloody shove off the icefall -

           She falls 20 feet down - hits the ice - the huge icicle in 
           her chest NAILING her to the frozen river as the ice 
           fractures beneath her - her blood finds the cracks and blooms 
           out under her like a crimson snowflake.

           Ruby THUDS onto the ice too, landing on her side 6 feet away. 

           They both lie, silent on the frozen river.

           Sapphire bleeds out quickly in her bathrobe. She turns her 
           head to look at Ruby. 

           Ruby’s exhausted, beaten and bloody. 

           Sapphire smiles thinly at Ruby, knowing she’s dying.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                             (weak)
                        Fair play. Didn’t see that one 
                        comin’. So, what do you wanna know 
                        about Atlas...?

           HIGH ANGLE on both women on the bloody ice. Lying close, 
           looking into each other’s eyes, finally laying it bare.

                                 RUBY
                        I don’t give a fuck about Atlas. I 
                        just want out. 

           In Sapphire’s eyes, a flicker of recognition, a connection. 
           Her breath slowing, she doesn’t have long left.

                                 SAPPHIRE
                        Don’t we all.

           She pulls her satellite cell phone from her robe pocket.

                        Wipe everything. This never 
                        happened.

           Just like all of Ruby’s jobs. 

           Sapphire taps on her cell screen with her thumb. Deleting all 
           the Gemstone’s information from Atlas, like Ruby asked. She 
           drops the phone on the ice and looks back at Ruby.

                                 SAPPHIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’re free.
           She smiles. Her expression fixes like this as she dies. Doing 
           one last good deed, woman to woman, in her last moment.

           Ruby’s lips part, her eyes wide in shock. She takes a beat to 
           absorb this unexpected gratitude.

           Her cell phone strapped to her arm VIBRATES again. This time 
           she looks at it.

           ON CELL SCREEN: a text message that simply reads: HE’S AWAKE.

           Relief washes over Ruby. Her body shakes with SOBS, which 
           soon turn into a LAUGH - she can barely believe it. Scott’s 
           OK, and finally it’s all over. She takes a moment -

           Then pushes herself painfully up off the ice.  

           EXT. SCOTT'S HOME - WEST VILLAGE, NY - TWILIGHT

           Ruby’s Land Rover is parked 50 feet down the street from 
           Scott’s house. 

           INT. RUBY'S LAND ROVER

           Ruby sits in the driver’s seat. Her wounds are patched up, 
           but she still has cuts and bruises. She stares out the 
           windshield at Scott’s house. Psyching herself up to get out 
           of the car, her fingers tap nervously on the wheel. 

           Suddenly, she stiffens off -

           THRU WINDSHIELD - Scott exits the house. He leaves the front 
           door open, gets on his knees and starts cleaning the step.

           Ruby takes deliberate deep breaths - breathing in, breathing 
           out, breathing in, breathing out - she gets out of the car.

           EXT. ENTRANCE - SCOTT'S HOME

           Scott bends over, cleaning the front step. The welcome mat is 
           gone, but a stubborn red tinge of his blood remains. He hears 
           feet on the steps and turns, surprised to see Ruby.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey.

           Ruby stops a few steps up. Visibly overwhelmed in the moment. 
           Her husband is safe, she’s leaving her job, everything is 
           going to be OK. 

           But there’s a distance between them, things still unresolved. 
                                 RUBY
                        Hi.

           Ruby smiles nervously. She sits on the top step, Scott leans 
           back against the door across from her.

                                 SCOTT
                             (concerned, re. injuries)
                        What happened to you, are you ok? 

           Ruby brushes it off.

                                 RUBY
                        Yeah I’m good. I’m great. Are you-

                                 SCOTT
                        All better. Thank you, they told me 
                        it was you who called the 
                        ambulance. Without you I’d probably 
                        be dead by now.

           Ruby smiles thinly - if only he knew what she’d been through.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        How did you know what happened, 
                        about the break in?

                                 RUBY
                        Uh, I still have notifications, for 
                        the security alarm. On my phone. 

           Well, that’s kinda true. And now she’s ready to start their 
           life together - properly this time. To be a family.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Scott, I-

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t. You don’t need to explain. 
                        It’s been long enough - whatever 
                        your reasons were for leaving, you 
                        had them. It’s OK.

           He’s not angry at her... He’s already moved on, and come to 
           terms with it. He speaks with the kindness of a stranger. 

           Ruby stares at him in shock, blindsided.

                                 RUBY
                        But... I have to, there’s so much 
                        to say-
                                 SCOTT
                        Stop, please. I’m sorry, but I 
                        can’t hear it. It’s too late. 

           Scott spots the wedding ring on her finger and frowns at it.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want it back, but you 
                        should stop wearing that.

           Ruby looks at her wedding ring and pales. No words.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Take care.

           Scott returns to scrubbing the step, eyes down. That was her 
           cue to leave. 

           Ruby doesn’t move. She just sits on the step and watches him, 
           absolutely heartbroken. Never crossed her mind that this 
           could happen. The chance of the family she wants disappearing 
           along with his rejection.

           Silent tears form in her eyes - she hurries up and away down 
           the steps, not wanting him to see her cry. 

           INT. RUBY'S LAND ROVER

           Ruby gets in and shuts the door. Her hand over her mouth, 
           stifling SOBS that turn into a full-on CRY now she’s alone. 

           Devastated, Ruby CRIES it out hard. She balls her wedding 
           ring hand into a fist and holds it tight, the thing she’s 
           drawn strength from the whole movie now causing her pain.

           She flips open the glove and pulls out a bottle of raspberry 
           Stolichnaya, opens it and takes a swig. She watches as -

           THRU WINDSHIELD - Scott finishes cleaning the step, goes 
           inside and shuts the door.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Night has fallen, it’s dark inside the car. The driver’s seat 
           is now pushed back and reclined, Ruby slumps in it. Can’t 
           bring herself to leave. 

           The vodka bottle half empty. Her eyes red raw from crying, 
           her face puffy, illuminated by light from -

           ON SCREEN IN THE DASH: the home video collection of Ruby and 
           Scott that she watched at the start of the movie plays. 
           They’re in the bathroom, agreeing to keep trying for a baby. 
           Ruby drinks deeply from the vodka bottle, torturing herself.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           In the driver’s seat, harsh dawn light illuminates Ruby’s 
           sleeping face. Been here all night. She wakes, groggy.

           Slowly, Ruby begins to gather herself.

           Shuts the near empty vodka bottle back in the glove.

           Her seat WHIRS as she moves it back into driving position 
           electronically. 

           She drinks a bottle of water, rehydrating. As she finishes 
           the bottle she notices her wedding ring, still on her hand. 

           Ruby stares at it, then goes to take it off. It’s stuck. Been 
           wearing it so long. She struggles, when her eye catches -

           THRU WINDSHIELD - 50ft away, Scott exits the house, heading 
           out for a run. He puts in earphones and jogs down the steps.

           Ruby watches him. Literally running away from her along the 
           sidewalk. He turns briefly to check for traffic before he 
           steps out to cross the street.

           Suddenly - Ruby’s car ROCKS as an AUDI Q5 drives past at high 
           speed. Heading straight for -

           EXT. SCOTT’S STREET

           Scott jogs, crossing the street, earphones in. Oblivious to 
           the danger, but regardless it’s too late as -

           THE AUDI HITS SCOTT AT SPEED. 

           His body flies up onto the windshield, launched high over the 
           car’s roof, landing with a sickening thud on the road. 

           The Audi SQUEALS to a halt 30 feet away.

           INT. RUBY'S LAND ROVER

           Ruby just stares, frozen in disbelief, as -

           THRU WINDSHIELD - the Audi suddenly REVERSES at speed, 
           DRIVING back over Scott’s body!

           Ruby’s hands fly up to her mouth, horrified - this is no hit 
           and run. She races out of the car.
           EXT. SCOTT’S STREET

           Ruby sprints to Scott in the road as the Audi drives away. 

           Scott’s body lies mangled and bloody. Eyes fixed open. 

           He’s dead.

           Ruby lets out a GUTTURAL NOISE, struggling with how to react. 
           She looks after the Audi, now stopped further down the 
           street, to see -

           A MASKED MERC looking back at her from the open driver’s 
           window. The Merc pulls their head back inside and speeds off.

           Ruby rushes into action, a picture of furious grief.

           She runs back to her Land Rover and climbs in. Her tires 
           SCREECH as she accelerates in pursuit. 

           EXT. 8TH AVE - MANHATTAN - SOON AFTER

           The Audi speeds out onto 8th Ave, followed seconds later by 
           Ruby’s Land Rover. Weaving and speeding through traffic.

           I/E. RUBY'S LAND ROVER

           Ruby wipes tears from her eyes, blinking them away to see 
           through the windshield after the Audi. Can’t believe this is 
           happening. She reaches out to her cell phone mounted on the 
           dash, taps the screen to make a call. It RINGS ONCE -

                                 MELLOR (FROM PHONE)
                        Ruby-

                                 RUBY
                             (borderline hysterical)
                        They killed him! They fucking 
                        killed him-

           Ruby’s Land Rover cuts up traffic, the Audi close up ahead.

                                 MELLOR (FROM PHONE)
                        Whoa slow down - are you OK, are 
                        you hurt?

                                 RUBY
                        I’m in pursuit - call you when it’s 
                        over.

           Ruby hangs up before Mellor can reply. A beat, before she 
           BANGS her hands on the wheel and SCREAMS out her pain.
           EXT. MERC’S AUDI

           The car mounts a sidewalk to avoid traffic. 

           LOOKING IN THRU WINDSHIELD - the Masked Merc reaches for a 
           gun, aims out the window and FIRES back at Ruby’s Land Rover.

           INT. RUBY'S LAND ROVER

           Ruby doesn’t even flinch as the bullets make IMPACT MARKS on 
           the glass - bulletproof. All great shots. 

           She reaches out for the TOUCH SCREEN embedded in the dash -

           ON TOUCH SCREEN: a LIVE STREET MAP keeps track as Ruby drives 
           through Manhattan. ICONS for traffic lights, the color they 
           are in real time. Ruby TAPS on the lights coming up ahead, 
           and they change color from green to red. 

           EXT. 8TH AVE AND W 23RD STREET

           CLOSE on the traffic lights, turning from GREEN to RED on 
           Ruby’s command.

           The Audi races for the lights - forced to SWERVE to avoid 
           traffic ahead coming to a stop - it turns left onto W 23rd, 
           speeding into the heart of Chelsea.

           Ruby’s Land Rover follows close behind. Ruby shoots out of 
           the open window - BANG BANG BANG - her shots PING off the 
           Audi’s trunk.

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - MANHATTAN

           Various traffic lights on different streets change color on 
           Ruby’s command, clearing the way and forcing the Audi to 
           follow Ruby’s route, west across the island.

           A high speed chase, Ruby funneling the Merc into a trap.

           EXT. 12TH AVE - MANHATTAN CRUISE TERMINAL

           The Audi speeds around a corner, onto a road bordering the 
           Hudson River. No sidewalks. 

           UP AHEAD - standstill traffic, the lights are on RED.

           The Audi has no choice but to swerve left - CRASHING through 
           metal gates, out onto -
           EXT. PIER 90 - MANHATTAN CRUISE TERMINAL

           Pier 90 is out of use - just one long, concrete dock. No 
           ships or vessels, and no one around.

           The Audi races along the pier, the end coming up fast with 
           nowhere left to go. 

           Ruby’s Land Rover speeds after the Audi, close behind. She 
           fires out of the window - BANG BANG -

           BOOM! The Audi’s rear tire BURSTS and it skids sideways, 
           SCREECHING to a stop right at the end of the pier. 

           The Masked Merc hurries out and starts to run -

           But Ruby’s Land Rover skids up 10 feet away. She levels her 
           gun out of the car window at the Masked Merc -

                                 RUBY
                        Don’t fucking move!

           The Masked Merc freezes, just a few feet from the edge of the 
           pier. They raise their hands and turn to face Ruby, the 
           Hudson River and Union City beyond it behind them. 

           Ruby keeps her gun on the Masked Merc and climbs out of her 
           car, holds them at gunpoint at the end of the pier. Her fury 
           and grief are at eleven, but the gun is firm in her grip.

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        Sapphire wiped us from the system. 
                        Why are Atlas still after me? Why?!

           The Masked Merc doesn’t reply. There’s no way out of this but 
           to slowly reach up and pull away their mask, to reveal -

           JADE. The Gemstone assigned to protect Scott.

           Ruby stares at Jade, open-mouthed. Her gun lowers a little. 

           With her hands up, Jade tries to logicize with Ruby.

                                 JADE
                        I was just doing my job.

                                 RUBY
                        But you were meant to protect him-

                                 JADE
                        My orders changed. I had no choice. 
                                 RUBY
                             (distraught, innocent)
                        Why?!

                                 JADE
                        Mellor couldn’t let you leave. 
                        You’re too valuable to let go.

           The gun drops down to Ruby’s side. Devastated, admitting -

                                 RUBY
                        Scott... he just left me. He was 
                        already gone.

           An “oh fuck” look sweeps Jade’s face. Genuine - 

                                 JADE
                        Ruby... I’m sorry.

           Ruby takes a moment in her vulnerable pain, before her anger 
           rises, along with the gun. She FIRES at Jade -

           Jade JOLTS in expectation of being shot -

           But the gun just CLICKS. Out of bullets. 

           Ruby’s operating with such wild abandon, her immeasurable 
           grief distracting her from keeping count.

           Jade sees her chance and RUNS. With nowhere else to go, she 
           SPRINTS the rest of the way to the end of the pier and DIVES -

           Into the HUDSON RIVER 10 feet below.

           Ruby runs to the edge of the pier and looks down, to see -

           Nothing but murky water SLOSHING against the concrete. Jade’s 
           nowhere to be seen.

           Ruby drops to her knees and WAILS OUT her grief to the river. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MELLOR'S LUXURY HOME - WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           CLOSE on Mellor’s face, deep in concentration, decorating a 
           black forest gâteau. Cherries delicately placed in cream.

           His expression falls, sensing someone behind him. He turns, 
           to see - 

           Ruby stands across the kitchen, on the other side of the 
           island. She looks upset.

           Mellor sighs, caring. Offers condolences like he’s a friend.
                                 MELLOR
                        Ruby, I’m so sorry about Scott. 
                        We’re gonna make Atlas pay for this- 

                                 RUBY
                        I know it was Jade. I know it was 
                        you.

           The atmosphere suddenly incredibly tense. Mellor’s serious 
           now. He switches to damage control. 

                                 MELLOR
                        I’m sorry. Truly. It was necessary, 
                        collateral damage. We need you to 
                        stay working, it’s what’s best for 
                        the country.

           Ruby almost laughs - how high and mighty that sounds. 

                                 RUBY
                        What about what’s best for me...? 
                        What about what I want?

           Mellor shoots her a look - don’t be so naïve. He leans back 
           against the counter as they talk. 

                                 MELLOR
                        Do you think I didn’t know you 
                        wanted to start a family? If you 
                        got pregnant, you’d quit - it was 
                        us who faked your identity being 
                        compromised in the first place, to 
                        make you leave Scott!

           BENEATH THE COUNTER - hidden out of view, Mellor pushes his 
           thumb on the underside of the counter - it GLOWS RED. He 
           pushes harder, but again, it glows red.

                                 RUBY
                        Are Atlas even real?

                                 MELLOR
                        Of course they’re real, none of 
                        this was us - you think we’d kill 
                        our own people? Atlas are 
                        criminals, we’re the government-

                                 RUBY
                        And you just murdered my husband.

           Mellor keeps pressing his thumb under the counter. Ruby 
           stares Mellor in the eye, knows what he’s trying to do.
                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        It won’t work. I locked you out.

           Mellor scowls. Pulls his hand away from the counter. 

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t know I’d quit, you 
                        didn’t even ask me-

                                 MELLOR
                        Oh come on Ruby - an assassin with 
                        a family and a career? Who are you 
                        kidding. Scott was your blind spot, 
                        we just exploited it.

           But now that she’s been betrayed by Mellor, Ruby’s starting 
           to realize the truth.

                                 RUBY
                        None of us can leave, can we? 
                        Sapphire didn’t retire - it was you 
                        that wouldn’t let her go. 
                             (remembering)
                        She said Atlas were gonna give her 
                        a whole new life, but only when all 
                        the Gemstones were dead... that was 
                        the only way she could get out, to 
                        do a deal with them and burn the 
                        house down behind her. It’s you - 
                        you’re my blind spot - been lying 
                        to me, to all of us, the whole 
                        time. 

           A flicker of desperation in Mellor’s eyes - he can see where 
           this is going. 

           He reaches back on the counter top - out of Ruby’s sight, his 
           fingers find a thick wooden rolling pin. 

                                 MELLOR
                        Look at the bigger picture. At the 
                        work you do, how important it is-

                                 RUBY
                        How many Gemstones have you lied 
                        to, manipulated? I’m gonna tell 
                        them all the truth. They can make 
                        their own choices, decide what’s 
                        best for themselves-

                                 MELLOR
                             (fury rising)
                        Ruby, you can’t do that! Face it, 
                        what you wanted was a fantasy! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MELLOR (CONT'D)
                        A woman like you, having a family, 
                        playing house-

                                 RUBY
                        I can have whatever the fuck I 
                        want.

           And with that, she raises the gun.

           In the same moment, Mellor swipes up the rolling pin and 
           lunges at Ruby -

           BANG! Ruby shoots Mellor right between the eyes.

           He CRUMPLES to the kitchen floor, dead. 

           Ruby puts her gun on the counter. 

           Cold blooded.

           She yanks off her stubborn wedding ring and places it on the 
           counter too - that chapter of her life is over.

           Ruby pushes her thumb down the island counter - it GLOWS 
           GREEN and the counter top slides open. Ruby glides out the 
           tablet screen, takes a moment, then starts to type on it. 

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        Mellor has retired. The Gemstone 
                        Initiative is under new management.

           INSERT CUT: a LATINA WOMAN runs hard along a beach, her cell 
           phone BEEPS and she looks at it, getting Ruby’s message.

           Ruby digs into Mellor’s black forest gâteau with a fork, 
           takes a bite. Her expression morphs to heaven - it’s so good.

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        We’re gonna do this right.

           INSERT CUT: an OLDER WOMAN has sex with a YOUNG MAN in a 
           closet, she looks at Ruby’s message on her smart watch. 

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        We all have our weaknesses. Our 
                        blind spots. But you deserve 
                        respect, enough to tell you the 
                        truth. 

           Ruby searches Mellor’s cupboards for a Tupperware. She finds 
           one, pops the lid open, fills it with cake. Taking the rest 
           of the gâteau with her.
           INSERT CUT: an ASIAN WOMAN rappels down a bridge at night, 
           she gets Ruby’s message on her phone strapped to her arm. 

                                 RUBY (V.O.)
                        I promise you’ll always get that 
                        from me. No matter how hard it 
                        might be to hear, and then you can 
                        make your choice. Decide what’s 
                        best. 

           INSERT CUT: Ruth sits in her diner, closed for the night, 
           having dinner with her WHOLE FAMILY. Happy. She gets Ruby’s 
           message on her phone, and her expression falls. Ominous.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - MELLOR’S HOUSE - SOON AFTER

           Ruby exits carrying the Tupperware and shuts the front door 
           behind her. She walks to her Land Rover, just as a battered 
           Honda comes up the driveway. 

           The Honda stops and the nanny, Conchita, gets out - bringing 
           Mellor’s Toddler home. 

           Ruby stops on the drive. Fuck. 

           Conchita lifts the little girl out of the back seat and 
           places her down on the driveway. Conchita makes eye contact 
           with Ruby, remembering her from before.

                                 CONCHITA
                        Hello.

                                 RUBY
                        Hey.

           Ruby’s mind goes a mile a minute, watching Conchita walk 
           slowly to the door holding the Toddler’s hand. Moments away 
           from finding Mellor’s body, from knowing it was her. 

           Ruby reaches for her gun, tucked into her back waistband. 

           The little girl watches her own feet toddle to walk on the 
           driveway and LAUGHS. Everything is funny when you’re three 
           years old. She stops and looks up at Ruby, recognizing her. 

           Ruby stares at the girl, deep in thought.

           Conchita reaches for the front door handle, when suddenly -

                                 RUBY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take her. 

           She turns to look at Ruby. Relief washing over her.
                                 CONCHITA
                        Are you sure?

                                 RUBY
                        Yes.

           Conchita EXHALES in gratitude, getting to avoid her horrible 
           boss. She leaves the Toddler and hurries back to her car -

                                 CONCHITA
                        Thank you, thank you.

           She drives off, leaving the Toddler and Ruby on the driveway.

           Ruby stares at the little girl a moment, then kneels and 
           holds her arms out wide. The girl GIGGLES and toddles over -

           Right into Ruby’s loving arms. 

           Warm hearted. 

           Ruby smiles, at peace in her new beginning, getting to have a 
           family and her job in a way she never could’ve imagined. 

           She leads the Toddler by the hand towards her Land Rover, 
           still carrying the Tupperware too. 

           As she walks, she spots a FAT GRAY CAT hop up onto a wall. It 
           looks very much like the one from the start of the movie. 

           Ruby gets an idea. Looks down at the little girl -

                                 RUBY
                        Hey. Should we get a cat?

           The Toddler looks up at Ruby, breaks into a big smile as we -

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
