           EXT. DUBAI - NIGHT

           The glittering skyscrapers of oil rich Dubai loom over the 
           Arabian sea. We pass through them and down the coast...

           ...to a PALATIAL ESTATE: luscious green gardens in the middle 
           of the desert, an olympic-sized swimming pool, ARMED GUARDS 
           lining the roof and patrolling the perimeter...

           We push into...

           INT. LIBRARY - PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - CONTINUOUS

           House music thuds in the background. There is a party 
           happening at the house, but this BRASS AND LEATHER LIBRARY is 
           where serious business happens.

           ANGLE ON: an IMPERIOUS CRIME LORD sipping tea at the head of 
           a massive antique table, surrounded by his HENCHMEN. This is 
           HAMZA (60s) head of “The Nizam,” a league of assassins.  

                                 HAMZA
                        We’re not having this discussion 
                        again. The peace with Skalnikoff 
                        and The Colony has been to 
                        everyone’s financial benefit. They 
                        take the lion’s share of western 
                        assignments, but the Nizam controls 
                        the east, and with it--

                                 TARIK
                        This isn’t peace. This is 
                        Skalnikoff waiting for our guard to 
                        drop, so he can strike. If you 
                        don’t come for him, he’ll come for 
                        you, father.

           ANGLE ON: TARIK (30s) at the opposite end of the table. He 
           has the bearing of an ungrateful prince: controlled by his 
           father and desperate to take his place. 

                                 HAMZA
                        I admire your ambition, my son, but 
                        you still have much to learn.

           In the background, the CLUB MUSIC cuts out and we hear 
           SCREAMS. The men at the table perk up, on high alert.

           A HENCHMAN peaks out the window, shakes his head to signal: 
           the roof is empty. The armed guards are gone. It’s too quiet.

           They are under attack.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Hamza nods to them. The men draw their guns and rush out of 
           the room. 

           Hamza motions for his son to stay.

                                 HAMZA (CONT’D)
                        Let them go. We don’t run, we wait.

           Frustrated, Tarik obeys. 

           INT. “NIGHT CLUB” - PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - CONTINUOUS

           Hamza’s armed men swarm into an empty IN-HOUSE NIGHTCLUB. The 
           party was clearly ended abruptly. There are broken glasses 
           and bottles everywhere, and the BODIES of SECURITY GUARDS--
           FELLOW SOLDIERS on the floor.

           The ARMED MEN cautiously disperse through the room, directed 
           by Hamza’s LARGE, FORMIDABLE GENERAL.

           KILLER POV: From the shadows, PREDATOR EYES case the room, 
           unseen by the guards...

           SLAM. One by one we see the armed men PICKED OFF by the 
           SHADOW KILLER. Fast, fierce, merciless.

           The GENERAL lets off a few panicked shots before he is thrown 
           to the ground like a rag doll, his own gun used against him.

           Whomever the killer is: they’re deadly efficient.

           INT. LIBRARY - PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - SAME TIME

           The VIOLENT SOUNDTRACK carries over to Hamza and Tarik. They 
           exchange looks, concerned. Tarik anxiously takes out his 
           phone to text for help...

           INT. HALLWAY - PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - CONTINUOUS

           The long, gilded hallway leading from the nightclub to the 
           library is STACKED WITH GUARDS. They are increasingly 
           nervous, checking their guns, fingers itchy on triggers. 

           The shadow enters the room and within moments every guard has 
           met his maker.

           We see the speed and devastation of the killer’s work but not 
           their face. Just the angel of death in a perfectly tailored 
           black suit. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. LIBRARY - PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - CONTINUOUS

           The SOUNDS OF SCUFFLING AND BODIES HITTING THE FLOOR. The 
           threat is clearly getting closer. Tarik looks at his father, 
           pleading. Hamza thinks, then:

                                 HAMZA
                        Go.

           Tarik pulls out a GOLD-PLATED GUN and rushes out of the room.

           We stay with Hamza, ALONE. He’s instantly older, and 
           impotent, listening to the approaching violence. He waits, 
           unguarded, growing worried at the sudden deafening silence.

           The door to the room opens. Hamza looks up, squinting to see. 
           A figure stands in the shadow.

                                 HAMZA (CONT’D)
                        Tarik?

           KILLER POV: the ASSASSIN walks toward Hamza. As he steps into 
           the light, we see A MYSTERIOUS TATTOO ON THE BACK OF HIS 
           NECK.

                                 HAMZA (CONT’D)
                        The legendary Geist. Of course he 
                        sent you.
                             (shakes head)
                        My son was right.

           KILLER POV: The assassin raises his gun but before he can 
           fire they both hear a gentle CLICK. 

           EXT. PALATIAL ESTATE - DUBAI - CONTINUOUS

           The house EXPLODES. Fiery sparks rain on the Arabian Sea as 
           we...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - HIGH SCHOOL, ILLINOIS - DAY

           A shower of sparks from a soldering iron. 

           We are looking into the circuitry of a small DOG-LIKE ROBOT. 
           We pull back to reveal a HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT at work.

           BENJI STONE (16). While his peers are having sex and learning 
           new dances on TikTok, Benji is building robots and watching 
           astronaut Mark Kelly videos...on TikTok. He’s lovable, 
           charming, clever, and deeply unpopular. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           The BELL RINGS. The teacher stops Benji on his way out.

                                 MS. PITT
                        Benji, great news. I talked to my 
                        friend in admissions at M.I.T. 

           RILEY MARKS, an all-state wrestler who’d make John DuPont’s 
           head spin, pauses on his way out the door...

                                 RILEY
                        M.I.Teeze nuts!

                                 MS. PITT
                        Riley Marks, you’re already on 
                        strike one, and you know what 
                        happens on strike two.

                                 RILEY
                        Nothing?

           Riley exits, giving Benji the finger on the way out.

                                 MS. PITT
                        If we can get her your essay on 
                        Monday she said she can sneak it to 
                        the top of the pile.

                                 BENJI
                        The mid-terms are Monday. I already 
                        have to study for those.

                                 MS. PITT
                        We both know you’re going to do 
                        fine on the mid-term, and this is a 
                        great opportunity, Benji. Pardon my 
                        English, but it’s fucking M.I.T.

                                 RILEY
                             (poking head back in)
                        M.I.Teeze Nu--

                                 MS. PITT
                        I’m actually glad you’re back. 
                        Let’s discuss academic probation-- 

           Riley literally RUNS AWAY. 

                                 MS. PITT (CONT’D)
                        Now, I’m late to meet my friend Sue 
                        at Slapshots bar and grill. So, as 
                        they say at Slapshots: you don’t 
                        have to go home but go home.

           Benji nods and heads out to:
                                        UNCLE WICK

           EXT. PARKING LOT - HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Hey, robot fucker!

           LAKSHMI MUKHERJEE (16) sits on the hood of a JEEP. She’s the 
           coolest kid in school, doesn’t put up with bullshit, and will 
           try anything once. She wears a SOCCER UNIFORM.

                                 BENJI
                        I don’t fuck robots.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        That’s stupid. If I could build 
                        robots, I’d fuck them constantly.
                             (then)
                        What took you so long? I feel like 
                        you were in the east wing forever. 

           ANGLE ON: Lakshmi’s PHONE pinging Benji’s location.

                                 BENJI
                        I shared my location with you for 
                        emergencies only. 
                             (then)
                        I thought you had practice.

           She pulls out a BRIGHTLY COLORED TIN of pre-rolled joints. 
           She looks around to make sure there aren’t any adults nearby. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (lighting up)
                        I got benched for smelling like 
                        weed. Is your mom going out of town 
                        on another girls trip this weekend?

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah. She’s leaving tonight. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Man, she loves hangin’ with her 
                        ladies! Speaking of, wanna go to 
                        Jenko’s party? 

                                 BENJI
                        I wasn’t invited. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        No one’s invited you fucking dork. 
                        It’s a party. You just go. It’s 
                        literally across the street from 
                        your house.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I can’t, I have to work on my 
                        M.I.T. essay.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh shit! Party at Benji’s!

                                 BENJI
                        Yes. Very cool party. Just me and 
                        my new babysitter.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        What happened to Mrs. Chen? She 
                        always “watches” you when your mom 
                        goes out of town. 

                                 BENJI
                        She retired and moved to Arizona. 
                        My Uncle Gideon is coming instead.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Wait, Uncle Gideon? Mystery uncle?! 
                        I thought he was dead? 
                             (passing Benji the joint)
                        Sorry. I thought he had passed.

                                 BENJI
                             (between puffs)
                        Apparently he’s been alive and just 
                        “busy with work” this whole time, 
                        and now he’s coming to babysit me 
                        because my mom is a fucking psycho. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Show Ruth some respect! She’s not 
                        psycho. Just very, very annoying.

           They get into Lakshmi’s brand new JEEP WRANGLER.

           INT. LAKSHMI’S JEEP - CONTINUOUS

           She clocks Benji watching HEATHER LANG on the SOCCER FIELD.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You could...now, hear me out...talk 
                        to her. 

                                 BENJI
                        You’re the one who’s supposed to 
                        put in a good word for me but you 
                        get benched before every practice.

           She shrugs. He plugs his phone into the car stereo.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        No. We are not listening to Drake.

                                 BENJI
                        Driver drives. Navigator is in 
                        charge of the music. 

           She groans as she puts the car in gear. They head home.

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - LATER

           They are high. Lakshmi sits on the bed PLAYING NINTENDO 
           SWITCH. Benji practices NUNCHUCKS. There are TAE KWON DO 
           TROPHIES on a shelf next to his SCIENCE FAIR TROPHIES. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        On God, I will fuck Riley Marks up. 
                        All you have to do is ask.

                                 BENJI
                        Thank you, but you have rage 
                        issues, and I don’t need that 
                        weighing on my conscience.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I don’t have rage issues.

                                 BENJI
                        All I said was Riley is annoying.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Speaking of something weighing on 
                        your conscience, if I give you a 
                        piece of Heather intel, promise not 
                        to let the police know I helped you 
                        plan her murder?

                                 BENJI
                        I’m not a killer. I’m a total 
                        sweetheart. But what do you know?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        She was supposed to go to the Fall 
                        Ball with Max--

                                 BENJI
                        This is common knowledge. You have 
                        nothing.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        --but he rescinded. His parents are 
                        getting divorced so apparently he’s 
                        too depwessed...
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        That’s nuts. If I’m him, I file for 
                        emancipation and take Heather to 
                        the dance as a legal adult. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Ha. When your parents got divorced 
                        you missed your daddy soooo m--

           RUTH (40s), Benji’s mom, enters. She’s smart, fit, and ultra 
           organized. A SMALL ROBOT DOG, like those Boston Dynamics army 
           dogs on YouTube but cuter, emits a horrible BARKING SOUND.  

                                 BENJI
                        Pasta, quiet.

           The robot dog, PASTA, goes quiet. 

                                 RUTH
                        You know I support your robotics, 
                        but can you please not make it bark 
                        at me. It raises my cortisol.

                                 BENJI
                        He barks cuz you don’t knock. And 
                        you can just say it stresses you 
                        out. You don’t have to use medical 
                        terms just because you’re an EMT.

                                 RUTH
                        But I am an EMT, so why not. Hi, 
                        Lakshmi, how’s DJ’ing going?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Good, thank you, I’m doing a 
                        residency at Hakkasan next month.

                                 RUTH
                        That’s wonderful.

                                 BENJI
                             (snorts)
                        You’re not even allowed to DJ 
                        school dances!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        That is because the cucks in the 
                        front office know I won’t play 
                        radio edits.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m heading to the airport, and 
                        your uncle’s here. So why don’t you 
                        come downstairs and say hello.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Mom, I tell you this every time you 
                        go out of town: I don’t need a 
                        babysitter! I’m sixteen!

                                 RUTH
                        You never complained this much when 
                        Mrs. Chen was watching you.

                                 BENJI
                        That’s because Mrs. Chen came over 
                        once every morning to make sure I 
                        was still alive, took a fancy 
                        seltzer, and then went home to 
                        watch TV. I could do whatever I 
                        wanted and it worked great!
                             (off reaction)
                        Lakshmi’s parents go away all the 
                        time and she never has a sitter.

                                 RUTH
                        She’s very lucky to have parents 
                        who are stronger than me.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Plus, we have a panic room.

                        Plus, they have a panic room.

                        I have Pasta. Pasta, attack!

           Pasta doesn’t move. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Your robot suuuuuucks.

                                 BENJI
                        Nothing is going to happen to me. 

                                 RUTH
                        You could fall asleep with a lit 
                        cigarette in your hand and catch 
                        the whole house on fire.

                                 BENJI
                        First of all, I don’t smoke 
                        cigarettes--

                                 RUTH
                        You better not smoke anything.

                        Someone could break in late at 
                        night and rape you. The world is a 
                        very dangerous place, Benji. 

                                 BENJI
                             (swinging nunchucks)
                        Yeah, that’s why I have a first dan 
                        brown belt in Tae Kwon Do.

                                 RUTH
                        Don’t nunchuck your mother. My Lyft 
                        is five minutes away. Come 
                        downstairs and meet your uncle. 

           Ruth exits. Benji looks at Lakshmi like thanks for your help.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        She loves you! She doesn’t want you 
                        to get raped. It’s very sweet!

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Benji and Lakshmi stop on the stairs and listen to Ruth 
           talking to a man who has his back to us.

                                 RUTH 
                        He’s a good kid. I’m actually 
                        excited for you two to finally get 
                        to know each other. You know who he 
                        reminds me of? Dad.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        How is father?

                                 RUTH
                        He...died, Gideon. Eight years ago.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Right.

           Benji and Lakshmi exchange a look: the fuck? They take the 
           last few stairs. 

                                 RUTH
                        Ah! Benji, sweetheart, this is my 
                        brother Gideon. Your uncle. 

           Reveal: UNCLE GIDEON, a middle-aged man in ill-fitting DAD 
           JEANS and an ill-fitting UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SWEATSHIRT. 
           He wears a bulky CARHARTT JACKET with the collar pulled up, 
           and...a baby blue FROZEN HAT, complete with sparkly Elsa and 
           Olaf, pulled low over his eyes.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Uh, nice to meet you. You love 
                        Frozen huh?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What?

                                 BENJI
                        Your...hat.

           Uncle Gideon looks at him blankly. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes.

                                 RUTH
                        OK! My Lyft is here. 

                                 BENJI
                        You know, I could drive you to the 
                        airport if I had my own car.

                                 RUTH
                             (ignoring that)
                        I love you, Bub. Emergency numbers 
                        are on the fridge. There’s pizza 
                        money in the junk drawer. Go easy 
                        on your uncle. 

           She gives Benji a hug and a kiss. She exits. They stand in 
           awkward silence for a moment. Then:

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Hi, I’m Lakshmi.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m going to bed. Goodnight.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s 5PM.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Not in Thailand.

           Gideon goes upstairs. We hear the door to the guest room 
           close behind him. Benji and Lakshmi just look at each other.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Is it weird? 

                                 BENJI
                        Is what weird?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Having a pedo for an uncle? Because 
                        it’s so cliché?

                                 BENJI
                        You’re my worst friend.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I’m your only friend. 

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK reads 8:50PM. Benji is at his 
           computer. Lakshmi is playing video games. A pizza box lies on 
           the ground. We can hear MUSIC outside.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You really never met him before? 
                        What does he do?

                                 BENJI
                        I guess he worked in Asia? My mom 
                        said he does import-exports.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        What’s he importing? Little kids?

           Lakshmi looks out the window. Jenko’s HOUSE PARTY is raging 
           right across the street.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, your uncle’s asleep, I’m 
                        bored, let’s just go to the party! 

                                 BENJI
                        No. You said you’d me help with my 
                        essay! How’s this?

           We push in on Benji as he reads.

                        afraid of his own shadow. He wasn’t 
                        carefree, he just didn’t care. 
                        Never there when I needed him. I 
                        love my dad but I don’t want to be

                        Cool. I have to pee.

           Lakshmi leaves. Benji keeps typing. He sees Lakshmi’s 
           brightly colored tin of pre-rolled joints on his desk. He 
           opens it and lights one up.  

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - LATER

           The BEDSIDE CLOCK reads 10PM. Benji, clearly high, realizes 
           Lakshmi has been gone for an hour. He pulls out his phone and 
           pings her location. She’s across the street at Jenko’s party. 

           Benji takes another hit, decides to join her.

           EXT./INT. JENKO’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           MUSIC IS BLASTING, there are TEENAGERS EVERYWHERE. It’s a 
           house party! Some kids are flying a DRONE. Benji has styled 
           his hair and put on his nicest hoodie.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You made it!

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah, how was the “bathroom”?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh, I lied about going to the 
                        bathroom. I came here instead.

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah! I know!

           He holds up his phone: he’s been tracking her movements.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Ew! Pervert! 

                                 BENJI
                        You set this up!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Couldn’t keep up with your slippery 
                        ass at Six Flags.
                             (off his reaction)
                        Now, let’s get you a beer!

           They head to the BACKYARD. Lakshmi is clearly popular, Benji 
           clearly is not. The KEG sits in a little UTILITY SHED. 
           Lakshmi pours a beer. Another DRAKE song starts to play.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Oh hell no!

           Benji pours half of a beer when the keg taps out. 

                                 RILEY
                        Shit! We’re tapped! BB Eight tapped 
                        the fucking keg!

                                 BENJI
                        Oh, wow, you’re calling me BB Eight 
                        because I like robots? Well, joke’s 
                        on you because Star Wars is cool, 
                        and BB Eight is cool.

                                 RILEY
                        It’s short for Bitch Boi Ate a 
                        Dick.

           CLINT WEST, a peach-fuzz-mustachioed asshole, grabs a bucket 
           and people start throwing in cash. He turns to face Benji, 
           thrusting the bucket in his face.

                                 CLINT
                        Let’s go, Bitch Boi. This is your 
                        fault.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        All I got was half of a warm, flat 
                        beer, how is this my--Fine.

           Clint is just glaring. Benji throws money in the bucket.  

                                 CLINT
                        Riley! Beer run, babyyyy!

           Clint and Riley leave. Benji looks around: Lakshmi has gone 
           off, upset about the music, leaving him on his own.

           He wanders the party. He sees JENKO and some kids huddled 
           around the drone, which is no longer working. 

                                 JENKO
                        Fuck. My dad said he’d make me pay 
                        if we had to get a fourth one!

                                 BENJI
                        I might be able to fix it.

           The kids let him work. Some even gather to watch. After a 
           moment, the drone is flying again. They’re impressed! 

           Until the drone starts spiraling faster and faster and then 
           CRASHES onto the roof. 

                                 JENKO/KIDS
                        Boo!/Fuck you, BB!/Eat shit, BB!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You suck, BB Eight!

           Benji gives her a look: you, too?! She shrugs, smiling.

                                 BENJI
                             (to Jenko)
                        Sorry.

                                 JENKO
                        Don’t be sorry. Fucking go get it.

           EXT. ROOF - JENKO’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji climbs out a bedroom window onto the roof and carefully 
           walks to the drone. He picks it up and gives a thumbs up to 
           Jenko, who’s angrily waiting on him. Then Benji’s face falls. 
           He sees a BABY BLUE FROZEN HAT moving through the crowd.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh god.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Benjamin?!

           Benji takes the drone and scrambles back inside.

           EXT. BACKYARD - JENKO’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji finds Uncle Gideon in the middle of a house party with 
           all of his peers. He is completely mortified.

                                 JENKO
                        Benjamin! Your dad is here!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m not his father, I’m his uncle.

                                 BENJI
                             (to Uncle Gideon)
                        Come on, let’s go.

                                 JENKO
                             (to Benji, mocking)
                        What, does he follow you everywhere 
                        to make sure you’re safe?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. I’m babysitting him.

           He could not have said a more embarrassing thing. The kids go 
           insane. Benji looks around - everyone is staring and 
           laughing. Including Lakshmi! And... 

           ...as if it could be any worse, Benji sees Heather Lang 
           standing nearby, watching with pity. 

           Benji is dying inside. He grabs Uncle Gideon and drags him 
           out of the party. Lakshmi goes to follow them, but Benji 
           glares at her and she backs off. 

           They make it out of the house and cross Jenko’s front lawn.

                                 BENJI
                        Why did you come over here?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I need a drink. 

                                 BENJI
                        SO?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I don’t know the area.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I don’t think anything’s even open--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’ll drive. 

           Uncle Gideon presses a KEY FOB, unlocking a $300,000 BLACK 
           MCLAREN LUXURY SPORTS CAR parked on the curb. 

                                 BENJI
                        Wait. That’s your car?

           As if in response, the SCISSOR DOORS glide up. Uncle Gideon 
           gets in, touches the ignition. The engine purrs. Benji 
           excitedly jumps inside. 

           He doesn’t even have time to buckle up before Gideon punches 
           the car into gear and they speed off--fast.

           Benji grips the dashboard and the hand-rail for dear life as 
           they tear down the quiet suburban street and...

           EXT. CITY STREETS/HIGHWAY - DRAG RACE - CONTINUOUS

           Uncle Gideon takes Benji on a white knuckle, death defying, 
           Fast and Furious style drive through suburban Illinois.  

           90 miles an hour, Tokyo Drifting around curves. He pulls onto 
           the highway and tailgates behind other vehicles, using the 
           slipstream to pull ahead even faster. 

           Back on the streets, he pauses at a RED LIGHT. Benji looks 
           over to see Clint and Riley in a CRAPPY CAR heading back from 
           their beer run. They see Benji in a MCLAREN. Their jaws drop.

           Benji smiles, and starts to give them the finger but has to 
           catch his balance as Gideon hits the gas again, running the 
           red, easily slipping between the ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

           The drive is exhilarating, and nauseating. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        That place looks open.

           Gideon yanks the HANDBRAKE to pull the car into a shuddering, 
           burnt rubber, 180-degree spin ending in a complete stop. 
           Gideon’s totally calm. Benji breathes hard, his face drained.

           EXT. DENNY’S - CONTINUOUS

           REVEAL: Uncle Gideon’s insanely fancy sports car is parked 
           outside of a run-down DENNY’S. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. DENNY’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Uncle Gideon and Benji sit in a booth. A bubbly, unassuming 
           SERVER comes up to take their order.  

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Welcome to Denny’s. What can I get 
                        you guys? 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’ll take a Hibiki 17, neat, with a 
                        water back. And I’m hungry. 
                             (looking at Benji)
                        You look weak.
                             (off reaction)
                        We’ll have two omakase. 

           The server looks deeply confused. 

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        I’m so sorry, what...what?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        One Hibiki 17, neat, water back, 
                        two omakase. 

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Right. So, I’m not sure which 
                        Denny’s you go to, I know that 
                        there are some regional 
                        differences, but I don’t think we 
                        carry any of those particular items 
                        at the moment. But if you’d like to 
                        take a look at our menu, we’ve got 
                        a lot of delicious options. 

           The server helpfully opens Gideon’s menu for him. Gideon 
           glares at it.

                                 BENJI
                        I’ll just get a cheeseburger, 
                        medium rare, cheddar, ketchup, no 
                        mayo, fries, and a Coke.

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Party time. Excellent. For you sir?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What blended Japanese whisky do you 
                        have? 

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Let’s see, we have...Coke, Diet 
                        Coke, Sprite, Diet Sprite, Barq’s. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Uncle Gideon glares at Benji.

                                 BENJI
                        I told you nothing was open.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Water.

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Rock n’ roll. Anything to eat?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (ultra serious)
                        Parmesan chicken sizzlin’ skillet. 

           The server heads off to put in their order.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        This place is disgusting.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s not that bad. It’s a Denny’s.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        The town. Everything.

                                 BENJI
                        Well, you can go. I don’t need a 
                        babysitter.
                             (off his grunt)
                        How come I’ve never met you?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’ve been busy. With...work. 

                                 BENJI
                        Work?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Imports. Exports.

                                 BENJI
                        You’re a drug dealer.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        My mom would tell these crazy 
                        stories about you sometimes, you 
                        were this larger than life 
                        character, like...Santa Claus...if 
                        everyone thought Santa Claus was a 
                        drug dealer and everyone assumed 
                        Santa Claus was dead because Santa 
                        Claus had disappeared.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I was...working.

                                 BENJI
                        OK but, you never had vacation or 
                        whatever? Most jobs you get, like, 
                        two weeks vacation.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        You wouldn’t have wanted me around.

                                 BENJI
                        Why not? You’re such a ray of 
                        sunshine!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        People around me tend to get...

                                 BENJI
                        Depressed? 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Dead. 

           This sits heavy for a second and then Benji starts laughing. 

                                 BENJI
                             (mocking)
                        People around me tend to 
                        get...dead.
                             (normal voice)
                        I’m sorry, that’s fucking corny. 
                        What the fuck do you do, man?! 
                        What’re you importing?! Boot cut 
                        jeans?! 

           Before Gideon can answer, the server returns with their food. 

                                 DENNY’S SERVER
                        Alriiiiighty then. We’ve got the 
                        burger and Coke, and the parmesan 
                        chicken sizzlin’ skillet, yum yum. 
                        Do we need anything else right now?
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Gideon gives the server a dark, penetrating, dangerous stare.

                                 DENNY’S SERVER (CONT’D)
                             (unflappable)
                        OK great! You need me, my name is 
                        Dougie. Enjoy!

           The server leaves.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What do you do, Mr. Questions?

                                 BENJI
                        I’m sixteen...I’m...in high school. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Is that what you want to do with 
                        your life?

                                 BENJI
                        What? No. That’s not even...an 
                        option. I want to build robots.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What kind of robots?

                                 BENJI
                        Do you know about Paro?
                             (off non-reaction)
                        Paro is this really cool Japanese 
                        robot, it’s like a stuffed seal but 
                        it helps senior citizens who are 
                        lonely. They can pet it and talk to 
                        it, and a lot of them develop 
                        really strong emotional attachments 
                        to it.
                             (then)
                        Anyway, I want to invent emotion-
                        based robots like that. Eventually.

           Long beat. Uncle Gideon stares at him. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Let me give you some advice: life 
                        is short, so you might as well do 
                        whatever the fuck you want to do. 
                        Be whoever the fuck you want to be. 
                        Fuck whoever the fuck you want to 
                        fuck...Et cetera.
                             (suddenly concerned)
                        Benji, give me your knife.

           Benji sees Uncle Gideon watching a MAN IN KHAKIS enter the 
           bathroom. This man seems to have rattled Uncle Gideon. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Benji slides the knife from his place-setting across the 
           table.

                                 BENJI
                        What’s wrong with yours?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No, give me your real knife.

                                 BENJI
                        I don’t have a knife.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Everyone has a knife.

                                 BENJI
                        ...I don’t.

           The MAN IN KHAKIS exits the bathroom, stops at their table.

                                 MAN IN KHAKIS
                        Steve? I was just talking about 
                        you. I was telling Kyle, we’ve 
                        gotta go back to Palm Springs. That 
                        shit was cray. Lemme get a pic!

           The man snaps a SELFIE with Gideon before he can turn away.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m not Steve.

                                 MAN IN KHAKIS
                        Oh, sorry, buddy, you look just 
                        like this guy Steve from my brother-
                        in-law’s bachelor party.
                             (off his look)
                        OK. You guys have a great night. 

           Gideon watches the man head to the doors. The man looks back 
           with a smile and an awkward wave as he exits the restaurant.

           Uncle Gideon takes out a SMALL GLASS BOTTLE and places an EYE 
           DROP in EACH EYE.

           He grabs the PLEATHER-BOUND DESSERT MENU.

           Through the window, they can see the man in khakis making a 
           phone call as he walks across the parking lot.

           Gideon throws HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS on the table and leaves. 

                                 BENJI
                        Hey! I’m still eating!
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Benji counts the money, pockets a couple excess hundreds. He 
           tries to finish the burger quickly as he stands to leave.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DENNY'S - CONTINUOUS

           We follow behind Gideon as he crosses the parking lot toward 
           the man in khakis. From behind, Gideon’s hulking silhouette 
           moves with a familiar determination...

           He pulls down the collar of his Carhartt jacket and we see 
           it: the mysterious tattoo on the back of his neck. 

           It’s him. THE ANGEL OF DEATH FROM DUBAI.

           Uncle Gideon rips the plastic binding from the dessert menu, 
           stretching it between his fists like a GARROTE. 

           As Gideon gets closer, we hear the man in khakis on the 
           phone:

                                 MAN IN KHAKIS
                             (quietly)
                        I know Geist is dead, but I’m 
                        telling you...It’s him! Look at the 
                        photo I just sent. I spotted him at 
                        O’Hare, followed him here, and it’s 
                        fucking him. When Skalnikoff finds 
                        out, he’ll put out a bounty. And 
                        I’ll be here to collect...What? I’m 
                        in a parking lot. Oh, what city? 
                        Shit, I don’t--

           Sensing the threat, the man turns quickly and throws his 
           hands up as GIDEON CHOKES HIM WITH THE HOMEMADE GARROTE.

           Gideon’s violence is swift, and brutal. And this unassuming, 
           sunburned man in khakis FIGHTS BACK!

           Hands tied to his own neck, the man does a quick bow, 
           throwing Gideon overhead. Gideon recovers and returns with a 
           flurry of punches, kicks, flying elbows. 

           Benji emerges from the restaurant to find his Uncle and the 
           man in khakis fighting brutally. Suddenly, we are watching 
           Raid: Redemption in the middle of a Denny’s parking lot. 

                                 BENJI
                        What the fuck?!

           He pulls out his phone and films them. Gideon clocks this, 
           displeased, but he’ll deal with it later. For now...
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Uncle Gideon judo-throws the man into a parked car, smashing 
           a window, shearing off the side mirror. The man drops.

           But the man just laughs as he gets back up to his feet. He 
           pulls out a short, curved, tactical knife.

                                 MAN IN KHAKIS
                        Geist.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Kravitz.

                                 MAN IN KHAKIS/KRAVITZ
                        I say to myself, no. You’re dead. 
                        But here you are. I could never 
                        forget the man who gave me this.

           Kravitz traces the tip of his blade down a long, thick scar 
           running the length of his neck from some age-old battle. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I recognized you, too, Kravitz.

                                 KRAVITZ
                        From the scar you gave me.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No. Because you talk too much.

           THE FIGHT RESUMES: The two men are both highly skilled, 
           landing devastating elbows and knees, blocking fatal knife-
           wounds, roundhouse kicking each other into oblivion. 

           Uncle Gideon grabs the thick-bound cover of the dessert menu 
           and uses it to block Kravitz’s knife-slashes.

           He punches the menu into Kravitz’s throat, driving it home 
           with his fist like a hammer to a nail.

           Benji watches in shock, his phone capturing the whole thing.

           Kravitz tackles Uncle Gideon and mounts him, the knife edging 
           toward Gideon’s face.

           Gideon rolls Kravitz, taking the mount, gripping Kravitz’s 
           knife-hand in his hands and forcing Kravitz to stab himself. 
           With the plastic menu binding looped around Kravitz’s neck, 
           Gideon chokes him until he stops moving.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh no. Oh no oh no oh no!

           Uncle Gideon breathes hard as he rolls off Kravitz. Then, 
           without missing a beat, he drags the body toward the car. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Relax. 

                                 BENJI
                        DON’T TELL ME TO RELAX, YOU JUST 
                        KILLED SOMEONE!
                             (then)
                        With a DENNY’S DESSERT MENU!
                             (then)
                        I’m calling the cops.

           Benji dials. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (very darkly)
                        No. 

           Benji puts the phone away. Gideon struggles to load Kravitz’s 
           body into the car, which isn’t easy to do, it’s a two-door.

           Benji notices the dead man has the same CRYPTIC TATTOO as his 
           uncle, but on the back of his hand.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (O.C.)
                        We received a disturbance call. 
                        Everything OK over here? 

           A MALL SECURITY PATROL CAR has pulled up.

                                 BENJI
                        No! This guy just--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Had too much to drink. Everything 
                        is fine, officer.

           The security guard clocks the shoe that has fallen off of 
           Kravitz’s dead foot. The broken glass. The pool of blood. 

           He picks up his radio to call for back up.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t. 
                             (then, darkly)
                        There’s a traveler, on an endless 
                        road. It’s night. It begins to 
                        rain. He comes upon a farmhouse.

           The Security Guard is frozen, SUDDENLY HYPNOTIZED by Gideon’s 
           words: his deep baritone, his soul-shaking gaze... 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Uncle Gideon is the ancient mariner. The voice of hell. His 
           words are the only words that have ever mattered. The 
           Security Guard is entranced, the radio falling to his side.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        He asks the farmer if he can take 
                        shelter in the barn until the storm 
                        passes. The farmer agrees, and 
                        offers him warm food, fresh milk, 
                        and a blanket. In the morning, the 
                        traveler is gone, the farmer is 
                        dead, and the farmhouse and barn 
                        have been burned to the ground.

           They stare at each other. Benji watches in awe.

                                 BENJI
                             (quietly to self)
                        What?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                             (shaken)
                        You can’t help some people unless 
                        they want to be helped. 
                             (off Gideon’s silence)
                        My cousin Tom’s a drinker. It’s 
                        sad, really. 
                             (then)
                        You fellas have a good night. Get 
                        your friend home safe.

           The Security Guard drives off, picking up speed, exiting the 
           mall parking lot entirely and disappearing up the road.

           Benji turns to the car and sees that Kravitz is gone.

                                 BENJI
                        Uh, Uncle Gideon?

           Benji looks up to see KRAVITZ’S BLOODY GRIN, the knife handle 
           swinging at Benji and slamming him right between the eyes 
           with a CRACK. Benji’s vision blurs as he sees Gideon’s 
           looming shadow rise behind Kravitz and twist his neck--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Benji wakes up in his own bed, on top of the covers, in the 
           same clothes he wore the night before. 

           Benji looks around: everything seems so normal. Did he dream 
           it? But it was so real. Then he notices...
                                        UNCLE WICK

           LAKSHMI’S BRIGHTLY COLORED TIN OF PRE-ROLLS on the 
           nightstand. He sighs, relieved. Maybe he was just high. 

           He sits up, grabs his phone. He texts Lakshmi: “Your weed is 
           too strong. I think I got roofied.”

           Lakshmi replies: “Oh yeah. I heard all the girls at school 
           talking about how bad they wanted to roofie you.” Then: 
           “Don’t smoke my weed without me rude!”

           INT. UPSTAIRS/DOWNSTAIRS - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He leaves his room and notices the GUEST ROOM DOOR across the 
           hall is ajar. He peeks inside: it’s IMMACULATE. 

           The bed is made. Nothing is out of place. No sign of Gideon.

           Benji goes to the KITCHEN and makes a bowl of cereal. 

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He takes the cereal back to his room and sits at his desk. He 
           swipes through his phone. He realizes the video he took in 
           the Denny’s parking lot is still there. Oh shit. He presses 
           play as he lifts a spoon of cereal to his lips.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (O.C.)
                        Give me your phone.

           Benji SHOCKS at the voice, spilling cereal everywhere. He 
           turns to see Uncle Gideon, dressed in the same ill-fitting 
           clothes, sitting stock still in a chair in the corner. 
           Somehow, Benji didn’t notice him there. How long was he...

                                 BENJI
                        Fuck!
                             (then)
                        Oh...FUCK! 
                             (re: video)
                        Did we...did we kill a guy?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I killed Kravitz. You were 
                        unconscious. Give me your phone.

           Benji obeys. Uncle Gideon motions to the incriminating video.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        Has anyone else seen this? 

           Benji shakes his head. Gideon deletes the video. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        WHO ARE YOU?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m your uncle, Gideon.

                                 BENJI
                        Are you a spy?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Spies are losers. Regional 
                        marketing VPs with lipstick cameras 
                        in the pockets of their spread 
                        collar Hugo Boss shirts. 

           There is a long, awkward pause. Then:

                                 BENJI
                        WHAT?!
                             (then)
                        OK. So who the fuck are you? You 
                        drive an eight million dollar 
                        sports car, people want to kill 
                        you, but they can’t because you’re 
                        too good at killing them, you Tokyo 
                        Drift all over the place, you’ve 
                        got weird tattoos, no one has seen 
                        you in nine hundred years, you 
                        order sashimi at Denny’s, you only 
                        drink Japanese scotch--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Japanese whisky. Scotch is from 
                        Scotland.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh my GOD!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sit down.

           Benji has been pacing, freaking out. He sits.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        I need you to relax.

                                 BENJI
                        You want me to relax?! You just 
                        made me accessory to murder! You 
                        just destroyed evidence.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Evidence. That’s a very strong word 
                        for a twelve year old. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I’M SIXTEEN!
                             (then)
                        Wait, did you actually think I’m 
                        twelve years old?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (clearly yes)
                        No.

                                 BENJI
                        The man you killed...what if his 
                        friends or somebody comes looking 
                        for him?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        People like Kravitz and I don’t 
                        have friends.

                                 BENJI
                        Right, OK, you always kind of focus 
                        on the wrong part of my questions.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Why aren’t you in school?

                                 BENJI
                        It’s Saturday.
                             (off blank reaction)
                        There’s no school on Saturdays. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Right. OK. Good.

                                 BENJI
                        I do have driver’s ed, though.
                             (off blank reaction)
                        Driver’s education?
                             (off blank reaction)
                        A teacher teaches me how to drive. 
                        A car.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Cancel it. It might not be safe.

                                 BENJI
                        No. Unless you want to teach me how 
                        to drive in your three hundred 
                        thousand dollar McLaren, I’m not 
                        skipping it. I want to get my 
                        license.
                             (then)
                        Besides, if I try to cancel, 
                        they’ll just call my mom. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           ANGLE ON: Uncle Gideon considering this. 

           INT. DRIVER’S ED CAR - DAY

           Benji is at the wheel of an old SCION. His INSTRUCTOR, MR. 
           LIPSCOTT, an overly anxious man, is in the passenger seat. 
           Uncle Gideon is in the back, brooding in his Frozen hat.

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                        Seatbelt, buckled. Check your 
                        mirrors. Foot on the brake.  

           Gideon leans forward, adjusts the mirror to eye the angles.

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT (CONT’D)
                        You know, Mr. Stone, if you’re 
                        uncomfortable, you are welcome to 
                        wait in my office for our session 
                        to end. It’s what most parents do.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m not his parent. 

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                        Right, I just mean--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m fine. 

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                             (moving on)
                        And reverse. Check the mirrors, 
                        don’t just rely on the camera. 

           The car jerks backwards. Gideon looks skeptical.

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That’s OK. Easy on the gas. Now put 
                        her into gear. And...we’re driving.

           They drive, slowly. Uncle Gideon is constantly doing threat-
           assessment in back.

           They get to a stop light. A MOTORCYCLE pulls up next to them.

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Good, always check your mirrors. 
                        Now, when it turns green--

           The light turns green. Benji advances. The car JERKS to a 
           stop as the motorcycle cuts them off.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Sorry!

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                        Careful, Benji! You almost clipped 
                        that guy. We’re lucky I caught it.

           Gideon sees that Lipscott has his own GAS and BRAKE PEDALS. 
           Benji sheepishly accelerates back into traffic. 

           The motorcycle is now in front of them. Then, Gideon clocks a 
           SECOND MOTORCYCLE pull up behind them... 

           And the CHROME GLINT of a GUN. 

           Shit. 

           Gideon springs into action. He lurches forward and PRESSES 
           LIPSCOTT’S LEG DOWN, forcing his foot to slam on the GAS.

                                 BENJI
                        Uh, Mr. Lipscott?!

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                        What the hell?!

           The car RAMS the first motorcycle. Benji SCREAMS. The 
           motorcycle skids sideways, but the rider recovers. 

           Gideon grips LIPSCOTT’S OTHER LEG, forcing him to SLAM ON THE 
           BRAKE. The motorcycle behind them dodges their sudden 
           blockade and zips up to pull alongside. The gun aimed as...

           Gideon smoothly drags Lipscott out of the passenger seat and 
           into the back. He climbs up front.

                           BENJI
                                                  MR. LIPSCOTT (CONT'D)
           What the fuck?!
                                              What the fuck?!

           Now Benji is steering, but GIDEON CONTROLS THE GAS AND BRAKE. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Drive.

           He slams on the gas, Benji almost steers them straight into 
           the back of a CITY BUS idling at a red light. Benji jerks the 
           wheel last second and they hop into the next lane. 

                                 BENJI
                        Sorry!

           The two motorcycles are giving chase now. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Road.

           Uncle Gideon is deadly calm as Benji once again almost slams 
           the car into some CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. 

                                 BENJI
                        Shit. Sorry.

           He rights the car. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Take that ramp.

                                 BENJI
                        I haven’t driven on the highway 
                        yet!

           Gideon reaches over and grabs the wheel, yanks it. The car 
           jerks up a highway on-ramp. Except...

                                 MR. LIPSCOTT
                        This is the off-ramp!

           Benji is swerving to dodge cars, Gideon just hits the gas.

           One of the motorcycles misses the ramp and smashes into the 
           cement divider, flipping over the handlebars.

                                 BENJI
                        Sorry!

           The second motorcycle picks up speed. They pull alongside.

           Gideon rips the PARKING BRAKE sending the car into a spin. 
           The motorcycle just narrowly misses getting clotheslined.

           Gideon throws the car in reverse. Now Benji is steering as 
           the car races BACKWARDS into ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

           Gideon hits the gas and catches them up to the motorcycle.

           He quickly opens the passenger door to smash the bike out 
           from under the RIDER. He grabs them by the leg, they’re 
           hanging out the door, almost DRAGGING ON THE PAVEMENT. 

           The rider’s helmet kicks up SPARKS. 

           Benji screams as he weaves between traffic on the highway. 
           Mr. Lipscott has also started screaming. He might pass out.

           Uncle Gideon waits until they near a SEMI-TRUCK then YANKS 
           the parking brake again. The car spins. He lets go of the 
           motorcyclist and their body slides under the SEMI’S WHEELS.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           WHOOMP. Then, a moment later, WHOOMP.

           That’s it. The chaotic, turbo, driver’s ed lesson-turned-high 
           speed chase comes to an abrupt end. They are now just driving 
           straight ahead, with traffic, at the speed limit. Casual. 
           Normal. No biggie. Benji white knuckles the wheel, his 
           forehead soaked with sweat. 

           Uncle Gideon roughly forces the damaged passenger door shut 
           with a metallic shriek. Benji YELPS.

           A long, awkward beat. Gideon seems unbothered. But Benji and 
           Mr. Lipscott are melting in their seats.

           Hands shaking, Mr. Lipscott pulls out his cellphone. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No.

           Mr. Lipscott silently obeys and puts the phone away.

           EXT. DRIVER’S ED OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji sits on the curb, shaken. Inside, we see Gideon talking 
           to Mr. Lipscott, clearly giving him some version of the 
           “traveler” speech. 

           When he finishes, Mr. Lipscott looks deeply rattled. Uncle 
           Gideon exits and walks past Benji. He gets in his sports car. 

           Benji texts Lakshmi. “What r u doing now? Can u come get me?” 

           She responds: “Too high.” Then: “Watching old eps of 
           Riverdale.” Then: “The Ghoulies are fucked up!” Then: “But I 
           do want to try snorting Jingle Jangle.” Then: “U ok?”

           Benji considers his response then just texts: “Yeah.”

           Benji gets up slowly and shuffles over.

           INT. UNCLE GIDEON’S CAR - SAME TIME

           As Benji slides into the passenger seat:

                                 BENJI
                        We just killed two people.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        One of them might have survived.

           Uncle Gideon hands over a piece of paper. Benji stares at it.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        He says you passed. Here is your...
                             (reading)
                        “Learner’s Permit.”

           He starts the car and pulls out.

           INT. UNCLE GIDEON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 BENJI
                        Who were those guys? 
                             (off non-reaction)
                        You have to start telling me what’s 
                        going on or I’m gonna...call my mom 
                        and tell her you...tried to touch 
                        my penis! 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I would never touch your penis. But 
                        if I wanted to for some reason, 
                        there would be no “try,” I would--

                                 BENJI
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?!

           Uncle Gideon is reluctant to talk, but Benji is very upset.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        For most of my life, I have worked 
                        on behalf of a man named Igor 
                        Skalnikoff who runs an organization 
                        that helps important 
                        people...remove obstacles. 

                                 BENJI
                        What kind of obstacles?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Human obstacles. 

           Another long, awkward pause. Then:

                                 BENJI
                        You’re a fucking John Wick?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        A what?

                                 BENJI
                        Forget it. So, Igor Skalnikoff sent 
                        people on motorcycles to kill us? 
                        Why?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m sorry that you got dragged into 
                        this. A thirteen-year-old shouldn’t 
                        have to see such--

                                 BENJI
                        Sixteen. And I told you sixteen.
                             (then)
                        Why do people want to kill us?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Recently, I...resigned from this 
                        organization. The man who attacked 
                        us in the parking lot last night 
                        worked for Skalnikoff and informed 
                        him I am still alive. I believe he 
                        has put a bounty on my head. Thus, 
                        the men on motorcycles.

                                 BENJI
                        OK. That sounds...bad.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        The bounty does not concern me.

                                 BENJI
                        What does concern you? 

           But Uncle Gideon is done sharing.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        You don’t dress like a John Wick.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (looks down at outfit)
                        I’m supposed to be dead. I’m trying 
                        to keep a low profile.

                                 BENJI
                        Well, you look like a fucking 
                        airport gift shop exploded.
                             (then)
                        What should we do?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Unfortunately, Benji, you are now 
                        on the board, because if they can’t 
                        get to me directly, clearly they 
                        will try to get to me through you. 

                                 BENJI
                        Does “on the board” mean...
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        It means we prepare you for the 
                        game. 

           Music Cue as the TRAINING SEQUENCE begins.

           INT. TAE KWON DO STUDIO - TRAINING SEQUENCE

           Gideon and Benji enter a hole-in-the-wall karate studio. 
           SENSEI DAVE teaches kids how to do a straight-leg high kick.

           He ad-libs for them to keep practicing and approaches Benji 
           and Uncle Gideon. He gives them a deep, solemn bow.

                                 BENJI
                             (bowing)
                        Sensei Dave. This is my uncle. We 
                        were hoping we could train here 
                        today. 

                                 SENSEI DAVE
                        Of course, drop-ins are always 
                        welcome. We encourage potential new 
                        students to dip their toes in the 
                        deep, transformative waters of Tae 
                        Kwon Do. Have you ever done any 
                        martial arts before? 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes.

                                 SENSEI DAVE
                        Great! Well, you guys are welcome 
                        to hop in for the next class.

           Gideon wanders over to the WOODEN WING CHUN TRAINING DUMMY 
           where a 13-year-old practices. Gideon gently moves him aside.

                                 SENSEI DAVE (CONT’D)
                        We can loan your uncle a gi with a 
                        ten dollar cleaning deposit.

                                 BENJI
                        We’re not really here to take 
                        class. We just need, like, a place 
                        to train. 

                                 SENSEI DAVE
                        Our mats are a sacred space, Benji. 
                        You know that. They’re not a 
                        playground for rough housing and--
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Sensei Dave sees Gideon punching and kicking the wooden dummy 
           so hard that he’s smashing the thick, heavy spokes off, and 
           sending splintering cracks through the tree-trunk like base. 

           The children have stopped practicing to watch the strange man 
           demolish the wooden dummy.

                                 SENSEI DAVE (CONT’D)
                        You can use the Tae Bo room. 

           INT. TAE BO ROOM - TAE KWON DO STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji and Uncle Gideon face off in KARATE GIS. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Attack me.

                                 BENJI
                        Come on, man, I’m not gonna--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m sure Skalnikoff will be 
                        terrified when he learns of your 
                        first dan brown belt in Tae Kwon 
                        Do. Attack me.

           Benji tightens his fists. He didn’t like that last jab. He 
           does an elaborate and impressive TAE KWON DO KATA toward 
           Gideon: a rehearsed series of kicks and punches and blocks. 

           Gideon doesn’t move. He doesn’t blink. But the second Benji 
           is within striking distance, Gideon sends him flying with a 
           Judo throw. Benji lands flat on his back, gasping for air. 

           Still holding Benji’s arm, Gideon drops into an ARM BAR, 
           straining his nephew’s elbow joint against his hip. 

                                 BENJI
                        Tap! TAP!!!

           QUICK POPS of Benji trying different methods of attack, each 
           one ending in the same throw (a DROP SAYANAGI, a dramatic and 
           powerful shoulder throw) followed by a brutal ARM BAR. 

           INT. KITCHEN - BENJI’S HOUSE - DAY

           Benji sits at the DINING NOOK icing his arm with FROZEN 
           ORGANIC CAULIFLOWER. Gideon rifles through the drawers. 

           There is an ARRAY OF KITCHEN TOOLS AND UTENSILS on the table. 
           Gideon brings more. They are laid out in an orderly fashion.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Anything can be a weapon. Do you 
                        understand?

                                 BENJI
                             (nodding)
                        No.

           Uncle Gideon picks up a SPATULA.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What is this?

                                 BENJI
                        A spatula.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No. 

           He flips the spatula so the metal handle sticks out.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        It is a metal rod that can be 
                        driven through a man’s eye socket 
                        into his brain.

                                 BENJI
                             (horrified)
                        OK.

           Gideon puts down the spatula. He picks up a WINE KEY.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Do you know what ligaments are?

                                 BENJI
                        Oh God.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - TRAINING SEQUENCE

           The living room furniture has been pushed aside. Uncle 
           Gideon, holding the WINE KEY, is showing Benji where to cut 
           on a SAND-FILLED DUMMY.

           ANGLE ON: Benji’s face, horrified.

           Uncle Gideon holds out the WINE KEY and motions to the 
           mutilated dummy. Your turn.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN

           It is still dark outside. Benji is asleep. He is ROUGHLY 
           SHAKEN AWAKE. He groans, annoyed.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Skalnikoff doesn’t sleep, so 
                        neither do you. 

                                 BENJI
                        Unless he’s at the door with a 
                        machine gun, I’m tired.

           We hear the sharp TING of a knife being drawn. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        What, are you gonna stab me?

           Benji opens one eye to see Gideon holding the knife to Pasta.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Pasta! Okay, I’m up! I’m up!

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - LATER

           Gideon sips coffee while Benji demonstrates his new ligament-
           slicing KNIFE SKILLS on the dummy with the WINE KEY. 

           Gideon is unimpressed, but the kid is improving.

           INT. TAE BO ROOM - TAE KWON DO STUDIO - DAY

           Benji and Gideon train. Benji looks decent. He even manages 
           to pull off a wobbly attempt at Gideon’s drop sayanagi. 

           Then Gideon tosses him around again like it’s nothing. Sensei 
           Dave watches through the spectators’ window, taking notes. 

           INT. KITCHEN - BENJI’S HOUSE - DAY

           Benji is sitting with the kitchen utensils turned weapons, 
           sensing the power in them that he never knew existed. He 
           looks up as Uncle Gideon walks in the room.

           Gone are the dad jeans and glittery Frozen hat...

           Gideon’s hair is slicked back. His stubble is just so. He 
           wears a sleek, SHARPLY TAILORED BLACK SUIT over a FITTED 
           BLACK SHIRT and a SKINNY BLACK TIE. Now he really does look 
           like John Wick. Now he looks like a fucking assassin.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Holy shit.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I need a drink. 

           INT. APPLEBEE’S - LATER

           They sit in the booth of another suburban chain restaurant. 
           They have a bunch of plates of various American foods. 
           Another UPBEAT SERVER arrives with a glass of WHISKEY.

                                 APPLEBEE’S SERVER
                        We didn’t have Habuki 16 or 
                        whatever, but Mike, our bartender, 
                        said Glenlivet is really good.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (disgusted)
                        Fine.

           Uncle Gideon sips the whiskey with a grimace. He returns to 
           the food, which he is clearly enjoying.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s good, right?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. It’s been a long time since 
                        I’ve had macaroni and cheese, and 
                        it never tasted like this.

                                 BENJI
                        Well, it’s truffle mac and cheese.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (impressed)
                        Truffles? Here? In this climate?

                                 BENJI
                        I think they just use, like, 
                        truffle oil, man. It’s so funny to 
                        me that you’re Jewish. You are just 
                        so not a typical Jew. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m not Jewish. 

                                 BENJI
                        My mom is Jewish. Which means her 
                        mom is Jewish. Which means your mom 
                        is Jewish. Which means you’re 
                        Jewish.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        But I don’t do Jewish things. 

                                 BENJI
                        I don’t think that matters. I mean, 
                        it doesn’t hurt but it’s not a 
                        requirement. Did you have a bar 
                        mitzvah?
                             (off non-reaction)
                        My bar mitzvah party was Pokémon Go 
                        themed, and we did the mannequin 
                        challenge. Remember that?
                             (off his blank look)
                        Here, look, I have it on my phone.

           Benji pulls out his phone and loads up an old video.

           The camera glides through a FROZEN BAR MITZVAH PARTY. 
           Everyone is stock still as the camera weaves through them. 

           The camera circles around a stock-still 13-year-old Benji in 
           his suit and yarmulke, DABBING on the dance floor.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I get it. Everyone is very still. 
                        Like mannequins. In a store. 

                                 BENJI
                        Yup. You totally get it.

           BACK TO VIDEO: Benji’s father, BRUCE, not staying still, 
           drunkenly argues with a CATERER before stumbling into the 
           table, knocking over the cake. People shout. The video cuts 
           out. Benji seems embarrassed as he puts his phone away.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. It was pretty fun, mostly. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m sorry I wasn’t around very much 
                        when you were...more...smaller. 

                                 BENJI
                        Well, the import/export business is 
                        very time consuming.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. And messy. 

                                 BENJI
                        Clean up on aisle nine!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Like at a grocery store.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I was making a joke about the mess 
                        of the mutilated bodies of the 
                        people I have killed.

                                 BENJI
                        I know, I was also...never mind.

           Uncle Gideon seems to appraise Benji. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I am sorry I put you in danger.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s OK. You said the bounty isn’t 
                        a problem. Right? You just have to 
                        keep killing these dudes.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. But eventually Skalnikoff will 
                        have no choice but to come himself. 
                        And that could be a...concern.

                                 BENJI
                             (scared but hiding it)
                        Skalnikoff is coming? Here?

           Gideon nods. He slides a small glass bottle across the table.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        If you know you have to fight, put 
                        one drop in each eye. It will 
                        sharpen your senses and increase 
                        your focus. For an emergency.

                                 BENJI
                        OK. Cool.

           Benji examines the bottle then puts it in his pocket. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Benji sits on the floor working on Pasta. Uncle Gideon sits 
           stiffly on the couch. Friends plays on the TV.

           ANGLE ON: ROSS and RACHEL kissing. The audience OOOH’s.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        But she dumped him.

                                 BENJI
                        Yes...they’re getting back 
                        together.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Why?

                                 BENJI
                        Sometimes people do that. It’s 
                        called an on-again-off-again 
                        relationship. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I hate it.

           Benji notices Uncle Gideon’s fists balling up. Danger sign.

                                 BENJI
                        OK. Take it easy.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I hate it. Let’s go back to 
                        Frasier. I like Frasier.

                                 BENJI
                        OK.

           Benji puts on Frasier. Gideon’s body visibly relaxes.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (about robot)
                        How does it work?

                                 BENJI
                        It’s a pretty basic quadrupedal 
                        task-based droid, with the four 
                        reticulated legs connected to a 
                        hydraulic actuator. 
                             (off non-reaction)
                        It’s voice-activated.

           Benji stands Pasta up and runs him through some commands.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Pasta, sit.

           Pasta sits. Benji holds his hand out, palm forward.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Pasta, touch.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Pasta touches its little metal face to Benji’s palm.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Pasta, jump.

           Pasta does a neat little backflip. But then something goes 
           wrong. Pasta won’t stop flipping, more and more wildly. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Pasta, SIT!

           Benji has to wrestle the robot down and manually shut it off.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        It’s a work in progress. 

           They watch Frasier in silence. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What’s the matter with Niles?

                                 BENJI
                        No one knows.

           INT. BENJI’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Uncle Gideon fell asleep sitting on the couch in his suit. A 
           CAR ENGINE stirs him awake. The LAFF TRACK from the TV, which 
           is still playing old sitcoms, jolts him to his feet. 

           Something’s wrong. Somehow there’s already a gun in his hand.

           He searches the house, gun extended, looking for Benji. 
           Benji’s room is empty. There is no sign of him. 

           Gideon finds a NOTE on the door: “Mid-terms. Back by 5. - B” 

           INT. LAKSHMI’S JEEP - MORNING

           Lakshmi smokes. She offers it to Benji. He shakes his head. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        What do you mean, no? It’s Monday 
                        morning. We always smoke weed on 
                        Monday mornings. We smoke weed 
                        every morning.

                                 BENJI
                        I can’t. I need to stay sharp. 
                        Just...in case something happens.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Name one time anything has ever 
                        happened.

           Benji doesn’t respond. Lakshmi lets it go. 

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Well? I’ve barely seen you for 
                        days. What’s up with your uncle? 

                                 BENJI
                        I actually need to talk to you 
                        about that. I didn’t want to do it 
                        over text...But you have to promise 
                        me you won’t tell anyone. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (gasps)
                        Benji, did your uncle...did 
                        he...touch you?

                                 BENJI
                        Fuck you.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh my god. You touched him? He 
                        unlocked something dark deep inside 
                        of you that you always suspected 
                        was there but never had the courage 
                        to admit to yourself, didn’t he.

                                 BENJI
                        Forget it.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Come on, I’m fucking with you. What 
                        is it?

                                 BENJI
                        Nothing. It’s fine. He’s normal. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Your uncle’s...normal?

                                 BENJI
                        Yup.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        OK, well, that’s a thing people say 
                        all the time, so I’m not suspicious 
                        or worried at all.

           They pull into the HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT. Lakshmi clocks 
           Benji watching Heather Lang sitting with her friends.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Either talk to her or kill 
                        yourself, but something has to 
                        give.

                                 BENJI
                        Gimme that.

           Benji grabs the joint and hits it for confidence.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I thought you needed to stay sharp. 

                                 BENJI
                        Let me give you some advice: life 
                        is short, so you might as well 
                        fucking do...whatever. Be...all 
                        that you can fucking be. And...fuck 
                        people...et cetera.

           Benji takes another hit, musters his courage, and exits. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I should probably livestream this.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Benji walks up to Heather and her CO-ED CREW: MEGAN, CARL, 
           and SHAY. They stop chatting and look at him with a mixture 
           of surprise, mean-spirited curiosity, and outright annoyance.  

                                 BENJI
                        Hey! What’s up?

                                 CARL
                        Can we help you? 

                                 BENJI
                        I was wondering...if you’re going 
                        to the Fall Ball on Friday? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Who? All of us?

                                 BENJI
                        I’m talking to Heather. 

                                 HEATHER
                        I don’t know. Maybe. Why? 

                                 BENJI
                        I heard Max...bailed? 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SHAY
                             (mocking his up-talk)
                        Are you sure you heard that? You 
                        sound like you’re not sure? 

           Carl, Megan and Shay laugh. Benji is faltering.

                                 BENJI
                        OK, look, I was just...if you want 
                        to go and you aren’t going with 
                        anyone, I’m not going with anyone--
                        I thought I could...take you, or...

                                 SHAY
                        Is it true your dick doesn’t work?

                                 BENJI
                        What? Who told you that my dick 
                        doesn’t work?! 

                                 CARL
                        So you don’t deny it.

                                 BENJI
                        I do deny it. My dick works! 
                        Heather, I promise my dick works.

           This was a little too loud, and some kids nearby laugh.

                                 HEATHER
                        EWW.

                                 MEGAN
                        I heard you have to take Viagra.

                                 BENJI
                        When would I even take Viagra? I’m 
                        a virgin.

           They got him. He’s dead. The girls grab their bags with 
           laughter and audible disgust and head inside. 

           Benji shuffles into school, humiliated.

           INT. MS. PITT'S CLASSROOM - HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Benji sits at his desk, sulking, a copy of his COLLEGE 
           APPLICATION ESSAY in front of him. 

           A pale, tall, intense looking woman walks in. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                             (indeterminate accent)
                        Hello classroom. I am substitution 
                        teacher. Name is...Beth. 

           Everyone exchanges giggles and knowing sideways glances. 

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Now I take attendance.

           She holds up what might be a blank sheet of paper. 

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Stone?
                             (pauses)
                        Benjamin Stone?

                                 BENJI
                             (confused)
                        Uh. Here.

           The substitute looks up from her sheet. The penetrating, 
           intimidating look she gives Benji is deeply unnerving. 

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                        OK, everyone is here. 

           She walks over to a TV/DVD player on a cart. She wheels it in 
           front of the class and puts in a disc.

                                 STUDENT
                        Uh, we’re supposed to have a test 
                        today. The mid-term exam?

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                        Yes, this is test.

           Shrek starts to play. Everyone looks at each other. The 
           Substitute sits in her chair, kicking her feet up on the desk 
           and burning holes into Benji’s face with her eyes. 

                                 BENJI
                        May I be excused?

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                        No. 

                                 BENJI
                        I have to...go to the bathroom.

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                        No. You don’t.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I have...diarrhea.

           Titters and whispers race through the classroom. Some kids 
           text their friends about it.

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER
                             (considering, then)
                        OK. You go, you come back. Three 
                        minutes. You not back, I find you.
                             (sickly grin)
                        For safety. 

           Benji shoves his stuff into his backpack and exits quickly.

           INT. HALLWAY - HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji runs up to the door of another classroom. Through the 
           window we see Lakshmi doodling, in her own world. 

           When he finally manages to get her attention, she makes an 
           excuse we don’t hear and heads to the door.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You told everyone in Ms. Pitt’s 
                        class you had diarrhea? I think 
                        it’s smart. Get ahead of it. 
                        Control the narrative. 

                                 BENJI
                        We have to get the fuck out of 
                        here. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Tell me about it.

           He starts running down the hallway. 

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you mean like right now!

           Lakshmi races to catch up. They run down a flight of stairs 
           and into another hallway. 

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Benji, where are we going? I’m on 
                        board, but do we have to run?

                                 BENJI
                        Don’t you play soccer, like, eight 
                        hours a day?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Yeah, so the rest of the time I 
                        don’t do shit.

           They round a corner and see THE PRINCIPAL talking to a 
           teacher, and blocking the path to the Exit Doors. Benji 
           backpedals and runs the other way, Lakshmi behind him. 

           INT. GYM - HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           The gym is decorated for the FALL BALL. There is crepe paper 
           twisting overhead. A DJ BOOTH is set up on a little riser. A 
           BANNER hanging on the wall reads “A NIGHT 2 REMEMBER.”

           Benji and Lakshmi burst through the double doors...

           ...and find themselves face-to-face with Clint and Riley. 

           One wall is filled with TROPHY CASES. The two bullies were 
           drawing dicks on the photos of former athletes.

                                 CLINT
                        Oh shit, it’s BB Ate a Dick.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Hey, hash tag Be Best, am I right?

                                 BENJI
                        We don’t have time for this. 

                                 RILEY
                        Oh, sorry, Bitch Boi, you got 
                        something better to do than get 
                        your ass kicked?

                                 BENJI
                        Yes...

                                 CLINT
                        Well, we don’t.

                                 BENJI
                        You don’t...have anything better to 
                        do than get your ass kicked?

                                 RILEY
                        Enough pillow talk!

           Lakshmi laughs at them, which only makes them more mad. They 
           move in, but Benji’s ready. He settles into his fight stance. 
           The boys laugh, underestimating him, when--Benji lands a 
           whopping combination on Clint. Clint’s hand shoots to a 
           bloody lip in surprise. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                           CLINT
                                                         LAKSHMI
           What the fuck?
                                              Whoa.

           But Benji’s not enough for both of them. Riley comes from the 
           opposite side and throws a punch at Benji’s unguarded jaw...

           ...but it’s HALTED IN MID-AIR by a large, scraped-up hand.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        That was a mistake. 

                                 CLINT
                        Who the fuck are you? His 
                        babysitter. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. 

           Uncle Gideon twists Riley’s hand, hard, snapping his wrist, 
           and then JUDO THROWS HIM to the ground. He screams.

                                 RILEY
                        You broke my wrist!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes.

                                 CLINT
                        What the fuck, man?! We’re just 
                        kids. You’re an adult. This is 
                        assault. We know our rights. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Do I look like the kind of person 
                        who cares about your rights?

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (quietly to Benji)
                        Wait, your uncle’s hot now?! Is 
                        that what you were trying to tell 
                        me in the car?!

                                 BENJI
                             (to Lakshmi)
                        Stop.

                                 RILEY
                        You’re so fucked, bro. My dad is on 
                        the Naperville municipal council.

           A door opens at the other end of the gym: the SUBSTITUTE. 

                                 CLINT
                        Help, lady! This psycho is--
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SUBSTITUTE TEACHER/WORM FEEDER
                        Geist.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Worm Feeder.

           The four teens heads swivel back and forth, jaws agape, 
           staring at “the substitute” and Uncle Gideon. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        You’re a long way from Berlin.

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        The bounty Skalnikoff has put on 
                        your head is very big.

           She pulls a KNIFE. So does he. They’re like two old cowboys 
           in a high-noon shoot out.

           You could cut the tension with...one of their knives. But 
           before they can attack: they’re interrupted by a DOOR OPENING 
           at the far end of the gym, and a JANITOR coming to retrieve 
           his forgotten MOP BUCKET. They quickly hide the knives.

                                 JANITOR
                        Hey now, get back to class!

           He leaves. The second the door closes, Gideon and Worm Feeder 
           bring their knives back up and rush each other. 

           Their fight is a blur of extraordinary skill and speed. Worm 
           Feeder can more than hold her own against Gideon. 

           It’s tit-for-tat, blow-for-blow. 

           In the blur of the fight, Lakshmi’s sleeve is SLICED.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Fuck!

                                 BENJI
                        Are you OK?!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        This is my favorite jacket! I just 
                        got this for Diwali!

           They smash into the stage and the DJ BOOTH starts playing 
           Drake’s “Nice for What.” 

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hell no.

           Lakshmi gets on the stage and changes the music. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Do you really need to DJ right now?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Drake sucks! He’s not good!

           She accidentally kicks on the SMOKE MACHINE and LASER LIGHT 
           SHOW. They might as well be fighting in a NIGHTCLUB. 

           IN THE FIGHT: Gideon and Worm Feeder’s knives are knocked 
           away. They’re bludgeoning each other with their fists, each 
           giving and taking damage, until, in a moment of stalemate:

           They spot two FENCING SWORDS CROSSED ON A PLAQUE in the 
           TROPHY CASE. They elbow-smash the glass and grab the swords. 

           Now they are SWORD FIGHTING. 

           Sliced up crepe paper falls like snow.

           Worm Feeder manages to get a nice cut across Uncle Gideon’s 
           cheek, drawing blood. But he does her one better, he stabs 
           the sword through her shoulder, pinning her to the wall. 

           He reaches in the trophy case for a heavy MARBLE-BOTTOMED 
           CHAMPIONSHIP CUP to finish the job when the JANITOR re-
           appears. He forgot his mop. 

                                 JANITOR
                        Hey what did I--certainly not. Now 
                        you’ve gone and messed up this gym 
                        and I just cleaned this gym.

           Uncle Gideon, Benji, and Lakshmi run. Worm Feeder pulls the 
           sword from her shoulder and follows after them. The janitor 
           doesn’t notice, too busy mumbling to himself as he exits...

                                 JANITOR (CONT’D)
                        Now I gotta go back the other way 
                        and get the mop bucket again. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           They race away from the school. A DOOR SLAMS behind them and 
           we see Worm Feeder--dripping blood--giving chase. She’s 
           unstoppable, like Robert Patrick’s T-1000 in Terminator 2.

           Lakshmi makes it to her JEEP and fumbles with the keys.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        We’ll take my car.

           She looks up and sees his McLaren. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Right. Yeah. Let’s take your car.

           Worm Feeder almost catches up to them as they pile in and 
           peel out, leaving her behind, and she’s still running.

           INT. UNCLE GIDEON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           They race through the suburban, Illinois streets.

                                 BENJI
                        Who was that?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Worm Feeder. 

                                 BENJI
                        Her name is WORM FEEDER?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. She and her twin sister, 
                        Cerberus, work for Skalnikoff.

                                 BENJI
                        We had a Skull Boy as a substitute 
                        teacher?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Skull Boy?

                                 BENJI
                        People who work for Skalnikoff. I 
                        made it up.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. Worm Feeder is a...Skull Boy. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Don’t bother explaining anything to 
                        me. Just keep speaking to each 
                        other in complete gibberish.

           The car slips under the half-opened GARAGE door at Benji’s 
           house as it closes behind them. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the house through the MUD ROOM.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I’m sorry, can someone please tell 
                        me what is happening?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        My uncle’s a John Wick and he’s ex-
                        communicado because he used to work 
                        for Skalnikoff who thought he was 
                        dead, but now that he knows he’s 
                        alive all the Skull Boys are after 
                        him because Skalnikoff wants to 
                        kill him.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Who’s Skalnikoff?

                                 SKALNIKOFF (O.C.)
                        I am.

           They all turn to see the house is FILLED with ARMED MEN.

           A man steps forward, the obvious RINGLEADER. 

           This old VOLDEMORT with the scarred-up face is IGOR 
           SKALNIKOFF. He’s beyond deadly, with wild mood swings between 
           slyly charming and violently angry. He speaks with a thick, 
           indeterminate Eastern European accent. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        It’s beautiful, Geist, to see you 
                        interact with children. So loving.

           Skalnikoff rolls a LARGE RED COIN over his knuckles. In the 
           other hand, he holds a FRAMED PHOTO OF BENJI AND RUTH he was 
           admiring. He sets it down. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t realize you had 
                        a...family. 
                             (smirks)
                        You’ve hidden so much from me.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Let the girl go. She’s not part of 
                        this.

                                 BENJI
                        What about me? I’m not part of this 
                        either!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Nice, Benji. 

                                 BENJI
                        I’m just saying.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Are you crazy? You a crazy guy? 
                        This is leverage, you fucking, you 
                        stupid guy. I know you. You would 
                        kill me with a toothpick from where 
                        you stand. No. They stay.
                             (to a gunman)
                        And check him for toothpicks.

           An armed man thuds over and frisks Uncle Gideon. He gives the 
           all clear and resumes his post. He hands Skalnikoff a gun.

           Skalnikoff lazily waves the gun at them to sit down. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        When I met your Uncle, he was 
                        nothing, a speck of dirt, a plastic 
                        bag of shit floating all alone on 
                        the ocean. A tiny little plastic 
                        bag, full of shit, bobbing around 
                        like a...like a stinky duck. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (snorting, still high)
                        What?

           Skalnikoff turns to face Lakshmi, from sly to terrifying. He 
           runs a disgusting finger down her cheek.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        No interruption from you, or I will 
                        traffic you. You shut it up, your 
                        pretty mouth. 
                             (then, brightening)
                        But I saw something in this sad 
                        little baggie. So I scoop him up 
                        out of the big scary ocean, and I 
                        dry him off, and I say “shhhh, oh 
                        you poor little baggie of shit, you 
                        stinky duck. Hush now. You are 
                        safe.” And when he is dry and nice, 
                        I train him. Hard. We train all day 
                        and all night for years. And I turn 
                        this little bag full of shit into a 
                        terrible, beautiful weapon. Hmm? 
                        And then what thank you do I get 
                        for all of my hard work? Betrayal. 

           Skalnikoff holds up a cell phone showing the “selfie” Kravitz 
           took with Gideon at Denny’s. Kravitz has a big fake smile on 
           his face. Gideon glowers in his Frozen hat: busted.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        Not so nice. Not...appreciation.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        You sent me to die, and I did. You 
                        should have left it alone.

           Skalnikoff stops rolling the coin.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        So I could have a little bag of 
                        shit running around, spreading his 
                        shit everywhere?
                             (turning dark)
                        No. I sent you to kill Hamza and 
                        cripple the Nizam. But you don’t 
                        cripple. Now, with his son, Tarik, 
                        on the throne, they are looking to 
                        expand. He is a threat to the 
                        Colony. To me. To everything I have 
                        built. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Not my problem. You sent me to kill 
                        Hamza knowing I would die in the 
                        process.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                             (shrugs)
                        All roads lead to death, I taught 
                        you this on day one.
                             (then)
                        But you did not die. So now it is 
                        very much your problem.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I did what you asked.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        No. I did not ask you to lie to me. 
                             (then)
                        But I miss you. I need you. Come 
                        back. I call off the bounty on your 
                        head. We finish what you started in 
                        Dubai. We kill Tarik. We finally 
                        destroy the Nizam. It will be like 
                        those good olden days. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I work for you, or I die.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        When you say it you make it sound 
                        bad. We make a good team, I know 
                        you know that.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        It’s that easy. I just come back 
                        with you. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Yes. No! You really hurt my 
                        feelings bad. So, if you truly want 
                        to make it up to me, a simple 
                        apology, I will accept, and also 
                        kill them.

           He motions to Benji and Lakshmi who look truly scared now.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        Easy peasy, no biggie, just a 
                        little gesture, a little...peace 
                        offering. You betrayed me, so now 
                        you betray yourself, even stevens. 
                        I think is fair.

                                 BENJI
                        And if he refuses?!

           Everyone looks at Benji. The answer should be obvious.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sure. Fine. Give me a gun.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Ha!
                             (to Benji)
                        I don’t know if you know, but your 
                        uncle is very funny man. He always 
                        cracking up me and the boys. One 
                        time, he dangling prime 
                        minister...what was his name? Ach, 
                        who cares. A corrupt, terrible man, 
                        don’t worry. He dangle him off a 
                        balcony in Kosice, and just before 
                        he let him go, he turn to me and he 
                        say, “Oopsie.” 
                             (laughs, then)
                        But of course, was not oopsie, was 
                        on purpose.
                             (to Uncle Gideon)
                        Nice try, clever guy. You don’t 
                        need a gun, Mr. I Kill People With 
                        Staplers And Spaghetti.

           Gideon squints at something we don’t see. He stands and 
           places a hand on the back of Benji’s neck. Benji tenses.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Since I’ve been out, I’ve 
                        reacquainted myself with the 
                        civilian world. I tried truffle mac 
                        and cheese. Have you had truffle 
                        mac and cheese?

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        What are you talking about?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Truffle mac and cheese? It’s a type 
                        of pasta. Have you had pasta?

           Gideon squints at the same spot, and now it’s clear: BENJI’S 
           ROBOT sits on the floor from the night before. Where 
           Skalnikoff stands now. Pasta doesn’t move.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                             (sighing, annoyed)
                        Yes, Geist, I have had pasta.

           Pasta’s eyes light up. No one else notices.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        It’s good. Pasta--

           Skalnikoff raises his gun.

                                 KRAVITZ
                        Jesus. You are stalling. 
                             (to a henchman)
                        Kill the childre--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        JUMP!

           Pasta does a backflip, kicking Skalnikoff in the groin. The 
           robot continues flipping wildly. The armed men try to shoot 
           it but can’t without hitting their boss. 

           Skalnikoff shoots the robot. It dies with an electric whine.

                                 BENJI
                        Pastaaaaa! 

           Lakshmi grabs Benji and pulls him behind the kitchen island.

           Gideon runs up the wall and leaps at the nearest gunman, 
           snapping the gun from his hand, catching it in mid-air, and 
           shooting six men at point blank range before they can react.

           He throws the emptied gun at a seventh, knocking him out.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Gideon joins Benji and Lakshmi behind the island as 
           Skalnikoff and his men obliterate the kitchen with gunfire. 
           Cabinets are shredded. Appliances pucker with bullet holes. 

           Uncle Gideon pulls open a drawer in the island. It’s full of 
           pots, pans, cooking utensils...and a gun.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Why is there a gun in the pots and 
                        pans drawer?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I put it there.

                                 BENJI
                        You put a gun in the pots and pans 
                        drawer?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes. In case.

                                 BENJI
                        In case of what?!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Apparently in case of this, Benji!

                                 BENJI
                        OK! Right! Good!

           Gideon counts the shots, waiting for them to have to reload. 
           When they do, he leaps up and lets off a full clip, doing to 
           the living room what they did to the kitchen: destroying it.

           Skalnikoff manages to escape, leaving behind a few armed men. 
           Some of them are hit in Uncle Gideon’s barrage. 

           Out of ammo, Gideon throws the gun aside and grabs TWO HUGE 
           KITCHEN KNIVES from a KNIFE BLOCK. He whips them at two 
           gunmen. They drop. He grabs two more knives and leaps into 
           the living room, slicing his way through the remaining men. 

           The living room is a war zone.

           Then, sudden quiet. Benji peeks out from the kitchen island 
           to see Gideon rush out the sliding glass door, pursuing 
           Skalnikoff. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Should we try to help him?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Help him what?!
                                        UNCLE WICK

           SMASH! Uncle Gideon comes crashing back through the sliding 
           glass door, thrown back into the room by...

           A GIGANTIC BRUISER who moves slowly and confidently.

           Gideon shakes off the glass, spits blood onto the carpet. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Hello, Truck. 

                                 TRUCK
                        Hello, Geist.

           Truck picks Gideon up with one hand and throws him across the 
           room. He smashes against the wall, taking a framed family 
           portrait down with him in a bloody streak. 

           Truck seems to look at the family portrait, curious.

           Gideon staggers to his feet and rushes at the big man, 
           lifting him into the air and smashing him into the coffee 
           table. They grapple on the ground. 

           Truck is just so much bigger. 

           Uncle Gideon’s blows don’t seem effective against the giant. 
           Truck’s punches on the other hand are devastating. The first 
           drops Uncle Gideon to one knee. The second sends his head 
           spinning. 

           Benji creeps out from behind the kitchen island. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (whisper-shout)
                        The fuck are you doing?

                                 BENJI
                        I’ve been training for this!

           He sneaks up behind Truck, settles into a TAE KWON DO STANCE, 
           adjusting his feet for balance, fists tight in cougar paws.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        KI-YAH!

           Truck turns at the noise as Benji does a flying tornado kick. 
           It’s a beautiful, impressive, acrobatic kick, striking Truck 
           directly in the face.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh shiiiiit!

           And it’s totally useless. Truck frowns like he’s been bopped 
           on the nose with a paper towel roll. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Shit.

           Truck smacks Benji like he’s swatting a fly. Benji smacks the 
           ground. As Truck lifts him over his head with one hand, Benji 
           sees the SPATULA from their training and manages to grab it. 

           Truck’s about to break him in half over his knee, Bane-style, 
           when--Benji JABS TRUCK IN THE EYE WITH THE SPATULA HANDLE. 

           Truck grunts and drops Benji.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Family of psychos. Family. Of. 
                        Psychos.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh fuck, I did not like how that 
                        felt when I did it!

           Gideon grabs the FIRE POKER from the FIREPLACE and 
           systematically severs Truck’s supporting ligaments: cutting 
           the two behind his knees to bring him halfway down, cutting 
           behind his triceps to leave his arms dead at his sides. 

           Truck turns to face Uncle Gideon.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sorry, Truck.

                                 TRUCK
                        It’s oka--

           Uncle Gideon jams the fire poker into Truck’s mouth, and 
           kicks the handle THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS NECK.  

           Truck slumps, impaled on the poker, DEAD. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        OH SHIT!!!

           Gideon helps Benji up. Benji cradles Pasta’s lifeless body.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Are you all right?

                                 BENJI
                        No! He killed Pasta!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (to Lakshmi)
                        Are you all right?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Shit! No! 
                             (stunned)
                        Is that guy dead?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Yes.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh shit!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        We can’t stay here. 
                             (to Benji)
                        Do you have a safe house?

                                 BENJI
                        I’m sixteen. 
                             (off blank reaction)
                        No, I don’t have a safe house!!

           Uncle Gideon considers what to do next...

                                 LAKSHMI (O.C.)
                        We have a panic room. 

           INT. PANIC ROOM - LAKSHMI’S HOUSE - LATER

           Benji, Lakshmi, and Uncle Gideon are in a sterile PANIC ROOM 
           stocked with SURVIVAL GEAR. SECURITY CAMERA MONITORS line the 
           wall. Lakshmi dips her finger in a jar of PEANUT BUTTER. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I obviously get snacky when I’m 
                        high but I get extra snacky when 
                        I’m anxious. So when I’m a little 
                        high and very anxious...Want some?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No. Thank you. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Benji? 

                                 BENJI
                        Raw peanut butter? Right now? Off 
                        the tip of your finger? I’m good. 

           Suddenly, there’s a BANGING on the door. They all jump at the 
           noise. But on the security monitors we see it’s just: 
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 REVATHY (O.C.)
                        Lakshmi, open the door! You know I 
                        don’t like you locking yourself in 
                        the panic room! Come downstairs for 
                        tea.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LAKSHMI’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji, Uncle Gideon, and Lakshmi sit in a formal living room. 
           Lakshmi’s MOTHER, REVATHY (50s), brilliant, funny, and 
           disarmingly “hip,” brings out a tray of tea.

                                 REVATHY
                        Benji, how’s your mom? Still 
                        working those crazy hours? 

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah. She’s good. Thank you.

           He doesn’t elaborate. 

                                 REVATHY
                        Very nice.

           Lakshmi dips her finger in the jar of peanut butter.

                        I know that’s not our survival 
                        peanut butter from the panic room 
                        that is for emergencies only. 

           Lakshmi guiltily withdraws her finger...

                        I have a case that needs my

                        Please, Lakshmi, don’t disturb him. 
                        You know he likes to be left alone 
                        when he’s watching Billions.

           She exits.

                                 BENJI
                        So. What do we do now, John Wick?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Why do you keep calling me that? 
                        Who is John Wick?

                                 BENJI
                        You are.

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (playing along)
                        That suit alone had to cost you, 
                        what, two gold coins?

                                 BENJI
                        OK, can we talk about the economics 
                        of John Wick for a second?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Motherfucker, we can talk about the 
                        economics of John Wick ALL DAY!
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Help me out. One gold coin is worth 
                        the clean up of one dead body, 
                        which, sure, great, but then it 
                        also costs one gold coin just to 
                        get into the hotel bar? 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Yes. What don’t you understand?! 
                        It’s three gold coins for a room at 
                        The Continental for one night, two 
                        gold coins for a Long Island Iced 
                        Tea at the bar, one back tattoo for 
                        passage to Morocco, one human 
                        finger for a gun in the desert. 
                        It’s pretty clear to me.

                                 BENJI
                        OK, wait, no, I think I get it. So 
                        it’s two gold coins for safe 
                        passage through the sewers, nine 
                        gold coins for a dog-walker, and a 
                        blood-oath marker for an impossible 
                        assassination?

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Yes. You get it.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        How many gold coins for you two to 
                        shut up?

           They shut up. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        Skalnikoff won’t stop until one of 
                        us is dead. You should stay here. 

                                 BENJI
                        Are you out of your fucking mind? 
                        You said yourself Skalnikoff would 
                        try to get to you through me. I’m 
                        not putting Lakshmi and her family 
                        in danger like that.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Benji, please. I can take on 
                        Skalnikoff and the entire Colony by 
                        myself, and maybe even succeed. But 
                        I can’t do it while also having to 
                        take care of a thirteen-year-old.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I’m sixteen, and you know that, and 
                        I feel like you’re doing it on 
                        purpose now.

           Uncle Gideon strains to find a solution. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (unhappily)
                        If you insist on coming I’ll need 
                        back up. 

                                 BENJI
                        I’m your backup!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No. You’re not.

           He pulls out a CELLPHONE and dials. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                             (on the PHONE)
                        It’s me. Skalnikoff knows. Yes. I 
                        understand. We’ll find somewhere to 
                        lay low. I’ll send you the address.

           He hangs up.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        Time to go.
                             (to Lakshmi)
                        Don’t worry, you will be safe here.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Well, yeah, we have a panic room.

           Uncle Gideon heads to the door. Benji and Lakshmi are alone.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        You can stay. You should stay. 

                                 BENJI
                        I’m sorry I dragged you into this 
                        but I’m on the board now.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh, OK, you’re on the board now. 
                        The fuck is that supposed to mean?!

                                 BENJI
                        I have to play the game. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Benji, I’m scared for you.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I’m scared for me, too. But I have 
                        to go.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Please be careful.

           She hugs Benji tight.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I got some peanut butter on 
                        your jacket.

           Benji leaves.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOTOR LODGE - EVENING

           The empty parking lot of a trash motel near the highway. 
           Gideon’s McLaren sticks out like a sore thumb. 

           Benji is dutifully hiding it with a TARP. 

           INT. LOBBY - MOTOR LODGE - SAME TIME

           Uncle Gideon stands at the RECEPTION DESK. The RECEPTIONIST 
           has seen it all, or at least she thinks she has.  

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        What suites do you have available?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh, good question. Let me check on 
                        the availability of our...suites.

           She types something into the computer. In a reverse-shot of 
           her monitor we see it’s just MINESWEEPER and SHOPPING.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, sir, all our suites 
                        are booked tonight. I’m sure you 
                        can understand. What with 
                        the...president being in town.
                             (then)
                        Wait! We do have a seaside villa.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (not getting it)
                        I’ll take it.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Thank you, sir. And how will you be 
                        paying today?
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Uncle Gideon throws, like, a thousand dollars in cash on the 
           counter for a 49 dollar room. This guy has no idea how money 
           works or how much anything costs, ever. She gives him a key.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Your room is one of the nicest we 
                        have. Enjoy your stay.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOTOR LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is a fucking dump. Benji flops on a cheap twin bed.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sorry about the accommodations. 
                        Your mother’s house is not safe.

           No response. Benji’s curled up on the bed, facing the wall.

           Gideon sheds his black blazer. He’s pockmarked with injuries 
           from his multiple fights.

           He dumps the contents of his duffel bag onto the bed: 
           bullets, a hammer, knives. He finds a black zippered case. 

           He goes into the small, dingy BATHROOM and opens the case: 
           it’s filled with SURGICAL TOOLS. He removes a BULLET FRAGMENT 
           from his side, and sews up various cuts and holes.

           When he’s done, he lies on his bed and stares at the ceiling. 

                                 BENJI
                        We almost died today.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No, we did not.

                                 BENJI
                        Yes, we did. For me, that was much 
                        closer to death than I am 
                        personally comfortable with.
                             (then)
                        Why did you come here? 
                             (off non-reaction)
                        You should be in Hong Kong, 
                        stabbing someone in the eye with a 
                        pencil four thousand times. 
                             (then)
                        And I should be taking my fucking 
                        mid-terms and smoking weed with 
                        other sixteen year olds. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        You are upset.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah! I’m upset!

           Uncle Gideon takes a moment to collect his thoughts. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I don’t want to be a part of that 
                        world anymore. Skalnikoff sent me 
                        to Dubai assuming I would die, and 
                        I let him think I did so I could 
                        seek a normal life. When your 
                        mother asked me to come stay with 
                        you...this was supposed to be my 
                        first step in that direction. 

                                 BENJI
                        This was your first step?! You 
                        couldn’t have, like, taken a 
                        cooking class? Or gone to Niagara 
                        Falls? Signed up for Bumble?!

           Gideon is about to say something, but Benji cuts him off.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        It’s a dating app. Bumble is a 
                        dating app.

           They lie in silence for a moment. Then:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’m sorry, Benjamin. I feel like 
                        this is my fault.

                                 BENJI
                        It is fucking literally all your 
                        fucking fault.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Bonesaw will be here soon. She will 
                        know what to do.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh, good, well, at least BONESAW 
                        will know what to do. 

           There is a GENTLE KNOCK at the door.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        She is here.

           He gets up, checks the PEEPHOLE, undoes the SECURITY CHAIN, 
           and opens the door. BONESAW enters the room.

           ANGLE ON: Benji, his face a complex web of emotions.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Bonesaw is the female equivalent of Uncle Gideon: 
           intimidating, determined, precise, dressed in TAILORED ALL 
           BLACK, SUNGLASSES at night, clearly armed, clearly deadly. 

           She is also BENJI’S MOTHER, RUTH STONE.

                                 BONESAW/RUTH
                        Hey, Bub.

           EXT. SWIMMING POOL - MOTOR LODGE - NIGHT

           Benji and Ruth sit on beat-up plastic chairs next to a filthy 
           MOTEL SWIMMING POOL.

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve been dreading this 
                        conversation for sixteen years. But 
                        I will answer any questions you 
                        want to ask.

                                 BENJI
                        OK. I guess my first question is: 
                        WHAT?! And also: THE FUCK?!

           Ruth hates to see her son upset, but there’s something 
           different about her as well: she has the same preternatural 
           calm as her brother. An assassin’s calm.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        So you’re not an EMT?

                                 RUTH
                        I sort of am. How do you think I 
                        got the nickname “Bonesaw”?

           She smiles. Benji doesn’t find any of this funny.

                                 BENJI
                        This weekend...All your trips with 
                        your “girlfriends”...

                                 RUTH
                        A job. Always a job. People like us 
                        don’t have friends, but I do work 
                        with a small, all-female crew.

                                 BENJI
                        Are you even my mom?

                                 RUTH
                             (ouch)
                        Oh, Benji, please don’t say that.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Are you?

                                 RUTH
                        Yes.

           He tries to find the words. Then:

                                 BENJI
                        So? What the fuck, mom?

                                 RUTH
                        Your grandfather, Isaac, my father, 
                        was willing to do things that other 
                        people didn’t want to do. He was 
                        very good at it, and he passed 
                        those skills down to his children.

                                 BENJI
                        Murdering. The things that other 
                        people didn’t want to do, the 
                        skills he passed down: you’re 
                        talking about murdering people.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. Bad people. Mostly. But yes.

                                 BENJI
                        Skalnikoff said that he “made” 
                        Uncle Gideon. He said he was a 
                        little bag of shit that he scooped 
                        out of the ocean.

           Ruth SPITS. Benji’s surprised, this is a mom he’s never seen.

                                 RUTH
                        Skalnikoff. That man does nothing 
                        and takes credit for everything.
                             (in Russian)
                        May his kingdom turn to ash.

                                 BENJI
                        Right. OK. You speak Russian. Fine. 
                             (then)
                        You sent an assassin to be my 
                        babysitter?

                                 RUTH
                        For your protection, yes. Always. 

                                 BENJI
                        Always? Wait...Mrs. Chen?!
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        She was barely active at that point 
                        but in her prime she could bring a 
                        government to its knees.

                                 BENJI
                        So just everyone is a fucking 
                        assassin. Is dad an assassin?

                                 RUTH
                        No. He’s just an asshole.

           It’s a lot for Benji to take in all at once. Then:

                                 BENJI
                        People tried to kill me today, mom.

                                 RUTH
                        I know. And we will make them pay.

           Ruth puts her arm around her son. He sinks into her comfort.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - MOTOR LODGE - LATER

           Ruth paces while Benji and Uncle Gideon sit on the twin beds.

                                 RUTH
                             (to Uncle Gideon)
                        You and I will discuss the insane 
                        mess that you got my son into 
                        later. For now...it would’ve been 
                        nice if you could’ve at least taken 
                        Worm Feeder off the board. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I tried. 

                                 RUTH
                        You failed. 

           Damn. Uncle Gideon is no match for his sister.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This doesn’t end until we kill 
                        Skalnikoff, and with the bounty on 
                        your head up to nine million, we’re 
                        going to have to take out a dozen 
                        Worm Feeders just to get to him.
                             (then)
                        We have to go to the house.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        He’ll be watching the house.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        We need weapons. I’m not you. I’m 
                        not hacking through an army with a 
                        paperclip and a box of crayons. I 
                        want my guns.

                                 BENJI
                        Wait, you grounded me once for not 
                        wearing sunscreen, and you have 
                        guns at our house? 

                                 RUTH
                        Well, Benji, if it makes you feel 
                        better, being a mother is like 
                        being permanently grounded, OK? 
                             (then)
                        And the greatest honor of my life.
                             (hardening, to Gideon)
                        What is this fucking hotel? This 
                        place is disgusting.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I don’t know the area. 

                                 RUTH
                        You look it up on Yelp! At the very 
                        least Google “nice hotel near me”!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Not all of us have been living a 
                        double life, Ruth. I have not set 
                        foot in the civilian world in 
                        twenty-five years. 

                                 RUTH
                        Shut up.

           Gideon shuts up the way other people shut up when he’s the 
           one telling them to shut up. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Pack your shit. Let’s go.

           EXT. BENJI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They pull up a half block from Benji’s house in the McLaren, 
           headlights off, hidden in shadow. Benji is crammed in back. 

                                 BENJI
                        This car does not have a proper 
                        backseat.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        Shhhh. 

                                 BENJI
                        Now she doesn’t care about car 
                        safety. Who are you?

           They can see an SUV parked in their driveway and another one 
           parked on the street. There’s a SNIPER on the roof.

                                 RUTH
                             (to Uncle Gideon)
                        Ready?
                             (off his nod, to Benji)
                        You stay here.

                                 BENJI
                        No! That’s bullshit!

                                 RUTH
                        You do not talk to me like that.

                                 BENJI
                        Sorry.

                                 RUTH
                             (firm)
                        Stay here.

           Ruth and Uncle Gideon exit the car and slip across the street 
           into the shadows. Benji strains to see what’s happening.

           Uncle Gideon is now on the roof, sliding up behind the 
           sniper. He takes him out and assumes his position, raising 
           the rifle and methodically shooting into the SUV. 

           Benji listens, flinching as he hears the DISTANT SCREAMS of 
           men trying to escape. Then, the night goes still again. Benji 
           waits, anxious. 

           He sees Ruth enter the house and the BARREL FLASH of multiple 
           GUNSHOTS.

                                 BENJI
                        Mom!

           Benji leaps out of the car and races across the street.

           EXT. BACKYARD - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Benji sneaks through the backyard, stealth and determined. He 
           maneuvers through the bent and broken frame of the sliding 
           glass door into the living room.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Benji’s feet CRUNCH on BROKEN GLASS. He gets spooked by 
           TRUCK’S PROPPED UP DEAD BODY. He curses under his breath. 

                                 BENJI
                             (hissing)
                        Mom!

           He enters the DINING ROOM to see Ruth FIGHTING with a gang of 
           men. And she is fucking destroying them. Benji is taken 
           aback. Ruth finishes her assault, bodies all around her. 

                                 RUTH
                        I told you to wait in the car.

                                 BENJI
                        I’m here to help you.

           She clearly doesn’t need it but is touched anyway.

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you, Bub. 

           She whips around to face a new threat, but it’s just Gideon.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Mud room.

           They pass through the BULLET-RIDDLED KITCHEN and BLOOD-SOAKED 
           LIVING ROOM. It’s a disaster scene. Ruth looks at Gideon.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sorry.

           They enter the MUD ROOM.

           INT. MUD ROOM / GARAGE - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           This is your typical SUBURBAN GARAGE: HONDA CR-V, WORKBENCH, 
           a bunch of old BEACH CHAIRS and MOVING BOXES along the wall.

           In the MUD ROOM: a bench for sitting and changing shoes. 
           Underneath it: a bunch of shoes. Coats hang on hooks. Normal.

           Ruth takes a FRAMED PHOTO off the wall to reveal a DIGITAL 
           KEYPAD. She punches in a code. A HATCH opens in the FLOOR 
           leading to a SECRET ROOM beneath the GARAGE.  

                                 BENJI
                        No. WHAT?!

           They descend.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. SECRET ARMORY - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Lights click on: they are in a HIGH-TECH ARMORY. 

                                 BENJI
                        Um. OK. Right. Sure. 

           Ruth pulls GUNS off the wall, stuffs them in TACTICAL DUFFEL 
           BAGS. She tosses more guns to Gideon. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want a gun. And frankly, I 
                        don’t want you to have a gun 
                        either. Do you know how many people 
                        die unnecessarily from gun violence 
                        every day in this country? It’s a 
                        sickness. We are sick.

                                 RUTH
                        I agree. And I was never giving you 
                        a gun.

           Ruth keeps packing up guns.

                                 BENJI
                        Right. Well, what am I gonna use?! 
                        This is such bullshit!

                                 RUTH
                        If you say bullshit to me one more 
                        time, I’m taking away your Switch.

                                 BENJI
                        You think I still care about a 
                        Nintendo Switch? My eyes are open, 
                        mother, and I will no longer--

                                 RUTH
                        I’ll pull you from Robotics Club. 
                        No Pasta 2.0. No Pasta 3.0. No 
                        M.I.T.

           This shuts him up.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Here. Take these.

           She hands him CHROME NUNCHUCKS. OK, these will work.

           Benji gives them a practice swing and accidentally smashes 
           some GLASS SHELVES, glass and ammo tinkling to the floor. 

                                 BENJI
                        Whoops.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Benji sheepishly tucks the nunchucks away.

           They hear ENGINES and PLODDING FOOTSTEPS up above.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Reinforcements.

           Ruth sighs. She wishes it didn’t have to be this way. She 
           punches a code into another KEYPAD, which flashes RED. 

           The hatch to the mud room hisses closed. Another hatch opens 
           in the wall revealing a DARK ESCAPE PASSAGEWAY.

           Ruth loads up the duffel bags full of guns. She and Gideon 
           head down the passageway. Benji pauses and shakes his head, 
           taking in one more surprise.

                                 BENJI
                             (grumbling)
                        We have a secret passageway out of 
                        the underground armory, but I had 
                        to save up to buy my bike?

                                 RUTH
                             (calling back)
                        Don’t be a brat. I was teaching you 
                        fiscal responsibility.

           EXT. BACKYARD/SUBURBAN STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           They exit another hatchway into a small, dark room with a 
           small doorway onto a sprawling backyard. Ruth and Gideon 
           cross quickly. Benji exits the enclosure and looks back to 
           see...a UTILITY SHED. He realizes he knows this backyard.

                                 JENKO (O.C.)
                        BB Eight? What the fuck?

           JENKO is on the back patio, playing with his drone. 

                                 BENJI
                        Hey, Jenko.
                             (then)
                        Don’t fucking call me BB Eight.

           There’s a new edge in Benji’s voice. Tough, sharp.

                                 JENKO
                             (intimidated)
                        OK.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Unless it’s the cool BB Eight. In 
                        which case, that’s fine.

           Benji rushes to meet his mom and Gideon. They cross the 
           street and get into Gideon’s McLaren. 

           From the car, they see more ARMED MEN pouring out of SUVs and 
           filling the house. Just as Benji is about to look away--

           BOOM. THE ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR IS ENGULFED IN A SILENT, 
           CONTAINED EXPLOSION. Windows are blown out. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, to self)
                        Our house!

           Benji is in absolute SHOCK as the car pulls away.

           INT. GRAN LUXE SUITE - HOTEL ARISTA - NIGHT

           A BELLHOP lets them into a much nicer room on the top floor 
           of a much nicer hotel. “Luxury in Naperville.”

                                 BELLHOP
                        The Gran Luxe Suite! I’m jealous!

           Benji is shell-shocked. Uncle Gideon hands the bellhop what 
           looks like a thousand dollars in cash. 

                                 BELLHOP (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, s--
                             (realizing how much it is)
                        Holy shit. You folks sure you don’t 
                        need any help with your...luggage? 
                        Or, literally anything? Molly? 
                        Coke? Shrooms? Poppers? You guys 
                        don’t look like poppers people, but 
                        you’d be surpri--

           Ruth and Gideon glare. He beats a quick but elated exit.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I need a drink.

                                 RUTH
                        There’s a mini-bar right there. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I saw a real bar downstairs.

                                 RUTH
                        Gideon--
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Ruth. 

           He exits. She lets it go.

                                 BENJI
                        I’m going with him. I need a drink, 
                        too.
                             (Ruth stops him)
                        Not sure if you noticed, but our 
                        house just exploded. With, like, 
                        all our stuff in it.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s just a house, Bub. 

                                 BENJI
                        Please don’t “Bub” me right now. My 
                        entire world is collapsing. Like 
                        our house. Which, again, just 
                        exploded. 

                                 RUTH
                        OK.

           She watches Benji absorb his new reality.

                                 BENJI
                        I want a car.

                                 RUTH
                             (laughs)
                        You’re using our very precarious 
                        life-or-death situation to 
                        blackmail me?
                             (then, genuine)
                        Your grandfather would be so proud.

                                 BENJI
                        And noise-canceling headphones. The 
                        Bose 700s, too, not the Quiet 
                        Comfort 35 crap. 

           INT. ZORBA COCKTAIL BAR - HOTEL ARISTA - SIMULTANEOUS

           The hotel bar is the height of suburban sophistication, which 
           is to say somewhat tacky and threadbare. It’s mostly empty. 
           Two COCKY SUBURBAN CEOs sit at a table. Gideon takes a stool 
           at the bar. The BARTENDER approaches.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I feel stupid for asking at this 
                        point, but do you have Hibiki 17?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BARTENDER
                        We do.

           Uncle Gideon looks at him blankly. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        If you’re joking, I’ll kill you.

           The bartender nervously looks at the bottles behind him to 
           make extra sure he actually has it.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Neat or rocks?
                             (off his death stare)
                        Neat. You got it.

           The Bartender goes to pour the drink. Uncle Gideon can feel 
           someone slide in next to him but he remains calm, unmoving. 

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        I heard you killed Truck.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        It wasn’t personal. 

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        So then you understand this isn’t 
                        personal for me, either.

           One of the COCKY CEOs slides up next to Worm Feeder to flirt. 

                                 COCKY CEO
                        Hey, didn’t I just see you outside?

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        No. 

                                 COCKY CEO
                        Yeah, I--

           In a flash, Worm Feeder grabs the garnish-paring knife from 
           the bar and SLICES OFF THE MAN’S NECKTIE. She shoves it in 
           his mouth and turns her back completely to him. Freaked out, 
           he grabs his buddy and rushes out. When they’re gone:

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Let me at least buy you one last 
                        drink.

           Uncle Gideon signals the bartender to make it two.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        I always admired you, Geist. Even 
                        when you tried to kill me, your 
                        craftsmanship was undeniable. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Not good enough to finish the job. 

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        Distracted by the janitor. It 
                        happens to all of us. We both know 
                        you could finish me off with a 
                        cocktail straw if you wanted to.

           The bartender delivers two drinks. Uncle Gideon throws way 
           too much cash on the bar. He pulls the COCKTAIL STRAW from 
           his glass and examines it. They both laugh. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I was out. You all could have just 
                        left me out. 

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        No one gets out.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Right. In that case...

           Before he can even take a sip of his precious Hibiki...

           Worm Feeder whips a CARDBOARD “WELCOME TO NAPERVILLE” COASTER 
           at his eye like a throwing star. He ducks. NOW, THEY’RE 
           FIGHTING. But this is Gideon like we’ve never seen him 
           before. He’s a superhero. He’s John Wick crossed with Jet Li 
           crossed with Tony Jaa crossed with Neo from The Matrix. 

           And Worm Feeder holds her own, again. We’ve seen them fight 
           before: they’re both incredible. 

           The few guests in the hotel bar scream and beat a quick exit.

           Uncle Gideon gets Worm Feeder to the ground, and pushes her 
           face into the floor with the heel of his designer shoe. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        What good is a nine million dollar 
                        bounty if you can’t collect it?  

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        It’s twelve million to bring you to 
                        Skalnikoff alive.

           Uncle Gideon pulls a gun, cocks it.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Goodbye, Worm Feeder.

                                 WORM FEEDER/CERBERUS
                             (laughing)
                        I’m not Worm Feeder. 

           She wipes her brow with the back of her hand, removing makeup 
           that was covering a EYEBROW SCAR. One we didn’t see on Worm 
           Feeder. Gideon hears the unmistakable sound of another gun 
           being cocked. COLD STEEL presses into the back of his head. 

                                 CERBERUS
                        She is.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Cerberus.

                                 WORM FEEDER (O.C.)
                        Hello, Geist. Miss me?

           Gideon does a spinning elbow to knock the gun off target as 
           Worm Feeder FIRES. 

           And now he’s FIGHTING IDENTICAL TWINS. The twins are kicking 
           him back and forth to each other like a soccer ball. Somehow, 
           he throws them off...

           In a three-way stand-off, they empty their clips at each 
           other. NEON BAR SIGNS explode. Glasses and bottles fly. 
           Gideon grabs a COCKTAIL UMBRELLA and jams it into Cerberus’s 
           ear. She screams. Skalnikoff was right: this man could kill 
           someone with a toothpick.

           They smash each other’s heads against walls, flip each other 
           over tables. 

           But Gideon triumphs. He’s the best in the world. Worm Feeder 
           and Cerberus lay broken on the floor. 

           He walks to the bar. His hand reaches for the glass of HIBIKI 
           17. He raises it, finally ready for a celebratory sip of his 
           long-anticipated prize. The glass touches his lips...

           ...Uncle Gideon’s vision begins to blur. 

           His arm goes slack, the glass crashing on the floor. He 
           staggers back, fumbling, messy like we’ve never seen him.

           Gideon has been drugged.

           GIDEON POV: the bartender WINKS, SINISTER. Gideon falls. From 
           the ground, we see Worm Feeder and Cerberus rise, shaking 
           glass from their hair.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 CERBERUS
                             (in German)
                        I was gonna say “miss me.” You 
                        never let me do the closer.

                                 WORM FEEDER
                             (in German)
                        Fuck you. The only reason he 
                        couldn’t kill me was the janitor? 
                        Get his legs.

           INT. GRAN LUXE SUITE - HOTEL ARISTA - SAME TIME

           Benji sits on the bed, texting on his phone. We hear the 
           constant WHOOSH and BLOOP-BLOOP of messages in and out. 

           Ruth sits on the other bed, cleaning a gun.

           The FIRE ALARM sounds. They snap to attention. 

           Ruth goes to the doorway and peeks out into the hall.

                                 RUTH
                        Get your things.

                                 BENJI
                        I don’t have anything. You blew all 
                        our stuff up, remember?

           Ruth ignores the dig, grabs the duffel bags. They exit into a 
           hallway of wailing alarms and flashing emergency lights. 
           Grumbling guests stream to the FIRE STAIRS. 

                                 RUTH
                             (whisper)
                        Head down. 

           She pulls Benji against the current of guests. They hurry 
           down the hall to a SERVICE ELEVATOR.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - HOTEL ARISTA - MOMENTS LATER

           They exit the hotel’s SERVICE ENTRANCE into the grease-
           smeared, dumpster-filled back alley. 

           Ruth peers around the corner to the front of the hotel where 
           evacuated guests mill about. No sign of Gideon. But there are 
           plenty of BAD GUYS disguised in OLD NAVY and CHICO’S hovering 
           at the edges of the crowd, scanning for them. 

           Ruth turns back to Benji, fire in her eyes.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        We’re in the end game now.

                                 BENJI
                        I’m sorry, mom, did you just say 
                        “we’re in the end game now”?

                                 RUTH
                        They have your uncle.

                                 BENJI
                        What?! Are you sure? How do you--

                                 RUTH
                        Too many people are still alive.

           She turns on her heel and walks off. Benji tries to keep up.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - HOTEL ARISTA - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruth and Benji slink through the UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE. 
           Benji spots the McLaren and signals to Ruth. 

                                 VALET ATTENDANT (O.C.)
                        Excuse me, ma’am, do you have your 
                        valet ticket?

           A VALET ATTENDANT approaches. 

                                 RUTH
                        Of course, it’s right here.

           She opens her bag. SHNNK. Ruth whips out a METAL BATON, 
           raising it in the air.

           But the VALET ATTENDANT pulls out a KNIFE! 

                                 BENJI
                        Fucking Naperville!

           Ruth and the valet throw down. He swipes at her but misses. 
           She crushes his hand with the baton, denting a Mercedes. He 
           glares at her and charges ahead. 

           THUNK! The Valet falls to the ground, revealing Benji, 
           standing behind him with the NUNCHUCKS.

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you, but I had it under 
                        control.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        You want me to just stand around 
                        and watch my mom have a knife 
                        fight?

                                 RUTH
                        We don’t have time for the 
                        attitude.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s not an attitude, it’s a 
                        question. Do you want me to just--

                                 RUTH
                        Get in the fucking car.

           Benji “ooohs” at his mom’s bad language.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Benji. Car. Now.

                                 BENJI
                             (grumbling)
                        We don’t have the keys--Oh.

           Benji watches in amazement as his mom HOT-WIRES THE IGNITION.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

           Ruth drives, fast.

                                 BENJI
                        If I’m Igor Skalnikoff, King of the 
                        Skull Boys, and I’ve abducted Uncle 
                        Gideon in treacherous Naperville, 
                        Illinois, where do I take him? 
                        Steak N’ Shake? Home Depot? 

           Ruth pulls onto the HIGHWAY. Benji clocks a sign: “CHICAGO.” 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        OK, that makes sense.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - LATER

           Quiet suburbia gives way to the hum of the BIG CITY. A 
           glittering SKYSCRAPER draws them like a beacon. The NEON LOGO 
           on top is the same MYSTERIOUS SYMBOL as Gideon’s TATTOO.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           EXT. THE CHICAGO HIVE - MOMENTS LATER

           They cruise by the building. The entrance is guarded by ARMED 
           MEN. People stream in and out like a NIGHTCLUB, flashing 
           something to the guards as they enter.  

                                 BENJI
                        Uncle Gideon’s in there?

                                 RUTH
                        The Colony has a hive in every 
                        major city. It’s safe to assume if 
                        Skalnikoff is in town, this is 
                        where they’d take him.

                                 BENJI
                        How do we get in? This feels weird 
                        saying to my mom, but I don’t have 
                        my fake ID on me.

                                 RUTH
                        You don’t need a fake ID, which 
                        we’ll talk about later.
                             (then)
                        You need an invitation.

           INT. BLACK ROSE TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT

           Benji sits in the tattoo chair. A TATTOO ARTIST preps her 
           needles and ink tray. Ruth hands the woman a HEAVY RED COIN.

                                 BENJI
                        Holy shit. I knew it.

           He texts Lakshmi: “SPECIAL COINS ALERT! SPECIAL COINS ALERT!” 

           She texts back: “OMG.” Then: “So bored. Why r u in Chicago?” 

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        Where do you want it? 

                                 RUTH
                        Let’s do the forearm so he can at
                        least cover it up with long sleeves 
                        later.

           Benji is so absorbed in texting back and forth with Lakshmi 
           that he barely registers what’s happening.

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        Works for me. 
                             (waiting, then)
                                 (MORE)
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
                        I’m not allowed to transfer the 
                        Sigil without a Sigil present.

                                 RUTH
                        Of course, sorry.

           She pulls up a length of skirt revealing the same CRYPTIC 
           TATTOO that Gideon has on his neck but on her INNER THIGH. 
           The same symbol that glowed on top of the building.

                                 BENJI
                        Wait, what’s happening?
                             (clocking hiked skirt)
                        Oh my GOD! Mom! 

                                 RUTH
                        We have to get your uncle out of 
                        there. Right?

                                 BENJI
                        Yeah, but....Jesus, put your skirt 
                        down--

                                 RUTH
                        This is how it has to be done, 
                        Benjamin. There are rules. Just 
                        look the other way!

           Benji squeezes his eyes shut. The tattoo artist gets to work. 

           EXT. BLACK ROSE TATTOO PARLOR - LATER

           They exit the tattoo parlor. Benji is admiring his forearm.

                                 BENJI
                        How does it look?

                                 RUTH
                        Uneven because you wouldn’t stop 
                        screaming “ouchie” in her ear like 
                        a baby, but good enough to get in. 

                                 BENJI
                             (re: tattoo)
                        I just want to point out that a 
                        week ago you wouldn’t even let me 
                        buy an old t-shirt on eBay because 
                        it was “too crude.” 

                                 RUTH
                        That shirt was crude. And stupid.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        It was funny! The Dunkin’ Donuts 
                        logo but it says “Funkin’ Gonuts”? 
                        That’s funny. 
                             (then)
                        So, now what? Any piercings you 
                        want me to get? 

                                 RUTH
                        No. But you’re right, we do have to 
                        do something about your clothes.

           INT. HIGH END TAILOR SHOP - NIGHT

           Another HEAVY RED COIN exchanges hands. A wizened TAILOR 
           measures Benji for a BESPOKE, TWO-BUTTON, BULLETPROOF SUIT. 

           In the background, Ruth is arming herself for what’s next.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - THE CHICAGO HIVE - SAME TIME

           Uncle Gideon opens his eyes: He’s in an ORNATE ROOM 
           overlooking the city. He looks down: HE’S TIED TO A CHAIR.

           The TWINS sit nearby. Cerberus braids her sister’s hair. Worm 
           Feeder loads one bullet in her gun, spins the chamber, aims 
           at Gideon, and pulls the trigger. 

           CLICK. Gideon doesn’t flinch, of course. Worm Feeder grins.

                                 CERBERUS
                        Careful, liebling, Skalnikoff wants 
                        him alive.

           Worm Feeder brushes her sister’s hands away.

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        Where the fuck is he?

                                 SKALNIKOFF (O.C.)
                        Just getting my tools!

           The twins jump to their feet. Skalnikoff enters with a 
           ROLLING CART, glinting with various TORTURE DEVICES.

                                 CERBERUS
                             (in German)
                        I hate when he does that. I can 
                        almost feel his breath on my neck.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 WORM FEEDER
                             (in German)
                        Shut up.

           Skalnikoff wheels the cart over to Uncle Gideon.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        I can’t believe you never told me 
                        you had a famous sister. 
                             (to the twins)
                        Did you know about this? Bonesaw, 
                        of the Daughters of Death. Yeah! I 
                        know! To think: one of world’s 
                        deadliest assassins is sister of 
                        another of world’s deadliest 
                        assassins! Although, maybe not so 
                        much deadly anymore, hmm? I mean, I 
                        expected more difficulty from the 
                        great Geist. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                             (spitting blood)
                        Untie me. I’ll show you how 
                        difficult I can be.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Untie you? No. I would never do 
                        that. Don’t even joke to me. 

           He holds a SURGICAL INSTRUMENT.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        After last time we talk I’m so mad 
                        at you, I want you dead. I tell 
                        everyone, millions of dollars you 
                        kill this guy, he hurt my feelings!
                             (then)
                        But then I say to self, Igor, stop. 
                        Igor, think. Igor, do not be 
                        carried away by baby emotions. 
                        Geist hurt you. Yes. So?

           At this, Skalnikoff sticks the blade into Gideon’s leg and 
           twists. Gideon makes no noise, but it’s clear it did hurt.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        ...You hurt him back. 

           Skalnikoff rips the knife out of Gideon’s leg. He eye-fucks 
           Gideon, HARD, hoping for a reaction. Gideon is stoic. After a 
           moment, Skalnikoff’s mood shifts again -- light, airy.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        But I do not kill you! Do you know 
                        why I do not? 

           He plunges the knife into Gideon’s leg again. He twists the 
           knife again. And again. Gideon finally grimaces. This one 
           hurts. Happy, Skalnikoff’s mood lifts again.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        I am at war with Tarik!  And it is 
                        your fault. So I brainstorm idea: 
                        what if I give you to Tarik. You 
                        killed his father. A blood offering 
                        will bring peace. 
                             (looking for validation)
                        Come on! That’s pretty good!

           Disappointed and annoyed with Gideon’s non-reaction to his 
           great idea, and bored of torture, Skalnikoff shoves a needle 
           full of sedative into Gideon’s neck, knocking him out again. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        Get the car ready.

           Worm Feeder heads for the elevator.

           EXT. THE CHICAGO HIVE - LATER

           Ruth and Benji stand across the street from the Hive. Ruth 
           wears a SEXY GOWN. Benji wears a BLACK SUIT just like Uncle 
           Gideon’s. Ruth tears up as she looks at him.

                                 RUTH
                        You look so handsome.

                                 BENJI
                        Oh, Mom, please. Now?! Don’t. 

           CLICK. Ruth took a photo of Benji on her phone.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sorry, it’s just--my baby is 
                        all grown up.

           He begrudgingly does a sheepish “ta-da” to show off his 
           outfit. Ruth does a quiet golf clap. 

                                 BENJI
                        You look nice, too.

                                 RUTH
                        Well, thank you very much!
                                        UNCLE WICK

           CLICK. Ruth took one more photo. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’m done. Seriously. 

                                 BENJI
                        Good. Let’s do this.

           Benji takes out the small glass bottle Uncle Gideon gave him 
           at Applebee’s and places an EYE DROP in EACH EYE.

                                 RUTH
                        What did you just take?

                                 BENJI
                        Uncle Gideon gave it to me. It’s 
                        Super Soldier Serum or something.

           Ruth grabs the bottle from him. She tastes the dropper.

                                 RUTH
                             (to herself)
                        That motherfucker.
                             (then)
                        Benji, this is just liquid cocaine.

           Benji grabs the bottle back from her.

                                 BENJI
                        Well, it’s WORKINNNNNG!

           Benji runs across the street. Oh boy.

           EXT. THE CHICAGO HIVE - LATER

           The ARMED MEN at the door size them up skeptically. Ruth 
           flashes her inner thigh tattoo and breezes past them. 

           Benji rolls up his sleeve to reveal his tattoo: FRESH and 
           BLOODY. The guards exchange a look but they wave him inside.

           INT. THE CHICAGO HIVE - CONTINUOUS

           This is a dark, sprawling DEN OF SIN. Music THUDS throughout 
           the building. SHADY CHARACTERS lurk everywhere. 

                                 RUTH
                        Just be cool.

                                 BENJI
                             (high on liquid cocaine)
                        Uh, I’m the fucking COOLEST. 
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Assassins give sidelong glances at Benji as he makes his way 
           through. He is bopping his head. Tweaking. 

           He finds Ruth at the bar. She slides a COIN to the BARTENDER.

                                 RUTH
                        Chopin on the rocks.

                                 BENJI
                             (strung out)
                        Make that two.

                                 RUTH
                        Do not make that two.

           Benji grabs a bar straw and starts CHEWING IT MANIACALLY.

           Ruth leans against the bar, surveilling the room. She clocks 
           a hallway leading to an elevator guarded by a SECURITY TEAM. 

           The elevator doors open and WORM FEEDER steps out.

           Ruth turns to the bar to hide her face, pulling Benji down 
           too. From the corner of her eye she sees Worm Feeder leave.

           She takes her drink, loops arms with Benji, and wanders them 
           over to the hallway pretending to be drunk. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        You take Tiny.

           The hallway entry is guarded by two men. Benji pulls his 
           NUNCHUCKS and attacks the shorter guy on the right while Ruth 
           pulls her guns and goes for the bigger guy on the left. 

           Benji’s nunchuck work is balletic. He’s just vibing as he 
           fights the guy. He’s practically dancing.

           He wins and leans over the man, screaming and laughing. Then 
           he just stares at him in wonder. He’s so high.

                                 RUTH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Benji!

           Benji looks up: in the time it took him to beat one guy, Ruth 
           has left a dozen bodies in her wake. She waits at the 
           elevator, frustratedly motioning: let’s go.

                                 BENJI
                        Right.

           They get in the elevator.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           They ride up in a gilded, antique elevator. Benji’s jittery.

                                 BENJI
                        Hey, Mom.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes, Benji.

                                 BENJI
                        If we don’t make it out of 
                        here...you were a good mom, and I 
                        love you. 

                                 RUTH
                        I love you, too, Bub.

                                 BENJI
                        Your hair is SO soft. Was it always 
                        this soft, mommy?!

                                 RUTH
                        When we finish saving your uncle, I 
                        am going to kill him.

           DING. The elevator has reached their floor.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - THE CHICAGO HIVE - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator doors open on the top floor suite with stunning 
           views over the city. The mood here is subdued: classical 
           music soothes the air, candles burn instead of strobe lights. 

           One entire wall is an AQUARIUM FILLED WITH SHARKS. Opposite 
           the aquarium is a BALCONY LEDGE over a two-story drop to 
           another lounge below. The walkway is narrow.

           At the end of the suite a woman steps out to block the way. 

                                 RUTH
                        Cerberus.

                                 CERBERUS
                        Bonesaw. Who’s your friend?

                                 BENJI
                        You can call me The Terminator.
                             (off Ruth’s look)
                        I like robots. It’s better than 
                        fucking BB Eight.
                             (then)
                        Your name’s Bonesaw!
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        Where’s Geist?

                                 CERBERUS
                        Come closer, I’ll take you to meet 
                        him.

           Cerberus settles into a FIGHTING STANCE. Benji realizes Ruth 
           is already in her fighting stance. He settles into one, too. 

           With a WAR CRY, Cerberus launches herself at them. Benji and 
           his mother fight side-by-side. They make a good team! 

           But Cerberus is one of the world’s deadliest assassins. She 
           judo throws Ruth into the wall. Ruth collapses on the ground, 
           her knife spinning away.

           Now, Benji fights Cerberus one-on-one. He’s holding his own, 
           but it obviously can’t last. He’s mostly defending, with no 
           opportunities to go on offense. 

           He swings the nunchucks at her, but she catches them and 
           yanks them out of his hands, tossing them over the ledge.

           NOW HE’S UNARMED. He blocks her attacks, but a few slip 
           through. And when they do, they’re brutal and exhausting. 

           He sees Ruth’s knife and grabs it, slicing Cerberus’s 
           Achilles just as Gideon taught him. She grunts, and stumbles. 

           He closes in, eyes screwed shut, SLICING AGAIN AND AGAIN.

                                 RUTH
                        Benjamin.

           Benji realizes he’s just stabbing Cerberus in the same leg, 
           over and over. She gives him a cold smirk, knocks the knife 
           away, and scissor-kicks him. He stumbles toward the drop-off.

           ON THE GROUND, still hurt, Ruth reaches for a gun. 

           Cerberus closes in on Benji, dragging her bad leg behind her. 

           Ruth can’t get a clean shot without possibly hitting Benji. 

           She aims to the right, and fires three times. POP POP POP! 

           Benji and Cerberus both turn at the sound of gunshots. 
           Cerberus looks behind her clocking the GLASS OF THE SHARK 
           AQUARIUM. It’s spider-webbing with cracks. 

           She gives Ruth a crooked grin: you missed.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           She only realizes her mistake when it’s too late as Benji 
           SHOVE KICKS her through the aquarium glass. A SMALL TIDAL 
           WAVE GUSHES OUT, SUBMERGING HER AND RELEASING THE SHARKS.

           Cerberus is flooded off of the ledge by three tons of water 
           and crashes to a floor two stories below.

           Benji rushes to Ruth and helps her up. She’s injured from the 
           fight and limping badly. 

                                 BENJI
                        Mom, are you okay?

                                 RUTH
                        I will be.

           They hear CERBERUS GROANING down below. She survived. Ruth 
           leans over the edge and SHOOTS TWICE. The groaning stops.

                                 BENJI
                        Jesus, Mom.

                                 RUTH
                        I never liked her anyway. She’s an 
                        anti-vaxxer.

                                 BENJI
                             (still so high)
                        Whaaaaaaaaaaaat--

           INT. PENTHOUSE - THE CHICAGO HIVE - CONTINUOUS

           They burst into Skalnikoff’s INTERROGATION ROOM to see an 
           ESCAPE DOOR clicking shut. 

           They can hear the ROTORS OF A HELICOPTER on the roof.

                                 BENJI
                        Shit!

           This time, Ruth has no choice but to agree with him.

                                 RUTH
                        Shit.

           EXT. THE CHICAGO HIVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji helps Ruth out of the building to see WORM FEEDER 
           pulling away in a LAMBORGHINI HURACAN.

           They get in the McLaren, parked at the curb. Ruth, injured, 
           takes the passenger seat. Benji presses the ignition button.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        Don’t worry, Mom. 
                             (extra serious)
                        I have my Learner’s Permit.

           He is about to put in more EYE DROPS. Ruth grabs the little 
           bottle and throws it out the window.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Hey! I need more! It’s wearing off!

                                 RUTH
                        Benji, I am still your mother, and 
                        I forbid you from taking any more 
                        liquid cocaine.

                                 BENJI
                        Narc.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes, I’m a big huge Narc. Now go.

           As they peel away from the curb, people within the Hive have 
           gotten the emergency signal. A bunch of armed men rush toward 
           awaiting SUVs and MOTORCYCLES. The chase is on.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT

           They race after Worm Feeder, who’s as good of a driver as 
           Uncle Gideon. Maybe better. 

           Up above, they can see the HELICOPTER heading somewhere. Worm 
           Feeder is following the helicopter. And they’re on her tail.

           Benji is TEXTING. Ruth gets pissed.

                                 RUTH
                        Do NOT text and drive! It’s so 
                        dangerous! 

                                 BENJI
                        Oh, is it? Is texting dangerous?! 
                        Here.

           Benji finishes one last text, hands her the phone.

                                 RUTH
                        What?

                                 BENJI
                        Driver drives. Navigator picks the 
                        music, those are the rules.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Ruth puts on Boyz II Men “Motown Philly.”

                                 RUTH
                             (off Benji’s look)
                        Driver drives. Navigator picks the 
                        music. Right? So shut up and drive.

           Benji stunt races through the streets of Chicago, keeping 
           Worm Feeder in view. He floats around corners. He speeds 
           through intersections, dodging traffic. HE’S GOOD!

           The motorcycles pull up alongside them. Ruth opens her door, 
           clotheslining one of the bikers and sending them flying head 
           first into the windshield of a parked car.

           Benji tries to mimic his mom, opening his door to smash 
           another motorcyclist. But the rider weaves out of the way, 
           and grabs Benji by the collar. 

                                 BENJI
                        Oh no! Oh fuck!

           They race toward a RED LIGHT. Benji is getting dragged out of 
           the car. Ruth grabs the wheel to steady it. 

                                 RUTH
                        Benji, gas.

                                 BENJI
                        What?! Mom, help me!

                                 RUTH
                        I am helping you. Gas.

           Benji hits the gas, speeding toward the intersection.

           At the last second, Ruth yanks up the parking brake. The car 
           enters a 360-DEGREE SPIN through the intersection. The car 
           dances smoothly, magically between oncoming traffic.

           Almost. 

           Benji’s door is sheared off by an on-coming BUS. The 
           motorcyclist is hit coming and going. He bounces off of the 
           bumper of the bus into the fender of a TAXI only to get 
           absolutely smashed by a DELIVERY TRUCK. 

           The motorcycle skids into a FIREBALL. 

           Benji recovers, but that was a close one.

                                 BENJI
                        What the fuck?!
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        Drive.

           He hits the gas again, speeding back into the chase. Worm 
           Feeder is just ahead. But the SUVs are gaining behind them. 

           Ruth is assassin-calm, mouthing the lyrics along to Boyz II 
           Men as they follow Worm Feeder onto the HIGHWAY...  

           EXT. CHICAGO HIGHWAYS - CONTINUOUS

           One of the SUVs rear-ends them, sending the car spinning. But 
           Benji has trained for this moment...

           He throws the car into reverse.

           Now they’re driving backwards, the SUV ramming them nose-to-
           nose. The vehicles are locked together, hurtling to disaster.

           In the rearview camera Benji clocks an 18-WHEELER. He guns 
           the engine, and now he’s PULLING THE SUV forward. Faster.

                                 BENJI
                        Mom, duck.

           They both duck their heads, and the sports car SLIDES BENEATH 
           THE TRUCK. The SUV smashes into it head-on.

           Benji lets the truck pass overhead, whips the McLaren around. 

                                 RUTH
                             (impressed)
                        Not bad.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s kind of my move.

           There’s one SUV left and it picks up speed. Worm Feeder will 
           lose them if they don’t catch up. Ruth pounds on the dash 
           until--CLICK--a release-latch opens a SECRET WEAPONS CACHE.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        That was there the whole time?!

           She pulls a MINI GRENADE LAUNCHER and fires one shot. The SUV 
           flips into the air in a giant explosion. Holy shit.

           They pull off the highway. Benji hits the gas and gains the 
           ground they lost on Worm Feeder, catching up to her as she...
                                        UNCLE WICK

           EXT. AIRFIELD - NIGHT

           ...speeds down a TARMAC. Benji’s right behind her. 

           In the distance, the HELICOPTER lands near a PRIVATE JET.

           The McLaren drags sparks, the front end is smashed, there’s 
           smoke coming from somewhere. It can’t go much further.

           Suddenly, Worm Feeder’s car does a 180-degree spin and STOPS 
           HARD, nose pointed straight at them. 

           Benji and Ruth stop. Worm Feeder gets out, gun drawn. 

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        Out.

           They get out of the car and face her, hands raised. 

                                 RUTH
                        Enough, Worm Feeder. Your sister is 
                        dead, you don’t have to join her.

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        That’s the difference between me 
                        and my sister. 
                             (then)
                        She might have cared.

           Worm Feeder SHOOTS RUTH, sending her spinning to the ground.

                                 BENJI
                        Mom!

           He rushes to Ruth’s side. She’s badly wounded but alive.

                                 RUTH
                        Benji, baby, run. Save yourself.

           Benji seems to consider it, but his eyes focus on something 
           in the distance. Suddenly, he’s confident.

                                 BENJI
                        No, mom. I feel like I’ve been 
                        pushed around by Skull Boys my 
                        whole life. 

                                 RUTH
                        Skull Boys?

           Benji stands, defenseless. He faces off with Worm Feeder, who 
           strides toward him.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        You know, you guys all have cool 
                        cars, and a lot of guns, and you 
                        love sushi, but you know what kids 
                        in high school have that you don’t?

                                 WORM FEEDER
                        Oh wow, please tell me.

                                 BENJI
                        Friends.

           WHAM! A JEEP comes barreling sideways across the tarmac, MEEK 
           MILL blaring. It smashes into Worm Feeder sending her flying.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Ruin my favorite jacket!
                             (realizing, sober)
                        Damn. Maybe I do have rage issues.

           ANGLE ON: Lakshmi’s phone on the dash, tracking Benji’s 
           location. The jeep stops. Lakshmi runs to Benji and Ruth. 

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        Ruth! Are you OK?

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t think there’s any 
                        inflammation of the peritoneum, so 
                        that’s good.

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (quietly to self)
                        Family of psychos.
                             (to Ruth)
                        ...OK...great.

           They hear the ENGINES OF A JET starting up. 

                                 BENJI
                        Uncle Gideon!

           Benji runs toward the helicopter where he can see Skalnikoff 
           forcing a beaten and drugged Gideon toward the jet.

           Skalnikoff turns to face Benji. He’s almost amused. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        You don’t give up. I like that.

                                 BENJI
                        You shouldn’t have killed my robot 
                        dog. Now I’m the baba yaga.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        You are not the baba yaga. But not 
                        bad for the grandson of Isaac the 
                        Scalpel. I met him once, your 
                        grandfather. Good man. Dangerous 
                        man. You look like him, just 
                        less...haunted.

                                 BENJI
                        Let my uncle go!

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Oh OK.
                             (then)
                        JJ: just joking. No, your uncle 
                        must pay for how he betray me. 
                        Plus, I need him for peace 
                        offering. 
                             (then)
                        But you I like. Come work for me. 

                                 BENJI
                        What?!

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        It’s in your blood. You were born 
                        to do this. You already have the 
                        sting of the beast.

           He motions to Benji’s sleeve, where the fresh sigil tattoo is 
           still bleeding through his shirt.

           Skalnikoff holds the gun out to Benji, urging him to take it. 
           He refuses. Skalnikoff drapes an arm over Benji’s shoulder.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        I will give you fifteen million 
                        dollars to shoot this man, and then 
                        you come work for me. Who is he to 
                        you? A stranger before this 
                        weekend. A demon who has brought 
                        hell upon your head. A little 
                        baggie of shit, smearing his shit 
                        everywhere.

           Skalnikoff thunks Uncle Gideon in the head with his gun.

                                 SKALNIKOFF (CONT’D)
                        Bad stinky duck.
                             (then)
                        But in you I see potential. I see 
                        the man you are already becoming.

           Benji looks at Gideon, beaten and broken at his feet.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        It’s funny you say that because 
                        lately I’d been really worried that 
                        I’m too much like my dad, afraid of 
                        my own shadow. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        And now?

                                 BENJI
                        That’s the thing. I was raised by 
                        my mom, motherfucker.

           Benji grabs Skalnikoff’s arm and executes a perfect DROP 
           SAYANAGI.

           Skalnikoff lands hard. Benji finishes the move with an ARM 
           BAR, breaking Skalnikoff’s arm. The gun skitters away. 

           Skalnikoff drags himself to his feet, dead arm flapping. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Interesting.

           Benji does a hard SIDEKICK into Skalnikoff’s knee. We can 
           hear it CRACK, and he stumbles. 

                                 BENJI
                        That’s for Pasta.

           Benji steps back as Skalnikoff lurches toward him, dragging 
           his lifeless, crooked leg along the cement.

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        You must finish what you have 
                        started. You must kill me. 
                        Otherwise, I will find you and I 
                        will finish what I have started.

           Benji kicks the other leg. Another loud CRACK. Skalnikoff 
           falls to the ground. 

                                 BENJI
                        That’s for Uncle Gideon.

           Skalnikoff, undeterred, army-crawls across the tarmac like 
           some unstoppable murder zombie determined to curse Benji.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        And this is for my mom.

           Benji does a traditional TAE KWON DO AXE KICK, his heel 
           landing hard on the back of Skalnikoff’s head, forcing his 
           face to bounce off the cement. This time, he’s out.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Benji rushes to Uncle Gideon and helps him to his feet. 

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Are you OK?

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        No. Are you?

                                 BENJI
                        No. Let’s get out of here.

           But Skalnikoff has regained consciousness and has crawled 
           himself to the gun. He aims it at them. 

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        All roads lead to death, little 
                        boy.

           Benji squeezes his eyes tight, waiting for the GUNSHOT. 

           But it doesn’t come.

           Instead, a hand lands on his shoulder. He opens his eyes, and 
           sees a large, handsome man in a beautiful bespoke suit 
           holding a gold-plated gun.

           It’s TARIK.

                                 TARIK
                        Go.

           Armed men surround Skalnikoff. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Tarik.

                                 TARIK
                        Geist. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Sorry again about your father. 

                                 TARIK
                        Consider us even.

                                 BENJI
                        Really? He killed your dad!

           Tarik and Gideon both look at him.

                                 TARIK
                        We had an arrangement. He got out, 
                        I got the Nizam. Who is this?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        They call me the Termin--

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Benjamin, time to go.

           Gideon reaches down and plucks Skalnikoff’s LUCKY COIN from 
           his hand. He gives it a practice roll along his knuckles.

           As they walk away, they hear Skalnikoff pleading...

                                 SKALNIKOFF
                        Tarik, kotik. Together we can forge 
                        a powerful alliance, one your 
                        father never had the courage to 
                        imagine. The Colony and the Niz--

                                 TARIK
                        Stop talking.

           Benji and Gideon get to Ruth and Lakshmi. The McLaren is 
           bullet-riddled, missing a door, the front-end is caved-in. 

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Let’s take your car.

           They drive away as, in the background, Skalnikoff is loaded 
           into Tarik’s jet to be taken to unimaginable misery.

           EXT. BENJI'S HOUSE - DAWN 

           Morning breaks as they pull up to the house.

           The four of them limp inside. They’re beyond exhausted. 

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Damn, your house is messed up.

           The house was destroyed in the fight with Skalnikoff--bullet 
           holes in the walls, knives sticking out of wood frames, 
           shattered glass--and now CHARRED by the controlled explosion. 

           Bodies everywhere.

           Gideon sits at what’s left of the dining nook table. 

           Lakshmi opens a CHARRED CUPBOARD, takes out some chips.

           Ruth sifts through the counter-top rubble to BREW COFFEE.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        I’ll call Bob.

                                 BENJI
                        Who’s Bob?

           LATER: the DOORBELL RINGS. Uncle Gideon goes to answer. Benji 
           and Lakshmi, curious, follow him to see who it is.

           An old man with HOODED EYES in a MOVER’S UNIFORM stands 
           there, holding a TOOLBOX. 

                                 BOB
                        Geist.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Bob.

           Uncle Gideon shows him into the house. 

                                 BOB
                        Bonesaw. You guys know each other?

                                 RUTH
                        Mind your business, Bob.

           Bob seems completely unmoved by the blackened, bloody damage. 

                                 BOB
                        OK. This it?

           Gideon nods, drops a stack of RED COINS into Bob’s hand.

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (elbowing Benji)
                        Magic coins! Magic coins!

                                 BENJI
                        I fucking told you.

                                 BOB
                             (to Uncle Gideon)
                        We’ll take it from here.

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (crunching on chips)
                        Bob, do you have, like, a price 
                        list for services? Like, how many 
                        red coins a rug cleaning costs, and 
                        how many for a body disposal?

                                 BOB
                        No.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           Bob goes to the door, SIGNALS to two GIGANTIC DUDES waiting 
           by a MOVING TRUCK. They BANG on the side of the truck. The 
           rear sliding door opens and a team of people in matching 
           uniforms carrying gear heads toward the house. 

           In quick succession we see them:

           - Hauling BODY BAGS out to the moving truck.

           - Sewing up Ruth’s bullet wound as she critiques their work. 

           - Scouring burned walls, tearing up the scorched carpet, etc.

           It’s impressive and efficient. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I should get home. Text me later?
                             (off Benji’s nod)
                        Welcome home, Ms. Stone.

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you, Lakshmi. 

           She exits. Then:

                                 BENJI
                        I’m gonna take a shower and I think 
                        I’m still a little high on liquid 
                        cocaine so I’ll probably do some 
                        other drugs to take the edge off.

           He looks at his mom to react, but Ruth is glaring at Gideon.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (O.C.)
                        What?

                                 RUTH (O.C.)
                        I told you we were gonna talk about 
                        the mess you caused later. It’s 
                        later, motherfucker.

           As Benji heads upstairs he can hear Ruth balling out Gideon.

                                 RUTH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        You told me you were out. I 
                        wouldn’t have asked you to watch 
                        him if I knew you’d drag him into 
                        your mess. Now my son’s upstairs 
                        doing drugs to come down from the 
                        other drugs you gave him?!

                                 UNCLE GIDEON (O.C.)
                        Ruth--
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH (O.C.)
                        Oh, don’t you “Ruth” me. I’m 
                        Bonesaw to you, bitch... 

           Benji closes the bathroom door and turns on the water.

           INT. BENJI’S ROOM - BENJI’S HOUSE - LATER

           Benji sits on his bed smoking one of the joints from 
           Lakshmi’s brightly colored tin of pre-rolls. Ruth knocks 
           before entering this time.

                                 RUTH
                        Hey, Bub.

                                 BENJI
                        Hey, Bonesaw. 

                                 RUTH
                        I suppose I deserve that but I 
                        definitely hate it. Are you OK?

           He takes a big hit from a joint before answering. She gives 
           him a dirty look, motions for the joint. He can’t believe 
           that’s still an issue at this point but he hands it over.

           She winks at him and hits the joint too. She blows PRISTINE 
           SMOKE RINGS. Of course she does. She’s Bonesaw.

                                 BENJI
                        I mean, I just saw a bunch of 
                        people die, and I helped kill some 
                        of them, and I almost died, and I 
                        watched you almost die, not to 
                        mention Uncle Gideon and my best 
                        friend almost died. So...I’m good.

                                 RUTH
                        I spent my whole life trying to 
                        shield you from that world. And I 
                        failed, miserably.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s OK. I mean, you personally 
                        took me to get an assassin tattoo 
                        last night. So, choices were made. 
                        But I’m sure it was hard 
                        to...juggle being a single mom and 
                        secretly being an assassin.  

           They share a moment of recognition between them.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 RUTH
                        I know we have a lot to talk about, 
                        but there’s time. I just wanted to 
                        tell you that I love you.

                                 BENJI
                        I love you, too, Mom. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh. Your uncle needs a ride to the 
                        airport. I thought you might want 
                        to drive him. 

           Ruth holds up a set of KEYS.

                                 BENJI
                        Holy shit. No. For real?!
                             (then)
                        Is it a McLaren? I’ve kind of 
                        gotten used to McLarens. I mean, 
                        I’d drive a Lamborghini, but--

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a used Prius.

                                 BENJI
                        That works!

           EXT. BENJI’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gideon loads his duffel bag into the trunk of a USED PRIUS. 
           Benji kisses Ruth on the cheek, gets behind the wheel. 

                                 RUTH
                        Wear your seatbelt, and follow all 
                        the rules of the road. And don’t 
                        park on raked leaves, they could 
                        catch fire. The car could explode-- 

           Benji GUNS THE ENGINE, which is just a soft ELECTRIC HUM. 

                                 BENJI
                             (shouting unnecessarily)
                        What Mom?! I’m sorry! It’s really 
                        hard to hear you!

            Uncle Gideon goes to Ruth to say goodbye.

                                 RUTH
                        Where will you go?
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Vienna? Singapore? I’d like to go 
                        somewhere like that for...not work.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s called vacation. You’re gonna 
                        hate it. Take care of yourself, 
                        Gideon. And don’t wait another 
                        twenty-five years to visit. 

           He nods and slides into the passenger seat. Benji tries to 
           PEEL OUT as best he can. It is just a Prius after all. 

           EXT. CHICAGO O’HARE AIRPORT - LATER

           Benji and Uncle Gideon pull up to PASSENGER DROP-OFF.

                                 BENJI
                        Well, it’s been...uh...

           Gideon hands him a small box wrapped in plain brown paper. 
           Benji opens it and finds a VERY INTENSE-LOOKING KNIFE.

                                 UNCLE GIDEON
                        Everyone should have a knife.  

                                 BENJI
                        This is pretty triggering for me at 
                        the moment, but...thank you. 

           Benji hugs Gideon who clearly does not know how to hug or 
           what a hug is. It’s a very touching moment for both of them.

           Gideon gets out of the car and, like any good assassin worth 
           his salt, he vanishes in the crowd.

           EXT. LAKSHMI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lakshmi is in her room playing on a DRUM MACHINE. She hears 
           CRASHING NOISES outside. She looks out her window to see:

           Benji, in his BULLETPROOF SUIT, doing donuts in his Prius.

                                 LAKSHMI
                             (calling out)
                        What are you doing?

                                 BENJI
                        It’s the Fall Ball, babyyyy!

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Oh God, you want to go to that?!
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI
                        I’m picking you up from your house 
                        in a suit, so, yeah, I’m thinking I 
                        want to go to that.

           INT. BENJI’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Benji drives, fast. Lakshmi’s dressed for the dance in true 
           Lakshmi style: jeans, t-shirt, cool jacket.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You know we’re both gonna be fucked 
                        up from last night for, like, ever.

                                 BENJI
                        So fucked up. This doesn’t end well 
                        for us.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I brought you something.

           She pulls a BOTTLE OF IMODIUM from her bag.

                                 LAKSHMI (CONT’D)
                        I thought you might want to try 
                        talking to Heather again, and I 
                        wanted you to be confident. It’d be 
                        a shame for you to fill your nice 
                        suit to the brim with diarrhea.

                                 BENJI
                        I know I joke around about you 
                        being the worst, but you are 
                        actually legitimately the worst. 
                             (then)
                        Do you really like my suit? I think 
                        it’s bullet-proof.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        You look great.

                                 BENJI
                        So do you.

           There’s a brief moment of awkward energy between them.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Why are you looking at me like 
                        that? This is not a date. We are 
                        not each other’s dates.

                                 BENJI
                        Eww! What? I know that! I was just--
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Well, you picked me up in a 
                        bulletproof tuxedo and now you’re 
                        looking at me--

                                 BENJI
                        I’m looking at you because I’m 
                        talking to you. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Then don’t talk to me! Just--eyes 
                        on the road, Imodium Jones.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - HIGH SCHOOL - FALL BALL - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter the gym. The MUSIC IS BLARING. The decorations 
           have been rehung, but there’s a DEEP SLASH through the “Night 
           2 Remember” banner and the TROPHY CASE has been boarded up.

           They see Heather Lang with her friends, who ignore them.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Just so you know, I think she’s 
                        basic as fuck and you’re too good 
                        for her. 

                                 BENJI
                        Thank you. There’s your boyfriend.

           ANGLE ON: Clint is punching Riley as hard as he can. Riley 
           gives him the finger with his broken hand in a CAST. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        They’re so dumb it’s almost art.

           An AIR HORN blasts and the RADIO EDIT of a DRAKE SONG starts 
           to play. Lakshmi makes a jerk-off motion at the DJ. He gives 
           her a look of disgust. Benji walks over to the PUNCH STATION, 
           where MS. PITT is watching the dance. 

                                 BENJI
                        Ms. Pitt, I’m so glad you’re alive. 

                                 MS. PITT
                        Are you? I know you were having 
                        stomach issues the day I was out, 
                        but if you didn’t want my help with 
                        your application you could’ve told 
                        me instead of ducking me all week.

                                 BENJI
                        I wasn’t ducking you. I just had 
                        to...find an ending for my essay.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 MS. PITT
                        OK. Well, you’re still on the hook 
                        for the mid-term, too.

                                 BENJI
                             (invoking Gideon’s menace)
                        There’s this guy who’s...traveling. 
                        At night. On a...road. And he comes 
                        up on this farm. He asks the 
                        farmer, hey, can I--there’s this 
                        storm, and I want to, like, stay 
                        here, and the farmer is like, 
                        totally. But in the morning...the 
                        point is, the farmer is...

                                 MS. PITT
                        Whatever you’re high on right 
                        now...I’m very jealous. 

           Benji returns to Lakshmi with two cups of punch. The music 
           transitions to a romantic slow song. They look at each other, 
           as if seeing each other for the first time. 

                                 BENJI
                        Should we...

                                 LAKSHMI
                        I was hoping you would ask.

           He reaches out and takes her hand, then leads her out onto...

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           ...the hood of his car. They sit and smoke weed. 

                                 LAKSHMI
                        Bob’s cute.

                                 BENJI
                        Something’s deeply wrong with you.

                                 LAKSHMI
                        At least my dick works.  

           Lakshmi laughs. Benji’s annoyed. They are best friends. 

           EXT. BENJI’S HOUSE - DAY

           CHYRON: Six Months Later

           Their house is back to normal. Ruth, bringing in the MAIL, 
           gets excited by what she sees.
                                        UNCLE WICK

           INT. KITCHEN - BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 RUTH
                        Benji! You’ve got mail!

           Benji comes in from upstairs. He’s trailed by PASTA 2.0.

                                 BENJI
                        What’s up, Mom?
                             (to Pasta 2.0)
                        Pasta, sit.

           The robot sits. Ruth motions to a MANILA ENVELOPE. He picks 
           it up nervously, and takes out a letter. He’s inscrutable.

                                 RUTH
                        Benji, I am going to throw up.

                                 BENJI
                        It’s from M.I.T.

                                 RUTH
                        I know it’s fr--What does it say?!

                                 BENJI
                        I got in.

           Ruth gives a SHOUT FOR JOY and grabs him into a little dance 
           to celebrate. Pasta dances with them. When they’re done, 
           Benji pours himself some coffee and gets a bowl of cereal. 
           Ruth goes through the rest of the mail. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey, this also came for you.

           She holds out a plain, brown box with a TON OF POSTAGE FROM 
           JAPAN. Benji opens the package and takes out a simple card. 

                                 BENJI
                        It just says “Gideon.” That’s nice.

           He digs deeper into the box and pulls out a ROBOT SEAL.

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                             (gasps)
                        Paro! Holy shit, I’ve never seen 
                        one in real life. These are like 
                        six thousand dollars.

           He hugs the robot and it SPEAKS. It’s not cute. It’s a 
           menacing voice speaking in JAPANESE. Ruth looks upset. She 
           curses under her breath...also in Japanese.
                                        UNCLE WICK

                                 BENJI (CONT’D)
                        Of course you speak Japanese. What 
                        does it say?
                             (then)
                        Ruth, I’m going to throw up! 

                                 RUTH
                        I have to be on the next flight to 
                        Osaka.

                                 BENJI
                        Mom--

                                 RUTH
                        You’re 17 now, you don’t need a 
                        sitter, you’re more than capable--

                                 BENJI
                        No, I’m fucking coming with you.

           Ruth looks at her son. She nods. They rush to the GARAGE. 
           MATCHING BLACK TACTICAL “GO BAGS” SIT PACKED BY THE DOOR. 

                                 RUTH
                        We’ll take my car. 

                                 BENJI
                        I’m driving.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re not driving. I’m driving.

           EXT. BENJI’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The car races out of the garage as HYPE MUSIC begins to play.

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Benji, what is this?

                                 BENJI (O.S.)
                        Driver drives. Navigator picks the 
                        music!

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        No, what is this? I like it!

           The MUSIC CRANKS UP as the car peels around the corner in a 
           cloud of rubber smoke and we:

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
