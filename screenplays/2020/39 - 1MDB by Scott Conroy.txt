           INT. THE BEVERLY HILTON (BALLROOM) - NIGHT

           We open on REAL FOOTAGE of the 2014 Golden Globe Awards. Co-
           hosts TINA FEY and AMY POEHLER are on stage, charming the 
           tuxedo pants off of the nominated TV and film STARS. 

           Over the din of the event comes the agitated voice of our 
           protagonist, CLARE (we’ll meet her shortly). 

                                 CLARE (O.S.)
                             (upper-crust English lilt)
                        Listen to me. This is the biggest 
                        financial crime in history. 

           NEAR THE FRONT OF THE BALLROOM - A table of A-listers that 
           includes LEONARDO DICAPRIO, MARTIN SCORSESE, JONAH HILL, and 
           MARGOT ROBBIE. They’re all in great spirits. 

                                 CLARE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We’re talking about something on 
                        the order of five billion dollars. 
                        Gone. Just like that. 

           ON STAGE - JENNIFER LAWRENCE, resplendent in a white gown, 
           stands behind the microphone. She opens a giant ENVELOPE. 

                                 JENNIFER LAWRENCE
                        And the Golden Globe goes to ... 
                        Leonardo DiCaprio. “The Wolf of 
                        Wall Street.” 

           AT HIS TABLE - Leo rises and grins. He turns to two UNKNOWN 
           PRODUCERS and performs a simultaneous bear hug with them.

           The first producer is JOEY McFARLAND (names and titles in 
           bold will be superimposed on screen). In his 30s, tall, 
           skinny, and blonde, McFarland exudes glib geniality.

           The second producer is RIZA AZIZ--the stepson of the 
           Malaysian Prime Minister. He’s also in his 30s, short, 
           skinny, balding, smirking, and thoroughly entitled. 

           Leo makes his way toward the stage. 

                                 CLARE (O.S.)
                        It was a scam from the beginning. 
                        And all the celebrities, the 
                        crooked politicians, the dirty 
                        bankers and lawyers. They dressed 
                        it up to look pretty. That’s how 
                        he’s gotten away with it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        The entire system is set up to 
                        enable a con artist like Jho Low. 

           Leo is now ON STAGE, standing behind the microphone and 
           holding his TROPHY as he addresses the Hollywood crowd. 

                                 LEONARDO DICAPRIO
                        Thank you to the entire production 
                        team: Joey, Riz, Jho. 

           AT LEO’S TABLE - Joey and Riza bask in the glow of having 
           Leonardo DiCaprio utter their names in this kind of setting. 

                                 LEONARDO DICAPRIO (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for being, not only 
                        collaborators, but for taking a 
                        risk on this movie. Truly. 

           Joey mouths, “thank you,” as Riza pounds his chest. One love. 

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON a woman’s face. She’s fed up. This is independent 
           journalist CLARE REWCASTLE-BROWN (in her 50s with long, 
           strawberry-blonde hair and penetrating, inquisitive eyes). 

                                 CLARE 
                        This is about how the 0.1 percent 
                        get to operate under a different 
                        set of rules than the rest of us. 
                        Can’t you see that?

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL a YOUNG FBI AGENT (square-jawed, stern) 
           and an OLD FBI AGENT (more congenial) seated across from her. 

           SUPER: “2016.”

           There’s also a female DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY (tightly 
           wound) who’s taking notes in her Washington-chic pantsuit. 

                                 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY
                        We can only address violations of 
                        U.S. law. The fact of the matter is 
                        that this sovereign wealth fund--

                                 CLARE 
                        1MDB is not a sovereign wealth 
                        fund. 

           SUPER: “1MDB: 1Malaysia Development Berhad.”

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Strategic development fund. 
                                 OLD FBI AGENT 
                        Isn’t that just semantics? 

                                 CLARE 
                        No!

           Uncomfortable silence. Clare collects herself. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Sovereign wealth funds are 
                        investment entities that oil-rich 
                        nations make for the benefit of 
                        their people. 1MDB, on the other 
                        hand, was borrowing money, using 
                        Malaysia’s limited oil wealth as 
                        collateral to create a personal 
                        piggy bank for the Prime Minister. 
                        But really, it was just a slush 
                        fund to subsidize Najib’s campaigns 
                        and his ghoul of a wife’s 
                        insatiable appetite for tacky 
                        handbags and garish jewelry. No, 
                        it’s not semantics. It’s crime.
                        But you knew that, right? You’re 
                        the FBI. I’m just some blogger. 

           They’re all unimpressed with her diatribe. 

                                 YOUNG FBI AGENT
                        Can we get back to “The Wolf of 
                        Wall Street” component?

                                 CLARE
                        Oh, let’s. Do you know about the 
                        party at Cannes they threw to kick 
                        off production? That was a doozy. 

                                 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY
                        I’m sorry, Ms. Rewcastle. But 
                        extravagant partying isn’t illegal.

                                 CLARE
                        Correct me if I’m wrong, but it is 
                        illegal, if it’s unknowingly 
                        financed by the national treasury. 
                        Is it not?

           She folds her hands on the table and waits for an answer.

           INT. MARCHÉ DU FILM - DAY

           We’re in the middle of the world’s biggest movie marketplace.
           SUPER: “Cannes Film Festival.”

           A coterie of lanyard-wearing PRODUCERS, DISTRIBUTORS, and 
           other international film industry PLAYERS rub shoulders 
           inside a cavernous, purple-carpeted convention hall. 

           It has the vibe of a trading floor, as high-strung men and 
           women negotiate through a cacophony of industry terms.

                                 PRODUCER
                        It’s “Kill Bill” but more violent. 

                                 DISTRIBUTER
                        2.5 mil gets you Europe and the 
                        Middle East on a handshake.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Meryl’s agent begged. I just didn’t 
                        think she was right for the part. 

           Joey and Riza navigate the labyrinth of makeshift hallways 
           delineated by pavilions that promote each movie for sale.

                                 JOEY MCFARLAND
                             (into his cell phone)
                        This is Red Granite’s coming out 
                        party, OK? We can’t fuck it up. Is 
                        everything set with Kanye’s suite? 

           Joey gives a friendly nod to a film EXECUTIVE.  

                                 JOEY MCFARLAND (CONT’D)
                             (into his cell phone)
                        Mr. West has a very strict rider. 
                        The dental floss has to be mint-
                        flavored, and all the vases must be 
                        cylindrical. If we allow even one 
                        rectangular vase to sneak in there, 
                        the launch party’s ruined. And if 
                        the launch party’s ruined, we could 
                        end up back making romantic 
                        comedies with some two-bit indie 
                        director, instead of the biggest 
                        fucking movie in the world with 
                        Marty Scorsese and Leo DiCaprio. 

           Joey hangs up and pockets his phone. Riza nudges him and nods 
           toward a LOW-BUDGET FILM PRODUCER (wide-eyed, sweating 
           through his shirt), who’s making his pitch to a trio of 
           disinterested FINANCIERS.
                                 LOW-BUDGET FILM PRODUCER
                        It’s a coming-of-age story about a 
                        young woman coming to terms with 
                        her true identity.   

           Joey and Riza stifles their laughter.

                                 RIZA
                        We’ve got to be spending more on 
                        our launch party than the entire 
                        budget of that movie. 

                                 JOEY
                        Bro. We’re spending more on 
                        appetizers. 

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Riza, Joey, and a couple hundred PARTYGOERS dance under the 
           stars to the thumping beats of KANYE WEST, who performs his 
           hit “Gold Digger” from a makeshift stage.

           A high-end buffet offers LOBSTER, CHAMPAGNE, and all kinds of 
           other high-end food and drinks served up by tuxedoed WAITERS. 

           AT THE BAR - JHO LOW--the third guy that Leo thanked in his 
           acceptance speech--presses a lime slice into his CORONA. Not 
           yet 30 years old, ethnically Chinese, and built like a beach 
           ball, Jho carries himself with a quietly cunning confidence.

           Nearby, some of the partygoers gawk at Jho. He may not be a 
           celebrity, but this is clearly a man with a reputation. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Everybody having a good time?

           BIG CHEERS as a FIREWORKS DISPLAY lights up the festivities. 

           BY THE SHORELINE - Cocktail in hand, The real-life “Wolf of 
           Wall Street” JORDAN BELFORT (48, tan and chiseled) watches 
           the fireworks with his girlfriend, ANNE (a vivacious blonde). 

                                 JORDAN BELFORT
                             (Queens accent)
                        I guarantee you this thing cost $3 
                        million to put on. Minimum. 

                                 ANNE
                        Jeez. Who spends that much cash on 
                        a party for a movie that hasn’t 
                        even started shooting yet?
                                 JORDAN BELFORT
                        Nobody spends money like this that 
                        they actually worked for.

           Belfort eyes Jho Low, who’s still holding court at the bar. 

                                 JORDAN BELFORT (CONT’D)
                        He may be a well-spoken boarding 
                        school boy, but I’m telling you: 
                        this Jho Low guy’s a fucking con 
                        man. 

           EXT. BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

           The posh boarding school CAMPUS overlooks the surrounding 
           English countryside from its hilltop perch. 

           SUPER: “Harrow School. 1999.”

           HIGH SCHOOL BOYS in matching straw boater hats, pressed 
           slacks, and ties, exit a 16th century red-brick academic 
           building and head out onto the pristine quad. 

           Seventeen-year-old Jho Low (pudgy with glasses that don’t fit 
           his face) struggles to keep up with a wealthy KUWAITI BOY 
           (physically imposing and already quite sure of himself) and a 
           wealthy RUSSIAN BOY (handsome and equally precocious). 

                                 RUSSIAN BOY
                        So what’s the plan for winter 
                        holidays, lads? 

                                 KUWAITI BOY
                        How about Ibiza? My family owns a 
                        villa near Santa Eulalia. 

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        Sounds cool. Are there direct 
                        flights to Ibiza? 

           The Russian and Kuwaiti boys exchange a look that resides 
           somewhere on the spectrum between pity and irritation. 

                                 KUWAITI BOY
                        Most people just fly private. 

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        Oh, yeah. I could totally do that. 

           The three boys turn onto a brick path back toward their dorm. 

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW (CONT’D)
                        Or you guys could come to Malaysia. 
           It’s as if he’s just proposed a trip to Neptune. 

                                 KUWAITI BOY
                        Malaysia?!

                                 RUSSIAN BOY
                        Honestly, I think I’d rather go on 
                        holiday to Kosovo.

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        No, no. You’ll like it, I promise. 
                        My family is kind of like royalty 
                        there.

           Jho’s buddies are intrigued now. 

           EXT. COLONIAL MANSION - NIGHT

           SUPER: “Penang, Malaysia.”

           The well-manicured grounds of a British colonial-era MANSION 
           are illuminated by floodlights. A couple dozen Malaysian 
           TEENAGERS in late-90s attire are lined up outside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM (COLONIAL MANSION) - CONTINUOUS

           The bubblegum pop of Britney Spears’ “Baby One More Time” 
           plays at full blast in an empty living room.

           A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of the mansion’s BILLIONAIRE OWNER posing 
           with his family sits on the mantle above the fireplace. 

           Seventeen-year-old Jho eases the photo out of its frame and 
           replaces it with a NEW PHOTO of himself and his own family.

           He walks over to the exterior door and opens it.

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        Welcome, everybody.  

           The kids--including the Kuwaiti and Russian boys from Harrow--
           stream into the mansion. They all look exceedingly impressed. 

                                 KUWAITI BOY
                        Damn, Jho. You weren’t kidding. 

           The Russian boy gives Jho a bro-hug.
           INT. LIVING ROOM (COLONIAL MANSION) - LATER

           The party is now in full swing. With a red solo cup in hand, 
           a pretty TEENAGE GIRL approaches Jho.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Great party, Jho. 

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        Thanks. Glad you could make it.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        But I thought you lived down the 
                        street in Georgetown. 

           Jho doesn’t even break a sweat. He smiles back at her. 

                                 17-YEAR-OLD JHO LOW
                        Nah, that’s just for the help. 

           The girl is satisfied by this answer. And impressed.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Very cool.

           Jho basks in her affirmation, as he takes her solo cup and 
           pours her some PUNCH from the bowl. The consummate host. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Clare shifts uncomfortably in her middle seat in coach, 
           wedged between two OVERWEIGHT MEN.

           SUPER: “Ten years later.” 

           On her lap is an old BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTOGRAPH of her 
           smiling MOTHER, stern FATHER, and bubbly seven-year-old self. 
           In the photo, Clare and her parents are posing in front of 
           their HOUSE-ON-STILTS, deep in the Malaysian rainforest. 

           The bottom of the photo is marked in pen, “7-8-66, Sarawak, 
           Malaysia.” Clare leans forward to look out the window, as the 
           plane descends over what appears to be a pristine RAINFOREST. 

           EXT. PALM OIL REFINERY - DAY

           A RENTAL CAR heads down an ACCESS ROAD that cuts through the 
           lush rainforest.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Seated behind the wheel, Clare’s expression sinks, as the 
           verdant landscape changes into smoggy, industrial blight. 

           She pulls up to a SECURITY GATE outside a PALM OIL REFINERY 
           that’s still under construction, its chimneys already 
           belching out GRAY SMOG into the clear-blue sky. 

           Clare rolls down the window and leans her head out to speak 
           to the SECURITY GUARD.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s going on here? 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Are you an employee? 

                                 CLARE
                        Of what? I used to live here. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Nobody lives here now. This is a 
                        palm oil refinery.  

           Clare scowls at him. She throws the car into reverse. 

           INT. LOGGING SITE - DAY

           NATIVE PROTESTERS in traditional garb are CHANTING angrily in 
           front of a TIMBER-CLEARING TRUCK. Clare has a small DV camera 
           trained on one particular NATIVE ELDER.

                                 NATIVE ELDER
                        The politicians and their cronies 
                        are destroying our land to make 
                        themselves rich.

                                 CLARE
                        Do you feel you have any voice in 
                        what happens here in Sarawak? 

                                 NATIVE ELDER
                        None. Please, tell the world what 
                        is happening to us. 

           A black SUV screeches up to Clare and the protesters. The 
           driver’s side window rolls down, and a Malaysian LOGGING 
           EXECUTIVE pokes his head out. 

                                 LOGGING EXECUTIVE
                        Out of the way! Stop filming!
           Unfazed, Clare turns her camera on the logging executive. The 
           guy starts CURSING at Clare in Malay. 

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A framed photograph of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak 
           hangs on the wall of this drab, bureaucratic workspace.

           KEVIN MORAIS, Deputy Public Prosecutor for the Malaysian Anti-
           Corruption Commission (mid-50s, Indian-Malaysian, looks like 
           he works too hard) sits at his out-of-date desktop computer.

           ON MORAIS’ COMPUTER SCREEN - Underneath the URL 
           “SarawakReport.com,” a blog post is titled, “How Taib Has 
           Robbed Sarawak.” The posted is written by “Anonymous.”

           Included in the post is an embedded VIDEO that shows the 
           logging site that we just saw, as well as an image of ABDUL 
           TAIB MAHMUD--the 74-year-old Chief Minister of Sarawak. 

           Morais picks up the phone and dials.

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Tony. Have you read this “Sarawak 
                        Report” blog online?

           INT. TONY PUA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Malaysian Opposition Party member TONY PUA (40s, spiky hair, 
           intelligent eyes, and bristling with energy), is on the phone 
           at his desk. He has Clare’s blog pulled up on his computer. 

                                 TONY PUA
                        Wow. I need to find out who’s 
                        behind this. He’s got some balls!

           ON HIS COMPUTER - Tony pulls up the “anonymous tip line” 
           phone number that’s listed on Clare’s web site. 

           EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT ARRIVALS - DAY

           Clare is on the phone with Tony Pua, as she scans the 
           arriving cars, looking for her ride.

                                 TONY PUA (O.S.)
                        Your accent is not what I was 
                        expecting. I feel like I’m talking 
                        to the Queen of England. 

           Clare laughs. 
                                 CLARE
                        Thank you so much for reaching out. 
                        Sometimes I wonder whether anyone 
                        reads my blog at all.

                                 TONY PUA (O.S.)
                        And sometimes I wonder whether any 
                        westerner can find Sarawak on a 
                        map. But I guess the answer is yes. 

                                 CLARE
                        Well, I was born in Malaysia, just 
                        like you were. I’d love to see you 
                        the next time I’m in KL. I’m quite 
                        familiar with your anti-corruption 
                        efforts. Perhaps you and I could 
                        make some trouble together.  

           Clare spots an old gray Sedan and waves at its driver. 

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clare’s laconic husband, ANDREW BROWN (50s, ruddy-cheeked, a 
           full head of thick, gray hair) sits behind the wheel. He 
           kisses Clare on the cheek as she buckles her seatbelt.

                                 ANDREW
                             (Scottish accent)
                        How was the old homestead?

                                 CLARE
                        They turned my backyard into a palm 
                        oil refinery. But apparently, my 
                        blog is making some ripples. That 
                        was a member of the Malaysian 
                        Parliament on the phone just then.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m glad it was worthwhile. But 
                        it’s good to have you home. 

           He pulls away from the curb. 

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - DAY

           Clare trudges up the winding, wooden staircase with Andrew 
           following behind her, carrying her suitcase.

                                 CLARE
                        Taib’s a nasty little tyrant, but 
                        he’ll wither under more scrutiny.
                                 ANDREW
                        So you’re planning to make another 
                        trip back to Sarawak, I take it?  

                                 CLARE
                        Well, I can’t do all of my 
                        reporting from the kitchen counter.

           They make it to the top of their fifth-floor walkup. Clare 
           opens the door with a key. 

           INT. CLARE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a mess. DIRTY SOCKS compete for floor space with TAKEOUT 
           CONTAINERS. The rug is stained with something purple. 

                                 CLARE
                        Jesus, Andrew. 

                                 ANDREW
                        What? You were gone for two weeks.

           She sighs, as she steps over a pizza box and into the--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A VIOLENT VIDEO GAME is in progress, as Clare’s sons ALEX 
           (14) and PATRICK (12) battle each other on the couch with an 
           opened bag of potato chips providing a makeshift barrier 
           between them. 

                                 ALEX
                             (staring at the TV)
                        Hi, mum. 

                                 CLARE
                        That’s it? How about a hug?

                                 PATRICK
                        Right after this game. 

           Clare throws her hands up in defeat. 

           EXT. THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY

           The glittering MONTE CARLO SKYLINE presides over dozens of 
           multi-million dollar YACHTS anchored in its harbor. 

           OUT IN THE OPEN OCEAN - a massive MEGA YACHT cuts through the 
           choppy water. 
           This thing makes the regular-sized yachts look like tug boats 
           by comparison. Its name, “ALFA NERO,” is painted in bold, 
           black letters on the aft deck. 

           INT. OWNER’S BEDROOM SUITE (ALFA NERO) - DAY

           A cabin fit for a billionaire--or a man pretending to be one. 

           Jho Low is eating a sumptuous, mimosa-fueled breakfast while 
           speaking into his cell phone in Cantonese. At the table with 
           him is a Malaysian man, who’s about his age. This is Eric 
           Tan, otherwise known as “FAT ERIC.” (He’s a little overweight 
           but not as fat as Jho is.) 

           Fat Eric attempts to cut a piece of bacon but is thwarted by 
           the limitations of his butter knife. He settles on using his 
           fingers instead, as Jho’s SECOND CELL PHONE rings.

                                 JHO LOW
                             (in Teochew; subtitles)
                        I’ll call you back later, OK? 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Bro. Can we settle on one language 
                        and just enjoy breakfast for once? 

           Jho puts his finger in the air as he finishes both calls and 
           then sets his two phones back down on the table. 

                                 JHO LOW
                             (in Hokkien; subtitles)
                        After this deal goes down, I’ll 
                        hire an expensive tutor who can 
                        teach Teochew to an idiot. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                             (in Hokkien; subtitles)
                        Don’t be an asshole.

           Fat Eric rips off another piece of bacon. 

                                 FAT ERIC (CONT’D)
                        So this guy, Turki. He’s, like, a 
                        real Saudi prince?

                                 JHO LOW
                        King Abdullah’s seventh son. So, 
                        yeah, he’s royalty, but he’s not 
                        exactly next in line. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        So what do we want to do business 
                        with him for?
                                 JHO LOW
                        Because when you’re the seventh 
                        son, you’re an afterthought. Which 
                        makes you willing to cut corners.

                                 FAT ERIC
                        But he and Obaid do run PetroSaudi.

                                 JHO LOW
                        PetroSaudi is basically a shell 
                        company. I’m connecting them to the 
                        Prime Minister of Malaysia here. 
                        Najib will make their business look 
                        respectable. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        But why does Najib need them?

                                 JHO LOW 
                        Same reason. Legitimacy. He’ll be 
                        able to brag that his major public 
                        initiative, 1MDB, can attract big-
                        time Middle Eastern wealth. This 
                        joint venture is gonna help him 
                        fulfill his promise to transform KL 
                        into a global financial center.

                                 FAT ERIC
                        But how? I thought PetroSaudi isn’t 
                        bringing in any cash to this.

                                 JHO LOW
                        It’s bringing its oil reserves. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Which you said were hardly worth 
                        anything. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Najib knows enough not to ask too 
                        many questions. We’re going to ... 
                        tweak some documents to suggest 
                        that 1MDB is owed repayment on a 
                        loan by PetroSaudi. That’ll allow 
                        us to take our share out of the 
                        transaction. 

           The gears churn ever so slowly in Fat Eric’s head. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        That all sounds real shady.
                                 JHO LOW
                        Jesus, Eric. It’s basically a 
                        commission. These are complicated 
                        financial machinations, OK? I went 
                        to Wharton. Where did you go, The 
                        University of Chuck E. Cheese?

                                 FAT ERIC
                        So it’s kind of all about 
                        appearances then.

                             (in Hokkien, subtitles)
                        Which is why we’re not going to 
                        tell Najib that Prince Turki is 
                        just renting this yacht. 

           Jho winks at him. Fat Eric smiles back, happy to feel 
           included in this scheme that his buddy has set up.

                        It’s hard to get rich people to 
                        invest their money in a venture 
                        like this. But you know what makes 
                        it easier? 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Booze? 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Getting other rich people to 
                        invest. No one wants to feel like 
                        they’re losing out. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK (ALFA NERO) - DAY

           The pristine, multi-tiered deck of the 269-foot nautical 
           monstrosity shimmers under the bright Mediterranean sun, as a 
           helicopter come in for an easy landing on the HELIPAD. 

           The propellers come to a stop. The first man to exit the 
           chopper is Prince Turki Bin Abdullah, the seventh son of the 
           King of Saudi Arabia (late 30s, dressed in his yacht-wear: a 
           white baseball cap, blue linen pants, and linen shirt). 

           Following behind him is Tarek Obaid (Prince Turki’s bushy-
           haired, gregarious childhood friend and business partner).

           Waiting for both men on the tarmac, Jho extends his hand to 
           greet them one-by-one, in the manner of a confident maitre’d.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Welcome, gentlemen. Please.
           He points Turki and Obaid toward the yacht’s interior. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK (ALFA NERO) - LATER

           Another helicopter touches down for a landing. Once again, 
           Jho is standing there to greet the arrivals. The first to 
           step out of the chopper this time is a MALAYSIAN BODYGUARD. 

           The bodyguard then reaches out to offer a hand to the First 
           Lady of Malaysia, Rosmah Mansor (mid-50s, steely-eyed and 
           humorless in her white leopard print shirt). She’s wearing 
           enough makeup and hair products to make Dolly Parton blush. 
           This is a woman who believes she belongs on a mega-yacht.

           The third person out of the helicopter is newly elected 
           Malaysian Prime Minister NAJIB RAZAK (mid-50s, white linen 
           shirt, salt-and-pepper hair, thin mustache). Though he’s a 
           world leader, Najib clearly plays second fiddle to his wife. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        An honor to have you both here. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Where is the Prince?

                                 JHO LOW
                        Prince Turki and Mr. Obaid are 
                        inside. But why don’t you relax a 
                        bit before we talk business. 

           He points Rosmah and Najib toward the SUN DECK, as the 
           chopper takes off again and the pad begins to UNFOLD into a 
           stunning INFINITY POOL. Rosmah looks on approvingly.

                                 ROSMAH
                             (to Najib)
                        Can I advise you something?

           He doesn’t need to answer. The “yes” is implied. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        You need to get serious about 
                        building our wealth. Appearances 
                        matter for a Prime Minister. 

           She pushes in front of her husband and follows behind Jho. 

           INT. MAIN SALON (ALFA NERO) - DAY

           Jho sits with Prince Turki and Obaid on white couches.
                                 JHO LOW
                        I’ve taken care to brief the Prime 
                        Minister on the unique opportunity 
                        to monetize your oil fields in the 
                        Caspian Sea. He’s particularly 
                        eager to discuss that. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        To be clear, PetroSaudi actually 
                        owns just an option on those oil 
                        fields, which is about to expire. 

                                 TAREK OBAID
                        But the option could still prove 
                        quite lucrative indeed. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Yes, and you can renew it, I’m 
                        sure, once you receive the proposed 
                        cash injection from 1MDB. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        Indeed.

                                 JHO LOW
                        And would process go through the 
                        government of Turkmenistan?

                                 TAREK OBAID
                        The Turkmenistan portion is 
                        actually in disputed waters, but 
                        that’s not for us to worry about. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        No, of course not. In fact, I could 
                        see that being an asset. You might 
                        want to present it that way when 
                        you speak to the Prime Minister.

           Turki sits with Najib, as Rosmah works on her tan nearby. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        Our oil fields in the Caspian are 
                        so valuable that multiple countries 
                        are trying to lay claim to them. 

           Najib opens his mouth to respond, but before he can do so--

                                 ROSMAH
                        Impressive, indeed.

                        We’ll need to have PetroSaudi’s 
                        assets valued by a neutral party, 
                        but what is a fair estimate?

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        I think ... oh ... $1.5 billion.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Feel free to be a bit more ...

           Turki and Najib continue to finalize this joint venture. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        Our assets will be valued at $2.5 
                        billion, minimum. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Very good. So Malaysia will provide 
                        $1 billion in cash from 1MDB, which 
                        will then be invested as--

                        --Jho sees fit. And in return, 
                        you’ll provide your $2.5 billion in 
                        assets to the joint venture. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        Exactly. It’s a win-win. 

           Najib nods approvingly.

           EXT. MAIN DECK (ALFA NERO) - DAY

           Turki, Obaid, and Jho approach the lounging Najib and Rosmah.

                        Prime Minister. Madam First Lady. 
                        I’m so glad you’re getting some 
                        time to relax and enjoy yourselves. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        I feel a bit like royalty out here.

                        Well, I’m sure you’ve been told 
                        that you look just like Queen Noor.

           glasses of tropical juice.

                        How could engaging in this level of 
                        shady activity be worth it to 
                        Najib? It just doesn’t compute.
                                 CLARE
                        It does if you understand Malaysian 
                        politics. Najib’s party, the United 
                        Malays National Organization (UMNO) 
                        had been in power since 
                        independence in ‘59. But the 
                        coalition it led was losing ground.
                        Through this joint venture with 
                        PetroSaudi, he gained the ability

                        But there must have been some

                        Yes. And all the crooks needed was 
                        a “neutral party” to convince them 
                        that PetroSaudi’s assets might 
                        actually be quite valuable. Someone

           Morse that includes the sentence, “We are looking for a mid-
           range of $2.5bn.” 

           Morse types his reply: “I think you won’t be displeased with

           PetroSaudi’s director of investments, Patrick Mahony (32, 
           British, suave, and pretentious) sits at his computer. He 
           picks up his cell phone and dials Jho Low.

                        He gave us a $3.6 billion

           Holding the letter, Obaid knocks quickly and then enters the 
           more modest office down the hall. 

           Sitting at his desk is the head of PetroSaudi’s London 
           Office, XAVIER JUSTO (40s, tall, fit, broad-shouldered, with 
           a goatee and lots of tattoos). He becomes important later on.

           Obaid hands the letter to Xavier. 

                                 TAREK OBAID
                        Can you give this one last look?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                             (Swiss-German accent)
                        Sure, I’m on it. 

           Xavier takes the letter back to his desk to read, and Obaid 
           turns to leave. But before he makes it to the door-- 
                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Tarek.

                                 TAREK OBAID
                        Yeah?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I still haven’t gotten reimbursed. 

                                 TAREK OBAID
                        Shit. Must be some administrative 
                        fuck-up. I’ll get you your money by 
                        the end of next week. 

           Before Xavier can protest, Obaid quickly exits his office. 

           INT. MANDARIN ORIENTAL HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY

           The windows overlook COLUMBUS CIRCLE from the ritzy hotel’s 
           34th-floor lounge. Mahony shares a couch with Jho. They’re 
           both looking over a series of documents.  

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        So, before you send it on to the 
                        Seychelles, the 700’s gonna go from 
                        1MDB’s Deutsche Bank account to 
                        this Coutts account in Zurich?

                                 JHO LOW
                        Coutts. Banker to the Queen.

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        Extra layer of legitimacy. Smart. 

           Mahoney’s phone buzzes. He checks it. 

                                 PATRICK MAHONY (CONT’D)
                        It’s my guy at BSI.

           Mahoney excuses himself and walks off to take the call. As 
           the BSI banker on the other end of the line begins to speak, 
           Mahony’s expression changes into one of deep irritation.

                                 PATRICK MAHONY (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        No, no. It’s all above board. Do 
                        you want our business or not? 

           Mahony begins to pace the room as the banker responds. He 
           ends the call in a huff and returns to face Jho.
                                 PATRICK MAHONY (CONT’D)
                        BSI won’t play ball on setting up 
                        the joint venture account for the 
                        remaining 300. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        What?

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        My guy there can’t get the transfer 
                        past their internal regulators. 

           Jho’s expression sink. He tries to maintain his composure. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I’ll take care of Deutsche Bank and 
                        Coutts. You need to fix this BSI 
                        problem. We’ll meet back here in 
                        three days to finalize everything.

           As Mahony quickly dials another number on his cell, Jho 
           hurries out of the office, checking his watch as he walks. 

           INT. DEUTSCHE BANK OFFICE (KUALA LUMPUR) - DAY

           Jho sits across from JACQUELINE HO (a relationship manager 
           for Deutsche Bank). 

           SUPER: “Deutsche Bank offices, Malaysia.” 

                                 JHO LOW
                        We need you to make the transfer 
                        right away, or else the entire 
                        joint venture could fail. This is 
                        very important to Malaysia’s 
                        relationship with Deutsche Bank. 

                                 JACQUELINE HO
                        It’s rather unusual for a client to 
                        make a transfer request in person.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Yes, well. This is a sensitive 
                        transaction. And it involves 
                        governments. You never know who’s 
                        listening on the other end of a 
                        phone call.

           She’s uncomfortable but trying to remain professional. 

                                 JACQUELINE HO
                        Our compliance department has 
                        raised some questions. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACQUELINE HO (CONT'D)
                        For instance, why isn’t the $1 
                        billion going directly into the 
                        joint venture with PetroSaudi? Why 
                        are you asking us to transfer $700 
                        million into an unnamed account in 
                        Switzerland? 

                                 JHO LOW
                        The Swiss account is owned by 
                        PetroSaudi. It’s to repay a loan to 
                        them. I really don’t want to bring 
                        the Prime Minister into this, but I 
                        will, if I must.  

                                 JACQUELINE HO
                        Mind if I step out for a moment?

           Jho motions toward the door. She exits. 

           INT. CORNER OFFICE (DEUTSCHE BANK) - MOMENTS LATER

           Jacqueline Ho stands before a DEUTSCHE BANK SENIOR PARTNER. 

                                 DEUTSCHE BANK PARTNER
                        These are very important clients. 
                        Approve the transfer. 

           She nods and exits the office. 

           INT. COUTTS HEADQUARTERS (ZURICH) - DAY

           Jho stands before a COUTTS COMPLIANCE OFFICER.

           SUPER: “Zurich.”

                                 COUTTS COMPLIANCE OFFICER
                        In order to accept this transfer of 
                        $700 million, we need the 
                        beneficiary to be named on the 
                        account. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        It’s Good Star LTD. 

                                 COUTTS COMPLIANCE OFFICER
                        Which is owned by whom?

                                 JHO LOW
                        It’s is an investment management 
                        company. 1MDB has decided to invest

                        Seychelles that I’m just now 
                        hearing of for the first time?

                                 JHO LOW
                        I’m sorry you haven’t heard of it, 
                        but that’s your own shortcoming. 

           The compliance officer looks skeptical. But he just nods. 

                                 COMPLIANCE OFFICER
                        OK. 

           INT. MANDARIN ORIENTAL HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY

           Patrick Mahony paces the lounge, on the phone again. 

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        Yes, I appreciate that. Bye.  

           He ends the call. Fresh off of his jaunt to Malaysia and 
           Switzerland, Jho approaches him, pulling his roller suitcase. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        We good with BSI?

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        Nope. They won’t do it. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        What the Hell were you 
                        “appreciating” then? 

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        My new guy at J.P. Morgan. He’s 
                        setting up the joint venture 
                        account to take in the remaining 
                        300 as we speak. Giddy up, partner. 

           Jho does a little fist pump and pats Mahony hard on the back. 

           EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - DAY

           Jho exits the Time Warner Center, composing an email on his 
           BLACKBERRY as he walks. 

           ON JHO’S BLACKBERRY - “Just closed the deal with PetroSaudi--
           looks like we have hit a goldmine.” 

           He practically floats onto 59th Street.
           BEEEEEEEP!

           A PEDESTRIAN pulls Jho back by the shirt collar at the last 
           moment, as a TAXI nearly slams into him.

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        You got a death wish, buddy?

           Jho just stares back at the pedestrian, like he’s in a dream.

           INT. LE BERNARDIN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Jho and Mahony sit at the three-Michelin Star restaurant with 
           views overlooking Central Park. Jho scans the wine list and 
           points out to the WAITER a $52,000 bottle of 1929 Domaine de 
           la Romanée-Conti.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Two of these. 

                                 WAITER
                        Oh, I’m sorry, sir. We don’t do 
                        that one by the glass. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        No, two bottles. 

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        We’re celebrating. 

           The waiter stares back at him. He’s serious.

                                 WAITER
                        Very good, sir. 

           As the waiter leaves to fetch the $104,000 worth of wine. Jho 
           picks up his cell phone. 

           ON JHO’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - His GOOD STAR LTD. bank account 
           shows an incoming transfer of $700 million. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Do you want your thirty-three now?

                                 PATRICK MAHONY
                        Tomorrow’s fine. Let’s enjoy 
                        ourselves tonight. We’ve earned it.

           Jho’s second cell phone rings. He answers it. 
                                 JHO LOW
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Yeah, everything’s set. I’ll begin 
                        making disbursements tomorrow. 

           Mahony just shakes his head, as he looks over the menu. For 
           Jho, the work never ends. 

           EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

           Prince Turki and Tarek Obaid exit the MOSQUE, put on their 
           shoes, and step out onto a busy central London sidewalk. They 
           immediately check their cell phones.

           On PRINCE TURKI’S CELL PHONE - An incoming transfer of $77 
           million from Good Star LTD. 

           On TAREK OBAID’S CELL PHONE - An incoming transfer of $153 
           million from Good Star LTD. 

           Turki and Obaid head out onto the street where their two GOLD-
           PLATED LUXURY CARS are parked illegally. 

                                 PRINCE TURKI
                        Last one there pays for the first 
                        lap dance. 

           Suddenly, Turki jumps into his ROLLS ROYCE, as Obaid throws 
           himself into his BENTLEY. Within seconds, each car SCREECHES 
           away from the curb and out onto the street. The race is on. 

           EXT. LONDON - DAY

           Turki and Obaid weave recklessly in and out of traffic. The 
           BENTLEY narrowly avoids a collision with a double-decker bus, 
           skidding to a stop at the very last minute. 

           As the Rolls uses the moment to gain an advantage, the 
           Bentley skids out again, almost slamming into a stop sign.

           PEDESTRIANS are left standing there, dumbstruck by the 
           drivers’ utter disregard for the people around them, as the 
           two cars make their way toward the famed neighborhood of--

           EXT. WHITEHALL (LONDON) - DAY

           We SOAR over Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and land on 
           the nearby apartment complex where Clare lives. 
           INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - DAY

           Carrying four bags of groceries, Clare trudges up that 
           rickety, wooden staircase with Alex and Patrick behind her. 
           Alex shoves Patrick in the chest. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Ow! 

                                 CLARE
                        Hey! Alex, you do not hit your 
                        brother. Especially on the stairs. 

                                 ALEX
                        I didn’t. 

                                 CLARE
                        Oh, no? My eyes must be broken. 

           They make it up to the fifth floor. She drops the shopping 
           bags and fiddles with the keys before unlocking the door.

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A cramped space befitting a middle-class family in central 
           London with a compact washer-dryer under the sink. Clare sits 
           at the small ISLAND, typing furiously on her laptop.

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - The back-end production tool for a 
           BLOG POST is headlined, “A Key Question On Taib’s Opulent 
           Sarawak Residence” by Anonymous. 

           Clare hits “publish” and then refreshes her web browser to 
           see that the post is now live.

           Sound of the front door CREAKING open and then SLAMMING shut. 
           Andrew enters the kitchen in his suit with his tie loosened. 
           He’s been drinking, though not to excess.  

                                 ANDREW
                        Hiya. 

           He goes immediately for the refrigerator, pulls out a plate 
           of leftover chicken, and walks it over to the microwave. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        Burning the midnight oil again?

                        I’ve got another big one tonight on 
                        Taib. You know he’s got properties

                        Bloody crook. 

           Andrew puts the leftovers in the microwave and hits “start.” 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        But everyone expects a little graft 
                        in Malaysia, right? The trick is 
                        not to be too blatant about it, so 
                        people don’t start sniffing around. 

                                 CLARE
                        That’s exactly what I’m doing, 
                        Andrew. Sniffing around. Holding 
                        power to account in a forgotten 
                        corner of a forgotten country.

                                 ANDREW
                        And good on you for doing it.

           She smiles a little, as he pours himself a glass of water. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        But it’d be nice if someone paid 
                        you for your work, don’t you think? 

           Her smile evaporates, as Andrew sets to work on his chicken.

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        What? It’s a stretch to cover our 
                        bills on one salary. You know that.

                                 CLARE
                        But my work is important. 

                                 ANDREW
                        I agree. But you’re not even 
                        putting your name on your posts. 

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe it’s time I change that.

           Clare begins typing on her laptop. Andrew comes around the 
           table to look at the screen. 

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - She deletes “Anonymous” in the 
           byline. In its place, she types, “By Clare Rewcastle Brown” 
           her finger hovers over the “Save” button. She hesitates. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Are you sure that’s a good idea?

                                 CLARE
                        You just finished telling me--
                                 ANDREW
                        Yes, but the trolls will all come 
                        out from under the bridge. You’ll 
                        have a great, big target on your 
                        back. Isn’t there an easier way? 

           She scrutinizes him. Isn’t impressed. 

                                 CLARE
                        I’m not going to go work at Tesco, 
                        if that’s what you’re asking. 

           She hits the “Save” button emphatically.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe the added visibility will 
                        help me land bigger stories.

                        I’m thinking beyond Malaysia.

                                 JHO LOW
                        I was actually looking at some

                        I’m tired of the minor leagues. I

           Yak looks out the window, as he considers what to say next. 
           As he turns back to Jho, his expression is newly serious. 

                                 YAK YEE CHEE
                        Are you familiar with the “Know

                        that banking professionals such as

                        Oh, no. I have no doubt about that

                        Others do not have to worry about. 

           Yak hands the business card to Jho, who reads it. The card 
           provides contact info for Shearman & Sterling Law Offices.

                        amenable to a discreet process that 
                        honors the very sacred concept of 
                        attorney-client privilege. 

           Jho pockets the business card. 

           INT. SHEARMAN & STERLING LAW OFFICES - DAY

           A Shearman & Sterling ATTORNEY (60s, salt-and-pepper hair, 
           expensive suit, gold watch) sits across from Jho inside one 
           of New York’s most prestigious law firms. 

           The attorney flips through a PACKET of high-end real estate.
                                 ATTORNEY
                        We have clients from all over the 
                        world who want to invest in the 
                        U.S. They’re from Venezuela, 
                        Russia, China. You name it. We 
                        typically offer them what’s called 
                        an “interest on lawyer account.” 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Which is what exactly? 

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Many of our high-net-worth clients 
                        prefer to remain anonymous. So we 
                        create in-house bank accounts at 
                        the firm for our clients to move 
                        their cash into without public 
                        scrutiny. Then we use that money 
                        for any acquisitions they may want 
                        to make in the U.S. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        And you’re not obligated to look 
                        into the source of these funds?

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Not legally or ethically obligated. 
                        In fact, our most important 
                        fiduciary duty is to our clients. 

           The attorney smiles reassuringly. Jho smiles back.

           Russian and Chinese BILLIONAIRES move in and out of the 
           marble lobby. A HIGH-END REAL ESTATE AGENT directs Jho toward 
           the elevator. Fat Eric trails behind his friend.

                        The unit is on the 76th floor and 
                        was recently rented to Jay-Z.

                        $30 million. And I must tell you 
                        that the seller is expecting 
                        multiple, all-cash offers. 

           They enter the elevator, and the doors close behind them.   
           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator begins to ascend. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        You could go in at 35.

                        Or 40. To be safe.

           The elevator doors open directly onto a lavish urban oasis, 
           offering sweeping, panoramic views of New York City. Jho 
           turns to Fat Eric, who gives him a thumbs up. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        OK, yeah. 40 is fine.

                        Excellent. I’ll have the paperwork 
                        sent over to your attorneys.

           Fat Eric checks his watch.

                        company. 

           Jho shoots daggers at Fat Eric, who tries to recover.

                        Oh, have they made anything I’ve

           MONTAGE

           Jho goes on a real estate-buying binge across the country 
           that begins with him boarding his brand new BOMBARDIER JET. 
           On the private plane, he signs the paperwork to purchase his 
           New York City penthouse apartment. 

           In Beverly Hills, he closes on the L’Hermitage Hotel and Red 
           Granite Pictures. He hands the keys to the Red Granite 
           offices to Riza and Joey, who are thrilled. 

           Jho next focuses on partying with his growing entourage. They 
           TRASH a five-star hotel suite in Miami beach. 

           The next morning, a naked Jho lies on the hotel carpet next 
           to a MODEL. He’s working his phones, looking unfazed.

           RINGING slot machines and SHOUTS fill the brightly lit floor. 

           IN A CORDONED-OFF HIGH-ROLLERS SECTION - Jho is at a 
           blackjack table, surrounded by a gawking entourage of 
           CELEBRITIES, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, HANGERS-ON, and Fat Eric.

           Next to a neat whiskey, Jho has a stack of about $5 million 
           in chips in front of him. He places a $100,000 bet. The 
           DEALER draws blackjack. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Ah, you got me. 

           For the next hand, Jho doubles his bet to $200,000. Loses 
           again. His entourage lets out a collective sigh. 

           Jho slides forward $400,000 in chips for his third bet.

                        Odds of me losing three straight

           The dealer wins again. 
                                 FAT ERIC
                        What about four straight hands?

           Jho slides $800,000 in chips toward the dealer.

                        the high-roller room. 

           Fat Eric taps Jho on the shoulder.

                        Come on. Let’s go play roulette. 

           Ignoring him, Jho places $1,600,000 on the table, and another 
           hand begins. Jho has an Ace, while the dealer is showing a 
           five. Jho doesn’t hesitate.

                        Double-down. 

           Jho counts out another $1,600,000 in chips and places them 
           next to his original bet. He now has $3,200,000 wagered on a 
           single hand. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        You don’t have to double with an 
                        Ace, you know. 

           Jho hands a $100,000 chip to Fat Eric.

                        wheel? I’ll join you in a bit. 

           Eric takes the $100,000 and marches off. Jho then turns back 
           to his $3,200,000 hand. His second card is a five of spades.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Hit. 
           The dealer turns over a four of clubs. 

                                 DEALER
                        20! 

           Everyone cheers. Jho gives out a couple of high-fives. Phew. 

           The dealer turns over his next card: Ten of diamonds. He 
           flips over another one. Ace of spades. One more card. The 
           five of diamonds. 

           Time seems to stand still as everyone in the room does the 
           math. Five+ten+one+five. Could it be? 

                                 DEALER (CONT’D)
                        21. So sorry. 

           As the dealer takes the $3,200,000 off the table, everyone in 
           the group turns to Jho, unsure of what to say. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I’ll get it back. Another whiskey. 
                        And where are my red T-shirts?! 

           INT. CASINO - LATER

           Jho is still sitting at the blackjack table. But he has just 
           twenty $1,000 chips remaining, in spite of the red T-shirts 
           that everyone is now wearing for good luck. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Alright, I’m done. Tough night. 

           He hands out a thousand-dollar chip to each member of his 
           entourage and gives the remaining chips to the dealer as a 
           tip. 

                                 DEALER
                        I’m sorry, sir. 

           Jho shrugs, as Fat Eric arrives back at the table. He’s 
           wearing a big grin.

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Check it out. I doubled my money!

           He shows off his $200,000 in chips. Jho just smiles and pats 
           his buddy on the back. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Nice work. 

           He turns to the rest of the group, eager to lighten the mood. 
                                 JHO LOW (CONT’D)
                        Drinks on Fat Eric tonight. We’re 
                        just getting the party started!

           Clare is perched on a bar stool, typing on her laptop. 

           SUPER: “That night.” 

           Her cell phone buzzes. She answers it. 

                                 CLARE
                        Hello?

           EXT. PAY PHONE - CONTINUOUS

           A driving RAINSTORM has cleared out the streets of downtown 
           Kuala Lumpur, as the Anti-Corruption Commission’s Kevin 
           Morais stands at a pay phone. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Is this Ms. Rewcastle Brown?

           INTERCUT KEVIN MORAIS AND CLARE

                                 CLARE
                        Speaking. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        I’ve been an admirer of your 
                        reporting on corruption in Sarawak. 

                                 CLARE
                        Oh? Well, I’ll take the compliment. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        I have a tip for you. 

                                 CLARE
                        Lovely. And who is this?

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        It has to be anonymous. 

                                 CLARE
                        OK. But it’d be helpful to know 
                        where you’re calling from. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Kuala Lumpur. Your blog has gotten 
                        some attention in the capital.
                                 CLARE
                        Really? Well, that’s nice to hear.

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        You’re focusing on the wrong guys 
                        though. Yes, Taib is corrupt. But 
                        Sarawak isn’t the big story. Ever 
                        heard of a man called Jho Low? 

           Clare Googles the name. 

                                 CLARE
                        It sounds vaguely familiar.  

           Clare scans through REAL PHOTOS on gossip blogs of Jho’s wild 
           partying, including a series of shots that show him dancing 
           and sharing a giant bottle of champagne with PARIS HILTON. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like he enjoys himself. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        He’s a convincing charlatan. And a 
                        thief. If you consider the total 
                        amount that has been stolen, I 
                        believe he may well be the biggest 
                        thief who’s ever lived. Look into 
                        his connections to Najib.

                                 CLARE
                        Can I get your number, at least? So 
                        I can follow up with--

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        This is extremely dangerous 
                        business. You’ll need to dig around 
                        yourself. But please be careful. 

           Morais hangs up the phone. Clare grabs a Post-It note and 
           scribbles with a pen, “Jho Low + 1MDB?” 

           She chews on the pen cap.

           A BRITISH AIRWAYS flight touches down on the runway. 

           INT. TONY PUA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Clare sits with Tony, who’s at his desk. 
                                 TONY PUA
                        Yes, the name “Jho Low” is on 
                        everyone’s lips in KL. 

                                 CLARE
                        From his online footprint, he seems 
                        to be primarily interested in 
                        partying. Do you think this guy 
                        could really be involved with 
                        funneling dirty money to Najib?

                                 TONY PUA
                        The least likely criminal 
                        mastermind is often the most 
                        effective one. Keep digging. 

                                 CLARE
                        My husband won’t say it out loud, 
                        but he thinks I’m tilting at 
                        windmills by even trying to expose 
                        corruption in this country. 

           Tony claps his hand together in delight. 

                                 TONY PUA
                        If you’re Don Quixote, can I be 
                        Sancho? 

                                 CLARE
                        I’m not doing this as a lark, Tony.

                                 TONY PUA
                        Najib is rotten to the core, but he 
                        controls the traditional media. 
                        Those of us who oppose him need to 
                        find new ways to get information 
                        out before the next election. You 
                        can do that with your blog. 

                                 CLARE
                        I’ll do my best. What’s your 
                        strategy in this?

                                 TONY PUA
                        You know what the modern-day epic 
                        novel is? The YouTube video. 

           She let’s out a little chuckle.

                                 CLARE
                        Well, I’m a serious journalist, 
                        Tony, not a performer. 
                                 TONY PUA
                        And I am a “serious” legislator. 
                        But I can walk and chew gum. 

           EXT. MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICES - DAY

           The striking, onion-domed building overlooks a mosque from is 
           perch on a hill in the administrative center of Malaysia.

           INT. MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wearing a suit and tie, Jho sits on a white couch. Najib 
           enters the office, glares at him, and turns to an AIDE. 

                                 NAJIB
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Close the doors. 

                                 AIDE
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Yes, sir.

           The aide shuts the double-doors and steps out. Najib takes a 
           seat on the couch opposite Jho.

                                 NAJIB
                        The fund is yours to manage. I 
                        don’t want to know details. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I understand. And I assure you that 
                        everything is on very solid ground. 

                                 NAJIB
                        But?

                                 JHO LOW
                        We need to ensure that we maintain 
                        our relationship with the Saudis, 
                        as we approach the next election. 
                        And that means further investment.

                                 NAJIB
                        What kind of “further investment”? 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Another $800 million injection from 
                        1MDB into the joint venture with 
                        PetroSaudi should suffice for now. 

           Najib scoffs. 
                                 NAJIB
                        It’s out of the question. You are 
                        beginning to bite off more than you 
                        can chew, young man.

           The double-doors SWING open. Rosmah enters, dressed to the 
           nines with a Birkin handbag draped over her shoulder.

                                 ROSMAH
                        Is there some problem? 

           Jho stands to greet her. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Good afternoon, Madam. The Prime 
                        Minister and I were just discussing 
                        some future investments.

                                 ROSMAH
                        Is he giving you what you need to 
                        run things properly?

                                 NAJIB
                        Rosmah, please. 

           She ignores him and remains focused on Jho. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Is he? 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I wouldn’t be asking, if it weren’t 
                        absolutely essential. But I 
                        understand the Prime Minister’s 
                        instinct to be cautious with money. 

           Rosmah scowls at her husband.

                                 ROSMAH
                        You know, Malaysia has never had a 
                        female Prime Minister. But now, it 
                        has a leader who lacks testicles.

                                 NAJIB
                        We have to consider the scrutiny.

                                 ROSMAH
                        Can I advise you something?

           Yes, she can. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        You have goons to handle scrutiny. 
                        You just tell him, “OK,” lah. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        You think our family’s expenses can 
                        be paid on a government salary?

                                 NAJIB
                        Rosmah--

                                 ROSMAH
                        You have sacrificed to become a 
                        public servant for the people of 
                        Malaysia. The least they owe you in 
                        return is a real salary fit for a 
                        man of your stature. 

           Jho purses his lips as he waits for Najib’s response. The 
           Prime Minister gives him a little nod. It’s done. 

           INT. RED GRANITE PICTURES - DAY

           Joey and Riza sit at a conference table with a trio of 
           Hollywood AGENTS. Jho stands off to the side, staring at one

                        You know who you guys should really 
                        talk to? Leo DiCaprio. 

                                 AGENT #2
                        Great idea.

                        We’d love to. What’s the project?

                        He and Marty have been trying to

           Jho continues to stare at his cell phones. 

           ON JHO’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - An email from Timothy Leissner 
           of GOLDMAN SACHS. The subject line reads,  “Opportunity.” 
                                 JHO LOW
                        Yes, we’d love to make it work. 

           EXT. GOLDMAN SACHS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The brand new, ultra-luxurious, forty-four story skyscraper 
           on West Street abuts the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. 

           INT. CORNER OFFICE - DAY

           Goldman Sachs President GARY COHN (50s, intense, a few wisps 
           of gray hair flanking his bulbous head) is at his desk 
           talking to TIMOTHY LEISSNER, Goldman Sachs’ head of 
           investment banking for Southeast Asia, (a tall, immensely 
           confident, crisp-suited banker in his early 40s).

                                 GARY COHN
                        I appreciate you coming in. Hope 
                        you’re not too jet-lagged. 

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER 
                             (German accent)
                        No, fully adjusted. I’m in planes 
                        more often than pussy these days.

           Cohn chuckles, as he cups his hands in front of him. 

                                 GARY COHN
                        Look. You’re one of our top 
                        performers, not just in Asia, but 
                        across the firm. And your recent 
                        work in monetizing the state is 
                        especially promising.

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        Governments tend to suck at 
                        governing these days, but they’re 
                        great at spending money. Wait until 
                        you hear about this new deal I’m 
                        cooking up with IPIC and Malaysia.

           $70 billion sovereign wealth fund owned by Abu Dhabi.”

                        Before you get into it, I need to 
                        ask: Is our work in Malaysia all on 
                        the up and up? 

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        Excuse me?
                                 GARY COHN
                        Compliance wants to know more about 
                        the role of this “Jho Low” 
                        character. Is he gonna cause 
                        problems for the firm? 

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        His ties with the Prime Minister 
                        and his family are indispensable. 

                                 GARY COHN
                        OK, but is he on the level? Because 
                        if the shit hits the fan here, I’m 
                        hanging you out to dry on this. 

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        Yes. He’s a legitimate businessman.

                                 GARY COHN
                        Alright. I’m taking your word for 
                        it. So what’s ado in Abu Dhabi?  

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        An opportunity, sir. One replete 
                        with the inimitable allure of 
                        Middle Eastern enchantment.

                        Mansour? I’ve never met someone 
                        worth $50 billion before.

                        Because you don’t fly to France for 
                        a meeting when you’re a member of

                        in place, right? 

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        Yes. This is really just an

                        We’re not here to party. We’re here

                                 TIMOTHY LEISSNER
                        Look, it’s all straightforward. 
                        Goldman will use our own capital to 
                        underwrite the bonds for 1MDB.
                        And then, in exchange for 1MDB 
                        paying $1.4 billion to Aabar--

                        bonds, which is gonna make them a 
                        hell of a lot sexier to buyers.
                        We all take our cuts off the top.

                        And everybody wins. 

           Jho looks a bit nervous, as Leissner FLOORS it.

           A SERVANT opens the door for Jho and Leissner, who enter what 
           is essentially the French version of the Playboy Mansion.

           in his early 40s but weathered from years of hard partying) 
           sits on a couch with views overlooking the Mediterranean, 
           cigar in hand. He’s wearing a skimpy bathing suit and a T-

                        the meantime, how about a smoke?

                        before we light our victory cigars.

                        There’s really not much more to 
                        discuss. Goldman will raise three 
                        bond issuances for 1MDB, totaling 
                        $6.5 billion. Prime Minister Najib 
                        will get to build his shiny new 
                        financial district in Kuala Lumpur. 
                        $400 million will then go--

           Another SERVANT enters carrying a pot of tea and three 
           serving sets on porcelain plates. He begins to pour the tea.

                        my home is trustworthy.

           Leissner doesn’t seem entirely convinced of that.

                        The 400 “birthday cakes” will go 
                        into your Luxembourg account. Jho

                        Wooooooow. Financial crime’s so 
                        easy. Turns out, you just need to 
                        know rich and powerful people who 
                        also lack a sense of shame, lah.

           As a MAKEUP ARTIST touches up his face, Tony’s CAMERAMAN 
           gives him a thumbs up, and the camera’s RED LIGHT turns on.

                        Well, Aabar Investments PSJ was a 
                        subsidiary of IPIC--the Abu Dhabi 
                        sovereign wealth fund. That’s 
                        regular, old, legitimate Aabar. But 
                        KAQ was talking about Aabar 
                        Investments Ltd. A lookalike fund.

                        Mohamed al Husseiny set up in the 
                        British Virgin Islands. As a shell 
                        company, it had a hard exterior, 
                        but it was empty inside.

                        The entire purpose of this Aabar 
                        was to confuse regulators into 
                        assuming it was the legitimate 
                        Aabar, making it easier for the 
                        thieves to siphon off hundreds of 
                        millions of dollars from this new 
                        venture with Goldman. The technique 
                        of naming a shell company to sound 
                        like a legitimate one was simple, 
                        but it proved quite effective.

                        So effective, in fact, that Jho 
                        later employed it himself when he 
                        bought a $100 million stake in EMI 
                        Records using the cut he took from 
                        the Goldman bonds. To disguise the 
                        source of funding, Jho had Fat Eric 
                        set up a shell company called 
                        Blackstone Asia Real Estate 
                        Partners, which was designed to 
                        confuse regulators into thinking it 
                        was part of The Blackstone Group--a

           Now wearing traditional Swiss hiking gear and flanked by the 
           snowy peaks of the Alps, Tony shivers in the cold.

                        As a backup plan, KAQ and al 
                        Husseiny funneled the Goldman funds 
                        through a bank in Switzerland that 
                        KAQ himself owned. That’s right, he 
                        actually owned the bank himself! 
                        Which meant that KAQ could report 
                        whatever he wanted to the 
                        authorities. Must be nice. Tony Pua 
                        would like to own a bank some day.

           Wearing a fancy suit, Tony is standing outside the Goldman 
           Sachs building in Lower Manhattan.

                        Worried about legal exposure from 
                        its role in facilitating this dirty 
                        deal, one Goldman executive argued 
                        for the firm to reduce the fees 
                        that Leissner charged 1MDB, which 
                        eventually totaled $600 million--a 
                        couple hundred times larger than 
                        typical. But other executives at 
                        the firm shot down that idea. After 
                        all, it was raining cash!

           Hundred-dollar bills begin falling from the sky. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Tony is fully naked, sitting in a BATHTUB, a la Margot Robbie 
           in “The Big Short.” But instead of soapy water, Tony’s tub is 
           filled with gold coins. He holds up a glass of champagne. 

                                 TONY PUA (CONT’D)
                        For his efforts in spearheading the 
                        deal, Leissner was rewarded with a 
                        salary and bonuses of over $10 
                        million in 2012, as Goldman raked 
                        in record profits at the expense of 
                        the Malaysian people. 

           Tony takes a long sip of champagne, mugging for the camera.

                        Wealthy banks cashing in, while the 
                        most vulnerable are left footing 
                        the bill. Sounds familiar, doesn’t 
                        it?

           He crosses his legs, splashing some of the gold coins over 
           the edge of the tub.

                        Back in primary school, I had a 
                        funny nickname. People used to call 
                        me, “The Big Short.”

           Tony sits at his laptop, adding to his YouTube video REAL 
           FOOTAGE of Margot Robbie posing for photos with Riza and Joey 
           McFarland at a “Wolf of Wall Street” premiere event. 

           Tony hits “publish” on his now completed video. 

           EXT. POOL AREA - DAY

           KAQ, Jho, and Leissner are lounging by KAQ’s INFINITY POOL, 
           which features a stunning view of the Mediterranean, as 
           several TOPLESS WOMEN drink wine in the nearby HOT TUB.

                                 KAQ
                        Well, gentlemen. I’d say it’s time 
                        we light those cigars. Shall we?

           He reaches for his “KAQ”-branded cigar box.

                        Speaking of celebrating, I’m having 
                        a little birthday get-together in 
                        Vegas next week. I’d be honored, if 
                        you would attend. 

                                 KAQ
                        I wish I could. But I have quite a 
                        bit of copulating to do before I 
                        return to my family in Abu Dhabi. 
                        I’ll send a birthday cake instead. 

           He hands Jho a cigar and lights it for him. 

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAY

           CONSTRUCTION WORKERS put the finishing touches on a massive 
           CIRCUS TENT that’s been erected at the foot of the Wynn 
           Hotel. The tent is surrounded by crowd control stanchions, as 
           a pair of MONSTER TRUCKS flank the entrance. 

           A BUS pulls up and parks in front of the tent. Two-dozen 
           LITTLE PEOPLE dressed as Oompa-Loompas, their faces painted 
           orange, exit the bus and surrender their cell phones to a 
           SECURITY GUARD before entering the tent.
           AT THE ENTRANCE - A high-strung PARTY PLANNER speaks to her 
           ASSISTANT, clipboard in hand.

                        Leo’s here. Marty, Bradley, and 
                        Tobey are on their way. I haven’t 
                        heard an update on De Niro, 
                        Kardashian, or Galifianakis.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I’ll check with their assistants. 

           Two CATERERS carry a massive FAUX BIRTHDAY CAKE toward the 
           entrance. The party planner stops them

                        In the cake?

                                 PARTY PLANNER
                        Yes. I’m not going to ask Britney 
                        Fucking Spears to hide inside an 
                        uncomfortable cake!

                        I think it’ll be cozy enough. 

           She waves them through, and they enter the tent.

           sticky target, just like in “The Wolf of Wall Street.” 
           - The faux birthday cake is rolled out onto the stage. 
           BRITNEY SPEARS (seen from the back in a short, gold skirt) 
           jumps out of it and leads the crowd in “Happy Birthday.”

           - Lavish luxury vehicles are brought out as birthday gifts 
           for Jho, including a red Lamborghini, a ribbon-wrapped 
           Bugatti Veyron, and three Ducati motorcycles. 

           - His face flushed from booze and excitement, Jho mouths 
           “Thank you” to the adoring crowd.

           IN THE VIP SECTION - Jho enjoys a private moment with Riza 
           and Joey, as they gaze out at the exuberant revelers.

           which includes a full bar and disco ball-adorned dance floor. 
           Fat Eric, Riza, Joey, and Leissner are joined by several 
           MOVIE STARS, including DiCaprio (we don’t see his face), POP 
           STARS, and SUPERMODELS. They’re all drinking and bobbing

           CHAVANOS RATTAKUL (a young hanger-on) snaps a photo of the 
           scene on his phone. He steps away from the baccarat table.

           The place is in full party mode, as WOMEN dance on the bar. 

           Some members of our crew are struggling to keep up now, as 
           others find sustenance in BUCKETS of KFC. 

           A half-dozen hostesses enter the VIP area wielding bottles of 
           CHAMPAGNE with sparklers attached. Jho takes a bottle from a 
           HOSTESS and hands it to Joey, who’s completely tapped out.

                        Bro. I can’t. 

           The hostess puts her hands on her hips. Pouts flirtatiously.

                        These bottles are 20-grand apiece, 
                        buddy. Someone’s gotta drink ‘em. 

           Jho takes the bottle from Joey and sets to work on the cork.

                        If no one wants to drink--

           CLOSE ON the RIVER of champagne running along the club’s

           bottled up and discarded in an instant.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Najib and Rosmah share a couch. He’s sipping tea. She’s 
           reading a PRINT-OUT filled with new polling numbers. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Latest polls are in. Not good. 

                                 NAJIB
                        It’s still two months before the 
                        election, and this announcement is 
                        going to give me a big boost. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Can I advise you something? 

           Sure can. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        You are too casual about this. You 
                        must be vigilant. Ruthless even. 

           An AIDE knocks and enters the suite. 

                                 AIDE
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        They’re ready for you. 

           Najib rises. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Watch the reaction to this. Maybe 
                        then you’ll learn to trust me. 

           Rosmah huffs, far from convinced. 

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Najib stands in front of TV CAMERAS, flanked by a placard 
           reading, “Official Signing Ceremony between United Arab 
           Emirates and Malaysia.”

           SUPER: “March 12, 2013.”
                                 NAJIB
                        This $6 billion public 
                        infrastructure deal is a historic 
                        achievement to secure economic 
                        prosperity for our two nations. I’d 
                        like to thank the Malaysian people 
                        for your trust in UMNO to continue 
                        to move our country forward.

           Najib smiles, as KAQ approaches him in his traditional Arab 
           whites. The two men shake hands and pose for photos. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           THOUSANDS of young Malaysians are gathered in front of a 
           CONCERT STAGE. There’s palpable energy in the air. 

           SUPER: “Penang, Malaysia.”

           OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE STAGE - Clare takes in the proceedings 
           with a reporter’s notebook in hand. She’s still digging. 

           ON STAGE - Najib looks out at the massive crowd and smiles. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Are you ready for Psy?

                                 CROWD
                        Yeaaaaaaah!

                                 NAJIB
                        Are you ready for Psy?

                                 CROWD
                        Yeaaaaaaaah!

           Najib vacates the stage, and Korean pop star PSY takes his 
           place. The crowd goes crazy as Psy starts performing his 
           smash hit, “Gangnam Style” with BACKUP DANCERS in tow. 

           EXT. BACKSTAGE - MINUTES LATER

           The crowd cheers, as PSY’S MANAGER watches from behind a 
           curtain. Fat Eric approaches him with a BRIEFCASE in hand. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Jho apologizes for not being able 
                        to attend. But he thanks you for 
                        arranging Psy’s performance and for 
                        his support for UMNO. 
                                 PSY’S MANAGER
                        Um-what? 

           Psy’s manager takes the briefcase from Fat Eric. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           As concertgoers stream out, Clare sits on the grass, typing 
           up a new blog post on her laptop. 

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - Her headline reads, “Najib Serves 
           As Opening Act For Psy, But Who Paid The Bill?” 

           A hulking UMNO SECURITY GUARD eyes Clare intently.  

           EXT. UMNO CAMPAIGN FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           An unremarkable storefront on a suburban street is plastered 
           with Malaysian flags and pro-Najib CAMPAIGN POSTERS. 

           An IMAM (60s, long gray beard, street clothes) rides his bike 
           up to the storefront. He parks the bike and enters.

           EXT. UMNO CAMPAIGN FIELD OFFICE - LATER

           The imam exits the building. He’s now carrying a suitcase 
           just like the one that Fat Eric gave to Psy’s manager. 

           INT. MOSQUE - DAY

           Dressed in a robe and Taqiyah skullcap, the newly greased 
           imam preaches to his CONGREGATION. 

                                 IMAM 
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        It is very important that the 
                        faithful support our Prime 
                        Minister, whose teachings are 
                        compatible with the Prophet’s. 

           EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

           The imam hands out a cash-stuffed ENVELOPE to each 
           congregant, as they leave the mosque.
           EXT. POLLING STATION - DAY

           VOTERS line up outside the polling station, which is being 
           monitored by MALAYSIAN POLICE OFFICERS. 

           A YOUNG WOMAN approaches the line but then thinks better of 
           it, as the officers watch her intently. She walks off. 

           INT. BACK ROOM (POLLING STATION) - DAY

           An ELECTION OFFICIAL takes a BALLOT BOX and throws it into a 
           trash bag. He ties up the trash bag and heads out the back 
           door, as if this is all routine. 

           INT. CLARE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           ON THE TV SCREEN - A staid BBC NEWS ANCHOR speaks to camera. 

                                 BBC NEWS ANCHOR
                        In Malaysia tonight, Prime Minister 
                        Najib Razak's governing coalition 
                        won 133 of the 222 seats in 
                        Parliament. Despite its victory, 
                        this was the ruling party’s worst 
                        election performance ever, as 
                        opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim 
                        accused Najib of widespread fraud. 

           Watching the report with Andrew, Clare barely reacts. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Terrible.

                                 CLARE
                        But not unexpected.

                                 ANDREW
                        So what now?

                                 CLARE
                        I get back to work. 

           Andrew changes the channel to a SOCCER GAME in progress.

           INT. SOCCER STADIUM - NIGHT

           Tony Pua is among a group of Malaysian MPs on the side of the 
           stage, as Opposition Leader ANWAR IBRAHIM (a slight, 
           bespectacled, but fiery man in his 60s) addresses a massive 
           crowd of his own supporters in a post-election rally.  
                                 ANWAR IBRAHIM
                        Najib and his henchmen believe they 
                        are untouchable. But while they 
                        have their dirty tricks, we have 
                        the support of the people! 

           The crowd cheers. Tony applauds, too. But a deep sense of 
           trepidation is written all over his face. 

           EXT. KUALA LUMPUR STREET - DAY

           REAL FOOTAGE of thousands of Malaysian PROTESTERS in matching 
           YELLOW T-SHIRTS marching and chanting anti-Najib slogans. 

           One of the protesters wields a large, cardboard CARICATURE of 
           a jewelry-wearing Rosmah--her eyes replaced with giant dollar 
           signs. Another hoists a homemade puppet rendering of Najib 
           trapped inside a jail cell. 

           As the protesters make their way toward a grassy area, a line 
           of heavily armed RIOT POLICE block their path. The marchers 
           stop in their tracks, but some of the police officers use 
           WATER CANNONS and TEAR GAS to beat them back. 

           From an adjacent street, a POLICE VEHICLE comes screeching in 
           and drives directly into the protesters, who try to DIVE out 
           of the way. Two of them are HIT and almost crushed by the 
           vehicle. They lie on the pavement, badly injured. 

           Several of the protestors then turn on the police vehicle, 
           beating their fists against it. They drag out the DRIVER and 
           begin to turn the police car upside down. 

           More officers rush in, flailing their BILLY CLUBS wildly. 

           INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HALL - DAY

           WEALTHY ART COLLECTORS and their AGENTS sit shoulder to 
           shoulder. A work of modern art is projected onto a BIG 
           SCREEN: It’s the neo-expressionist masterpiece, “Dustheads,” 
           by seminal Brooklyn graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

           ON STAGE - An AUCTIONEER (wearing a stuffy three-piece suit) 
           stands at a podium emblazoned with the Christie’s logo. 

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        We move to the Basquiat, showing 
                        above the screen. The 1982 work. 
           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jho is surrounded by a mini-entourage that includes Riza, 
           Joey, and Fat Eric. They watch the proceedings in the 
           adjacent auction hall from a live video feed. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I don’t think I’ll have to spend 
                        more than 22. Maybe 23. 

           INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The auctioneer looks out on the crowd. 

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        And we’ll open this at 20. 

           A HAND immediately shoots up near the front row.

           Jho taps his fingers as he speaks into a landline phone.

           Joey rubs Jho’s head.

                        Come on!

           INT. CHRISTIE'S AUCTION HOUSE - LATER

           JHO’S ART AGENT (a proper dandy) stands in a special cordoned-
           off area underneath the screen next to a RIVAL AGENT. Both of 
           them have their hands over their landline phone receivers.

                                 JHO’S ART AGENT 

                                 AUCTIONEER

                        Didn’t work this time. 34 million. 

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jho is still on the phone, agonizing now. He puts his hand 
           over the receiver. The air has gone out of the room. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        It’s at 42.5. Crazy.

                        There’s other Basquiats, bro.

                        Gotta know when to fold ‘em.

           Joey and Riza exchange a worried look. Has Jho lost his mind?

           This has the feel of a knock-down prize fight now.

                        43 would be next. We’re at 42.

                        That’s the third jump bid. Will it 
                        work this time? 

           The rival agent smirks. It’s gotten totally out of hand.

                                 AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
                        It’s worked. I think. 43 million,

           Jho jumps up and down in triumph, as his buddies engulf him 
           in a sweaty, triumphant embrace. They try, but fail, to lift 
           him off the ground. Jho’s superhero status has its limits.

           A CHRISTIE’S EMPLOYEE enters the room and spots Jho.

           A barbed wire fence surrounds a drab, concrete compound that

                        which I definitely don’t recommend.

           INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

           REAL FOOTAGE of Leonardo DiCaprio at a “Wolf Of Wall Street” 
           junket. He’s seated among several ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALISTS. 

                                 LEONARDO DICAPRIO 
                        This film is an indictment of all 
                        of Wall Street. But it’s an 
                        indictment about something that’s 
                        in our culture, this incessant need
                        to consume and this incessant need 
                        to obtain more and more wealth with 
                        complete disregard for anyone 
                        except yourself.

           The entertainment journalists nod dutifully.

           INT. SWISS CHALET - NIGHT

           A cozy, rustic retreat well-suited for Christmas with the 
           family. HOLIDAY MUSIC plays on the stereo, as Andrew, Alex 
           (18 now), and Patrick (16) wrap presents.

           CLARE’S BROTHER (50s, Christmas sweater) throws a log on the 
           fire, as a festive snowfall blankets the surrounding Alpine 
           landscape outside the framed windows.

           IN THE KITCHEN AREA - Clare is on her cell phone.

                                 CLARE 
                        The wolf of what?

           EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - DAY

           On his phone, Tony walks along a busy street. 

                                 TONY PUA
                        Wall Street. It comes out on 
                        Christmas Day. Rosmah is telling 
                        school officials to make sure every 
                        child in Malaysia sees it.

           INTERCUT TONY AND CLARE

                                 CLARE
                        Odd. What’s it about?
                                 TONY PUA
                        Greed. Excess. It’s a strong R-
                        rating. Lots of drugs. Nudity. 
                        There’s supposedly an orgy scene. 

                                 CLARE
                        Oh, my. 

                                 TONY PUA
                        Rosmah’s saying it’s a warning 
                        about the pitfalls of decadence. 

                                 CLARE
                        She wants to show schoolchildren an 
                        orgy, so they know to avoid orgies? 

                                 TONY PUA
                             (laughs)
                        Rosmah is apparently very anti-
                        orgy. The question is why? 

                                 CLARE
                        You think Jho Low has something to 
                        do with this?  

                                 TONY PUA
                        That’s for you to find out. 

           MUSIC CUE: “Holly Jolly Christmas.” 

           MONTAGE

           As her family enjoys the holiday, wrapping presents, 
           decorating the tree, and playing board games, Clare works 
           obsessively on researching “The Wolf of Wall Street” and 
           Jho’s ties to the film, via Riza and Joey. 

           She scours social media and comes across the photo that we 
           saw being taken in the Sydney casino of Jho gambling with the 
           caption, “A good way to waste a million dollars.” Riza is 
           visible in the background. 

           Andrew tries to convince her to take a break and enjoy some 
           dessert. She relents for a moment but keeps working away on 
           her cell phone, which she’s hidden under the table. 

           She finally puts the phone away on Christmas morning to enjoy 
           some family time. But then it’s right back to work again. 

           END OF MONTAGE
           INT. BEDROOM (SWISS CHALET) - NIGHT

           Clare is on her laptop in bed next to Andrew. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Come on. It’s after midnight. 

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - She’s about to publish a new blog 
           post headlined, “Wall Street Greed/Malaysian Money.” 

           Among the images embedded in the post: the “Wolf of Wall 
           Street” promotional movie poster; a photo of Riza and Joey 
           inside the Red Granite Pictures headquarters in Los Angeles; 
           and a wildly drunken Jho partying in Las Vegas. 

           Clare hits “publish” and closes her laptop. Then she just 
           lies there, staring at the ceiling. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight. 

                                 CLARE
                        Sorry, what?

           He grunts and buries his head in the pillow. 

           EXT. SWISS CHALET - DAY

           Clare’s family is engaged in a heated SNOWBALL FIGHT. But 
           she’s not participating, staring at her phone instead. Andrew 
           takes the opportunity to get his unsuspecting wife in his 
           sites, as he packs a HUGE SNOWBALL. 

                                 CLARE
                             (still reading her phone)
                        Oh, my. 

           Andrew throws the snowball at Clare. It looks like it’s going 
           to hit her smack in the forehead, but at the very last 
           moment, she tilts her head just enough. The snowball misses.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Andrew, come look at this. 

           ON CLARE’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - The analytics on her most 
           recent blog post. It’s gotten 128,568 page views. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Wow. 

           Clare hits refresh. The page view count goes up to 135,121.
                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        Consider me impressed. What’s next?

                                 CLARE
                        I heard from a source that Riza’s 
                        building a brand new mansion in 
                        L.A. Bought by a shell company, of 
                        course. I’d bet anything he paid 
                        for it with 1MDB cash.

                                 ANDREW
                        But if there’s no owner listed, how 
                        can you prove the house is his? 

                                 CLARE
                        I thought maybe I’d pay him a 
                        little unannounced visit. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           With the southern California sunshine shimmering against the 
           Pacific Ocean, a British Airways flight descends toward LAX. 

           INT. WAITING AREA (RED GRANITE PICTURES) - DAY

           The floor-to-ceiling windows provide panoramic views of West 
           Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Copies of HOLLYWOOD TRADE 
           MAGAZINES are scattered across the coffee table.

           Clare enters and glances at the original “Metropolis” movie 
           poster hanging on the wall next a “Wolf of Wall Street” 
           poster celebrating its status as “The #1 movie in America.” 

           She approaches the RECEPTIONIST (a stylish Asian woman). 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        How can I help you?

                                 CLARE
                        Hi, I’m here for Riza. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                 CLARE
                        No, I actually have a delivery. 
                        Some materials for his new home, 
                        but I have conflicting addresses. 
                        Could you help me sort this out? 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t just--
                                 CLARE
                        It’s the English accent, is it? 
                        Hard to trust. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        No, it’s not that, I--

           Clare leans in closer. 

                                 CLARE
                        The materials I’m delivering are of 
                        an ... intimate nature. And I don’t 
                        want to embarrass Mr. Aziz. You can 
                        understand that, I’m sure.

           The receptionist gives her a long, hard look. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        912 North Hillcrest. 

                                 CLARE
                        Thanks so much. 

           Clare turns and leaves quickly.

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

           Clare and a freelance VIDEO CAMERAMAN exit her rental car on 
           the side of a hilly road that’s lined with HIGH HEDGES 
           designed to conceal expensive property from prying eyes. 

           They approach an electronic FENCE at the top of the hill. 
           Clare pushes the handle on the gate. It creaks open. 

                                 CLARE
                        Come on. Let’s have a look. 

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        We could get arrested.

                                 CLARE
                        I’m a foreigner. I’ll just tell 
                        them I was confused. 

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Where does that leave me? 

           She enters the property. He follows her reluctantly.
           EXT. RIZA’S BEVERLY HILLS COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Clare and her cameraman stroll the opulent grounds. There’s a 
           TENNIS COURT, INFINITY POOL, and massive OUTDOOR PATIO. The 
           MANSION and two GUEST HOUSES are still under construction.

           Clare tests the sliding door leading into one of the guest 
           houses, but it’s locked. She snaps a few photos of the 
           mansion on her iPhone, while the cameraman shoots video.

           She eyes a LADDER that’s leaning against a palm tree. 

                                 CLARE
                        Hold the base for me, would you?

           The cameraman grips the ladder, as Clare begins to scale it. 
           She makes it to the top and starts snapping more photos.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
                        Hey! 

           Clare looks down at a beefy SECURITY GUARD, who’s about fifty 
           yards away. This guy doesn’t look pleased. 

                                 CLARE
                        Riza sent me. He didn’t tell you?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        No, he didn’t tell me. 

                                 CLARE
                        You do work for Riza Aziz, yes?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I do. And who the hell are you? 

           Clare descends the ladder.

                                 CLARE
                        Oh, just a mum from London. 

           She turns to her cameraman. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Time to go.

           Before the guard can react, Clare DASHES back toward the 
           front gate. The cameraman follows behind her.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        You’re a crazy woman.

                                 CLARE
                        So I’ve been told.
           EXT. HERMES BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

           Four MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT SECURITY GUARDS flank two SUVs 
           parked outside the ultra high-end luxury store.

           INT. HERMES BEVERLY HILLS - CONTINUOUS

           Rosmah browses the store with Riza. 

                                 RIZA
                        It’s Scorsese’s highest-grossing 
                        movie ever. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Oh? That’s good?

                                 RIZA
                        Yeah, mom. That’s good. We’ve taken 
                        in almost $400 million worldwide.

                                 ROSMAH
                        You should try for a billion. 

           He just shakes his head, as she points out a bright-yellow 
           HANDBAG on display. It’s next-level tacky. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        I think yellow is a very good color 
                        for me. Do you agree?

           Riza’s face is now buried in his phone. He looks worried. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        Riza. The yellow one, yes? 

                                 RIZA
                        Yeah, yeah. It looks great. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        Always on that silly phone. 

           ON RIZA’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - Clare’s latest blog post is 
           headlined, “WOW! Riza Aziz’s Secret Beverly Hills Mansion.”

           Riza scrolls through the post, which contains photos and 
           video of his property. Rosmah reads over his shoulder. 

                                 ROSMAH (CONT’D)
                        Bitch. This woman could make 
                        everything come crashing down. 
                                 RIZA
                        It’s just a little blog, mom. If we 
                        ignore her, she’ll go away.

                                 ROSMAH
                        My husband ignores problems. Now 
                        you see how his problems have 
                        grown. Ignoring is not how you make 
                        problems go away. You make problems 
                        go away by taking care of them. 

                                 RIZA
                        So what do you suggest? 

           She shoots her son a steely-eyed glare. 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Looking frazzled, Clare hands Andrew a letter. 

                                 CLARE
                        Cease and desist letter from the 
                        law firm representing Riza’s movie 
                        company. They’re demanding I 
                        retract my blog post.

                                 ANDREW
                        Or else ... what? 

                                 CLARE
                        They’ll sue us for everything we’re 
                        worth. 

                                 ANDREW
                        They’ll be disappointed when they 
                        find out how little we’re worth. 

           Andrew glances at the window. A FLASH of movement on the 
           street below catches his eye. 

                                 CLARE
                        What?

                                 ANDREW
                        Nothing. Thought I saw something. 

           Clare’s young researcher AMY (22, slight in stature and 
           utterly fearless) enters, carrying an open laptop. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Who are you? 
                                 CLARE
                        This is Amy. My new researcher. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Not in it for the money, I take it?

                                 AMY
                        No, I’m in it for the scalps.  
                             (to Clare)
                        Look at this. 

           ON AMY’S LAPTOP SCREEN - A web site that looks nearly 
           identical to SarawakReport, except it’s called SarawakReports 
           (with an “s”). It’s filled with unflattering photos of Clare 
           and attempts to discredit her. 

                                 ANDREW
                             (furious)
                        My God. They’re not even finished 
                        threatening you with financial ruin 
                        and they’ve already moved on to 
                        slandering you? We have to do 
                        something about this. 

           Clare notices just how riled up her typically staid husband 
           has become. It unsettles her. 

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe I should take my foot off the 
                        gas pedal, just for a bit. 

                                 ANDREW
                        No. It’s quite clear that you’ve 
                        really hit a nerve. The only thing 
                        to do now is to keep going. 

           A smile crosses Clare’s face. 

                                 CLARE
                        I wasn’t expecting you to say that. 

                                 AMY
                        I found some interesting leads on 
                        Rosmah’s recent jewelry purchases. 
                        Shall we get back to work?

                                 CLARE
                        Yes. We shall.

           INT. LONDON COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Clare and Amy are seated at a small table by the window, 
           typing away on their laptops. 
           Amy glances across the shop at a BLONDE WOMAN in a long 
           overcoat, who’s pretending to read a newspaper but seems to 
           be watching Clare. 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW - Across the street, a BURLY MAN (shaved 
           head, looks like a Russian hitman) is standing on the corner, 
           pointing a camera with a telescopic lens directly at Clare. 

           Noticing him, Clare slams her laptop shut.

                                 AMY
                        What are you doing?

           Clare storms out of the coffee shop. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Clare marches across the street and approaches the burly man. 

                                 CLARE
                        Hey! You!

           The man takes a couple of steps backward. But Clare gets 
           right up in his face, as PEDESTRIANS stop to watch. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I saw what you’re doing. Stop it 
                        right now. It’s bloody rude.

           The man looks unsure of what to say or do. Finally, he tucks 
           his camera under his arm and breaks into a SPRINT--trying to 
           get away from her as quickly as he can. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Coward!

           She folds her arms across her chest and watches the man fade 
           into the anonymity of central London, as Amy rushes out of 
           the coffee shop and joins her side.

                                 AMY
                        Maybe now they’ll get the message 
                        that you can’t be intimidated. 

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe.

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

           The old FBI agent offers Clare a cup of tea. 
                                 CLARE
                        It was full-on cyber warfare 
                        buttressed by physical 
                        intimidation. I later found out 
                        that Najib paid off some political 
                        mudslingers in America to write 
                        columns disparaging me. 

                                 YOUNG FBI AGENT
                        Josh Treviño and Ben Domenech. 
                        Yeah, we know about that. 

                                 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY
                        Our understanding is that it was a 
                        fairly standard PR operation.

                                 CLARE
                        Bribing journalists?! 

                                 OLD FBI AGENT 
                        Again, we find these tactics 
                        distasteful. But we have to deal in 
                        what’s legal and illegal here. 

           She takes a sip of tea. Collects herself. 

                                 CLARE
                        Thank God Mahathir wasn’t as 
                        frightened of Najib as you all are.

           They shoot daggers at her. She turns away, disgusted. 

           INT. NAJIB’S OFFICE - DAY

           Over tea, Najib sits with former Malaysian Prime Minister 
           MAHATHIR MOHAMAD (early 90s, but still healthy looking). The 
           mood is tense between them. 

                                 MAHATHIR MOHAMAD 
                        A leader is nothing without the 
                        trust of his people.

                                 NAJIB
                        And I have that. 

                                 MAHATHIR MOHAMAD
                        You had it. Now, it’s gone. Because 
                        of your selfish move to consolidate 
                        power using tainted funds.

                                 NAJIB
                        Oh, please. You know that in 
                        politics, cash is king. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NAJIB (CONT'D)
                        But everything I do is for my party-
                        -our party, Mahathir. And by 
                        extension, our country.

                                 MAHATHIR MOHAMAD
                        You and your wife have become  
                        symbols of just how out of touch 
                        the ruling elite has become.

                                 NAJIB
                        You have no right to bring Rosmah 
                        into this. 

                                 MAHATHIR MOHAMAD
                        I am only trying to speak honestly 
                        with you, in the hope that you will 
                        change. Because if you don’t, you 
                        will face consequences. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Mahathir, you were my mentor. I 
                        honor that. But I am your Prime 
                        Minister. Remember your place. 

           Mahathir appears utterly unmoved by Najib’s entreaty, as he 
           considers his next move.

           INT. LONDON THINK TANK - NIGHT

           Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim addresses a group of pro-
           democracy REFORMERS and Malaysian EXPATS. Clare sits in the 
           audience, taking notes. 

                                 ANWAR IBRAHIM
                        Sodomy. That’s what the regime has 
                        charged me with in its effort to 
                        silence me. I do give them points 
                        for creativity. But it shows how 
                        desperate Najib is. I humbly ask 
                        you, our vibrant Malaysian expat 
                        community in London, to help me 
                        mount my legal defense. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As Anwar shakes hands with well-wishers, Clare approaches an 
           AIDE TO ANWAR (an earnest, young Malaysian man in a suit).  

                                 CLARE
                        Hiya. Sorry to bother.
                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        It’s no bother. I am an admirer of 
                        your reporting. We all are. 

                                 CLARE
                        Well, thank you. But I’m still 
                        looking for the back-breaker. 

                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        Well, I very much hope you find it.

                                 CLARE
                        What are you hearing back home? Any 
                        leads for me to sink my teeth into?

                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        Not really. 

                                 CLARE
                        “Not really”? That sounds more like 
                        “yes, maybe.”

           The young aide looks around to make sure no one’s listening.

                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        I hesitate to tell you this. But we 
                        were recently approached by a man 
                        who claims to have proof of the 
                        criminal 1MDB conspiracy in the 
                        form of emails exchanged among the 
                        chief perpetrators themselves. 

                                 CLARE
                        What? That’s massive. Why on earth 
                        would you hesitate to tell me that? 

                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        Because I don’t trust this man. He 
                        wants money. 

                                 CLARE
                        OK. But sometimes in reporting, you 
                        don’t need trust straight away. You 
                        just need to start a conversation.

                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        He sent me a strange document. I 
                        took a photo. Give me your mobile 
                        number, and I’ll send it to you.

                                 CLARE
                        That would be lovely. Thank you. 
                                 AIDE TO ANWAR
                        But I’m telling you. He’s in 
                        Thailand, and the Thai government 
                        is very close to Najib. This has 
                        all the markings of a ruse. 

                                 CLARE
                        I’m actually quite good at sniffing 
                        those out. 

           Clare catches the eye of an UNKNOWN MALAYSIAN WOMAN--the only 
           female member of Anwar’s entourage. The woman looks like she 
           wants to tell Clare something. But instead, she turns away at 
           the last moment--not yet confident enough to make the 
           approach. 

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Clare drags a roller bag through the busy terminal. She 
           approaches a gate with a flight departing for BANGKOK. 

           INT. BANGKOK HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Seated on a couch, Clare catches up on the latest news on her 
           laptop, as a stoic and intimidating HOTEL SECURITY GUARD 
           stares at her. Clare catches his gaze. He keeps staring.  

           A tall, tanned, and fit man approaches Clare. This is Xavier 
           Justo, the former head of PetroSaudi’s London office, whom we 
           met briefly earlier on. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Hi, are you Clare?

           Clare takes in Xavier’s unexpectedly striking appearance. 

                                 CLARE
                        Yes. And you? 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I’m the man who wants to help you 
                        put a lot of people in prison. 

           She nods slowly, careful not to react. 

                                 CLARE
                        Shall we talk somewhere quiet then? 
           INT. PRIVATE HOTEL MEETING ROOM - DAY

           The kind of lifeless, bare-walled space that’s usually 
           reserved for boring meetings. This isn’t one of those. 

           Xavier places his laptop on a desk and pulls up a chair for 
           Clare and then another one for himself.

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I want you to know: For me, this is 
                        about money. Nothing more. I’m 
                        asking for $2 million. 

           Clare can’t help herself from letting out a laugh. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT’D)
                        This is what I’m owed by PetroSaudi 
                        where I worked for many years. 

                                 CLARE
                        PetroSaudi? The oil company? 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Actually, they’re mostly in the Jho 
                        Low business. They made me cover my 
                        own expenses when I opened the 
                        London branch. And then, they 
                        refused to repay me when I left. 
                        I’m not asking for any more than 
                        what they owe me. 

           Clare folds her hands, trying to take this guy seriously. 

                                 CLARE
                        Look. I don’t have that kind of 
                        money. And even if I did, I 
                        wouldn’t pay you. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Then I’m not sure what you and I 
                        are doing here. 

                                 CLARE
                        Let me see what you have. And then 
                        maybe, I can turn to some allies of 
                        mine and ask whether they might be 
                        able to pay you. I have to say 
                        though, I’m not optimistic. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        It’s very dangerous for me to even 
                        be speaking to you about this. 
                                 CLARE
                        You think I’m not putting my own 
                        safety on the line by meeting with 
                        you? I’m currently the target of a 
                        well-financed smear campaign by the 
                        Malaysian government. I have men 
                        photographing me on the street. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I appreciate that you, too, are 
                        invested in this. But there are 
                        people who would quite literally 
                        have me killed, if they knew they 
                        could get away with it. 

                                 CLARE
                        I can promise you that I will not 
                        publish anything you show me 
                        without your permission, and I 
                        won’t betray you as a source.

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I’m familiar with your work. You’re 
                        a diligent reporter. I trust you. 

           He spins his laptop screen toward Clare. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT’D)
                        Ten minutes. No notes. 

           MONTAGE

           Clare reviews the scanned documents on Xavier’s laptop 
           screen, as he maintains control of its touchpad.

           He spins through a bewildering series of documents and 
           emails, opening and closing them at high speed.

           She ends up taking a couple of notes. He doesn’t protest. 

           END MONTAGE

           He closes his laptop. Clare exhales. She’s gobsmacked. 

                                 CLARE
                        How many emails are there? 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        About 330,000 covering 2009 to 
                        2011. They were like amateur 
                        criminals at the time. Sloppy. 
                        Wrote everything down. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT'D)
                        Once they got in deeper, they 
                        realized how compromising it all 
                        was, so they physically removed the 
                        company’s servers from London and 
                        Geneva. But I’d already downloaded 
                        everything. 

                                 CLARE
                        Do the PetroSaudi guys know you 
                        have this?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Yes. For months, I tried to 
                        negotiate with Patrick Mahony. That 
                        ended when he sent me one 
                        particular email. I don’t respond 
                        well to threats.

                                 CLARE
                        What did it say?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        “What troubles me so much is the 
                        way I see this situation ending--
                        with the destruction of you.”

                                 CLARE
                        He sounds lovely. 

           ON CLARE’S NOTEBOOK - She underlines the phrase, “$700 
           million vanished” three times.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Did I see a payment of $700 million 
                        to some outside entity? 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        That was the first bribe paid to 
                        Good Star, Jho Low’s shell company.  

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe it was a commission for 
                        handling the deal?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Commissions are normal. Five 
                        percent. Maybe even 15. $700 
                        million is not a commission. That 
                        is criminal. 

                                 CLARE
                        But it’s insane. I mean, you can’t 
                        just take $700 million in broad 
                        daylight and get away with it.
                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Actually, that’s up to you now.  

           He’s right. And the notion invigorates her. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT’D)
                        Jho is under pressure now, but 
                        someone needs to turn the screws. 
                        You see that what I have is real. 
                        Go and tell your friends that they 
                        can have the weapon they need to 
                        make things right in Malaysia and 
                        take back the election they should 
                        have fairly won the last time.

                                 CLARE
                        I’ll try. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Clare enters from the bathroom. She’s on her cell phone. 

                                 CLARE
                        He wants $2 million. 

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        I can start clipping coupons. 

           ON CLARE’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - She looks at her checking 
           account balance. It’s at -£43.21. 

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t think that would quite 
                        cover it.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I’m exhausted. 

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        You’ll find a way. You always do. 

                                 CLARE
                        Good night.

           She ends the call and collapses onto the bed. 

           There’s a knock on the door, causing Clare to jolt. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                             (scared)
                        Who is it?

           She gets out of bed and creeps up to the door nervously. 
                                 BELLBOY (O.S.)
                        Message from the front desk. 

           Clare looks through the peep hole and sees the bellboy 
           standing there. She hesitates for a moment, wondering if she 
           should trust this person. She opens the door cautiously. 

                                 BELLBOY  (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to bother you, ma’am. But 
                        we had a call to the hotel. A man 
                        asked if you were staying here. Are 
                        you expecting someone?

                                 CLARE
                        No. And who are you? 

                                 BELLBOY
                        Please don’t worry. I work for the 
                        hotel. We told him nothing. If he 
                        calls back, we’ll call the police. 

                                 CLARE
                        Thank you.

           She moves to close the door quickly. But the bellboy 
           continues to stand there. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Is there something else? 

                                 BELLBOY
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. But you are the 
                        editor of Sarawak Report, yes? 

           Clare gasps. She takes a step back. Who is this guy?

                                 CLARE
                        Why do you ask? 

                                 BELLBOY
                        I am Malaysian. And I just want to 
                        say ... Thank you for what you are 
                        doing for our country. 

           He bows and then leaves Clare standing there alone.

           EXT. KOREATOWN - NIGHT

           Under the shadow of the Empire State Building, the Manhattan 
           neighborhood buzzes with a post-bar, late-night crowd. 
           INT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A down-home, 24-hour Korean BBQ joint, complete with tables 
           featuring their own charcoal grills to cook your own food. 

           Flanked by a pair of PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, Jho is seated 
           with Joey, Fat Eric, and a couple other YOUNG GUYS.

           Jho is on one of his phones, looking frazzled, as his two 
           OTHER CELL PHONES lie on the table next to his uneaten meal.

                                 JHO LOW 
                             (into the first phone)
                        No, the Viceroy Hotel payments are 
                        due on the 11th. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Isn’t Park Lane due on the 12th?

                                 JHO LOW
                        Shut the fuck up, Eric. 

           One of the other two cell phones buzzes. 

                                 JHO LOW (CONT’D)
                        Hold on. 

           He picks up the second phone and speaks into it.

                                 JHO LOW (CONT’D)
                        Hi, let me call you back. No, I 
                        don’t want to cancel it. 

           The third cell phone rings. Jho starts banging his head on 
           the table, overwhelmed by the demands of his enterprise.  

           Australian supermodel MIRANDA KERR (30, tall, sky-blue eyes, 
           wavy brown hair and dimples) enters wearing a formal gown. 
           She spots a friend in Jho’s group and heads for their table. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Hi! 

           She flashes her supermodel smile, kisses her friend on the 
           cheek, and gives a little wave to everyone else at the table. 

           Jho raises his head slowly and does a double-take. He’s 
           absolutely gobsmacked by her beauty. 

                                 MIRANDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m Miranda. 

           Jho manages to collect himself enough to pull the jacket off 
           of the seat next to him, offering it to her. 
                                 MIRANDA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank you. Sorry I’m dressed 
                        like this. I just left a gala.

           She sits. Jho offers her his hand. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I’m Jho. With an H. H to the izzo. 
                        [beat] That’s how you spell it.

           He lets out an uncharacteristically awkward belly laugh.

                                 MIRANDA
                        Yes, I’ve heard so much about you. 

           She offers him a smile and a pat on his knee. Our hardened 
           criminal mastermind is putty in her hands. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - NIGHT

           Jho sits in the back of the town car heading down Broadway. 
           He starts composing a text message.

           ON JHO’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - “Please order a heart-shaped 
           diamond necklace for Valentine’s Day. Inscription: ‘MK.’ $1-
           $2 million is fine. Size matters.”

           Jho sends the text. Seconds later, he remembers something. 

           He composes another text: “And that 22 carat diamond necklace 
           we talked about for our other friend, Black Heart.” 

           Jho puts his phone down. It buzzes immediately.

           “Are you SURE? Liquidity has become VERY tight You don’t need 
           the added scrutiny.” Jho composes his response: “Yes. Do it.” 

           Jho pockets his phone and gazes out the window. 

           INT. JHO’S NYC PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Flickering candles set the romantic mood. Jho takes in his 
           epic view with Miranda by his side. He holds her hand. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Happy Valentine’s Day, baby.

           One of his cell phones buzzes in his pocket. He silences it 
           with his free hand and takes out a jewelry box instead. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Oh my God. You’re crazy. 
           His expression sinks for a moment.  

                                 MIRANDA (CONT’D)
                        Good crazy, I mean. 

           She opens the jewelry box and gasps on cue when she sees 
           what’s inside: a heart-shaped diamond necklace. 

                                 MIRANDA (CONT’D)
                        Jho. This is ... this is just ...

                                 JHO LOW
                        Just 11 carats. But there will be 
                        something bigger on our trip. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        You sure you still want to go? I 
                        know you’re stressed about work.

                                 JHO LOW
                        I can work from anywhere. That’s 
                        the best thing about being a 
                        billionaire. Well, that and the 
                        yacht. 

           She kisses him, as he helps her put on the necklace. 

           EXT. OFF THE NEAPOLITAN COAST - DAY

           Jho’s brand new MEGAYACHT, even grander than the Alfa Nero, 
           floats along the craggy Neapolitan coast. 

           Music Cue: Tame Impala’s “The Less I Know The Better.”

           MONTAGE

           IN THE DINING ROOM - Jho greets Miranda for dinner on seven 
           consecutive nights. Just after they sit down each time, he 
           presents her with a new piece of jewelry. Diamond earrings 
           one night, a bracelet the next, a ring after that. And so on. 

           Miranda acts surprised and appreciative, and Jho feeds off of 
           her surface-level affirmation. But by the fifth night, the 
           act starts to wear thin for them both. 

           On the sixth night, Jho is starting to sweat noticeably. By 
           the seventh night, he appears to be physically unwell. 

           Miranda tries to help him out of his chair, but he insists on 
           staying. Two of his cell phones ring simultaneously. He 
           silences them both and insists on trying to enjoy their meal. 
           Neither of them is having any fun now.
           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Bleary-eyed, Clare opens the refrigerator. She stares at her 
           options. Nothing is appealing.

           Her phone buzzes. She answers it. 

                                 CLARE
                        Tony. Give me good news. 

           INT. TONY PUA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Tony is on the phone with Clare at his desk. 

                                 TONY
                        Do you know who Tong Kooi Ong is? 

           INTERCUT TONY AND CLARE

                                 CLARE
                        Owner and publisher of The Edge in 
                        Singapore. They do good reporting, 
                        though they toe the line with Najib 
                        a little too much for my taste. 

                                 TONY
                        Tong is a friend of mine. He’s 
                        aware of the material you’ve been 
                        pursuing, and he may be interested 
                        in acquiring it. 

                                 CLARE
                        Would he really pay for the story? 

                                 TONY
                        Jho recently called him a traitor 
                        for raising questions about his 
                        role at 1MDB. Tong doesn’t take 
                        well to insults. His blood is up. 

                                 CLARE
                        $2 million worth of blood? 

                                 TONY
                        Tong’s blood is quite rich. 

                                 CLARE
                        Alright. Give me his number. 
           EXT. SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT - DAY

           A British Airways plane comes in for a landing.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Clare sits at a conference table with TONG KOOI ONG (50s, 
           disheveled in an eccentric multi-millionaire way), owner and 
           publisher of The Edge, two LAWYERS, and the Editor of the 
           Edge, HO KAY TAT (50s, more subdued than his boss).   

           A MUTED TV is tuned to a FINANCIAL NEWS CHANNEL. All eyes are 
           on Clare. 

                                 CLARE
                        It’s quite likely the biggest theft 
                        in the history of the world. And 
                        it’s also the story of the century. 

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        We are very interested in making a 
                        deal with your source. 

                                 HO KAY TAT
                        But how can we be certain his 
                        material is genuine?

                                 CLARE
                        I’m sure you have people who can 
                        authenticate it.  

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        We do. And I’ve never pretended to 
                        be above paying for a good story. 

                                 HO KAY TAT
                        But $2 million ...

                                 CLARE
                        It’d be the most anyone ever paid 
                        for a single news story. Ever. And 
                        it’s entirely worth it. 

                                 LAWYER #1
                        It’s the exposure we can’t afford. 

                                 LAWYER #2
                        Here in Singapore, the laws against 
                        libel are--

           Tong puts up a hand to silence his own lawyer. 
                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        The best defense against libel is 
                        truth. If we can show the documents 
                        are real, we have a responsibility 
                        to publish them. 

           ON THE TV - Anwar Ibrahim is in handcuffs, being escorted 
           into a police van. The accompanying BREAKING NEWS banner 
           reads, “Malaysian Opposition Leader Sentenced to 5-Year In 
           Prison for Sodomy.” PROTESTERS pour out onto the streets.

                                 CLARE
                        Oh, no. 

           The TV coverage lands on one particular MALAYSIAN WOMAN who 
           has her two SMALL CHILDREN in tow. 

           She stands on the outskirts of the protesters. Rather than 
           appearing merely angry, she looks scared. Defeated even. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                             (pointing at the TV)
                        This right here. This is the first 
                        cannon shot. Najib is going to war. 

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        This story is about Jho Low and his 
                        cronies in the business world. It’s 
                        not about Najib. 

           Clare opens her mouth to respond. But at the last moment, she 
           decides to let Tong keep talking.

                                 TONG KOOI ONG (CONT’D)
                        But these are troubled times. So 
                        let’s not quibble any longer. It is 
                        time to act. Tell your source I am 
                        ready to make his payment. 

                                 CLARE
                        Brilliant. 

           INT. TONG’S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

           Expensive ARTWORK competes for wall space with framed front-
           pages of past issues of The Edge. 

           Two IT EXPERTS analyze data from a laptop and hard drive, as 
           Clare, Tong, Ho, and Xavier Justo look on.
                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        Assuming my tech guys don’t see any 
                        problems, I’ll have the $2 million 
                        wired to you this afternoon. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Can we do it another way? I don’t 
                        have an account set up that can 
                        accept that kind of payment. 

                                 HO KAY TAT
                        It’s surprisingly easy. 

                                 CLARE
                        Just ask Jho Low.

           One of the IT experts gives Tong a thumbs up. 

                                 IT EXPERT
                        Everything looks legitimate. 

           He hands Xavier’s hard drive back to him. Xavier then 
           immediately gives the drive to Tong.

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I’m just not comfortable with 
                        having that much money wired to me 
                        at once. Let’s find another way. 

           Tong looks up at the wall and points to a striking, 
           impressionistic PAINTING of a flower garden. 

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        You want to take the Monet?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        Excuse me?

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        It’s an original. You can use it as 
                        collateral. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        What would I do, put it in my 
                        checked baggage?

                                 CLARE
                        It’s probably more of a carry-on. 

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        I see your point. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        We can figure out payment later.
           Tong looks surprised that Xavier trusts him to such a degree.

                                 TONG KOOI ONG
                        Deal.

           He shakes Xavier’s hand. 

                                 CLARE
                        Last thing: I get a copy of the 
                        data, too, right? I would like to 
                        run my own story on my blog. 

                                 TONG KOOI ONG 
                        That works for me, as long as you 
                        don’t beat us to the punch. And 
                        remember: This is a financial 
                        scandal. We must avoid politics. 

           Clare smiles her best sweet, innocent smile. 

                                 CLARE
                        I understand your concerns, and we 
                        must certainly tread cautiously.  

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Clare exits the building and hails a cab. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO (O.S.)
                        Clare. 

           She turns around and Xavier is standing there on the sidewalk 
           behind her. He hands her a thumb drive. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO (CONT’D)
                        Something a little extra.

                                 CLARE
                        Excuse me?

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I’ve been looking at the material 
                        for months. This contains the 
                        hundred most important documents 
                        that will prove everything. 

                                 CLARE
                        I can’t pay you. 

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        You deserve to break the story. You 
                        were pursuing it when no one else 
                        was. And it is about the regime.
           She pockets the thumb drive. 

                                 CLARE
                        I thought you said you were only in 
                        this for the money.

                                 XAVIER JUSTO
                        I have a plane to catch.

           With that, he turns and heads off in the other direction. 

           INT. SINGAPORE AIRPORT FOOD COURT - NIGHT

           Clare and Tony sit on the same side of a table in the middle 
           of the busy food court. They’re focused on Clare’s laptop, 
           which has Xavier’s thumb drive plugged into a USB port. 

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - A PDF document outlining the terms 
           of the original partnership between 1MDB and PetroSaudi.

                                 CLARE
                        Look at this. PetroSaudi just 
                        removed $700 million from the deal, 
                        as what they call an “advance.” 

           She clicks through a series of incriminating EMAIL EXCHANGES 
           from Patrick Mahony, Jho, and Jho’s lawyers and accountants. 

                                 TONY
                        An “advance” for what? 

                                 CLARE
                        You’re a numbers guy, Tony. Could 
                        there be some legitimate purpose?

                                 TONY
                        No. It’s clear from these emails 
                        that the entire point of the joint 
                        venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi 
                        was to siphon off that $700 
                        million, which they buried in 
                        dozens of pages of legal nonsense.

                        British Airways Flight 762 to 
                        London Heathrow is now ready to 
                        board at Gate A7.

                                 CLARE
                        Is it possible that Najib was 
                        somehow unaware of all of this? 
                                 TONY
                        This is Malaysia. Business and 
                        politics are the same. And nothing 
                        happens until the Boss Man says OK.

                                 CLARE
                        This is even more egregious than 
                        I’d suspected. These guys were 
                        nothing but common bank robbers. 

                                 TONY
                        And Najib was driving the getaway 
                        car. He’s still driving it. 

           Tony takes a bite of food.

                        Mahathir is our only hope now that 
                        Anwar has been arrested. He’s the 
                        only one in Malaysia with the clout 
                        to mount a serious challenge to 
                        Najib. But it’s a long-shot. 

                                 CLARE
                        I need to publish right away. This 
                        thing makes Watergate look like a 
                        tea party. 

                                 TONY
                        Najib will stop at nothing to 
                        destroy you.

                                 CLARE
                        If the difference between right and 
                        wrong still means something, that’s 
                        a risk I’m going to have to take. 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Clare and Amy stand at Clare’s laptop on the kitchen island, 
           as Andrew and her two boys look on. 

                                 CLARE
                        You ready for this? 

                                 AMY
                        Ready as ever. 

                                 CLARE
                        Well, if you think the scrutiny 
                        we’ve been getting so far has been 
                        tough, buckle up because
                        it’s about to ratchet up to a level

                        we can’t even fathom. The regime 
                        will look for any minor mistake--a 
                        misspelled name even--to say we’re 
                        nothing but crass rumor-mongers. 
                        And a lot of people will believe 
                        them, so we have to make sure we 
                        get absolutely everything right. 

                                 AMY
                        Well, when you put it like that, 
                        it’s a bit scary. 

                                 CLARE
                        It’s alright to be afraid. But it’s
                        not OK to let that fear hold us
                        back from exposing these crimes to
                        the world. The people of Malaysia 
                        are counting on us not to bugger 
                        this up. They’re not asking us to 
                        save them. They just want a chance 
                        to save themselves. 

                                 AMY
                        Well. Let’s get to work.

           MONTAGE

           MUSIC CUE: Chvrches’ 2015 song, “Never Ending Circles.” 

           Amy sorts through the data, which contains a dizzying array 
           of emails and documents, as Clare begins drafting her 
           blockbuster blog post. 

           We highlight bits and pieces on screen, like Jho explicitly 
           conveying his desire to “use PetroSaudi International as a 
           front,” and Mahony replying that he’d be “happy to do that.” 

           Clare plays with a few different possible headlines before 
           landing on, “HEIST OF THE CENTURY: How Jho Low Used 
           PetroSaudi As ‘A Front’ To Siphon Billions Out Of 1MDB!”

           END OF MONTAGE

           Everyone gathers around Clare. She hits “publish.” 

                                 PATRICK
                        So, what now? 

                                 CLARE
                        We let the dominos fall. And then 
                        it’s on to the next one. 
           EXT. MEGAYACHT - DAY

           Jho’s yacht approaches the postcard-perfect island of CORFU. 

           ON THE POOL DECK - Red-faced, his T-shirt soaking through 
           with sweat, Jho paces nervously.

           He’s talking on one phone, gripping his second and third 
           device in his free hand. Miranda looks out at the stunning 
           view, pretending not to be eavesdropping on his call. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Please don’t worry, ma’am. No one 
                        reads that silly little blog. I 
                        have everything under control. 

           INT. WALK-IN CLOSET (PRIME MINISTER’S RESIDENCE) - CONTINUOUS 

           Rosmah speaks to Jho from inside the most enormous, 
           ostentatious WALK-IN CLOSET you’ve ever seen. It’s bigger 
           than most people’s apartments, filled to the brim with 
           DESIGNER HANDBAGS, CLOTHES, and JEWELRY. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        You fool! How could you be so 
                        sloppy? I will not have my life 
                        destroyed by the stupidity of an 
                        incompetent juvenile like you. 

           EXT. MEGAYACHT - CONTINUOUS

           Jho holds the phone away from his ear. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        I’m losing the signal. Please send 
                        the Prime Minister my regards. 

           He ends the call. 

                                 MIRANDA
                        Is everything OK? 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Fine.

                                 MIRANDA
                        You can tell me if it’s not. Who 
                        was that on the phone?

                                 JHO LOW
                        Just Black Heart, worrying as 
                        usual. Everything’s perfect.

                        a beautiful day. 

           Jho begins to rub Miranda’s shoulders. She tenses up. 

           We PAN DOWN to reveal the name of Jho’s megayacht, painted in 
           big letters on the side of the vessel: “EQUANIMITY.” 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT 

           Clare stands in front of a PHONE BOOTH. She checks her watch. 

           Wearing a backpack, the UNKNOWN MALAYSIAN WOMAN whom we saw 
           previously in Anwar’s entourage approaches her cautiously.

                                 CLARE
                        Nice to meet you in person. 

           Clare shakes her hand. The woman unzips her backpack and 
           pulls out a manilla folder. She hands it to Clare. 

                                 UNKNOWN MALAYSIAN WOMAN
                        I actually almost met you once 
                        before. At the event with Anwar.

                                 CLARE
                        I thought you looked familiar.

                                 UNKNOWN MALAYSIAN WOMAN
                        I was reluctant to come to you 
                        then, out of fear for my own 
                        safety. I cannot stand back any 
                        longer. You have already done much 
                        in your reporting, but what I have 
                        to show you now comes from a 
                        whistleblower who works at the 
                        highest levels of government. It 
                        will change everything. 

                                 CLARE
                        I hope so. Thank you for doing 
                        this. I know it’s a risk. 

                                 UNKNOWN MALAYSIAN WOMAN
                        No. Thank you. You’re the one who 
                        has to put your name on this. 

           INT. CLARE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare and Andrew are each reading The Guardian. Well, 
           actually, Andrew is reading it. Clare is scanning. 
                                 CLARE
                        Unbelievable. Nothing. They still 
                        haven’t even include a brief 
                        summary of my reporting.

                                 ANDREW
                        So what? It’s 2015. Do people even 
                        read newspapers anymore?

                                 CLARE
                        You’re reading one right now.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m more fossil than person. But I 
                        take your point. 

                                 CLARE
                        I have a new one in the works on 
                        Najib’s finances. I think it’ll be 
                        my biggest scoop yet. But The Edge 
                        is determined to protect him from 
                        real scrutiny. I don’t know that I 
                        can work with them again.

                                 ANDREW
                        So what are you thinking? 

                                 CLARE
                        I wonder if I should team up with a 
                        bigger publication. Like the Wall 
                        Street Journal maybe. 

                                 ANDREW
                        I see the logic in working with an 
                        American paper. Global impact and 
                        all. But wouldn’t they just take 
                        all the credit? 

                                 CLARE
                        It’s a risk. But at the end of the 
                        day, I’m not in this for credit. 

                                 ANDREW
                        You’re the expert on this stuff. 
                        Whatever you think is best. 

           She stares at the ceiling, mulling it over in her head.

           INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL BUREAU - DAY

           As the newsroom buzzes with activity, Clare sits with a Wall 
           Street Journal reporter (young and supremely confident). They 
           scrutinize the DOCUMENTS that the Malaysian woman gave her. 
                                 CLARE
                        Right here. This is the big one.  

                                 WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER
                        Goldman deposited their proceeds 
                        from the $3 billion with BSI.

                                 CLARE
                        And then $1.2 billion was taken out 
                        right away.

                                 WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER
                        Moved into this shell company, 
                        Tanore Finance Corporation. Owned 
                        by Eric Tan, aka “Fat Eric.” 

                                 CLARE
                        Then $681 million was wired from 
                        Tanore to this Wells Fargo account, 
                        Just before the 2013 election. 

                                 WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER
                        This is incredible. The account is 
                        actually in Najib’s own name.

                                 CLARE
                        Guess he wasn’t especially worried 
                        about being caught back then. 

                                 WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER
                        This is going to be a massive 
                        story.

                                 CLARE
                        Happy to help. 

           He gives her a strange look, as if he’s reluctant to 
           acknowledge her role in bringing this story to him.

                        personal bank account? Where are 
                        the massive profits that the 
                        Malaysian people were promised? I 
                        am calling for an immediate 
                        official inquiry into 1MDB’s 
                        misappropriation of funds.

           LOUD JEERS from the majority of RULING PARTY MPs. Tony cups 
           his ears and waves his arms, fully embracing their scorn. 

           INT. PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE - SAME

           Najib watches Tony’s speech live on TV with an AIDE.

           On a nearby couch, a red-faced Rosmah reads the printed-out 
           copy of The Sarawak Report. Behind her, an AIDE opens a SAFE 
           and places a giant BAG inside before locking it again. 

                                 NAJIB
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Have Tony Pua’s passport revoked.

           The aide nods and leaves the room quickly.

                                 ROSMAH
                        Revoking one man’s passport is not 
                        nearly sufficient. This is a 
                        crisis, and you act as if it’s a 
                        mere nuisance. You are a weak man--

                                 NAJIB
                        That’s enough!

           Rosmah is stunned by her husband’s sudden anger. 

                                 NAJIB (CONT’D)
                        I’ve given you everything you could 
                        ever ask for, yet you continue to 
                        question me at every turn. I am the 
                        Prime Minister. And I have a plan. 
                        Now stay out of the way. 

           Shaken by her husband’s audacity, Rosmah leaves the room. 
           Najib picks up a landline phone and dials.

                                 NAJIB (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Close it down. 

           And with that, he hangs up and waits. 
           INT. 1MDB HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A half-dozen 1MDB OFFICERS frantically gather up DOCUMENTS 
           from filing cabinets. 

           SUPER: “July, 28, 2015.”

           They hand the documents over to an OFFICE MANAGER, who 
           promptly feeds them through a PAPER SHREDDER. 

           INT. THAI PRISON - DAY

           Xavier Justo is thrown into a dusty JAIL CELL where a couple 
           dozen dangerous-looking PRISONERS await him. 

           SUPER: “Bangkok, Thailand.” 

           A THAI POLICE OFFICER locks the cell door. 

           INT. THE EDGE (KUALA LUMPUR BUREAU) - DAY

           Two Malaysian POLICE OFFICERS enter the newsroom and confront 
           Ho Kay Tat at his desk. One of the officers slaps a pair of 
           handcuffs onto Ho. 

                                 HO KAY TAT
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        This is illegal!

           The officers lead him out of the newsroom. 

           EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Sirens blare, as smoke billows out of the high-rise police 
           headquarters in downtown Kuala Lumpur. OFFICE WORKERS stream 
           out of the building, as FIREFIGHTERS rush in.

           SUPER: “Royal Malaysian Police Headquarters.” 

           Dressed in a button-down shirt and khakis, Kevin Morais 
           wanders onto the scene, staring up at the blaze. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Stand back. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Where’s the fire?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Tenth floor. 
                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        That’s where we keep our files on 
                        major white-collar crime cases. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Yes, well. It looks like arson. 

           Morais’s expression sinks. 

           INT. MALAYSIAN ATTORNEY GENERAL’S OFFICE - Day

           Attorney General ABDUL GANI PATAIL sits at his computer.

           ON HIS COMPUTER SCREEN - A Reuters report is headlined, 
           “Malaysian PM reshuffles cabinet, dumps deputy after 1MDB 
           criticism.” There’s a knock on his door. 

                                 ABDUL GANI PATAIL 
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Come in.

           The door opens. A SECURITY GUARD enters. The Attorney General 
           knows exactly what this means: He’s next to go. Patail raises 
           his arms to show that he’s not going to put up a fight. 

           The security guard escorts him out. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Clare drives into a school parking lot. She’s on the phone 
           with Andrew and she looks both shaken and furious.  

                                 CLARE
                        This is it. Najib is going full-on 
                        strongman. It’s a disaster.

                                 ANDREW
                        But at least you got the story out. 
                        People know the full extent of his 
                        corruption now. 

                                 CLARE
                        I should’ve listened to you and 
                        just published on my own. The 
                        Journal didn’t even mention me in 
                        their story. Typical men, relying 
                        on a woman to do the work for them 
                        and then taking all the credit. 

           She parks her car and opens the door angrily. 
           EXT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Clare approaches the central London high school on foot. 
           She’s now scrolling through Twitter on her phone.

           ON CLARE’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - A REAL TWEET from Tony Pua 
           from July 28, 2015: “@tonypua: The purge commences. The 
           Attorney-General is replaced. Any flicker of hope that the 
           prime minister might be charged for misdeeds is 
           extinguished.”

                                 CLARE
                        No, Tony. Don’t give up on me now.

           Her phone buzzes. It’s an unknown number. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello? [beat] My email address?

           INT. MALAYSIA ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION OFFICE - DAY

           A sea of BUREAUCRATS work in rows of identical cubicles.

           Kevin Morais stands at a DOCUMENT SCANNER and places a series 
           of PRINTOUTS on the machine. We can see the name “Najib” in 
           the headline of one of the printouts. 

           As a CO-WORKER walks by, Morais quickly flips the pages over. 
           Once the coast is clear, he starts to scan the documents. 

           INT. KEVIN MORAIS’ CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Morais sits on a couch, typing on his out-of-date laptop. 

           ON HIS LAPTOP SCREEN - Morais pulls up an anonymous Gmail 
           account that he’s created for this very task. He types 
           Clare’s email address in the “to” line. In the subject line, 
           he types, “Formal charges against Najib.” 

           Morais attaches the documents he scanned at work earlier in 
           the day and types, “This is the reason why Najib removed Gani 
           Patail as AG. From your source in KL. Keep up the pressure.”

           He hits “send.” 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Clare and Amy stare at Clare’s laptop.

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - The email from Kevin Morais. 
                                 AMY
                        So the A.G. was on the brink of 
                        bringing criminal charges against 
                        Najib, who then suddenly fired him 
                        before he could act? It doesn’t get 
                        more blatantly corrupt than this. 

           Clare looks uncharacteristically hesitant. 

                                 CLARE
                        It doesn’t. So then why do I have 
                        this strange, sinking feeling in my 
                        gut about publishing this? 

                                 AMY
                        Do you trust the source? 

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t even know his name, but he 
                        was the one who turned me onto 1MDB 
                        in the first place. I’m fairly 
                        certain he works for the anti-
                        corruption commission.  

                                 AMY
                        Sounds like someone in the know. 

                                 CLARE
                        Najib is absolutely desperate now. 
                        Who knows what the regime is 
                        capable of when their backs are 
                        really up against the wall. 

           Amy considers this. 

                                 AMY
                        Well. We’re already banned in 
                        Malaysia. We don’t have to publish.

           Clare looks her right in the eyes. 

                                 CLARE
                        Yes. We do. 

           INT. MALAYSIAN HOMES - VARIOUS

           MONTAGE

           EVERYDAY MALAYSIANS--including the YOUNG WOMAN we saw being 
           intimidated from casting her ballot in the election--exchange 
           WhatsApp messages, sharing Clare’s blockbuster report, which 
           is headlined, “ARREST WARRANT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER! - The 
           Real Reason The Attorney General Was Fired - EXCLUSIVE!”

           INT. MALAYSIAN POLICE HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM - Day

           Inspector-General of Police TAN SRI KHALID ABU BAKAR (late-
           50s, muscular and intimidating in his military-style uniform) 
           stands before the cameras. 

           An unflattering, mug shot-style photo of Clare is affixed to 
           the wall behind him. 

                                 TAN SRI KHALID ABU BAKAR
                        Today, the Royal Malaysia Police 
                        obtained a warrant for the arrest 
                        of Clare Rewcastle Brown. Ms. Brown 
                        is charged with stirring sedition--
                        a crime punishable by up to 20 
                        years imprisonment. She may call 
                        herself a journalist, but Malaysia 
                        will not stand for her lies.

           INT. MALAYSIAN CABINET ROOM - DAY

           Najib meets with his new, entirely loyal CABINET MINISTERS.

                                 NAJIB
                        This is a challenging moment for 
                        our nation, but it’s no time to 
                        panic. We must face down the 
                        threats posed by political 
                        terrorists and act firmly against 
                        them to preserve our democracy. 

           The newly appointed Attorney General MOHAMED APANDI ALI 
           (carefully trimmed mustache, a Najib lackey) raises his hand. 

                                 MOHAMED APANDI ALI
                        Prime Minister, what are you going 
                        to do about these dangerous leaks 
                        to the press about our work?

                                 NAJIB
                        We are addressing this problem. 

           An expression crosses over Najib’s face that we haven’t seen 
           yet. It’s nothing less than frightening. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           A middle-class, high-rise building in a quiet neighborhood on 
           the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.  
           Kevin Morais exits the building and walks to his WHITE SEDAN, 
           which is parked in an adjoining PARKING LOT. 

           EXT. KUALA LUMPUR ROAD - DAY 

           Heading toward downtown Kuala Lumpur, Morais’ white sedan 
           weaves its way through traffic. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Behind the wheel, Morais fiddles with the radio dial. As 
           traffic slows in front of him, he checks his watch. 

           Frustrated, he hits the horn and then weaves around the car 
           in front of him, nearly causing a collision. 

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Babi saitan. 

           Morais continues onto a stretch of road that’s less 
           congested. Something catches his eye in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR. 

           A COMPACT PICKUP TRUCK pulls up beside his sedan. The DRIVER 
           (a slight man dressed in all black) stares at Morais.

           Morais shrugs, as if to say, “What the Hell do you want?” The 
           compact pickup truck slows down and Morais pulls ahead of it.

           As traffic begins to build, Morais slows down again. 

           BANG!

           The truck rams Morais’ sedan from behind. 

           Furious, Morais jerks the gearshift into “park,” unbuckles 
           his seatbelt, and pushes opens the driver’s side door. 

           EXT. KUALA LUMPUR ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Morais storms up to the pickup truck on foot.

                                 KEVIN MORAIS
                        Alamak!

           Suddenly, the driver and THREE OTHER MEN jump out of the 
           pickup truck simultaneously. 

           Morais now realizes that this is a setup. He makes a 
           desperate run for it. Before he can get far, two of the men 
           from the truck POUNCE on him. 
           They drag Morais, kicking and screaming, into the back of the 
           pickup truck, which promptly speeds away. 

           EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

           Police DETECTIVES wielding FLASHLIGHTS cordon off with yellow 
           tape a wooded area that’s surrounding a stream.  

           A detective STUMBLES away from the scene, struggling to 
           maintain his composure after what he’s just seen. 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Clare, Amy, and Andrew stare at the TV.

           ON THE TV SCREEN - A BBC ANCHOR reports on the grisly murder.

                                 BBC ANCHOR
                        A top prosecutor for the Malaysian 
                        Anti-Corruption Commission, Kevin 
                        Morais’ body was found in a ravine, 
                        entombed in a barrel of cement. 

           The coverage cuts to Kevin Morais’ brother, CHARLES MORAIS 
           (heavyset, morose), who sits at a table making a statement.

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        Kevin was driven by his sense of 
                        right and wrong. And for that, he 
                        paid the ultimate price. 

           Clare wipes back the tears that are welling up in her eyes. 

                                 CLARE
                        Kevin Morais was my source. It had 
                        to have been him.

           Andrew embraces her. He looks deeply shaken. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Clare, this isn’t about getting the 
                        story anymore. It’s about your 
                        life. Our lives. 

           She buries her face in his chest.

           On her phone, Clare walks briskly along a grimy alleyway. Her 
           teenaged son, Alex, is on the other end of the line. 
                                 CLARE 
                        I don’t care what your friends are 
                        doing. You’re not going to Italy.

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        Ridiculous. Why not?

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t want you traveling right 
                        now. It might not be safe. 

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        This isn’t fair. Why should my life 
                        be put on hold because of you?

           As she rounds a corner, a BLACK CAR creeps up behind her, 
           maintaining a distance of about fifty feet. 

           Clare stops in her tracks. She turns around and stares at the 
           trailing car. The driver’s face is obscured in the shadows. 

                                 CLARE
                        Hang on, Alex. 

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 CLARE
                        Just stay on the line, OK?

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        Mom. What’s going on? 

           Clare scans her surroundings, searching for someone to call 
           out to. But she’s all alone in this dark alley. She breaks 
           into a fast walk, her heavy breath visible in the cold London 
           air. The car follows her. 

           She rounds a corner and breaks into a full-on SPRINT. She 
           eventually reaches a PUBLIC square with people milling about. 

           Clare turns around. The black car is gone. She catches her 
           breath and checks her phone. 

           ON CLARE’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - An incoming call from an 
           unknown international number. 

                                 CLARE
                        Alex, I’ll call you back. 

           She ends the call with her son and answers the incoming call. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?
                                 CHARLES MORAIS  (O.S.)
                        Is this Clare? 

                                 CLARE
                        Yes, who is this?

           EXT. KUALA LUMPUR STREET - CONTINUOUS (DAYTIME IN MALAYSIA)

           Charles Morais exits his lawyer’s office and walks out onto a 
           busy Kuala Lumpur street. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS 
                        This is Charles Morais. I found 
                        your number in my brother’s 
                        personal files. 

           INTERCUT CLARE AND CHARLES MORAIS

                                 CLARE
                        Where are you?

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        KL. I just left my lawyer’s office.

           Clare looks over her shoulder. Thinks she sees something and 
           takes a couple of steps around a corner. 

                                 CLARE
                        Are you crazy? You essentially just 
                        accused Najib of murder. You need 
                        to leave the country. Now. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        I was very careful. I didn’t say--

                                 CLARE
                        You know what they did to your 
                        brother. You think they’d hesitate 
                        to do it to you, too? 

           Charles considers this. She’s right. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        I’ll leave as soon as I can. And 
                        perhaps you should consider moving 
                        to a safer place yourself? 

           Breathing heavily, Clare clutches her knees. Tears begin to 
           stream down her face. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS (CONT’D)
                        Clare? Are you OK?
           Clare begins bawling her eyes out. 

                                 CLARE
                        I never should’ve put your brother 
                        in danger. I’m so sorry. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        You didn’t know. 

                                 CLARE
                        If I didn’t publish--

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        But you did publish. And because 
                        you did, people know just how 
                        corrupt Najib really is. And they 
                        won’t stand for it now. They can’t.

           Clare nods as the tears continue to flow freely. She wants to 
           believe him, yet she knows better. 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS (CONT’D)
                        My brother did not die in vain. I 
                        was calling to thank you. 

           Clare takes a deep breath and tries to compose herself. 

                                 CLARE
                        Take care of yourself, OK? 

                                 CHARLES MORAIS
                        You too, Clare. 

           INT. PUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Her face red and wet, Clare enters the traditional ENGLISH 
           PUB, which is busy with a LUNCHTIME CROWD. 

           She approaches the BARTENDER, who’s drying glasses. 

                                 CLARE
                        Just water, please. 

           Clare takes a seat on a bar stool and starts scrolling 
           through her email on her phone. 

           ON CLARE’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - A flurry of concerned messages 
           from colleagues, family members, and sources, including one 
           that reads, “Clare: What happened to Kevin was a warning to 
           all of us. I can’t speak to you anymore.” 

           As the bartender sets her water down on the hardwood bar, 
           Clare nearly jumps out of her seat, startled by the noise. 
                                 BARTENDER
                        You alright?

                                 CLARE
                        Yes, fine. 

           Clare grips the glass of water, her hand shaking. She downs 
           it in a couple of gulps and begins composing an email. 

           ON CLARE’S PHONE SCREEN - She types in the subject line, “Of 
           Interest To U.S. Authorities?”

           EXT. JHO’S NYC PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

           Fat Eric is lounging on the couch, playing a video game with 
           a huge bowl of noodles resting on his chest. Looking 
           stressed, Jho enters and gives him a disdainful glare. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Yo. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        What?

                                 JHO LOW
                        We need to think about getting out 
                        of New York. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        Vegas this weekend?

                                 JHO LOW
                        No, I mean, we need to think about 
                        leaving the U.S. Forever maybe.

           Fat Eric pauses the game and turns to Jho. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                        I thought you said not to worry. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Cash is tight. We’ll be under less 
                        pressure if we lay low for a bit. 

                                 FAT ERIC
                             (in Hokkien; subtitles)
                        Laying low? That doesn’t sound fun.

                                 JHO LOW
                        All of the accounts are in your 
                        name. You think I’m the only one 
                        who could end up in jail?
           The gravity of their predicament appears to hit Eric for the 
           first time. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Clare is alone at her laptop, scarcely able to keep her eyes 
           open. Andrew wanders in. He pours himself a cup of water. 

                                 ANDREW
                        How about getting some sleep? 

                                 CLARE
                        I need to be fully prepared for 
                        anything they might ask. 

                                 ANDREW
                        It’s like Churchill said: The 
                        Americans always do the right 
                        thing, once they’ve exhausted all 
                        other options.

                                 CLARE
                        He never actually said that. But 
                        the sentiment is exactly what I’m 
                        worried about. There are still 
                        plenty of bad options remaining. 

           Clare gets back to work, as Andrew leaves her to it. 

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

           Our timeline has now caught up with Clare’s ongoing meeting 
           with the two FBI agents and the D.O.J. attorney. She remains 
           visibly frustrated by their apparent intransigence. 

                                 YOUNG FBI AGENT
                        You’ve given us plenty of useful 
                        information, Ms. Rewcastle.

                                 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ATTORNEY
                        We look forward to continuing our 
                        review process into this matter. 

           Clare stares at her like he she three heads.

                                 CLARE
                        And how long will that bloody take? 
                        The Malaysian people are going to 
                        choose a Prime Minister next year, 
                        and the deck is already stacked 
                        against their chances of getting a 
                        free and fair election. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARE (CONT'D)
                        What the Hell happened to American 
                        leadership on the world stage?

           A heavy silence hangs in the air for a long beat. 

                                 OLD FBI AGENT
                        We have our process, too. 

           Without another word, Clare rises and walks out of the room. 
           The door SLAMS shut behind her. 

           INT. CYPRUS COUNCIL OF MINISTERS - DAY

           Looking like he hasn’t slept in days, Jho finishes filling 
           out a form, as a PASSPORT OFFICIAL observes him. 

           SUPER: “Cyprus” 

           Jho hands the form back to the passport official, who takes a 
           quick glance. 

           CH-CHUNK. A heavy STAMP presses down on Jho’s brand new 
           Cypriot passport. 

                                 PASSPORT OFFICIAL
                        Congratulations, sir. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Is this effective immediately? 

                                 PASSPORT OFFICIAL
                             (nods)
                        You are now an official resident of 
                        the Republic of Cyprus. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Thank you very much. 

           Jho exhales. He looks deeply relieved--even a little cocky 
           again. And then, one of his phones BUZZES. 

           ON JHO’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - An INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE from 
           Fat Eric: “Shit! Are you watching this?”

           Jho tenses up again instantly. He quickly heads out the door. 

           INT. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DAY

           REAL FOOTAGE of U.S. Attorney General LORETTA LYNCH, flanked 
           by American flags, and standing at a podium emblazoned with 
           the official U.S. Department of Justice logo. 
           SUPER: “July 20, 2016. Washington, D.C.”

                                 LORETTA LYNCH
                        The Department of Justice has filed 
                        a civil complaint, seeking to 
                        forfeit and recover more than $1 
                        billion in assets associated with 
                        an international conspiracy to 
                        launder funds stolen from 1 
                        Malaysia Development Berhad, or 
                        1MDB, a company wholly owned by the 
                        government of Malaysia. 

           EXT. CYPRUS COUNCIL OF MINISTERS - DAY

           Jho watches a LIVE VIDEO FEED of Lynch’s press conference on 
           his cell phone. He turns the video feed off and then dials 
           Fat Eric, who answers on the first ring. 

                                 FAT ERIC (O.S.)
                        I’m getting my go bag ready. 

                                 JHO LOW
                        Do it quietly. And don’t panic. 

                                 FAT ERIC (O.S.)
                        Don’t panic? We are fucked!

                                 JHO LOW
                        Just stick to the plan. I’m leaving 
                        right now. 

           Jho ends the call and heads toward his RENTAL CAR. He looks 
           around nervously, like he’s expecting to get arrested at any 
           moment. 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           With Amy and Andrew standing behind her, Clare watches a live 
           video stream on her laptop.

           ON CLARE’S LAPTOP SCREEN - Loretta Lynch is at the podium. 

                                 LORETTA LYNCH
                        Unfortunately, sadly, tragically, a 
                        number of corrupt 1MDB officials 
                        treated this public trust as a 
                        personal bank account. Today’s case 
                        is the largest single action ever 
                        brought by the Department’s 
                        Kleptocracy Recovery Initiative.  
                                 CLARE
                        They actually came through. I can’t 
                        believe it.  

                                 ANDREW
                        Congratulations, darling. You’ve 
                        done it. 

                                 CLARE
                        Done what? 

           Andrew’s gleeful expression evaporates. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        This is a start. But Jho is still 
                        out there. Najib is still in power. 
                        I haven’t done anything at all yet.

           Andrew looks down at the floor. She’s right. 

           INT. CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare’s phone buzzes. She sees who’s calling and answers it.

                                 CLARE
                        Did you see they scheduled the 
                        election for a Wednesday?

           INT. TONY PUA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Tony Pua sits at his desk, speaking to Clare on the phone. 

                                 TONY
                        And they’re closing the polls at 
                        5pm, so working people have less 
                        opportunity to vote. Typical Najib. 
                        He’s going to steal it again. 

           INTERCUT CLARE AND TONY

                                 CLARE
                        Everything we’ve done. The lives 
                        that have been destroyed. Has it 
                        really all been for naught? 

                                 TONY
                        Mahathir is about to announce he’s 
                        running against his old protégé, 
                        Najib. He built this country from 
                        the ground up. His credentials in 
                        Malaysia are unrivaled. 
                                 CLARE
                        Credentials? Tony, the election is 
                        gonna be rigged again. Not even 
                        Mahathir can win this fight with 
                        one hand tied behind his back.

                                 TONY
                        You’re probably right. But we have 
                        to at least try to get Najib out of 
                        office. What else can we do?

           EXT. MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE - DAY

           SECURITY GUARDS escort Rosmah and Najib to their awaiting 
           town car. He looks exceedingly uneasy. In contrast, she 
           appears poised and at peace. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        All you have to do is win the 
                        election, and this will all go 
                        away. And you have more than enough 
                        resources at your disposal to win 
                        the election. 

                                 NAJIB
                        But Mahathir. He’s a living legend.

                                 ROSMAH
                        Barely living. Mahathir is 92 years 
                        old. Everyone who was once loyal to 
                        him is loyal to you now. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Not everyone.

                                 ROSMAH
                        There are many, many people in 
                        Malaysia who are relying on you to 
                        win for their own livelihoods. 
                        Project strength, and it will all 
                        be OK, just as it’s always been.

           They get into the back of the town car.

           INT. MALAYSIA - VARIOUS

           MONTAGE

           Najib and Rosmah barnstorm across Malaysia in advance of the 
           2018 general election, focusing on Najib’s rural base. 
           They appear together at Muslim religious ceremonies, glad-
           handing with local leaders, and pumping up supporters, who’re 
           mostly dressed in matching RED SHIRTS. 

           Najib starts to gain more confidence, as he sees how fired up 
           his base is. This doesn’t look like someone who’s in any real 
           danger of losing an election rigged in his favor.

           END OF MONTAGE

           EXT. STADIUM - DAY

           Mahathir Mohamed speaks at a HUGE CAMPAIGN RALLY. Now the 
           candidate running against Najib, he’s flanked by opposition 
           leaders in Parliament, including Tony Pua.

                                 MAHATIR MOHAMAD
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        I spent decades helping to build 
                        UMNO. But Najib and his cronies 
                        have coopted the party for their 
                        own self-interest. We must defeat 
                        him for the sake of our nation’s 
                        future. It is now or never. 

           The crowd cheers wildly, as does Tony Pua. 

           MONTAGE

           Mahathir speaks at LARGE RALLIES--mostly in big cities--to 
           crowds of ANTI-NAJIB VOTERS, who wear YELLOW T-SHIRTS. 

           These people are at least as fired up as Najib’s supporters.  
           But as we look closer, we can see evident signs of concern. 

           At one rally, an OLD WOMAN IN A SHAWL quietly prays as 
           Mahathir speaks. She’s been down this dangerous road of hope 
           before, and it always ends the same way: in defeat.

           END OF MONTAGE

           EXT. POLLING STATIONS (VARIOUS) - DAY

           A NEWS REPORTER narrates the scene, as Malaysians turn out in 
           MASSIVE NUMBERS at polling stations around the country. 

           SUPER: “May 9, 2018.”
                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        It’s Election Day in Malaysia where 
                        embattled Prime Minister Najib 
                        Razak remains a heavy favorite to 
                        retain power, even amid accusations 
                        of corruption in the 1MDB scandal. 

           The lines at the polls extend for nearly a mile in some 
           places. These people are absolutely determined to vote, in 
           spite of the odds. 

           INT. HALLWAY (CLARE’S APARTMENT) - DAY

           Clare paces the hallway anxiously, as she scans through news 
           sources on her phone. Andrew approaches from the kitchen. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Big day, huh?

           He hands her a copy of the London Times SPORTS SECTION. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT’D)
                        If they take care of business 
                        against Brighton, Man City will 
                        break the all-time record for most 
                        wins in a Premier League season. 

                                 CLARE
                        Funny. 

                                 ANDREW
                        It’s out of your hands now. Get 
                        your mind off of it. Take a walk.

                                 CLARE
                        Take a walk? That’s your solution 
                        to this completely unbearable 
                        tension. Take a walk? 

                                 ANDREW
                        Yes. 

                                 CLARE
                        You’re impossible. 

           She grabs her coat. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Where are you going?

                                 CLARE
                        I’m taking a walk.
           She heads out the front door and slams it behind her. 

           EXT. ST. JAMES’S PARK - DAY

           A brilliant spring day in London. Everyone’s out and about. 

           Clare enters the park and gazes at the colorful FLOWERBEDS 
           that are laid out invitingly in front of BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

           She walks along the lake, as a family of PELICANS draws a 
           group of gawking TOURISTS. Her phone buzzes. It’s Andrew. 

                                 CLARE
                        Hi. 

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        Some people are here to see you.

                                 CLARE
                        What? Who?

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        I don’t know them. 

                                 CLARE
                        Should we call the police?

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        No, I don’t think you’ll want to do 
                        that.  

           She’s worried, confused, and annoyed that he won’t say more.

                                 CLARE
                        I’ll be home in ten. 

           EXT. CLARE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Clare walks along a narrow ALLEYWAY in Westminster. As she 
           approaches her building, we can start to hear people 
           CHANTING. The chanting gets louder and louder. 

           Clare turns a corner. On the sidewalk in front of her 
           building are dozens of MALAYSIAN EXPATS in yellow t-shirts. 
           They’re singing, swaying, chanting, and embracing one 
           another. Some of them look pretty hammered. 

           As Clare gets closer to her building, an OLDER MALAYSIAN 
           WOMAN in a yellow T-shirt points her out.

                                 OLDER MALAYSIAN WOMAN
                        Itu dia!
           Everyone turns toward Clare. They break out into wild CHEERS. 

                                 CLARE
                        What is all this? 

           The crowd parts and makes a path for Clare, as she approaches 
           her building. 

           AN EXUBERANT MALAYSIAN MAN hands her a bottle of champagne. 

                                 EXUBERANT MALAYSIAN MAN
                        Najib has lost!

                                 CLARE
                        What? Are you sure? 

           A pleasantly DRUNK MALAYSIAN WOMAN stumbles toward Clare and 
           EMBRACES her. Clare lets out a little smile. 

                                 DRUNK MALAYSIAN WOMAN
                        We’ve done it. Yeaaaaaah!

           Clutching the champagne bottle, Clare unlocks the door. 

                                 CLARE
                        Let’s not count our chickens--

           The crowd’s CHEERS drowns her out. She enters her building. 

           INT. CLARE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Boiling over with nervous energy, Clare is pouring over 
           ELECTION RETURNS on her laptop with Amy and her two sons 
           looking over her shoulder. 

                                 CLARE
                        Look at these numbers from Sarawak. 
                        It’s the biggest swing against 
                        Najib of any state.

                                 PATRICK
                        Go, mom!

           Amy is staring at her phone. She looks worried. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh, God. My friend in Ipoh says he 
                        saw an unmarked car at a polling 
                        station hauling away ballots. 

                                 CLARE
                        I knew it. This isn’t over. They’re 
                        gonna find a way to steal it. 
                                 ALEX
                        Can they really do that, mom? The 
                        world is watching now. 

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t know. I--

           Andrew enters, holding the bottle of champagne that was 
           handed to Clare previously.

                                 ANDREW
                        The BBC just announced Mahathir is 
                        about to give his victory speech. 
                        It’s official. The opposition has 
                        won a majority. 

           He begins to twist off the wire cage surrounding the bottle. 

                                 CLARE
                        Wait!

                                 ANDREW
                        Clare. 

           She grins from ear to ear. 

                                 CLARE
                        Can I open it? 

           Clare hugs her husband tightly and then takes the champagne 
           bottle from him. She’s about to pop the cork when suddenly--

                                 AMY
                             (staring at her phone)
                        Hold on. Najib and Rosmah are 
                        trying to flee the country.

                                 CLARE
                        What?! 

           Clare takes Amy’s phone and reads the text on her screen.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        We’ll track down the tail number of 
                        the getaway plane.

                                 PATRICK
                        But Sarawak Report is blocked in 
                        Malaysia, mom. No one will be able 
                        to read it there.  

           Clare is already texting with a source. 
                                 CLARE
                        They people will find a way. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           Najib and Rosmah both sit upright in the back seat, as their 
           DRIVER speeds onto a highway. Rosmah is fully panicked. 

                                 ROSMAH
                        How could you let this happen? We 
                        should have had a plan. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Be calm. We’ll be in Jakarta in an 
                        hour, and we’ll regroup there. 

                                 ROSMAH
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Faster!

           The driver steps on the gas pedal, and the car accelerates. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           MALAYSIAN PEDESTRIANS are gathering on the road. They 
           exchange messages on their cell phones and gossip in Malay. 

           ON A PEDESTRIAN’S CELL PHONE - A WhatsApp message shares a 
           link to a new SarawakReport blog post from Clare that reveals 
           Najib’s getaway plane’s TAIL NUMBER and flight plan. 

           As the pedestrian stares at his phone, Najib and Rosmah’s 
           TOWN CAR speeds past him, almost running him over. 

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        That’s them! They’re getting away!

           The town car accelerates toward the airport.  

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Hundreds of MALAYSIAN CITIZENS are gathered outside the main 
           airport gates. An OLDER WOMAN checks her cell phone. 

           ON THE WOMAN’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - Several WhatsAPP messages 
           share the getaway car’s last known whereabouts. 
                                 OLDER WOMAN
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Check every car. They should be 
                        here soon. 

           The Malaysian citizens stop and pull over arriving CARS, 
           searching for Najib and Rosmah. But they keep coming up 
           empty. 

           INT. TOWN CAR  - DAY

           The getaway car approaches the main airport access road. The 
           driver slows down, as he notices the crowd that’s gathered 
           ahead. 

                                 ROSMAH
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Just go! 

                                 DRIVER
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Go through the crowd?

                                 ROSMAH
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        They’ll move. If they don’t, it’s 
                        their fault. 

           The driver grips the steering wheel tightly, unsure of what 
           to do at first. He takes a deep breath and then TURNS off of 
           the main road and onto a DIRT ROAD. 

                                 DRIVER
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        We’ll go around them.

           The dirt road is empty of pedestrians. It looks like they 
           have a clear path to the airport. 

           Rosmah pats Najib on the knee. They’re going to make it. 

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           The Malaysian citizens look frustrated, as they continue to 
           search arriving cars in vain. A YOUNG MAN checks his phone. 

           ON THE YOUNG MAN’S CELL PHONE SCREEN - A WhatsAPP message 
           reads, “We’ve lost them.” 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        Damn it! 
           EXT. BACK ENTRANCE (AIRPORT) - DAY

           An ELECTRONIC GATE opens, and the town car drives through. 
           The car heads for the terminal. 

           EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

           A PRIVATE JET taxis onto the runway and accelerates rapidly. 
           Moments later, it’s in the air. 

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           CLOSE ON a FLIGHT ATTENDANT, who carries two cocktails on a 
           tray, as she makes her way up the aisle. She stops beside a 
           plush leather seat. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir. Your beverage. 

           A hand reaches out and takes the drink. We PULL BACK TO 
           REVEAL that it’s not Najib or Rosmah, but rather Jho Low.

                                 JHO LOW
                        Thank you.

           The flight attendant hands the second cocktail to Fat Eric, 
           who’s seated on the other side of the aisle. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Enjoy the flight, gentlemen. 

           Jho takes a sip of his drink and gazes out the window, 
           plotting his next move.  

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           Another CROWD appears on the road ahead. The driver slows 
           down. He begins to execute a three-point turn. 

                                 ROSMAH
                             (in Malay; subtitles)
                        What the Hell are you doing? 

           Rosmah reaches out to hit the driver. Najib holds her back. 

                                 NAJIB
                        Rosmah. It’s over. 

           The town car heads away from the crowd.
           EXT. MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE - DAY

           Uniformed anti-corruption POLICE OFFICERS remove dozens of 
           BOXES, overflowing with jewelry and other luxury items, from 
           the opulent residence. They load the boxes into trucks. 

           Najib and Rosmah are each led out of the house in HANDCUFFS 
           and escorted into awaiting police vehicles. 

                                 ROSMAH
                             (to Najib)
                        Do something! These men are 
                        criminals. They should be arrested!

           Najib just looks straight ahead, like she’s not even there. 

           The officers load Najib and Rosmah into separate police cars. 

           INT. CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare is fast asleep but still clutching her phone. A sliver 
           of morning sunlight cuts through the window, landing on her 
           face. She still doesn’t stir. 

           Andrew enters quietly, carrying a tray with two glasses of 
           champagne. He takes the phone out of Clare’s hands.

                                 ANDREW
                        Good morning. 

           She rubs her eyes. He hands her a glass of champagne. 

                                 CLARE
                        A little early, isn’t it? 

                                 ANDREW
                        It’s 5 o’clock in Kuala Lumpur, and 
                        we still haven’t celebrated. I’m so 
                        proud of you, darling. You really 
                        pulled it off. 

           She sits up in bed, at last allowing herself to enjoy a small 
           sip of champagne. 

                                 CLARE
                        Jho was sighted in China last 
                        night. I was about to write up a 
                        new post before I passed out. 

                                 ANDREW
                        You can take one day off. 
                                 CLARE
                        You think the crooks are going to 
                        take a day off? 

           She puts the champagne glass back down on the tray and 
           reaches for her laptop. 

           Andrew shakes his head in awe and profound admiration for 
           Clare, as she begins working on her next story. 

                                         THE END
