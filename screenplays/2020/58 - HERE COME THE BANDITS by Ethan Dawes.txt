           EXT. LAMADE STADIUM - EVENING

           Bleachers overflow with buzzing fans. The GOODYEAR BLIMP 
           floats aimlessly above the field. From a distance it looks 
           like a professional baseball stadium, minor league maybe...

                                 COMMENTATOR V.O.
                        It doesn’t get much more exciting 
                        than this. It’s win or go home for 
                        these boys... 

           QUICK CU’S OF: CAMERAS, LIGHTS, CLEATS digging into the 
           batter’s box. The UMPIRE crouches behind the CATCHER. SWEAT 
           BEADS drip down the side of a young face.

           We see a cleat push up against the rubber on the pitcher’s 
           mound.

                                 COMMENTATOR V.O. (CONT’D)
                        California is up by two, but the 
                        bases are juiced for Japan’s big 
                        man coming up to bat. If the boys 
                        from the West can get out of this 
                        inning, they’re taking home the 
                        title.

           REVEAL: These are Little Leaguers. Playing in the 
           championship game of the Little League World Series. 

           Our team on defense, California, wear blue and yellow jerseys 
           with WEST scrawled across the chest. The opponent, JAPAN, in 
           red and white.

           The CALIFORNIA COACH, 40’s, sweet but pensive, calls for time 
           and waves to the catcher, BEN "PICKLES" SCHWARTZ, 13, curly 
           hair, solid--

                                 COACH
                        Pickles! 

           Pickles jogs over and joins them on the mound.

           They approach the pitcher MICKEY STANLEY, newly minted 13-
           year-old, brown hair, light eyes, we nearly see him becoming 
           a man in this moment. He waits with great anticipation as his 
           coach approaches--

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, this is nothing. We’ve been in 
                        tougher spots. This is your game, 
                        Mickey, they’re just playing in it. 

           Pickles looks to Mickey, trying to gauge his mood--
                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        If you can get two strikes on him, 
                        then go with the curveball. Unless 
                        I call for something else, that’s 
                        the plan. 

           Mickey feigns some confidence.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave it hanging. Pickles, 
                        that thing gets in the dirt, I want 
                        you jumping on it, a pass ball 
                        means a run. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Got it, Coach. 

           Coach puts the ball in Mickey’s glove--

                                 COACH
                         (softens)
                        Hey, look around you, you’ve made 
                        it. I couldn’t be more proud of you 
                        boys. Just have fun, that’s what 
                        it’s all about. 

           Mickey smiles in relief. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Thanks, Dad. 

           Mickey’s Dad and Pickles walk off to their respective places.

           Mickey looks around the stadium, connects with his mom, 
           DEBRA, 40’s, proud, nervous, she smiles and waves. His eyes 
           continue to wander to the OPPONENTS DUGOUT, where we find a 
           dozen Japanese kids, waiting with great anticipation.

           The BATTER, a beast of a 13-year-old, size 14 shoe, looks at 
           Mickey, waiting for him to give him everything he’s got.

           Mickey takes a deep breath, winds up, and UNLOADS. Batter 
           rears back, swings, and hits the ball INTO THE NEXT ZIP CODE.

           But foul. RELIEF from one side of the stands, AGONY from the 
           other--

                                 COMMENTATOR V.O.
                        And a long strike one.

           Mickey takes the next sign, this time... SMACK!..the ball 
           hits the glove before the batter can finish his swing.
                                 COMMENTATOR V.O. (CONT’D)
                        And strike two! The big righty from 
                        Balboa Park nearly touching eighty 
                        miles an hour on that one.

           Mickey’s Dad shoots him a wink and bubblegum-smacking-smile.

           The batter steps out of the box, takes a deep breath, steps 
           back in. Mickey is ready to pitch immediately, he goes right 
           into his wind-up...

           BEGIN SLOW MOTION

           Mickey releases. The ball soars through the air, the batter 
           clocks the rotation of the ball, Mickey’s face falls as he 
           realizes...he left it hanging.

           He started it too high...the ball drops, but instead of 
           dropping away from the batter, out of his reach, it drops 
           right into his wheelhouse, like a big lopsided mango.

           END SLOW MOTION

           CRACK!

           CU ON MICKEY: Just like that, it’s over.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON

           CHYRON: TEN YEARS LATER

           Mickey, now 28, wears a wrinkled white T and blue jeans, 
           everyone else is ready for practice. He’s asleep against his 
           locker. His COACH, 40’s, gut, windbreaker, shoots him a look-

                                 COACH
                        STANLEY! 

           He wakes up, groggy--

                                 MICKEY
                        So loud. Oh my god, why so loud? 

                                 COACH
                        Get out there and throw some 
                        batting practice. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yes sir, Mr. Coach, sir. 

           It’s a MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM. Painted on the wall is 
           "ACES" LUBBOCK, TX. 
           Mickey begrudgingly gets up, opens his locker, flips on a 
           BOOMBOX. Bruce Springsteen blares through the speakers, 
           Mickey dances as he gets ready. Other players are irked by 
           the noise.

                                 PLAYER 1
                        Turn that crap off, Stanley. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m sorry, I can’t hear you! Gotta 
                        respect the boss! 

           THE TOWEL BOY, 18, passes pushing a cart full of dirty 
           uniforms.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Seth, do me a solid and take care 
                        of some personals while you’re at 
                        it. 

           Mickey reaches into his locker, pulls out a small bag of 
           laundry and tosses it in.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like wasting water on small 
                        loads. 

           Seth begins to walk off-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Easy there, Usain Bolt. 

           Mickey then removes a HUGE bag of laundry from his locker--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a while. 

           Mickey takes a whiff from the bag.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Careful, that’s powerful stuff. 

                                 SETH
                        I’m not supposed to wash any 
                        personal belongings. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Who’s making this personal? I don’t 
                        want to make this personal. I want 
                        to save the environment. That’s 
                        actually a personal dream of mine, 
                        water is being wasted everyday-- 

           Seth walks off as Mickeys drones on...
           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

           Mid-practice. Mickey is on the mound throwing batting 
           practice to his teammate TUCKER, 26, big, fat, obnoxious 
           goatee.

                                 TUCKER
                        Let’s see what you got, kid. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Fastball. I’m going to throw you a 
                        fastball. 

           Mickey winds up and throws... WHACK! Tucker sends it out of 
           the park in a hurry.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Nice cut. 

                                 TUCKER
                        That all you got? 

                                 MICKEY
                        It’s practice, Tuck, let’s build 
                        your confidence, we all know you 
                        need it. 

                                 TUCKER
                        Why don’t you give me that famous 
                        curveball of yours? 

           This winds up and throws...WHIFF Blows a fastball by him.

                                 TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Do that again, I dare you. 

           Mickey THROWS HIM SOME CHIN MUSIC. Tucker falls to the 
           ground. Mickey smirks. Tucker jumps up and walks towards him, 
           pointing his bat--

                                 TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Watch it! 

                                 MICKEY
                        What’re you gunna do, meathead? 

                                 COACH
                        KNOCK IT OFF! 

           The boys cool down. Tucker gets back in the batter’s box.

                                 TUCKER
                        Let’s see that breaking ball, tough 
                        guy.
           Micky winds up and releases. The ball soars towards Tucker, 
           then drops so quickly and dramatically it looks like it’s 
           going to drill a hole through the ground. SWING AND WHIFF. 
           Nowhere near it.

           ANGLE ON: Coaches, impressed...until they see Mickey, holding 
           his arm, wincing in extreme pain.

                                 MICKEY
                        No, no, no... 

           He tries to move it-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        OW! 

                                 COACH 2
                        Crap. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           OPEN ON: A set of X-RAYS. DR. MITCHELL, 40’s, inspects them. 
           Mickey sits on the examination table--

                                 DR. MITCHELL
                        I’m seeing more and more of this 
                        with kids your age. When did you 
                        start throwing a curveball? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Eleven...maybe twelve? 

                                 DR. MITCHELL
                        Your body wasn’t developed enough 
                        to handle that sort of workload. 
                        Players like you start throwing all 
                        these wacky pitches too early then 
                        it catches up with them and...SNAP. 
                         (Off Mickey)
                        There’s really only one thing we 
                        can do-- 

                                 MICKEY
                        Tommy John? 

                                 DR. MITCHELL
                        I was gunna say hack the whole 
                        thing off, but yeah, that would 
                        work, too. 

           Doctor smiles, knowing this weighs on him.
                                 DR. MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, kid. I know that’s a tough 
                        pill to swallow for pitchers. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What if I just rest? Physical 
                        therapy? 

                                 DR. MITCHELL
                        You’ll be able to do every day 
                        tasks, but throwing a baseball is 
                        out of the question if you don’t 
                        have the surgery. 

           Mickey exhales.

           INT. COACH’S OFFICE - LATER

           Shack of an office, coffee pot from the 80’s, legal pads. 
           Mickey has his feet up on the tanker desk that sits between 
           him and Coach. Coach slides a check across his desk.

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s this? 

                                 COACH
                        Your final check, plane voucher for 
                        the flight home. 

                                 MICKEY
                        That’s it? I’m done? 
                         (looks at ticket)
                        A coach seat?! 

                                 COACH
                        Lotta guys out there looking for 
                        their shot, Ace. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What about my shot? I spend a year 
                        out here in the middle of friggin’ 
                        nowhere giving you guys results, 
                        and that’s worth what, $600 bucks? 

                                 COACH
                        We’re going to pay for the surgery, 
                        but we can’t keep you on the 
                        roster. Let’s face it, your numbers 
                        haven’t been great. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’ll be better in no time. Really, 
                        it’s nothing. I’ll do whatever-- 
                                 COACH
                        Best of luck to you. 

                                 MICKEY
                        This is bull-- 

                                 COACH
                        Watch it. 

           Mickey retracts.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I know you think you can 
                        skate by on your talent, but 
                        sometimes you gotta do things you 
                        don’t want to do in order to get 
                        where you need to be. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I think they call that compromise. 

                                 COACH
                        They call it teamwork. You got 
                        something, kid. But you need to 
                        stop getting in the way of 
                        yourself. You’re a pain in the ass. 

           Mickey gets up. Heads to the door--

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m good enough to play in the 
                        bigs. You know that.

                                 COACH
                        So was Matt Hausfater.

                                 MICKEY
                        Who’s that?

                                 COACH
                        Another pitcher you’ve never heard 
                        of because his bad attitude got in 
                        the way of his 100 mile an hour 
                        fastball.

           Mickey shakes his head, leaves. The door closes, we stay on 
           coach.

                                 MICKEY
                         (from down the hall)
                        If this is a middle seat I’m gunna 
                        lose it!
           EXT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Players avert their eyes as he packs up his stuff. Seth 
           passes pushing the cart of clean laundry--

                                 MICKEY
                        Hey Seth, you have my clothes? 

           Seth hands him a bag, Mickey inspects his clothes, they’re 
           now TODDLER SIZED AND PINK. His uniform, pants, everything. 
           Other players laugh. 

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Real funny! VERY FUNNY! 

           Mickey CHUCKS some of the laundry around the room. He then 
           continues to completely TRASH THE ROOM. Players start to 
           video it with their phones as he spirals and LAUNCHES A TRASH 
           CAN AT A LOCKER. 

           OFF THE CRASH of the locker...

           ESTABLISHING: PLANE ARRIVING AT LAX

           INT. LAX - LATER

           Mickey walks through the BAGGAGE CLAIM, his arm in a sling. 
           His face suddenly lights up. REVERSE ON: His mother, Debra, 
           60’s, holding a sign for: "THE ACE"

           INT./EXT. DEBRA’S TOYOTA - LATER

           They drive, K-Earth on the radio. Mickey takes in his 
           hometown.

                                 DEBRA
                        Your dad would be proud of you. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I slacked off. 

                                 DEBRA
                        You’re young, you’re allowed to 
                        slack off. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m not that young anymore. 

                                 DEBRA
                        Hun, you had a shot and you took 
                        it, that’s more than most kids can 
                        say. You hungry or anything? 
                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah. 

                                 DEBRA
                        Anywhere you want. 

           He shoots his mom a smile...

           ESTABLISHING: BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE

           Donations from the local pizzeria and construction companies 
           have given way to soft outfield grass and softer cushions on 
           the bleachers. It’s dialed in. With the exception of an old 
           sign at the entrance with faded paint that reads: "WELCOME TO 
           BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE"

           We catch various ballplayers on the field--

           -A ATHLETIC KID, 12, is hitting bombs over the fence.

           -A RICH KID, 10, wears a multitude of sweatbands and goes 
           through an exhausting routine before stepping up to bat. He 
           takes a pitch, then steps out of the batter’s box and goes 
           back into his routine.

           -A PORTLY KID, 9, is getting help from a DAD, 40’s, as he 
           piles catcher’s gear on him. It’s an overwhelming amount of 
           padding. The kid goes to stand and slowly TIPS OVER.

           INT./EXT. THE DUGOUT DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Mickey takes a HUGE BITE out of a burger. DAVE aka "DUGOUT 
           DAVE", 60’s, jeans, grease-stained shirt, a valley holdover 
           from it’s agriculture days, shares a smile with DEBRA as they 
           watch him eat-

                                 DAVE
                        Glad you still have that appetite. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Now that I’m not playing, I’m just 
                        going to get really fat, so stock 
                        the fridge. Is this cheese organic?

                                 DAVE
                        You’ll get back out on that field, 
                        what have I always told you? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Trust your gut. 

                                 DAVE
                        What’s your gut telling you? 
           Mickey BURPS.

                                 DEBRA
                        Manners, Mickey! 

           Dave slaps him in the face with a bag of hot dog buns he’s 
           putting away.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ll pay you fifty bucks to paint a 
                        new welcome sign for the park. 

           Mickey looks at the overgrown sign--

                                 MICKEY
                        Why haven’t they fixed that thing? 
                        They don’t seem to be lacking any 
                        funds around here.

                                 DAVE
                        They just pour money into new 
                        batting cages and computers. 
                        Someone was talking about video 
                        cameras for replays. Can you 
                        believe that? At a little league! 
                        Ridiculous. They don’t understand 
                        the feeling you get when you step 
                        into a ballpark is the most 
                        important part. We get replay 
                        cameras, I’m out of here. These 
                        parents argue enough. 

                                 MICKEY
                        The game’s changing. Any new 
                        talent? 

                                 DAVE
                        Some solid players. None as good as 
                        you and the Backyard Bad Boys. 

           Dave looks at a FRAMED NEWSPAPER CLIPPING on the wall, Mickey 
           as a kid, being lifted by his former All-Star team with the 
           headline "LOCAL BOYS BOUND FOR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP”. It 
           strikes a chord in Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        No point in showing up if you don’t 
                        win. 

                                 DAVE
                        There’s this one girl, Mackenzie 
                        Jones, throws a fastball like I’ve 
                        never seen. Reminds me of you. 
                                 MICKEY
                        Baseball, not softball. 

                                 DAVE
                        How long you been gone? They got 
                        girls out here playing hardball. 
                        Good ones, too. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Girls can’t play baseball. 

           Debra WHACKS Mickey on the back of the head with the same bag 
           of hot dog buns--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        OW! What? Put those away, you don’t 
                        work here--

                                 DEBRA
                        These are good. Not too damaging 
                        but they get the point across.

           Dave nods in agreement.

           SFX: SMACK.

           Micky DUCKS. As if he thought the noise was his mom whacking 
           him again--

           SMACK!

           He then turns his head, realizing it’s something else.

           THWACK!

           He gets up and rounds the corner to find MACKENZIE JONES, 12, 
           dark features, laser focus, ponytail sticking straight out of 
           the back of her hat.

           She’s throwing HEAT to an older girl in a CATCHER’S MASK. 
           Mickey is transfixed. Dave approaches--

                                 DAVE
                        Could use some work on her control. 
                        The league just lost a coach. Maybe 
                        you should step in... 

                                 MICKEY
                        Are you nuts? If my minor league 
                        team found out I moved in with my 
                        mom and started coaching Little 
                        League, I’d get laughed out of a 
                        career. 
                                 DAVE
                        Until that arm gets better, you 
                        don’t have a career. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t have the patience for kids. 
                        They’re always hungry...and sticky. 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Dave! Let’s get that grill fired 
                        up, I’m starving! 

           Mickey and Dave look down at SCOTCH JONES, 7, goofy, oddly 
           mature, always wearing golf attire, tugging on Dave’s pants.

                                 MICKEY
                        See what I mean? 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.C.)
                        Scotch! Time to go. 

           Mickey looks up, catcher takes off her mask, TANNER JONES, 
           27, no bullshit, dark eyes, wipes the hair out of her face. 
           Her and Mickey lock eyes for a brief moment.

                                 MICKEY
                        Um, hey, what’s up? 

                                 TANNER
                        Nothing, you? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Nothing. 

                                 TANNER
                        Cool. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Cool. 

                                 TANNER
                        Great chat. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Not my best. 

           She laughs and walks off.

                                 DAVE
                        Nice one. That’s her sister, 
                        Tanner. I thought you were going to 
                        get her name but that would’ve been 
                        moving too fast for you. 
                                 MICKEY
                        I like to take things slow. And the 
                        little one? Her...? 

                                 DAVE
                        Brother. 

           INT. SPORTS AGENCY - OFFICE - LATER

           OPEN ON the video of Mickey trashing the locker room, it has 
           tens of thousands of views. With the title CUT MINOR LEAGUER 
           LOSES IT.

           PULL OUT to reveal Mickey’s agent, TAD, mid 30’s, tight suit, 
           behind a desk COVERED in various bobbleheads, playing the 
           video on his phone-

                                 TAD
                        Healthy or not, nobody wants this 
                        in their clubhouse. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Tad, I gotta play again, I’ll do 
                        anything. 

                                 TAD
                        We need to improve your image 
                        first. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I played three seasons in the

                        You’re a liability! This is a 
                        liability. Professional 
                        organizations don’t want negative 
                        press like this, at any level. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What happened to this friggin’ 
                        sport? Baseball is about getting 
                        dirty. It’s about stepping up to 
                        the plate when a ball is getting 
                        thrown at your face at 90 miles an 
                        hour! It’s not about being nice and 
                        feelings and crap. I may as well go 
                        coach Little League! 

           Tad thinks.

                                 TAD
                        Wait...that’s it. 
                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 TAD
                        Little League. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m too old to play Little League! 

                                 TAD
                        Not to play. Coach! Go coach Little 
                        League! Injured ballplayer gives 
                        back to his community with his time 
                        off! Are you kidding? People eat 
                        that stuff up. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You want me, a professional 
                        baseball player--

                        Whatever!...To go coach little snot-
                        nosed kids how to field ground 
                        balls? 

                                 TAD
                        Hey, you don’t have to. I also 
                        don’t have to represent a pitcher 
                        who can’t pitch-- 

                                 MICKEY
                        Tad, you can’t be serious... 

                                 TAD
                        Former pitcher revisits his roots! 
                        You said you’d do anything...this 
                        is anything. This is a start. 

           Off Mickey, reluctant...

           INT./EXT. MICKEY’S CAR - LATER

           Mickey sits in his Ford Explorer parked outside Balboa Little 
           League. He takes a deep breath and gets out.
           INT. BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The office is covered with CHAMPIONSHIP BANNERS and faded 
           photos of wide-eyed Little League teams. Behind the desk is 
           League President STEVE CAMERON, 60’s, polo shirt, balding.

           Mickey sits across from him.

                                 STEVE
                        What’s the catch? 

           Mickey spots a COOLER and removes a Capri Sun from it.

                                 MICKEY
                        Man, I missed these things. No 
                        catch...I love...kids. I love 
                        baseball and I can’t play right 
                        now, so I figured I’d pass along 
                        everything I know. The basics-- 

                                 STEVE
                        Healthy competition... 
                        exercise...confidence building... 

                                 MICKEY
                        ...Giving wedgies, hawking loogies, 
                        spitting sunflower seeds. Yeah. I 
                        got all the bases covered. Pun 
                        intended. 

                                 STEVE
                        Mickey, we take this seriously. If 
                        I catch you slacking off, I’ll get 
                        rid of you. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Steve, can I call you Steve? Or it 
                        it Mr. President of Baseball? 

           Steve isn’t entertained.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. President Steve, I won most of 
                        the banners hanging on this wall. 
                        Who better to teach kids the ins-
                        and-outs of this place than the guy 
                        who put this place on the map?

           He takes NOISY sip of the Capri Sun.

                                 STEVE
                        The draft is tomorrow morning at 
                        7am. Leave the attitude at home. 
           Mickey SPITS Capri Sun everywhere-

                                 MICKEY
                        7am! Who’s awake at 7am?! 

           Steve wipes the beverage off his face.

                                 STEVE
                        Most human adults. Including all 
                        the other coaches that need to be 
                        at work by 9am. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Can we push that back...or is there 
                        some sort of auto-draft feature? 

                                 STEVE
                        This isn’t Fantasy Football. 7am 
                        tomorrow morning. And I suggest you 
                        get a co-coach, these kids can run 
                        you into the ground. 

           Off Mickey, not exactly thrilled...

           INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS - LATER THAT DAY

           It’s sheer mediocrity is what has kept this giant returns 
           closet/sporting goods store safe from bankruptcy. Never 
           extending beyond a first floor like it’s competitors, Dick’s 
           and Sports Chalet, Big 5 has outlasted them all by staying in 
           it’s underwhelming lane. 

           BLUE SHIRTED EMPLOYEES aimlessly walk past WALLS OF ATHLETIC 
           EQUIPMENT. We see customers in various departments using 
           equipment incorrectly--

           -Two 12-YEAR-OLDS casually place a TRAMPOLINE under a 
           BASKETBALL HOOP.

           -A OLD MAN is testing GOLF EQUIPMENT, he lines up to swing in 
           the practice stall FACING THE WRONG WAY, shooting into the 
           store. An EMPLOYEE runs up and turns him around.

           -A TEENAGER sits in a kayak with a helmet on, looking oddly 
           serious. We PULL OUT to revel another TEENAGER pushing him, 
           sending him FLYING off a bench that has been propped up like 
           a ramp, into a wall of inflatable pool toys.

           -Back to the 12-year-olds, one of them is stuck on top of the 
           hoop, the other trying to lasso him with a jump rope.
           Walking briskly down the aisle is PICKLES, now 29. He’s 
           barking orders at BOPE, 16, thin as a rail, glasses too big 
           for his face, staring off into space--

                                 PICKLES
                        Bope! Redress the mannequins, pump-
                        up the basketballs, and go take the 
                        Spring skiing stuff off the wall.

                                 BOPE
                        Yes sir, Mr. Pickles. 

           Pickles’ face lights up as he see’s...

                                 PICKLES
                        ACE?! 

                                 MICKEY
                        The Big Pickle. 

           They hug.

                                 PICKLES
                        Man, I feel like I haven’t seen you 
                        since college! 

                                 MICKEY
                        I know, sorry I kinda lost touch. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Hey, I was your catcher...that’s a 
                        bond that can’t be broken by a few  
                        ignored phone calls...texts...and 
                        notarized letters. Did you get the 
                        care package I sent? 

                                 MICKEY
                        I did, turns out ice cream doesn’t 
                        travel very well by mail...thanks, 
                        though. 

                                 PICKLES
                        What brings you ’round these parts? 
                        I didn’t know you were back in 
                        town! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, sorta threw my arm out 
                        and...got cut. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Dang, I’m sorry man. What’s up? 
                        Want a job application? 
           In the b.g. we see Bope near the ski equipment, he’s 
           assessing two skis that are stuck to the wall.

                                 MICKEY
                        Nah, I wanted to talk to you about 
                        Little League. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Baseball is aisle six. 

                                 MICKEY
                        No, I think we should coach Little 
                        League together. 

           Bope continues to struggle with the skis, trying to pry them 
           off the wall, Mickey and Pickles don’t notice.

                                 PICKLES
                        Us, like you and me, the dynamic-
                        duo, coach? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Back to the glory days, what do you 
                        think? 

                                 PICKLES
                        Heck yes! I’ve always wanted to 
                        give one of those uplifting 
                        speeches when the team is down in 
                        the dumps and the game is on the 
                        line! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Great. The draft is tomorrow at 
                        7am, I can’t make it so you gotta 
                        be there. 

           Bope’s face has turned BEET RED as he continues to struggle 
           with the skis.

                                 PICKLES
                        No can do, gotta open up shop here. 
                        Do you have something more 
                        important like a doctor’s 
                        appointment or family emergency or 
                        are you just too lazy? 

                                 MICKEY
                        After all these years, you still 
                        know me better than anyone else. 

           WHACK! Bope NAILS himself in the face with the ski and falls 
           to the ground. Mickey and Pickles turn--
                                 PICKLES
                        Keep up the good work, Bope. 

           Bope gives a THUMBS UP from the ground.

                                 MICKEY
                        He gunna be okay? 

                                 PICKLES
                        He’ll be fine. Nature over nurture. 
                        Anyways, this is exciting! 

           PRE-LAP SFX: ALARM BUZZING takes us to...

           INT. MICKEY’S BEDROOM - 6:30AM

           Mickey silences his alarm. Goes back to sleep.

           INT. BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE - CONFERENCE ROOM - 7:15 AM

           We GLIDE DOWN the table. Steve sits at the head, 
           Parent/Coaches sit on either side of him staring each other 
           down. There’s an unoccupied seat at the end of the table.

                                 DAD 1
                        Do we wait? 

           Next to Steve sits JEFF JONES, 50’s, strong jaw, stern, wears 
           a GIANTS hat.

                                 JEFF
                        Steve, we have jobs to get to... 
                        families to support. This kid has 
                        nothing to do but watch cartoons. 
                        Let’s get into it. 

                                 DAD 1
                        Are we sure he was the best choice? 
                        I heard he’s a bit of a loose 
                        cannon... 

                                 STEVE
                        He was the only volunteer-- 

                                 MOM 1
                        Mickey Stanley, is he-- 

                                 JEFF
                        Same kid who got us to the Little 
                        League World Series fifteen years 
                        ago. Then gave up a grand slam in 
                        the championship. 
                                 DAVE (O.C.)
                        I’ll draft his team for him. 

           ANGLE ON: Dugout Dave, watching from the end of the room. He 
           walks over and takes the empty seat.

           INT. MICKEY’S ROOM - LATER

           Mickey wakes up, looks at his clock: 7:45am

                                 MICKEY
                        Crap! 

           He puts on pants and DASHES out the door...

           EXT. BALBOA PARKING LOT - LATER

           Mickey STUMBLES out of his car and BOLTS towards the office.

           INT. BALBOA CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey enters, the coaches are wrapping up--

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m here! I’m here. Did it start? 
                        Are there bagels? 

                                 STEVE
                        Here’s your team. 

           Steve hands him a ROSTER, he looks it over-

                                 MICKEY
                        Autumn...Mackenzie...Betsy...This 
                        is a softball team. I’m coaching 
                        baseball. 

                                 STEVE
                        Those are all bona fide 
                        ballplayers, son. Dave drafted for 
                        you. 

           Jeff walks over with a cardboard box and drops it in front of 
           Mickey. THUNK.

                                 JEFF
                        Here are your jerseys. Your girls 
                        should like these. I have a bet 
                        going with the other dads, odds are 
                        you won’t last a week. 
           Mickey opens the box and pulls out a BRIGHT PINK JERSEY with 
           FLAMINGOS scrawled across the chest.

                                 MICKEY
                        You gotta be kidding me. 

           INT./EXT. DAVE’S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave is wiping down the counter. Scotch sits in front of him 
           with a GIANT SUNDAE.

                                 SCOTCH
                        I’m gunna need a bigger spoon. 

                                 DAVE
                        Or a snorkel. 

           Dave hands him a ladle as Mickey storms in, waving the roster 
           in his hand-

                                 MICKEY
                        Dave! What the heck, man?! 

                                 DAVE
                        You’re welcome? 

                                 MICKEY
                        There are two boys on this team, 
                        we’re screwed! I can’t win with 
                        this team! 

                                 DAVE
                        Who said it’s about winning? 

                                 MICKEY
                        If I’m going to coach a Little 
                        League team, it’s going to be a 
                        winning one. 

                                 DAVE
                        There’s some real talent there, 
                        they just need some guidance... 

                                 MICKEY
                        Matty Weinberg! I heard about this 
                        little nutbar, he got kicked out of 
                        school for biting! Biting?! In the 
                        day-and-age of iPhones? Who bites 
                        anymore? 
                                 DAVE
                        He’s just...curious. Mickey, they 
                        need someone to teach them to love 
                        the game. Someone like you. No one 
                        has given these kids a shot because 
                        they’re girls...or they’re a little-

                                 MICKEY
                        Evil! 

                                 DAVE
                        Odd. Trust me, those dads woulda 
                        stuck you with a much worse team. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You stuck me with a cheerleading 
                        squad, not a baseball team! 

                                 DAVE
                        You’re better than that, kid. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Dave, I’m on board for co-ed Little 
                        League. Don’t get me wrong. But 
                        between you and me, come on, 
                        baseball is a man’s sport. You 
                        gotta be tough. You gotta have ball-
                         (off Scotch’s look)
                        --Huevos! How am I going to win any 
                        games with a chick team? 

                                 DAVE
                        Let’s face it. You’re not exactly a 
                        great communicator. You’re not easy 
                        to take. Any other group of kids 
                        wouldn’t have given you the time of 
                        day. Those kids will listen to you. 
                        That’s if you have anything to 
                        teach them. 

                                 MICKEY
                        The FLAMINGOS?! 

                                 DAVE
                         (laughing)
                        I had no say in that. Man, those 
                        are some ugly jerseys. 

           SFX: AN ENORMOUS BELCH echoes from the counter, Scotch sits 
           there, sundae gone, eyes droopy.
                                 SCOTCH
                        Call my mom. Call a chopper. I’m 
                        gunna need to be airlifted outta 
                        here. 

           Scotch slowly falls off his stool and lands with a thud. He’s 
           immediately asleep.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - THE NEXT MORNING

           QUICK CUTS OF: Young baseball players looking like PROS. 
           They’re turning double plays, making diving catches, 
           exhibiting perfect swings.

           SFX: A LOUD WHISTLE takes us out of the sequence to another 
           field where PICKLES, WEARING A PINK FLAMINGOS HAT, IS STOKED.

                                 PICKLES
                        Listen up you jive turkeys! 

           REVERSE ON THE TEAM: WE PAN DOWN A LINE OF FACES-- girls of 
           all different shapes and sizes and two puny boys, the 
           antithesis of the players we just saw.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        You little monkey butts! You goofy 
                        jelly-- 

           Mickey, wearing sunglasses and his faded Balboa All-Star hat, 
           carrying a bat, intervenes--

                                 MICKEY
                        It’s too early for that, man. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Sorry, I’m just so psyched to be 
                        here. There’s no crying in 
                        baseball! Are you crying? Are you 
                        really crying?! 

           REVERSE ON: The team, nobody is crying. They look at each 
           other quizzically.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Nobody is crying... 

                                 MICKEY
                        What are you doing? 

                                 PICKLES
                        Tom Hanks, League of Their Own. 
                                 MICKEY
                        Let’s start with some defense, 
                        everyone go to your position. 

           JANETTE, 12, short, spunky, untied cleats--

                                 JANETTE
                        You haven’t given us positions yet, 
                        sir. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Good point. What’s your name? 

                                 JANETTE
                        Relief pitcher, Janette Wilson, 
                        sir...but you can call me Trouble. 

                                 PICKLES
                        What, why? 

                                 JANETTE
                        The Cyclone! The Sultan of Swat! 
                        Shoeless Joe Jackson! Every great 
                        ballplayer has a great nickname. 
                        Mine’s... Trouble. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You gotta earn a nickname, kid. But 
                        everyone here can learn something 
                        from Jordette- 

                                 JANETTE
                        Janette. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Whatever. Ask questions. More 
                        importantly, never talk back to 
                        your coach. 

                                 JANETTE
                        But-- 

                                 MICKEY
                        No buts! No cuts...and absolutely 
                        zero coconuts. We’re not fooling 
                        around here, we’re playing 
                        baseball. Now get out to whatever 
                        position you think you should be 
                        playing. 

           THEY ALL RUN to the Pitcher’s mound.

                                 PICKLES
                        That ain’t gunna work... 
           Mickey recognizes Mackenzie in the middle of the group--

                                 MICKEY
                        Mackenzie, right? 

           She nods.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Stay there, everyone else go to a 
                        different position. 

           THE PACK RUNS OVER TO SHORTSTOP. Mickey hangs his head.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay! Just go to whatever position 
                        you played LAST YEAR. 

           THEY ALL RUN TO THE DUGOUT...and sit on the bench.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Huh. 

           EXT. PRACTICE - LATER

           The team is lined up at THIRD BASE. Fielding ground balls. 
           Mickey hits one down the line and it rolls past TEDDY, 12, 
           ginger, thick-framed glasses, reading a BOOK.

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s that in your hand? 

                                 TEDDY
                        Stats! I’m going to be the next Vin 
                        Scully. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s your name? 

                                 TEDDY
                        Teddy Saperstein! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Teddy, we’re here to make stats, 
                        not read them. 

                                 MATTY
                         (next in line)
                        Yeah, nerd! 

           The rest of the gang snickers. Mickey looks over to MATTY 
           WEINBERG, 11, short, yappy-
                                 MICKEY
                        You must be Mike Weinberg’s little 
                        brother. 

                                 MATTY
                        The name’s Matty, old man. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s that? I can’t hear you from 
                        up here. 

           The other players giggle, Matty is FUMING. He jumps up, GRABS 
           MICKEY BY THE COLLAR, and yanks him down to his level so 
           they’re face-to-face--

                                 MATTY
                        Do you know what it’s like being 
                        this tall? Whenever I’m at the 
                        mall, theme park, any crowded 
                        place, someone ALWAYS farts in my 
                        face! ALWAYS! I’m face-to-face with 
                        someone’s butt at least ONCE A DAY! 
                        You adults, you think you can go 
                        around, farting in kid’s faces 
                        without them knowing, we know! I’ve 
                        seen some stuff, man! 

           Mickey, scared, slowly peels the kid off him.

                                 MICKEY
                        Can you throw this ball over to 
                        first? 

           Matty throws a LOB to Pickles, standing on first. It hangs in 
           the air for an eternity but eventually makes it there.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Good enough. Stay here. Next! 

           A petite blond ALLY, 12, steps up-

                                 ALLY
                         (singing)
                        I’m Alllllyyyyy! 

           Everyone winces as she belts it out-

                                 MICKEY
                        Wow, okay, what was that? 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m a soprano! 
                                 MICKEY
                        You’re a center fielder. 

           Mickey tosses a ball in the air and off the CRACK of the bat 
           we...

           BEGIN SEQUENCE

           -With the exception of Mackenzie, they’re all bad. Very bad.

           -Janette chases down a ground ball and TRIPS on her laces--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s tie those cleats! 

           -Mickey hits a fly ball to AUTUMN, 11, small, dark hair, 
           stiff as a board. She makes zero effort, it drops right next 
           to her.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you here to play baseball? 

                                 AUTUMN
                        No. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Then why show up? 

                                 AUTUMN
                        Disciplinary purposes. 

           Off Mickey, confused...

           -At SECOND BASE and SHORT STOP are IDENTICAL TWINS, MEL and 
           BELLE, 12, brown bob cuts, angular faces--

                                 MICKEY
                        Mel, Belle! Turn two. 

           Mickey hits the ball to short stop, Belle struggles to field 
           it, Mel runs over, trying to help. They bump into each other, 
           kicking the ball around, this goes on for an inordinate 
           amount of time. They eventually PICK IT UP TOGETHER and run 
           it over to first base holding hands. 

           -IN THE PARKING LOT we see CODY THOMAS, 12, tall, lanky, 
           pedaling her bike with a tattered baseball glove hanging off 
           the handlebars. She rides up to the fence and looks at the 
           team, unimpressed. Mickey spots her from the field.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Mackenzie! 

           Mackenzie runs over to him-
                                 MACKENZIE
                        Sup? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Is that girl on our team? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        No...that’s Cody Thomas. She just 
                        kind of hangs around the park. 

           Later...

           Janette is still in the dugout trying to tie her cleats.

                                 PICKLES
                        Need help? 

                                 JANETTE
                        I got it. 

           REVERSE ON: The field, Mel and Belle are braiding each others 
           hair, Ally is singing in center field, Matty is beating up 
           Teddy...

           -Mickey spots Mackenzie’s older sister Tanner watching from 
           near her car. He waves, she shakes her head.

           -Janette has finally tied her cleats, she gets up, runs and 
           TRIPS immediately. They’re tied together.

           Mickey looks up at the sky.

                                 MICKEY
                        Looks dark, we should call it. 

                                 PICKLES
                        It’s only three. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Good point. Second lunch time.

           END SEQUENCE

           INT. DUGOUT - LATER

           The team looks up at their coaches, exhausted-

                                 MICKEY
                        Alright guys, that was- 

                                 AUTUMN
                        I think you mean GIRLS. 
                                 MICKEY
                        Huh? 

                                 MATTY
                        I’m pretty sure he means GUYS. 

                                 AUTUMN
                        There are more GIRLS THAN GUYS! He 
                        should be addressing us as GIRLS! 

                                 MATTY
                        I’m no stinkin’ GIRL! 

           Autumn gets in Matty’s face, before we know it, THE WHOLE 
           TEAM IS CAUGHT IN A SCUFFLE.

                                 MICKEY
                        Okay...enough, break it up. 

           The fight continues...

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You guys--girls, whatever, stop... 

           They still go at it--

                                 PICKLES
                        1-2-3 EYES ON ME! 

           They stop, frightened.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        Cool. It worked.

                                 MICKEY
                         (looking at roster)
                        Where’s Betsy Simon? 

           The players look at each other, fearful--

                                 MACKENZIE
                        She’s on our team?! 

                                 MATTY
                        She’s bad, man. That is one bad bit- 

                                 PICKLES
                        Hey! No cursing. 

                                 MATTY
                        ...bitcoin. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Does anyone know where she is? 
           INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - LATERs

           AN OLD TV IS PLAYING THE SANDLOT, the part where Ham famously 
           says, "You play ball like a girl!"

           CRACK! A baseball DRILLS A HOLE IN HAM’S FACE. A plume of 
           smoke billows from the broken TV.

           REVERSE ON: BETSY SIMON, 12, an intimidating young lad, 
           FUMING as she looks at the broken TV.

                                 MICKEY (O.C.)
                        Betsy! Betsy Simon! 

           Betsy gets up and looks outside her tree house to find 
           Mickey, Pickles, and the rest of the team--

                                 BETSY
                        WHAT?! 

                                 MICKEY
                        You missed practice. 

                                 BETSY
                        Get off my lawn. 

           She ducks back into her tree house.

                                 MICKEY
                        Will you be at the game this 
                        weekend? 

           THE TV COMES FLYING OUT OF THE TREE HOUSE AND CRASHES on the 
           ground in front of them, baseball still lodged in it.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I think that’s a yes. 

                                 PICKLES
                        That little girl scares the cra-- 

                                 MATTY
                        Hey! No cursing. 

                                 PICKLES
                        --aaap out of me. 

                                 MATTY
                        You cursed. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Shut up, I’m an adult. 

           PRE-LAP SFX: THE NATIONAL ANTHEM sung by a 5-year-old girl...
           EXT. BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE - OPENING DAY

           Fields are buzzing, Dave’s Diner is packed. We make our way 
           to the MAJOR field where the first game of the season is 
           about to be underway.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        On the third base line we have our 
                        home team, the Giants. You might 
                        recognize some of these boys from 
                        their championship run last year. 
                        Their coach, Jeff Jones, is looking 
                        to clinch a league record sixth 
                        Championship. And the visitors, on 
                        the first base line the... 
                        Flamingos? Looking, well... 
                        confused. 

           THE FLAMINGOS stand hesitantly, awkwardly tugging at their 
           pink jerseys. The Giants laugh at them from across the field.

           INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOX - SAME

           Behind the mic our announcer, BRIAN, 20’s, swagger of a 
           1940’s newsman, turns to his co-commentator, Scotch, food all 
           over his face.

                                 BRIAN
                         (covering the mic)
                        Those are some ugly jerseys. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Ugly indeed, Jack, ugly indeed. 

                                 BRIAN
                        My name is Brian. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Jason, I’m seven-years-old, give me 
                        a break. 

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff meets Mickey at home plate, they shake hands and pose 
           for a TEENAGER snapping photos.

                                 JEFF
                        Why don’t you quit now, save your 
                        girls some embarrassment? 
                                 MICKEY
                        How old are you, the sum of all 
                        your players? 

           SNAP! The photo is taken, the coaches separate instantly.

           EXT. MAJOR FIELD - LATER

           CU ON: The scoreboard. The Giants are up by 9 in the first 
           inning.

           Balls are being drilled all over the field. The Flamingos 
           can’t get an out to save their life.

           Mackenzie pitches, a grounder is hit right back to her, she 
           fields it and throws to first base where Teddy is giving the 
           play-by-play instead of waiting for the ball--

                                 TEDDY
                        The ball is drilled back up the 
                        middle to the pitcher! Mackenzie 
                        Jones fields it with ease, throws 
                        to first and-- 

           THUNK! It NAILS Teddy in the chest and he falls to the 
           ground. He didn’t even put his glove up.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        And the first baseman is down! He’s 
                        down! 

                                 MICKEY
                        TEDDY! We’re in the middle of a 
                        game, what are you doing?! 

           Teddy rolls on the ground in pain--

                                 TEDDY
                        Sorry, coach! I got a little caught 
                        up in the color commentary... 

           Mackenzie runs over, picks up the ball and SPEEDS down the 
           line, following the runner as he tries to get to second. She 
           tags him out.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                         (from the ground)
                        And a stand-up play from the valley 
                        wunderkind! The medic should be on 
                        their way to help the first 
                        baseman. Any day now...anybody?
                        I guess this is how it ends for 
                        me... 
           EXT. FIELD - LATER

           Betsy steps into the batter’s box and stares down the 
           pitcher. The pitch comes, she swings and BIG WHIFF. As she 
           swings, everyone in the field (as well as the stands) DUCKS.

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s everyone ducking for? 

           Another pitch. She swings and BAM! She DRILLS one down the 
           first base line, nearly taking Pickles’ head off as he stuffs 
           his face with a hot dog. Foul ball, strike two.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we might have something here. 

           The next pitch comes, she rears back and...WHIFF. The bat 
           SLIPS out of her hands and it flies back, back, back and OVER 
           THE FENCE.

           SFX: GLASS SHATTERING FOLLOWED BY AN ALARM.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Well, she’s got power. 

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And there’s one reason not to park 
                        behind center field. 

                                 SCOTCH (V.O.)
                        Another reason is sometimes I take 
                        our dog Scooter back there to do 
                        his business. I tell my mom I clean 
                        it up and throw it away but I 
                        don’t. I should. But I don’t.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        Um. Thank you for sharing that.

           Autumn is up to bat, she timidly steps into the batter’s box, 
           stiff as a board. She CLOSES HER EYES as the pitcher 
           throws...

           Ball 1.

                                 MICKEY
                        She’s so small...she has no strike 
                        zone. 

           Ball 2.
                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        A base runner! Finally. Alright, 
                        Autumn, whatever you do, DON’T 
                        SWING! 

           Ball 3.

           The next pitch comes, Autumn doesn’t swing but CALLED STRIKE. 
           Autumn looks at the Umpire-

                                 AUTUMN
                        A STRIKE?! Are you 
                         (BLEEPING)
                        serious? THAT’S 
                         (BLEEPING BLEEP)
                        GET YOUR EYES CHECKED YOU 
                         (BLEEP).

           Everyone is shocked as the expletives pour out of this tiny 
           girl. In the stands, parents are SLACK-JAWED.

                                 UMPIRE
                        You’re outta here! 

           She’s ejected. Jeff shoots Mickey a look...

                                 MICKEY
                        She’s here for disciplinary 
                        purposes. 

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think it’s working. 

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - LATER

           CU ON: The scoreboard 10-0, 4th inning. The game is over. The 
           teams huddle for the post-game cheers.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And due to the mercy rule, the game 
                        is ending two innings short. To put 
                        it simply...that was a beating for 
                        the Flamingos. 

           INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

                                 SCOTCH
                        You got that right, Brittany. 

           Brian covers the mic.
                                 BRIAN
                        My name is Brian, Scotch. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Your last name is Scotch? That’s 
                        crazy! My first name is Scotch! 
                        Brittany Scotch...that’s a weird 
                        name for an adult man. 

           Brian shakes his head.

           EXT. MAJOR FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           The teams line-up and shake hands. As they pass each other--

                                 GIANTS 1
                        Nice try achem-LOSERS-coughcough. 

                                 GIANTS 2
                        Cute jerseys. 

           A player is passing Matty-

                                 GIANTS 3
                        How’s the weather down there, 
                        SHORTY! 

           Matty JUMPS at him, Betsy GRABS THE KID and holds him, Matty 
           starts PUNCHING him. Other players get in on it. The stands 
           are cleared. IT’S AN ALL-OUT BRAWL.

           We spot Debra in the stands, hanging her head. We also find 
           Tanner and Cody watching the fight, unimpressed.

           INT. BALBOA CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Mickey and Jeff sit across from Steve, he’s FUMING. Jeff 
           holds a bag of ice on his leg--

                                 STEVE
                        This is Little League, not the 
                        friggin’ UFC! 

                                 JEFF
                        That Weinberg kid socked me in the 
                        shin! 

                                 MICKEY
                        To be fair, he can’t reach any 
                        higher. 
                                 STEVE
                        Is this funny to you, kid? You 
                        think this is some sort of joke? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Kind of. 

                                 STEVE
                        What’s the punchline, huh? A washed-
                        up ballplayer comes back to his 
                        Little League to make himself look 
                        good? 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 STEVE
                        I see what you’re doing, alright? 
                        I’m not exactly convinced you’re 
                        here out of the goodness of your 
                        heart. Just know that I’m not going 
                        to let your bad attitude negatively 
                        effect the reputation of this 
                        league, got it? 

           Off Mickey--

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You have one strike on you. Do I 
                        have to tell you what happens after 
                        three? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Take your base? 

           Off Steve, shooting daggers at Mickey...

           EXT. ROCCO’S TAVERN - THAT NIGHT

           Pool bar with a jukebox and flat screens playing highlights 
           from every sport. Mickey and Pickles play PING-PONG.

                                 MICKEY
                        These girls are hopeless. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Who thought coaching would be this 
                        hard? I’m happy to do it but I 
                        can’t believe they don’t pay 
                        coaches in Little League--forget 
                        college athletes--this is a bigger 
                        scandal in the sports world.
           SLAM! Mickey hits the ball, Pickles fails to return.

                                 MICKEY
                        How are you this bad? I’m playing 
                        left-handed. 

                                 PICKLES
                        I haven’t exercised this much in a 
                        while. 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Can I play? 

           Mickey and Pickles look over and see Tanner.

                                 PICKLES
                        I could use a break. And a snack.

           Pickles hands her the paddle. She serves...THWACK! Mickey is 
           taken aback. He tosses her the ball--

                                 MICKEY
                        Funny seeing you here.

                                 TANNER
                        Why is that funny? It’s a bar.

                                 MICKEY
                        Well, yeah--I--It’s just a thing 
                        people say--I don’t know. I guess 
                        it’s not that funny. I’m not like, 
                        laughing. I--just haven’t seen--
                        Okay. Just serve.

           She serves. Another ace.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        For the record, I’m not using my 
                        good arm. 

                                 TANNER
                        From what I’ve heard, your good arm 
                        was never good to begin with. 

           THWACK! She serves another ace. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Damn.

                                 PICKLES
                        Torched.

           Later...
           MID-MATCH. MICKEY IS POURING SWEAT. It’s heated. A crowd has 
           formed. Mickey misses a corner shot.

                                 TANNER
                        20-15. Sucker’s serve. 

           He serves the ball and SLAM! Gives it everything he’s got. 
           She NAILS it back in his face. Game.

                                 MICKEY
                        You’re definitely the best girl 
                        I’ve ever played-- 

           Tanner storms over, grabs him by the shirt and SHOVES HIM 
           AGAINST THE WALL-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Woah, woah! Relax, I’m just--

                                 TANNER
                        Mackenzie hasn’t been practicing 
                        year-round only to be let down by 
                        some washed-up minor leaguer with 
                        nothing to teach her. 

                                 MICKEY
                        The team isn’t good, okay? That’s 
                        not my fault! I don’t know how a 
                        buncha misfits can win a baseball 
                        game. I don’t have much to work 
                        with here.

           She shoves him again--

                                 TANNER
                        They’re excited young kids. You 
                        have everything to work with.

           Tanner drops him on the floor and walks off.

                                 TANNER (CONT’D)
                         (shouting back as she 
                         exits)
                        I’ll be at practice tomorrow! You 
                        better have a plan. 

           Mickey looks up at Pickles-

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s her problem? 

                                 PICKLES
                        Apparently you. 
           INT. MICKEY’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Mickey enters, it’s late. He flips on the light, the first 
           thing we see is a photo of him as a child with his dad, 
           they’re in matching All-Star uniforms.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Your dad spent a lot of time with 
                        you boys out on that field. 

           He looks up, Debra is in the doorway-

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t know how he found the time. 

                                 DEBRA
                        He loved it out there. He would 
                        come home after practice and just 
                        be so...smiley, there was nothing 
                        he would’ve rather been doing. 

           Debra puts her hand on his shoulder and looks at the photo-

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t really know how to connect 
                        with them the way he did with us. 

                                 DEBRA
                        I think your version of baseball is 
                        a little different than theirs. 
                        Think about being their age. What 
                        was fun for you?

           Mickey thinks.

                                 MICKEY
                        I...don’t know. I liked putting on 
                        the jersey. I like being able to 
                        put on this nice uniform knowing I 
                        could go out and play and get it as 
                        dirty as I wanted. And just...I 
                        don’t know, it was fun.

                                 DEBRA
                        Fun. Now there’s a crazy idea. 

           Debra exits. Off Mickey, pensive...

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - THE NEXT MORNING

           It’s California heat. Desert heat. Summer on Ventura Blvd. 
           heat. The team looks up at Mickey, already sweating--
                                 MICKEY
                        Let’s start with some fundamentals. 
                        Pickles, show the team how to slide 
                        properly. 

           Pickles DARTS down the base path, approaches second base, 
           FARTS and trips over the bag. The kids BURST into laughter. 
           He continues to fart as he rolls around on the ground.

                                 MATTY
                        He’s having a fart attack, coach! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Thank you for showing the team what 
                        not to do. 

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Can anyone slide properly? 

           They take turns, having little success.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        I’d say forget about the last game, 
                        but I want you to remember that 
                        feeling and I want it to drive you. 
                        A great man once said, "The past is 
                        never the past. It is always 
                        present." 

                                 AUTUMN
                        That doesn’t even make sense, who 
                        said that? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Bruce Springsteen. 

                                 ALLY
                        Who the heck is Ruth Springsteen? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Bruce. The Boss. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh! I know Bruce, he’s my rabbi. 

                                 MICKEY
                        He’s not your rabbi. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah, Rabbi Springsteen. 

                                 MICKEY
                        The boss is not your rabbi! 
                                 TEDDY
                        You callin’ my rabbi a liar?! 

           Mickey hangs his head, then...

                                 MICKEY
                         (shouting)
                        Hit it! 

           CU: A hand plugs an IPOD into the speaker system on the 
           field. We PULL OUT -- It’s Tanner. Bruce Springsteen’s "BORN 
           IN THE U.S.A." blares over the speakers.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, let’s have some fun. We 
                        might even learn something. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           -Dave is taking the trash out, looks to the field and smiles 
           as he sees...

           The outfield COVERED with tarps, Mickey, Pickles, and Tanner 
           are HOSING them down, making GIANT SLIP-N-SLIDES. The kids 
           run through the grass, HIT THE TARPS and slide across, 
           working on their sliding form. BIG SMILES on their faces.

           Later...

           The gang is huddled around home plate--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        The beauty of first base is that 
                        you can run right through it. You 
                        do everything you can to beat out 
                        the throw. Pickles, Tanner... 

           ANGLE ON: First base, Pickles holds one side of a PAPER 
           BANNER that reads "BIG 5 WINTER SALE!" Tanner holds the other 
           end. 

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see if you can run fast 
                        enough to blast through that paper. 

           Janette BOLTS down the base path, hits the paper and SLAP --
           bounces right off it. Falling to the ground.

           Teddy gets up and DARTS down the first base line, he slowly 
           meanders off the base path. He completely misses the banner 
           and continues to run into the outfield.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Teddy! Get back here! 
           The team laughs.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll have to work on his sense of 
                        direction. Betsy? 

           Betsy wobbles down the base path, not going very fast, by the 
           time she gets to first she’s totally WINDED. She FALLS over, 
           collapses through the sign, landing on her face.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a start. 

           Later...

           Tanner is in center field with Ally--

                                 TANNER
                        You and the catcher are the only 
                        players with a perfect view of the 
                        entire field. You gotta be loud, 
                        whenever there’s an out, I want the 
                        kids in the next town to hear it. 

                                 ALLY
                         (singing)
                        I CAN DO THAAAAT! 

           Later...

           Mickey helps Mackenzie grip a change-up.

                                 MICKEY
                        Nothing throws a batter off like a 
                        good change-up. You want to make 
                        them miss so bad they’ll wonder if 
                        they should even be out here. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Did you ever wonder that? 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        If you should be out here...playing 
                        baseball. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Never. Neither should you. People 
                        like us, we belong out here.
                                 MACKENZIE
                        Sometimes I feel like it’s really 
                        just a sport for boys. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Well, if you want to change 
                        anyone’s mind about that, you gotta 
                        convince yourself first. Can you 
                        show me that? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Yeah. 

           -Pickles works with Mel and Belle on turning double plays, 
           they’re slowly making progress.

           -Betsy is on the mound pitching to Pickles as he stands in 
           the batter’s box. She throws and NEARLY TAKES HIS HEAD OFF. 
           He falls to the ground.

                                 MICKEY
                        Maybe we’ll stick to catcher. 

           Pickles climbs to his feet and looks behind him, the ball is 
           lodged in the wall.

           -Betsy is behind home plate in catcher’s gear. Mickey throws 
           the ball to her, she pops up, throws it down to second as 
           Mackenzie tries to steal second base. She’s out by a mile.

           Mickey is in right field with Janette--

                                 JANETTE
                        Just let me pitch! I’m the next 
                        Sandy Koufax. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m the next Sandy Koufax. 

                                 JANETTE
                        You’re injured! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Watch it, missy. 

           Off Mickey’s smile...

           Janette tries to pitch. She can barely make it to the plate.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        That ain’t gunna cut it. 
                                 JANETTE
                        I need the pressure to be on, I’m 
                        no good in low-stakes 
                        circumstances. I’m a closer! 
                        Closers play with heart and grit 
                        and I got that in spades! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Closers also have fastballs. 

           INT. PICKLES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pickles watches various clips from famous sports movies and 
           practices delivering a big moving speech.

           INT. MICKEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mickey is doing laundry. He finds his STAINED PINK UNIFORM 
           from the minors. Gets an idea.

           INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS - THE NEXT DAY

           Mickey stands over the cash register with Pickles.

                                 PICKLES
                        Ace, the discount is only for 
                        family. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Pickles, look around you... 

           They look at the kids running around the shop, enamored by 
           the fancy gear. Matty and Betsy are tossing Bope’s glasses 
           around, he tries to get them but keeps crashing into things.

                                 PICKLES
                        It’s a mess, I know.

                                 MICKEY
                        No, doofus. This is your family. 

           Pickles smiles and slides his ID through the register.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - LATER

           Mackenzie is throwing batting practice to her teammates, 
           nobody can get a hit off her.
                                 MICKEY
                        Can’t anyone make some contact off 
                        her? 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        I can. 

           They look to the bleachers, it’s CODY.

                                 MICKEY
                        Do you play here? 

                                 CODY
                        No. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        She just sits and watches like a 
                        weirdo. 

                                 CODY
                        The only thing I’m watching is you 
                        not following through and losing 
                        velocity on your fastball. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh snap! Analytical burn.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Why don’t you put your bat where 
                        your mouth is? 

                                 PICKLES
                        Damn. These kids are snappy. 

           Cody gets up and walks onto the field. She grabs a bat and 
           helmet and steps into the batter’s box. Mackenzie takes the 
           rubber, they stare each other down.

           Mickey and Pickles look on, entertained. Mackenzie winds up 
           and CRACK! Cody hits it out of the park in the blink of an 
           eye. The other players crane their necks as they watch it fly 
           out. Cody walks off the field, gets on her bike, and leaves.

                                 MEL AND BELLE
                        Talk about a walk-off home run. 

           Mackenzie is frazzled but intrigued.

                                 MICKEY
                        Why doesn’t she play? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I don’t know. 
           Off Mickey, pensive.

           INT. GALLERIA FOOD COURT - LATER

           CU ON: A CARDBOARD BOX

           Mickey pulls out a STUNNING jersey. It’s all black with the 
           word BANDITS across the chest in pink outline. The players 
           look on in awe. Mickey nudges Pickles--

                                 MICKEY
                        This is your moment. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Huh? 

                                 MICKEY
                        The big speech. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Oh. Right! 

           Pickles looks at the team, starts to pace across the room. He 
           clears his throat--

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        When you’re down...and out for the 
                        count...in the dumps. Teams are 
                        just, it’s you and me...and Dupree. 
                        Bad movie. We don’t want to be like 
                        Matt Dillon... 

           Off the kids, confused-

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        We want to be like Matt Damon...the 
                        baseball version of Matt Damon. 
                        Good Will Hunting! The Departed!
                         (considering)
                        Matt Dillon is good too, 
                        though...Wait, before I continue. I 
                        have a question...what the hell am 
                        I talking about? 

           They have no idea. Mickey steps up and relieves Pickles--

                                 MICKEY
                        Bandits are outlaws. 

           Off Matty-
                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Bandits have been kicked to the 
                        curb. 

           Off Betsy-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Bandits have been pushed in a 
                        corner and left to fend for 
                        themselves. 

           Off Mackenzie-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Bandits take what isn’t theirs. 
                        Those other teams think that field 
                        belongs to them...what are we going 
                        to do? 

                                 TEAM
                        TAKE IT! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Most of all, Bandits stick 
                        together. 

           Off Mel and Belle-

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        By the looks of you, I’d say you 
                        were born to be Bandits. 

           CHEERS. They crowd Mickey as he passes out uniforms--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Obviously, don’t break any laws or 
                        do anything bad, you’re bandits 
                        when it comes to baseball...out in 
                        public, you’re perfectly good kids. 

           Janette looks at the back of her jersey, instead of her name, 
           it says "Trouble". She smiles. Mickey looks over to Tanner, 
           tosses her a jersey--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        We could use your help in the 
                        dugout, coach. 

                                 TANNER
                        You trying to keep me around? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Anyway I can. Dinner. Tomorrow 
                        night after the game?
                                 TANNER
                        Maybe...if you win. 

           ACROSS THE FOOD COURT WE FIND three kids in GIANTS hats, 
           watching the Bandits.

                                 GIANT 1
                        Clowns. 

                                 GIANT 2
                        Better uniforms won’t make them 
                        better ballplayers. 

           Giant 1 takes a SMOOTHIE and HURLS IT ACROSS THE FOOD COURT, 
           exploding in front of Matty and Betsy. The Giants start 
           cracking up. Matty gears up to run at them, Pickles grabs him 
           by the shirt collar, Matty runs in place.

                                 GIANT 3
                        You girls have no shot! NO SHOT!

                         (growling)
                        Let me at ’em! 

           MUSIC KICKS IN--

                                 BRIAN (PRE-LAP V.O.)
                        And here come the Bandits! Needing 
                        a win here if they want to make 
                        anything of the rest of the 
                        season... 

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - DAY

           -The Bandits storm the field in their new uniforms.

           -The Giants watch from the bleachers.

           -The Bandits play textbook baseball. They’re focused, in 
           sync, and energized.

           INT. COMMENTATOR’S BOOTH - SAME

                                 BRIAN
                        And we’re seeing some new life in 
                        this team as the Bandits have a 
                        commanding lead heading into the 
                        final inning. 
                                 SCOTCH
                        You got that right. Baseball, 
                        Soccer, Basketball, Rugby. These 
                        are all sports. I learnt that in 
                        school. Big shout out to Mrs. 
                        Montgomery at Balboa Elementary, 
                        you’re doing a bang-up job. 

                                 BRIAN
                        You heard it here first folks, 
                        baseball...is a sport. 

           EXT. FIELD - LATER

           The final out is called. BANDITS WIN. The team throws their 
           gloves in the air and celebrate. Tanner approaches Mickey--

                                 TANNER
                        Dinner at my place tonight? 

           Mickey lights up.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - THAT NIGHT

           Mickey waits at the front door of a sprawling suburban home 
           holding flowers. The door swings open and it’s JEFF, the 
           Giants coach.

                                 MICKEY
                        Oh...no. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hey there, Mick. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I think I’m at the wrong house. 

           Mackenzie and Tanner appear from behind Jeff on both sides, 
           smiling from ear-to-ear.

                                 JEFF
                        I really wish you were. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Mickey, Mackenzie, Tanner, and Scotch, sit at the dinner 
           table. The parents have yet to enter.

                                 SCOTCH
                        Want to see me stick my fist in my 
                        mouth? 
                                 MICKEY
                        Absolutely. 

           Scotch goes for it. Mickey looks to Tanner--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you tell me Jeff was 
                        your dad?! 

                                 TANNER
                        I guess it slipped my mind... 

           Mackenzie laughs-

                                 MICKEY
                        You think that’s funny? Is that why 
                        he didn’t draft his own daughter, 
                        cuz everything is a big joke to 
                        her! 

           Scotch’s ENTIRE FIST is in his mouth, he’s making weird 
           noises.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Is he okay? Also, WOW. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Scotch! Bad boy! 

                                 MICKEY
                        I think it’s stuck. 

           Mackenzie SLAPS Scotch on the back, his fist POPS out.

                                 JEFF (O.C.)
                        I didn’t draft my daughter because 
                        my wife thinks we bicker too much 
                        when I’m her coach. 

           Jeff enters the dining room holding mashed potatoes followed 
           by his wife NANCY, 40’s, hippie-turned-soccer mom/attorney, 
           wielding a roast chicken--

                                 NANCY
                        They couldn’t leave it on the 
                        field. 

                                 JEFF
                        She thinks I pushed her too much. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        You didn’t push me enough! 
                                 NANCY
                        See what I mean? 

           SFX: A LOUD BELCH emits from the end of the table, everyone 
           looks over, Scotch has eaten half the chicken.

                                 SCOTCH
                        Lovely chicken, Nancy. What’s for 
                        dessert? 

           EXT. TANNER’S HOUSE - SAME

           The Bandits are crept down in a BUSH OUTSIDE THE DINING ROOM 
           WINDOW.

                                 MATTY
                        I can’t see, I can’t see! 

           Betsy LIFTS him up and puts him on her shoulders.

                                 MATTY (CONT’D)
                        That’s better. 

           Matty SNAPS a photo with his iPhone and sends it to 
           Mackenzie.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Mackenzie’s phone buzzes, she looks at it--

                                 JEFF
                        What’s the rule, Mackenzie? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        With a runner on third, always go 
                        for the squeeze bunt over the big 
                        hit. 

                                 NANCY
                        About phones at the dinner table... 

           She silences it, glances at the photo, and giggles.

                                 TANNER
                        What’s so funny? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Scotch. 

           They look at Scotch, he’s wearing his pants on his head.
                                 SCOTCH
                        Sometimes you gotta loosen your 
                        belt after a big meal. You know 
                        what I mean, Alfonzo? 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? My name is Mickey. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Whatever, guy. Pass me that gravy 
                        boat. Daddy’s goin’ swimmin’! 

                                 JEFF
                        I think we have to like--limit his 
                        TV or something?

                                 NANCY
                        He’s perfect.

           EXT. TANNER’S HOUSE - SAME

           Betsy SNEEZES, causing Matty to FALL off of her shoulders.

                                 MATTY
                        WOAH! WOAH! WOAH! 

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           SFX: AN O.C. THUMP comes from the front lawn.

                                 NANCY
                        What was that? 

           Jeff heads for the front door--

           EXT. TANNER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff inspects the front yard...nothing. We find them UP IN 
           THE TREE. Stifling their laughter.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

                                 JEFF
                        So, Mickey, what’s your plan once 
                        that arm heals? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Hopefully get back to playing ball. 
                        Depends how it responds to physical 
                        therapy. 
                                 TANNER
                        I’m sure you’ll be fine. 

                                 JEFF
                        That can get expensive. Who foots 
                        the bill for that? 

                                 MICKEY
                        The team paid for the surgery...but 
                        I have to take care of everything 
                        else. Probably be a while until I 
                        can afford it.

                                 JEFF
                        Maybe you should be focusing on 
                        work instead of playing with these 
                        kids. 

                                 TANNER
                        Sounds like you’re scared of a 
                        little competition, Dad. 

                                 JEFF
                        Me, scared? Of this jabroni? No 
                        way. 

           Jeff DRIVES his knife into a piece of chicken. Mickey laughs 
           nervously...

           INT. TANNER’S ROOM - LATER

           Mickey looks at Tanner’s old trophies.

                                 MICKEY
                        You’re a little old to be living at 
                        home, don’t you think? 

                                 TANNER
                        You’re one to talk, Momma’s boy. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Touché. 

                                 TANNER
                        It’s just until I’m done with grad 
                        school, then I’ll be out of here. 
                        And hey, my parents aren’t that 
                        bad. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Your mom is lovely. Your dad wants 
                        to rip my face off. 
                                 TANNER
                        So did I when we first met... 

           Mickey moves in closer, they lock eyes--

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The team is watching from the tree, with a perfect view into 
           Tanner’s window. Mel and Belle are giggling--

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Keep it down! 

           They look at the branch above them...it’s Pickles. He lowers 
           a bag of popcorn to the kids.

           INT. TANNER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey takes Tanner by the hand, leans in and...

                                 MATTY (O.C.)
                        WOAH! 

           Mickey and Tanner look out the window to spot THE KIDS 
           HUDDLED IN THE TREE, they try to duck but FALL OUT! Mickey 
           runs to the window and looks down on his team in a dog pile 
           on the front lawn, laughing incessantly.

                                 AUTUMN
                        Nice moves, coach! 

                                 MATTY
                        You just taught me more in fifteen 
                        seconds than you have all season! 

           Off Mickey and Tanner, shaking their heads.

                                 PICKLES
                        Very smooth, Ace. 

           They look up at Pickles, eating popcorn. He offers them some.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        Jiffy Pop? 

           INT. TAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           CU ON: A PLASMA TV. It’s highlights of Mickey pitching, 
           hitting, pumping up his college and minor league team in slow 
           motion, as well as footage of him with the Bandits.
                                 MICKEY
                        Wow...what is this? 

                                 TAD
                        Highlight reel, baby. Texture. 
                        Moral fiber. This is what we’re 
                        going out with. We’re going to 
                        reintroduce Mickey Stanley to the 
                        baseball world.

           Off Mickey, smiling...

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mickey sits in the examination room as a Doctor, 40’s, checks 
           the mobility of his arm.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Your recovery speed is pretty 
                        amazing. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Positive thinking. 

           Doctor moves to a wall of pamphlets--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Here are some physical therapists 
                        and personal trainers that have 
                        great programs for ballplayers. 
                        Unfortunately...they’re not exactly 
                        cheap. 

           Mickey looks over the pamphlets, taken aback by the prices.

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t know if I can afford 
                        this... 

                                 DOCTOR
                        They have great results. With the 
                        right program you could be back out 
                        there in as little as six months. 

           INT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Mickey is exiting when he spots Dugout Dave getting out of 
           his car with some help from what looks like his son. Mickey 
           looks on, confused.
           INT. DAVE’S DINER - LATER

           Mickey looks at a cheeseburger pensively. Dave notices as 
           he’s wiping down the counter--

                                 DAVE
                        Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. You’re 
                        thinking too hard. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m having fun coaching these kids. 
                        I just...I gotta make some money 
                        soon. 

                                 DAVE
                        You’ll figure something out. You 
                        always do. 

                                 MICKEY
                        If I can’t play, I’m not sure what 
                        else there is. All of my friends 
                        went straight into the job 
                        market...I’m so behind. All I have 
                        on my resume is baseball player. 

                                 DAVE
                        There are worse things in life than 
                        having something on your resume 
                        that you truly loved doing. Some 
                        people live their whole lives 
                        without that. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I just gotta catch a break. 

                                 DAVE
                        Breaks happen when you work hard. 
                        Stay focused, you’ll be alright. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What were you doing at the doctor’s 
                        office the other day? 

                                 DAVE
                        Just a routine check-up. Making 
                        sure the old gears are still 
                        working. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I never thanked you, by the way. 

                                 DAVE
                        For what? 
                                 MICKEY
                        Y’know...Everything. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hey, ballplayer or Little League 
                        coach, you know I’m here for you. 

           Off Mickey’s smile...

                                 BRIAN (PRE-LAP V.O.)
                        And here come the Bandits! Trying 
                        to make a playoff push late in the 
                        season. 

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

           The Bandits take the field. Mackenzie jogs out to the 
           pitcher’s mound when then OPPOSING COACH, 40’s, comes and 
           says something to the UMPIRE.

                                 UMPIRE
                        Bandits coach! 

           The Ump waves Mickey out--

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s up? 

                                 UMPIRE
                        She’s at her pitch limit for the 
                        week. She needs seven days rest. 

                                 MICKEY
                        She’s had seven days. 

                                 UMPIRE
                        It’s only been six. 

           Mickey looks out onto the field and exhales...

           BEGIN SEQUENCE

           Different Bandits try their arm at pitching.

           -Betsy is on the mound throwing WILDLY. Tremendous speed that 
           frightens every batter as it nearly lops their heads off.

           -Matty pitches, getting irate as balls are called. He takes 
           his hat off, STOMPS ON IT, and is carried off the mound, 
           kicking and screaming, by Pickles.

           -Janette waves to Mickey from right field, pleading to pitch 
           without much success.
           -The Bandits get CRUSHED. 13-2.

           END SEQUENCE

           INT. DUGOUT - POST GAME

           Mickey looks over his distraught team.

                                 MATTY
                        We suck! 

                                 MICKEY
                        You don’t suck. All this shows us 
                        is that we can’t rely on Mackenzie 
                        too much. 

                                 JANETTE
                        I’ve been wanting to pitch all 
                        season! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Janette, you’ll have your chance, I 
                        promise. 

                                 BETSY
                        At this rate, we’ll never make 
                        playoffs. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Didn’t you at least have fun today? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        It’s hard to have fun when you’re 
                        getting whooped. 

           Off Mickey, concerned, we...

                                              SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. CARNIVAL - EVENING

           CU’S OF the Bandits, smiling ear-to-ear as they ride a ROLLER 
           COASTER. As they BLAST past camera we catch:

                                 MACKENZIE
                        AHHHH! 

                                 TEDDY
                        I’m gunna spew! 

                                 MATTY
                        Prove it! 
           Ventura Boulevard has been shutdown for an old school 
           carnival. Ferris wheel, bumper cars, and kids strung out on 
           all the fried crap they can get their hands on. Mickey and 
           Tanner walk past the GAME AREA sharing a funnel cake-

                                 MICKEY
                        My dad wouldn’t let me play sports 
                        like golf or tennis because he 
                        didn’t want it to ruin my swing. 

                                 TANNER
                        Are you mad at him for it? 

                                 MICKEY
                        No way. He gave me a shot. 

                                 TANNER
                        What does he think now? 

           BEAT.

                                 MICKEY
                        He passed away when I was in high 
                        school. 

                                 TANNER
                        Oh...that sucks. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah. 

                                 TANNER
                        Sorry, was that insensitive? 

                                 MICKEY
                        No, not at all. Everyone always 
                        says, "I’m so sorry." Like it’s 
                        their fault...or "What a hard time 
                        that must’ve been." But, you nailed 
                        it on the head...it...sucks. 

                                 TANNER
                        Do you think you’ll play again? 

                                 MICKEY
                        I have to. Towards the end there, 
                        my heart wasn’t in the right place. 
                        I didn’t care when I could 
                        play...now that I can’t, all I want 
                        to do is get back out there and 
                        show people what I can do. 
           She shoots him a smile, endeared.

                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. BUMPER CARS - CONTINUOUS

           CRASH! BAM! THWACK!

           The Bandits are in an all-out war against the Giants in the 
           BUMPER CARS. They’re ramming into each other left and right. 
           Pickles and Teddy are in a car together, each holding COTTON 
           CANDY, scared for their lives. Every time Pickles goes to 
           take a bite the car gets SLAMMED.

                                 PICKLES
                        This is my nightmare! 

                                 TEDDY
                        This is bad for my digestion! 

           Matty and Mackenzie occupy another car, getting nailed from 
           every direction.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey holds a SLEDGE HAMMER at the STRONGMAN game.

                                 TANNER
                        I’ve been helping out with the 
                        basketball team at school...who 
                        knows, maybe I’ll coach in the NBA. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You mean WNBA? 

           Mickey DRIVES the hammer down, hitting the block, the ball 
           shoots up but fails to ring the bell.

                                 TANNER
                        No, I mean the NBA. 

           Tanner takes the hammer from him.

                                 MICKEY
                        Are you admitting men’s sports are 
                        better? 

                                 TANNER
                        They just pay better. 
           She DRIVES the hammer down, SLAMS the block, and RINGS the 
           bell. She shoots Mickey a smile, he’s impressed...and a 
           little scared.

                                 CARNEY
                        We have a winner! 

           The Carney goes to hand the prize to Mickey, thinking he won, 
           Tanner SNATCHES it.

           EXT. BUMPER CARS - CONTINUOUS

           The bumper war continues. Pickles notices the Giants remove 
           CARTONS OF EGGS from their jackets.

                                 PICKLES
                        Oh no. They’re strapped. 

           EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey and Tanner head towards the bumper cars...

                                 TANNER
                        Not a lot of guys our age would 
                        give up their precious time to 
                        volunteer with a bunch of kids. 
                        What gives, huh? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah. Well, the thing is, I-- 

           Tanner reaches for his hand. He stops talking and smiles.

           EXT. BUMPER CARS - CONTINUOUS

           The Bandits are getting PELTED WITH EGGS from every 
           direction. The RIDE OPERATOR, 30’s, tries to intervene, he 
           gets nailed with an egg and SLIPS in the middle of the rink.

           An egg is HURLED towards Matty’s face, Mackenzie CATCHES it. 
           She throws it back, nailing the assailant.

                                 MATTY
                        Give me your scarf. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        What are you gunna do? 

           Matty reaches down and pushes a button on his sneakers, 
           WHEELS pop out. Mackenzie hands him her scarf.
                                 PICKLES
                        Stop wasting perfectly good eggs! 

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll protect you, captain! 

           Teddy shields Pickles as eggs are slung their way. Teddy gets 
           lit up.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey and Tanner near the bumper cars--

                                 TANNER
                        Most guys are just so obsessed with 
                        themselves and their jobs...they 
                        forget about other people. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, I guess I kind of just... 

           His EYES LIGHT UP--

           ANGLE ON: The BUMPER CARS, Matty is tethered to the bumper 
           car with the scarf, rolling around on his Heely’s as if water 
           skiing.

           Mackenzie drives, ferociously WHIPPING him around, he’s 
           speeding towards the head Giant, he JUMPS over the Ride 
           Operator that’s on the ground and LEAPS into the car, 
           tackling the Giant. Mickey RUNS up and YANKS ON THE LEVER.

           SFX: A SCREEEEECHING HALT

           Passersby turn to the source of the noise. Matty and the 
           Giant go wrestling to the ground.

           Teddy is laying across the car on his back, COVERED IN EGG. 
           Pickles pops up from inside the car, he looks down at Teddy--

                                 TEDDY
                        If I don’t make it, tell my family 
                        I loved one thing and one thing 
                        only...various numbers generated by 
                        different things baseball players 
                        do on the field... 

           Teddy exhales dramatically and falls back. Pickles surveys 
           his clothes--

                                 PICKLES
                        I didn’t get hit...I didn’t get 
                        hit! 
           WHACK! An errant egg nails him in the face.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        I’m hit. 

           Pickles collapses on top of Teddy. Mickey sees STEVE 
           approaching the scene.

                                 MICKEY
                        Bandits! Come with me, NOW! 

           The team runs towards him, he leads them to the GAME AREA. 
           Steve runs over to the bumper cars, sees the mess and the 
           Giants recuperating--

                                 STEVE
                        WHO DID THIS? 

                                 GIANTS 1
                        Who do you think? 

           Off Steve...

           EXT. GAME AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Steve searches for the Bandits, he passes THE DUNK TANK...

           -Where Teddy sits incognito wearing a SNORKELING MASK, he 
           SPLASHES into the water where we find Matty and Mackenzie at 
           the bottom of the tank.

           -Steve runs past a WALL OF STUFFED ANIMALS...TWO OF THE BEARS 
           REMOVE THEIR HEADS, it’s Mel and Belle. The game operator 
           turns, it’s Pickles.

           -We catch Scotch bartering with the PENNY CANDY GUY, standing 
           next to barrels full of candy--

                                 SCOTCH
                        I’m willing to pay extra if you 
                        drop me in the barrel and let me 
                        eat my way out. 

           -Steve passes the HORSE RACES, the commentator has a TOP HAT 
           on, his back is turned--

                                 COMMENTATOR
                        Number six making a break for the 
                        finish line...is this, wait, can it 
                        be? YES! HORSE NUMBER 3 COMING UP 
                        FROM BEHIND AND IT’S NUMBER THREE 
                        FOR THE WIN! 
           Steve passes, the commentator turns, it’s Teddy. He takes off 
           his hat, wipes his brow. Two people playing the game spin 
           their chairs around, it’s Mickey and Tanner.

                                 MICKEY
                        Fun date, huh? 

           Tanner SPRAYS HIM WITH WATER from her pistol. Mackenzie and 
           Matty run over, dripping wet--

                                 MACKENZIE
                        You gotta come see this. 

           EXT. CLOWN GAME - MOMENTS LATER

           The team watches in awe as a Cody THROWS HEATERS at the clown 
           faces. Knocking them down one-by-one.

                                 MICKEY
                        You ever play in a league, Cody? 

           She answers by hitting another one, it BURSTS INTO PIECES.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        How’d you like to join our team? 

                                 CODY
                        Can’t. 

           BAM! BAM! She hits two in a row. THE CARNEY hands her a GIANT 
           STUFFED ANIMAL and she walks off.

                                 MICKEY
                        Anyone know where she lives? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I heard she lives with her uncle. 

           INT. TAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mickey sits across from Tad.

                                 MICKEY
                        It’s healing well but I can’t 
                        afford the physical therapy. Isn’t 
                        there a client loan program or 
                        something? 

                                 TAD
                        Not these days, unfortunately. 
                                 MICKEY
                        There’s gotta be something... 

                                 TAD
                        Wait! 

           Tad reaches for his phone but grabs a DARTH VADER BOBBLEHEAD 
           and puts it to his ear--

                                 TAD (CONT’D)
                        Jamie! 
                         (realizing)
                        Nope, that’s Darth Vader. 

           He puts it down and grabs his phone.

                                 TAD (CONT’D)
                        Jamie! Get me someone from 
                        marketing. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What are you doing? 

                                 TAD
                        What’s the one thing every 
                        professional athlete does besides 
                        play sports? 

           Off Mickey, confused--

           EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY

           Mickey wears a full BASEBALL UNIFORM HOLDING A BAT and looks 
           into the camera as he walks past rows of used Hondas. He 
           looks directly into camera-

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m Mickey Stanley, and if there’s 
                        one thing I learned pitching in the 
                        minors it’s that you know a home 
                        run when you see it. Down here at 
                        West Covina Autos, we’re slashing 
                        prices left and right. For any 
                        buyer, that’s... 
                         (swings the bat)
                        A home run. 

           O.C. CUT! Tad approaches--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Used cars? Come on! What about Nike 
                        or Adidas... 
                                 TAD
                        Mickey, as you said, you’re a minor 
                        leaguer no one has heard of. We 
                        were lucky to get this. There are 
                        harder ways to make two thousand 
                        bucks.

                                 MICKEY
                        I just feel like I’m selling out a 
                        little here. 

                                 TAD
                        It’s not selling out, it’s buying 
                        in, Mickey. It’s buying in.

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - LATER

           Mickey approaches an old trailer with a gaggle of lawn 
           flamingos in the front. He approaches the door.

           KNOCK KNOCK. Nothing. KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        HOLD YOUR DARN SELF! 

           He’s startled as the door SWINGS OPEN and we find TOM, 50’s, 
           a BIG BURLY MAN--

                                 TOM
                        What? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Hi, sir, my name is Mickey Stanley 
                        and I-- 

                                 TOM
                        What are you selling? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Nothing, I--I wanted to talk to you 
                        about your niece...?

                                 TOM
                        Cody? What’d she do this time? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Nothing, I wanted to talk to you 
                        about her playing baseball...

           Tom looks him up-and-down...
           INT. TRAILER - LATER

           PAN ACROSS vintage photos of ballplayers in the eighties. 
           Among them, Cody’s dad.

                                 TOM
                        My brother was one of the best 
                        relief pitchers you’ve ever seen. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I remember Jack Thomas...I used to 
                        have his baseball card. 

                                 TOM
                        You and every other kid.

           Mickey takes a seat across from Tom--

                                 MICKEY
                        Cody has a great arm. 

                                 TOM
                        She’s her father’s daughter. 

           ANGLE ON: Cody listening from the hallway.

                                 MICKEY
                        I’d love to have her come out and 
                        play for our team. 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t have the time to drive her 
                        back-and-forth to the field. The 
                        practices...games...I need to pick 
                        up every shift I can. 
                        Unfortunately, that leaves little 
                        time for-- 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’ll take care of everything, you 
                        just need to sign off on it. 

                                 TOM
                        You some sort of volunteer?

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah! I’m a coach. I play minor 
                        league ball and I’m injured now so 
                        I figured...y’know, why not.

           Tom looks him up and down.

                                 TOM
                        KID! 
           ANGLE ON: Cody, in the hallway, silent--

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re in that hallway, get 
                        out here. 

           Cody reluctantly takes a step out--

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? 

           Off Cody, smiling...

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - DAY

           Ballplayers from different teams have come out to watch the 
           new addition to the team as a game is underway. The Giants 
           watch, intimidated.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        The Bandits are looking invigorated 
                        here due to some pitching help by 
                        their new player, Cody Thomas. 

           Cody is on the mound, striking guys out left and right.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        If she can put this last batter to 
                        bed, playoffs might not be ruled 
                        out for the boys in black. 

           Betsy calls time and looks up at Brian in the announcer’s box-

                                 BETSY
                        GIRLS! 

                                 BRIAN
                        Correction, girls. 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Talk about a gross factual error... 

           WE PULL OUT to reveal Teddy, standing behind him-

                                 BRIAN
                        Shouldn’t you be out in the field? 

                                 TEDDY
                        I’m sitting this inning out. Plus, 
                        game over. 

           Brian looks down, the last strike has been thrown, Bandits 
           win! Teddy grabs the mic--
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        And here come the Bandits! 

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           -The Bandits go on a tear, mounting a WINNING STREAK. The 
           STANDINGS are adjusted, the Bandits slowly climbing into 
           contention.

           -The Giants are holding down the first place position.

           -Mackenzie and Cody pitch back-to-back, nearly untouchable.

           -Janette is bored in the outfield as opposing teams can’t get 
           a hit.

           -The Giants grow worrisome.

           -The Bandits land a spot in the PLAYOFFS.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - DAY

           Brian and Scotch watch the game, invested.

                                 BRIAN
                        The Bandits are in a win-or-go-home 
                        situation here in the bottom of the 
                        6th as they duke it out with the 
                        Astros to advance to the semis. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        I tell ya, Frank, this reminds me 
                        of my first day at school. I was 
                        nervous, intimidated, and extremely 
                        farty, but I knew I could overcome 
                        my brain and my butt. 

           The crowd LAUGHS, we overhear, "He’s so cute and weird!"

                                 BRIAN
                        Again, my name is Brian. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Semantics! 

           EXT. FIELD - LATER

           CU ON: The scoreboard, the game is tied, bottom of the 6th.

           The Bandits are up to bat.
           ANGLE ON: Teddy, in the dugout, enamored by the action, 
           speaking into the small end of a baseball bat--

                                 TEDDY
                        Bottom of the 6th, last chance for 
                        the Bandits to clinch a spot in the 
                        playoffs. The Cinderella kids are- 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Teddy... 

                                 TEDDY
                        -refusing to go down without a 
                        fight...it’s come down to one 
                        batter, one batter looking-- 

                                 CODY
                        Teddy... 

                                 TEDDY
                        for a walk-off hit to win this 
                        thing for the Band- 

                                 WHOLE TEAM
                        TEDDY!! 

           He stops and looks, the whole team is staring at him.

                                 TEDDY
                        What?

                        You’re up! 

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh...no. 

           Teddy looks out on the field, sees everyone waiting. He 
           clocks Mel on third base, waiting for someone to drive her 
           home. Teddy timidly grabs a helmet and bat and approaches the 
           batter’s box.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                         (to Ump)
                        How’s it goin’? 
                         (to catcher)
                        Beautiful day for a ball game.... 

                                 CATCHER
                        Get in the box, dingus. 

           Mickey gives him a sign, Teddy nods and steps up to bat.
                                 MICKEY
                        You got this Ted, base hit! 

           Teddy is suddenly confused and puts his hand up to the Ump.

                                 UMPIRE
                        TIME! 

           He approaches Mickey--

                                 TEDDY
                         (whisper)
                        You gave me the sign for a bunt, 
                        right? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yes. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Then why’d you just tell me to get 
                        a base hit? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Trying to throw off the other team, 
                        Teddy... 

                                 TEDDY
                        OH! Man, gotta love baseball. 
                        That’s why they call it the 
                        thinking man’s sport! 
                        Person...thinking person’s sport?

                                 MICKEY
                        Get in the batter’s box, Teddy. 

           Teddy walks back. The pitcher throws, Mel DARTS down the base 
           path, Teddy lays down a perfect bunt, the pitcher fields it 
           and throws it to the catcher but SAFE! Bandits win!

           The team spills onto the field, lifting Mel and Teddy up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hava...nagila hava nagila..hava... 
                        Everybody! 

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And the Bandits are headed to the 
                        semifinals! 

           INT. TAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tad sits, feet up on his desk.
                                 TAD
                        It’s all happening. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 TAD
                        ESPN. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Huh? 

                                 TAD
                        They’re doing profiles on Tommy 
                        John Surgery. Mickey "Ace" Stanley 
                        former pitcher for the Lubbock Aces 
                        is going to be interviewed. Looks 
                        like that injury finally paid off! 

                                 MICKEY
                        No way. ESPN? Really?

                                 TAD
                        I had to call in a lot of favors. I 
                        also reached out to a few sponsors. 
                        Our friends at West Covina Autos 
                        are willing to pay you five-hundred 
                        bucks to wear their gear during 
                        your interview. Combine that with 
                        the commercial...that’s more than 
                        enough for the fancy physical 
                        therapy. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Tad, that’s amazing! You’re the 
                        man! 

                                 TAD
                        I’m the man! Shoots next Saturday. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Wait, Saturday? I can’t, we have a 
                        playoff game... 

                                 TAD
                        It’s ESPN. You can do anything for 
                        ESPN. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I can’t just bail on the kids... 

                                 TAD
                        Mickey! This is the opportunity 
                        we’ve been waiting for. It’s ESPN!

                        It’s the big time! You know the 
                        last time a minor leaguer who 
                        wasn’t playing had a feature on 
                        ESPN? 

                                 MICKEY
                        No... 

                                 TAD
                        Me neither! Cuz it never happens! 

           Tad digs into his drawer and pulls out a HAT AND T-SHIRT from 
           West Covina Autos, Mickey looks at them.

                                 MICKEY
                        Kinda ugly. 

                                 TAD
                        No one said making money was 
                        pretty. 

           Off Mickey, conflicted...

           EXT. JONES’S FRONT YARD - EVENING

           Mickey watches as Mackenzie pitches to Tanner. She throws a 
           CURVEBALL.

                                 MICKEY
                        What was that? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Curveball. 

                                 MICKEY
                        None of that. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        If we’re going to make a run for 
                        the championship I’m going to need 
                        to mix it up a little. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Leave it up to me to decide when to 
                        mix it up. Lay off those, I’m not 
                        kidding. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Fine. I’m getting some dessert, or 
                        are you the master of my diet as 
                        well? 
                                 MICKEY
                        Ha. Ha. 

           He tousles her hair as she enters the house.

           INT. JONES’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff and Nancy dry dishes as they watch Mickey and Tanner 
           through the kitchen window.

                                 NANCY
                        Kind of reminds me of us when we 
                        first fell in love. Cute...young... 
                        skinny. 

                                 JEFF
                        You’re skinny. 

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not talking about me. 

           She pats his belly.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey! 
                         (then)
                        She is not in love with that boy. 

                                 NANCY
                        Looks like it to me. 

           Jeff looks--they’re ABOUT TO KISS. He BANGS on the window, 
           breaking it up. Mickey is TERRIFIED.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, he’s sweet. 

                                 JEFF
                        What’s so sweet about a guy like 
                        that with our little girl? 

                                 NANCY
                        She’s not little anymore. And how 
                        many other boys do you know his age 
                        that volunteer at a Little League? 

                                 JEFF
                        Volunteer? Hun, he’s doing it for 
                        his image. He has a bad rep in the 
                        minors, he’s just trying to save 
                        some face.

                        Trust me, when it comes down to it, 
                        he doesn’t care about those kids, 
                        he just cares about himself. 

           ANGLE ON: Mackenzie, listening from the hallway.

           EXT. MAJOR FIELD - DAY

           The game is about to be underway. Both teams are waiting. 
           Pickles eyes the parking lot, waiting for Mickey. The UMP 
           approaches--

                                 UMP
                        We gotta get this game going, 
                        where’s Coach Stanley? 

                                 PICKLES
                        I’ll try him again. 

           Pickles pulls out his phone--

                        I can’t make it. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Everything okay? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, it’s fine, just tell them my 
                        car broke down. I’ll explain later. 
                        You can handle this. 

           Mickey hangs up, guilt ridden.

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Mackenzie looks at Pickles--

                                 MACKENZIE
                        What’s the deal? 
                                 PICKLES
                        His car broke down. 

                                 MEL AND BELLE
                        Uber, heard of it? 

                                 PICKLES
                        We’ll have to start the game 
                        without him. 

           Off Mackenzie, skeptical...

                        It’s not easy...you think for a 
                        second you might not ever throw a 
                        baseball again...

                        One out in the bottom of the sixth. 
                        The Bandits need some runs here to 
                        advance to the championship game 
                        against the Giants who punched 
                        their ticket earlier today. 

           Pickles coaches from third base, anxious. Tanner coaches from 
           first as the Bandits try to knock in a few runs.

           BEGIN SEQUENCE

           -Janette doubles down the left field line.

           -Matty is up to bat, he BUNTS, sending Janette to third. He’s 
           safe on first.

           -Teddy is in the dugout when his iPHONE gets a GOOGLE ALERT. 
           He pulls it out of his bag. 
           Teddy taps on a link that says MICKEY STANLEY ESPN INTERVIEW. 
           He waves Mackenzie over to watch.

           -Cody is up to bat.

           -Teddy and Mackenzie watch the LIVE INTERVIEW OF MICKEY ON 
           ESPN, confused. They call the rest of the team over to watch.

                                 ANCHOR
                        And I hear you’re coaching Little 
                        League in your off time?

                                 MICKEY
                        Ha, yeah. It’s been really fun 
                        getting back to my roots. Spending 
                        time with those kids...they’ve 
                        taught me a lot.

           The kids look on, confused.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Liar.

           -Cody drives one up the middle, the short stop makes a DIVING

                        They’re headed for the 
                        championship! 

           Pickles cheers but notices his team in the dugout isn’t even 
           paying attention. He approaches and looks at the phone, 
           confused...

                                 MACKENZIE
                        My dad was right. He just cares 
                        about himself... 

           Off Pickles, torn...

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - THE NEXT MORNING

           Mickey walks onto the field for practice. Nobody is there. He 
           looks at his watch.

           Time passes. He pulls out his phone and calls Pickles, no 
           answer. Calls Tanner, no answer. Calls Mackenzie, no answer. 
           Off Mickey, worried...
           EXT. TANNER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mickey gets out of his car and heads for the door. Tanner 
           exits with a backpack slung over her shoulder--

                                 MICKEY
                        Hey-- 

                                 TANNER
                        ESPN, congrats... 

                                 MICKEY
                        Tanner, listen-- 

                                 TANNER
                        You let them down. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Who cares?! We won! Everybody wins. 

                                 TANNER
                        It’s not about that! They look up 
                        to you and you bailed on them. 
                        Worse, you lied to them. 

           She walks to her car--

                                 MICKEY
                        My career was on the line. What was 
                        I supposed to do? 

           She gets in her car--

                                 TANNER
                        I don’t know, maybe not be a 
                        selfish ass-- 

           She slams the door, cutting herself off. He watches her take 
           off. He looks at the house, sees Mackenzie watching through 
           the window. He waves, she walks off, upset.

           EXT. MICKEY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mickey gets out of his car and approaches the front door 
           where he see’s his mom, crying, holding the phone. Off 
           Mickey...

           EXT. FOREST LAWN CEMETERY - MORNING

           WE START ON A PICTURE OF DAVE.
           PAN ACROSS attendees, in all black, huddled around the 
           casket. Little Leaguers of all shapes and sizes take turns 
           placing hats on the casket. Mickey is beside himself. He 
           looks at the picture of Dave...

                                 DAVE’S VOICE
                         (in Mickey’s head)
                        Trust your gut. 

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - THAT NIGHT

           Mickey is in the batting cage, taking swings as a machine 
           pitches. He’s still in his suit. With each pitch he swings 
           harder and harder, angry. He takes a BIG CUT-

                                 MICKEY
                        OW! 

           He holds his arm...

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        That was stupid. 

           He leans back up against the fence, slides down until he’s 
           sitting in the dirt. He looks over at the rotting sign at the 
           entrance of the field. His eyes continue over to Dave’s 
           Diner, the lights suddenly flicker off.

           INT. BIG 5 SPORTING GOODS - LATER

           Mickey finds Pickles organizing hiking equipment.

                                 MICKEY
                        Pickles-- 

                                 PICKLES
                        Only my friends call my Pickles. 

           In the b.g. we see Bope, holding a feather duster, he 
           approaches the ROCK CLIMBING WALL.

                                 MICKEY
                        Benjamin Zachary Schwartz, can I 
                        explain? 

                                 PICKLES
                        If there’s one thing I’ve learned 
                        working at a sporting goods store, 
                        it’s that being honest is always 
                        better than doing something wrong 
                        and hoping no one finds out. 
                                 MICKEY
                        How has working at a sporting goods 
                        store taught you that? 

                                 PICKLES
                        Do you know how many people try to 
                        return stuff they’ve used?! They 
                        don’t think I’m gunna take a whiff 
                        of the armpit of a running shirt, 
                        but I’ll do it, I’ve done it, 
                        Mickey! 

                                 MICKEY
                        We won! We’re getting to play in 
                        the championship, nobody was-- 

                                 PICKLES
                        We’re getting to play in the 
                        championship, not you. And it’s not 
                        always about winning, Mickey. It’s 
                        about showing up for your team. You 
                        taught me that. 

           ANGLE ON: Bope as he rigs the rock climbing harness so he’s 
           counterbalanced by a few medicine balls. He starts to climb 
           the wall and meticulously dust the hard-to-reach spots.

                                 MICKEY
                        I didn’t think it was a big deal. 

                                 PICKLES
                        It is a big deal. You were on TV, 
                        that’s a big deal! They would’ve 
                        thought it was cool to have their 
                        coach on TV, they would have 
                        understood. I just don’t know why 
                        you lied about it. It’s insulting. 

           In the b.g. Bope seems stuck halfway up the wall. He’s trying 
           to propel himself higher by yanking on his harness.

                                 MICKEY
                        I need your help, I need to fix 
                        things with the team. 

                                 PICKLES
                        You’re on your own on this one. 

           Pickles walks off. Mickey watches Bope as he furiously YANKS 
           on his harness, the medicine balls come loose and Bope goes 
           CRASHING to the floor in a cloud of dust.
                                 BOPE
                        I’m alright! 
                         (BEAT)
                        I think my legs broke my fall. 

           Mickey shakes his head and walks off. Bope tries to stand and 
           falls on his face.

           EXT. MICKEY’S FRONT YARD - MORNING

           He gets the mail, opens a letter addressed to him, it’s the 
           CHECK from West Covina Autos. 

           INT. SPORTS AGENCY - TAD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tad sits on his Bluetooth headset, clutching a football-

                        Dak is great, sure. But we’re 
                        talking about the GOAT here. Come 
                        on. It’s a fair trade. Dad’s team 
                        smoked me last week.

           Mickey enters-

                                 TAD (CONT’D)
                        Mom, I gotta go.

                        Mickey. Take a seat. Great news-- 

           Mickey sits, Tad drops a stack of envelopes in front of him-

                                 MICKEY
                        There’s something I need to take 
                        care of. I might not be ready by 
                        next season. 

                                 TAD
                        What? Why not? 

                                 MICKEY
                        I need to use the money for 
                        something else. 

                                 TAD
                        Mickey, I’m doing everything I can 
                        on my end-- 
                                 MICKEY
                        I’ll think of something...just hang 
                        with me. 

           EXT. BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE - DAY

           Mickey stands in front of the OLD WELCOME SIGN with a shovel 
           in his hand. He takes one last look at the sign and DRIVES 
           the shovel into the ground.

           EXT. BALBOA LITTLE LEAGUE - LATER

           A delivery truck is pulling up with SOMETHING ON THE TRUCK 
           BED, covered in a tarp. The DELIVERY GUY takes it off the bed 
           and places it where the old sign was. Mickey signs a form.

           He looks up at the covered object and YANKS the tarp off, 
           it’s a BRONZE STATUE OF DAVE. A spatula in one hand, his hat 
           in the other, tipping it to people as they enter the park.

           CU ON A PLAQUE: In Loving Memory of Dugout Dave, "Trust your

                        My girls are real pissed at you. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I know.

           Mickey sits deflated on the couch, watching TV in the dark. 
           Debra enters-

                                 DEBRA
                        Isn’t your big game today? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Not my game anymore. 

           A KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR. Debra looks out the window, 
           smiles.

                                 DEBRA
                        It’s for you. 

           She walks into the other room. Mickey begrudgingly gets up 
           and answers the door, it’s Pickles.

                                 PICKLES
                        Well, this place looks...terrible. 
                        You look...chubby. And your hair is 
                        ridiculous. 

           Mickey shoots him a look.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, that last part wasn’t true. 
                        Your hair actually looks really 
                        good today. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Thanks. 

           Mickey collapses back onto the couch. Pickles spots a framed 
           photo of their Little League team sitting on the mantle.

                                 PICKLES

                        might have grown up to invent some 
                        cool Japanese cars but you know

                        That was truly revolutionary when 
                        you did that.

                        They probably recalled those 
                        Japanese cars anyway. And you know 
                        what? You can’t recall a fart. 
                        Trust me, I’ve tried. Point is, 
                        they didn’t enjoy themselves, they 
                        didn’t goof around. And you know 
                        what? They were better. That’s why 
                        they beat us. They were a better

                        curveball. One. Lousy. Curveball. 

                                 PICKLES
                        You could also say they beat us 
                        because I got picked off the inning 
                        before or because Jackson hit into 
                        a double play with a man on 
                        third... 

                                 MICKEY
                        I let the kids down. 

                                 PICKLES
                        They’re just kids, man! They don’t 
                        understand the things us adults go 
                        through everyday. How old is this?

           Pickles grabs a slice of pizza from an open box--
                                 MICKEY
                        You were right. I should have been 
                        honest with them. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Hey, you didn’t quit after we lost 
                        that big game. You dusted yourself 
                        off and you kept playing baseball. 
                        That’s what life’s about, getting a 
                        little chin music and being ready 
                        for the next pitch. And that’s what 
                        you’ve taught those kids. Nobody 
                        ever gave them a chance until you 
                        came along. 

                                 MICKEY
                        It was all Dave. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Because he knew you were the right 
                        guy. He knew you could show them 
                        how to really love the game. Nobody 
                        expected us to be in this position. 
                        No one thought these kids were 
                        worth a damn. But the beauty of 
                        baseball is that- 

           Pickles walks to the curtains--

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        -not every hit is a home run. 

           Pickles YANKS the curtains open, LIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM...

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        But that doesn’t mean you can’t 
                        steal home. 

           Mickey adjusts his eyes to find Tanner and the Bandits on the 
           front lawn, suited up and ready to play.

                                 MICKEY
                        That was it. 

                                 PICKLES
                        Huh? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Your big speech, that was it. 

           Pickles realizes.

                                 PICKLES
                        Oh, crap! And I wasted it on you?! 
           Mickey walks outside...

           EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           He approaches Tanner and the team.

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 TANNER
                        We know. 

           The Bandits watch as Mickey goes in for a kiss, Tanner puts a 
           finger on his lips--

                                 TANNER (CONT’D)
                        Go win a championship first. 

           The Bandits "ooooh! " and "aaaahh!"

           Off Mickey’s smile we...

                                                     SMASH TO:

           The Bandits enter the ballpark, tipping their hats to the 
           statue of Dave as they enter.

                                 BRIAN
                        And it looks like it will be a 
                        David vs. Goliath match-up as the 
                        Bandits take on the Giants in the 
                        championship game! 

                                 SCOTCH
                        You got that right, Ottoman, and 
                        what a match-up it will be. 

           Brian covers the mic and looks at Scotch--

                                 BRIAN
                        I’m a human man and my name is 
                        Brian, I am not a piece of 
                        furniture! 

                                 SCOTCH
                        You’re not a piece of furniture and 
                        I’d love a piece of cake!

                        Just another beautiful day at the 
                        ballpark. 

           ON THE FIELD...

           The UMPIRE, 40’s, approaches Mickey as the teams stretch 
           before the game. He says something but we can’t hear the 
           exchange. Off Mickey, concerned we...

           INT. BALBOA CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff and Steve are looking over a map of the way the town is 
           divided. Mickey enters--

                                 MICKEY
                        You wanted to see me, Steve? 

                                 JEFF
                        The trailer community is here...but 
                        Oxnard is the cut off, one block 
                        north of where she lives. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 JEFF
                        Cody Thomas is ineligible to play. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 STEVE
                        She lives outside of the district. 
                        She’s not supposed to be playing in 
                        our league, she should be playing 
                        at Oak Park. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I had no idea. 
                         (realizing)
                        This was you, Jeff? 

                                 JEFF
                        I just want everyone to have a fair 
                        chance. 

                                 MICKEY
                        This isn’t fair to my team, and 
                        this definitely isn’t fair to Cody. 
                        They’re kids, it’s my fault, don’t 
                        punish them because I messed up. 
                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry, Mickey. 

                                 MICKEY
                        She can’t play because she’s one 
                        block outside the district? Are you 
                        kidding? This is ridiculous!

                                 MICKEY
                        All this does is show me how scared 
                        you actually are. 

                                 JEFF
                        You think I’m scared? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Of being beat by a bunch of girls? 
                        You bet your butt I do. 

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll bet your arm I’m not. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What?

                        You beat me, I’ll pay for that 
                        fancy physical therapy. I beat you, 
                        you call it off with Tanner. 

           Off Mickey, confused...

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey pulls Tanner aside as the teams warm-up. She’s deep in 
           thought, until...

                                 TANNER
                        HA! Do it! Take the bet! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Are you kidding? 

                                 TANNER
                        If we win, he pays up...if we lose, 
                        what, we have to pretend we’re not 
                        dating? 

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m not going to lie to your dad... 
                                 TANNER
                        You’re also not going to lose. 

                                 MICKEY
                        We might without Cody. 

           Tanner SLAPS Mickey.

                                 TANNER
                        Get your head in the game! We’re 
                        going to win and he’s going to pay 
                        to get your butt back on that 
                        field! 

                                 MICKEY
                        Fiesty. 

                                 TANNER
                        Damn right I am. Now snap out of it 
                        and win this ballgame. 

           Mickey can’t help but to smile.

                                 MICKEY
                        Sometimes I think you only like me 
                        for my tremendous coaching ability.

                                 TANNER
                        It’s mainly just your hair...

           Off his smile--

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - DAY

           The team is huddled around Mickey on the first base line.

                                 CODY
                        So...I’m benched? 

           Mickey kneels next to her-

                                 MICKEY
                        You can’t play, but if it’s alright 
                        with you, I’d love to have you help 
                        coach. There aren’t any rules 
                        against that. 

           She nods silently.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Mackenzie, we just need to be smart

                        we have a solid shot. Throw strikes 
                        and trust your defense.

                        And the stage has been set. The 
                        whole league has come out to watch 
                        this showdown... 

           INT. DUGOUT - LATER

           Pickles paces across the dugout. The team looks at him with 
           great anticipation as he gears up for a speech, he takes a 
           deep breath...

                                 PICKLES
                        Nope, I got nothin’. I friggin’ 
                        lost it! 

           Off the team, nodding.

                                 MICKEY
                        Three months ago I didn’t plan on 
                        being here. But I wouldn’t want to 
                        be anywhere else right now. So go 
                        out there and play your hearts out. 
                        Don’t do it for me, do it for 
                        yourselves. And do it for Dave, 
                        because without him, we wouldn’t be 
                        here right now. Bandits on three. 

           They put their hands in--

                        I’d like to say this will be an 
                        even match-up, but the Bandits are 
                        going to have a tough time without 
                        one of their best players, Cody 
                        Thomas, who turned out to be

                                 SCOTCH
                        Classic. 

           WE PAN ACROSS: The faces of the Giants as they take a knee 
           along the third base line, watching the Bandits warm-up.

           Mickey and Jeff greet each other at home plate.

                                 JEFF
                        As much as I love my daughters, 
                        I’ve never had the guts to tell 
                        them baseball is a man’s sport. 

           A BALL ZOOMS PAST JEFF’S FACE. He jumps back.

           ANGLE ON: Mackenzie, on the mound, pissed.

                                 MICKEY
                        I think she disagrees. 

           INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

                                 SCOTCH
                        Jumble, I gotta tell you, I cannot 
                        wait to see what goes down here 
                        today. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Did you just call me Jumble? That’s 
                        not even a name! 

                                 SCOTCH
                        That’s not a name and I’m not tall 
                        enough to ride the ferris wheel! 
                        Here comes the first pitch! 

           ANGLE ON: The field--
           The Giants batter steps into the box. Mackenzie winds up, 
           throws, and...WHACK! The ball flies out of the park in a 
           hurry.

                                 BRIAN
                        And a HOME RUN on the first pitch! 
                        WOW. What a way to start the game. 

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff shoots Mickey and Tanner a wink from the dugout.

                                 MICKEY
                        Doesn’t he feel bad for her? 

                                 TANNER
                        This is his version of tough love. 

           Mickey gauges Mackenzie’s mood, it didn’t even phase her, 
           she’s locked in, ready for the next batter.

                                 TANNER (CONT’D)
                        If one of them is going to cry at 
                        the end of this game, it ain’t 
                        gunna be her. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Alright, shake it off! 

           Later in the game...

           The Bandits are up to bat, Betsy steps into the batter’s box 
           with Teddy on first and Mackenzie on third.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Remember what we worked on. 

           He gives her and the runners a sign. The pitch comes, Betsy 
           fakes a bunt and Teddy DARTS down to second base, the catcher 
           pops up and FAKES A THROW to second, Mackenzie BOLTS home, 
           falling for the fake throw.

           She’s STUCK IN A PICKLE The catcher and third baseman try to 
           run her down, she guns it towards home and DIVES, knocking 
           the catcher down. There’s a beat. Everyone in the stands gets 
           to their feet, looking on with great anticipation.

           The catcher opens his glove, ball still in there.

                                 UMPIRE
                        OUT! 
           Mackenzie hangs her head. Collects herself and jogs back to 
           the dugout.

                                 MICKEY
                        It’s alright! We’ll get ’em next 
                        time. 

           Later...

           The Giants are up to bat and knock in runs. On the scoreboard 
           we see Mackenzie’s pitch count is nearing the limit.

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - LATER

           ANGLE ON: The scoreboard. Top of the sixth. The Bandits are 
           down by three. Two outs. Mackenzie is up to bat with the 
           bases loaded. She steps into the batter’s box. Jeff calls for 
           time and approaches his pitcher--

                                 JEFF
                        Walk her. 

                                 PITCHER
                        Coach, the bases are loaded... 

                                 JEFF
                        Giving them one run is better than 
                        her knocking them all in. Walk her, 
                        then we’ll get the next batter. Got 
                        it? 

                                 PITCHER
                        Got it. 

           Jeff walks back to the dugout.

                                 MICKEY
                        Base hit here, all we’re thinking 
                        is base hit. 

           The catcher pops out of his crouch, getting ready for an 
           INTENTIONAL WALK. Mickey looks to Jeff--

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be kidding. 

                                 TANNER
                        COME ON, DAD! Really?! 

           From the booth-

                                 SCOTCH
                        What the frick, DAD?! 
           Brian covers Scotch’s mouth.

                                 BRIAN
                        I apologize, it seems as though my 
                        partner here has a vested interest 
                        in this game...plus, he’s seven. 

           Ball 1

           Mackenzie stands there, frustrated.

           Ball 2

           Cody yells out to Mickey--

                                 CODY
                        Have her swing! 

                                 MICKEY
                        What? 

                                 CODY
                        Force them to pitch to her. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I--(then) Good thinking, coach. 

           Cody smiles.

           Mackenzie looks down to Mickey, he calls for time. Mackenzie 
           approaches.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Swing. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        But they’re walking me... 

                                 MICKEY
                        Take control of the situation. You 
                        swing at the next two pitches, get 
                        two strikes on you, force them to 
                        give you one good pitch. That’s all 
                        it takes to change the game. If 
                        they still want to walk you, fine. 
                        But let’s take a chance here. 

           She walks back to the batter’s box. The pitcher throws and 
           she SWINGS. The crowd murmurs, confused.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And it looks like Mackenzie just 
                        swung at the intentional walk... 
           Pitcher throws again...SWING. Strike two.

           The pitcher looks to Jeff, unsure of what to do. Jeff calls 
           time and walks out to his pitcher, the catcher joins them.

                                 JEFF
                        One strike. You up for it? 

                                 PITCHER
                        No problem. 

           Mackenzie approaches Mickey--

                                 MACKENZIE
                        What do we do? 

                                 MICKEY
                        Using your head only gets you so 
                        far. 

           On the mound--

                                 JEFF
                        Fastball down and away. 

           Mickey and Mackenzie--

                                 MICKEY
                        Trust your gut. Let’s show them 
                        what girl’s baseball looks like. 

           The catcher makes his way back to home plate.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And it looks like they will try to 
                        get the out here. 

           Mickey watches Jeff as he makes his way back to the dugout--

                                 MICKEY
                        What do we think? Maybe I’d go 
                        fastball down and away, the old 
                        standby, at least hope she hits it 
                        on the ground... 

           Jeff looks at him, frazzled.

                                 JEFF
                        McConnell! 

           Jeff gives his catcher a sign. The pitcher adjusts the ball 
           in his glove.

           BEGIN SLOW MOTION
           The pitcher winds up, UNLEASHES. The ball flies through the 
           air and DROPS, it’s a CURVEBALL, Mackenzie waits on it and 
           CRACK!

           END SLOW MOTION

           The ball FLIES OUT OF THE PARK. GRAND SLAM! The crowd ERUPTS! 
           Mickey shoots Jeff a smile.

                                 MICKEY
                        That’s one impressive daughter you 
                        have. 

           The Bandits spill onto the field and wait for Mackenzie as 
           she PUMPS HER FIST like Kirk Gibson rounding the bases.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t get too excited, we still 
                        have an at-bat. 

           Later...Off the crowd....

           EXT. FIELD - LAST INNING

           Mackenzie takes the mound.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And Mackenzie Jones will come out 
                        to pitch the final inning. She has 
                        yet to reach her pitch limit. The 
                        Bandits need to maintain their one 
                        run lead to send the Giants 
                        packing. 

           Mackenzie stares the batter down. She winds up and...IT’S A 
           curveball. SWING. Strike 1.

                                 MICKEY
                        Easy there! 

           She throws a FASTBALL. Strike 2. Then ANOTHER curveball. 
           Strike 3. ONE OUT.

           Mickey calls for time and approaches the mound with Pickles. 
           He checks the pitch count on the board--6 LEFT.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        We need to get the next two batters 
                        in 6 pitches, can you do that? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        As long as you let me throw the 
                        curve. 
                                 MICKEY
                        Lay off it, I’m not kidding. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I don’t see what other options we 
                        have. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Get them to put the ball on the 
                        ground, trust your defense. 

           Next batter. SINGLES UP THE MIDDLE. Mackenzie looks to 
           Mickey, nervous.

           Next batter. SINGLES TO RIGHT FIELD, Janette throws the ball 
           in in time to stop the runner from scoring. Runners on first 
           and third. The situation has turned on it’s head in an 
           instant.

           Next batter. Curveball. STRIKE 1. Mickey shoots her a look.

           She throws a fastball and it’s lined to center field. Ally 
           THROWS it in, stopping the runner from scoring. BUT THE BASES 
           ARE LOADED.

           Mackenzie looks around, taking in the situation. Mickey 
           watches her process it and...

           BEGIN FLASHBACK

           The Little League World Series game. 13-year-old Mickey gazes 
           around the field. The bases loaded, the big hitter coming 
           up...A young Pickles looks at him from behind home plate--

                                 PICKLES
                        Mickey...Mickey...MICKEY! 

           Mickey snaps out of it.

           END FLASHBACK

           Mickey shakes it off and looks at Pickles--

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        Call the pitch. 

           Mickey gives the sign. Mackenzie shakes it off. Betsy looks 
           to Mickey, he gives her the same sign. Mackenzie shakes it 
           off again Mickey goes to call time but she has already 
           STARTED HER WIND-UP. She pitches...

           CURVEBALL STRIKE 1. Mickey tries to get her attention, she 
           ignores him.
           FAST BALL STRIKE 2. Mickey tries to call time but it’s too 
           late.

           CURVEBALL STRIKE 3. TWO OUTS!

           The Bandits pump their fists, until they notice Mackenzie 
           HOLDING HER ARM, writhing in pain. MICKEY AND JEFF RUN OUT TO 
           THE PITCHER’S MOUND--

                                 JEFF
                        Great job, having her throw all 
                        those curveballs, are you nuts?! 

                                 MICKEY
                        I told her not to!

                                 MACKENZIE
                         (wincing)
                        It’s not his fault, dad. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Are you okay? 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        It’s my arm. I’m sorry, you were 
                        right. OW! Crap. 

           Matty runs over--

                                 MATTY
                        Where does it hurt?! 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        My arm...I need some ice. 

           Matty reaches down heroically and LIFTS HER UP.

                                 MACKENZIE (CONT’D)
                        I can walk! 

                                 MATTY
                        We’re not taking any chances! 

           He carries her to the dugout.

                                 MATTY (CONT’D)
                        Someone get some ice! 

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And Mackenzie Jones is being 
                        carried off the field! The Bandits 
                        now with the game on the line and 
                        without their star pitcher... 
           Mickey and Pickles look out at their team--

                                 PICKLES
                        What’s the move? They have their 
                        three and four spots coming up... 

           Mickey looks at the scoreboard. All they need is one out. 
           Bases loaded. They’re up by one.

                                 MICKEY
                         (calls out)
                        Everybody in! 

           He waves the whole team in. They huddle around him on the 
           mound, Mickey looks at them, about to speak when--

                                 PICKLES
                        I’m damn proud of you kids. A few 
                        months ago you could barely tie 
                        your cleats. Now you’re all 
                        bonafide ballplayers and you have 
                        your opponents shaking in their 
                        booties. You’re tough, you’re full 
                        of spirit, and most of all...you 
                        care about each other. 

           The team looks at each other, smiling--

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        You’re the best damn group of kids 
                        I’ve ever met. Win or lose, we do 
                        it together. 

           Mickey smiles.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        So together, we’re making this 
                        decision. 
                         (he holds the ball up)
                        Who wants it? 

           The team collectively looks to Janette. She smiles coyly.

                                 PICKLES (CONT’D)
                        You ready, Janette? 

           She’s focused. And dead serious.

                                 JANETTE
                        Call me Trouble. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Hands in. 1-2-3... 
                                 TEAM
                        BANDITS! 

           INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOX - CONTINUOUS

                                 BRIAN
                        And it looks like we’re seeing a 
                        pitching change after Mackenzie 
                        Jones was carried of the field by 
                        that rather small boy... 

                                 MATTY (O.C.)
                        HEY! 

           Brian looks at Matty, shooting him a death stare--

                                 BRIAN
                        I mean... strong man. The Bandits 
                        have decided to go with...number 
                        two, Janette Lewis? Haven’t seen 
                        her pitch all season, I wonder what 
                        the game plan is here. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        It’s times like these, Crinkle, 
                        that take me back to the early days 
                        in my career. 

                                 BRIAN
                        When was that? 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Yesterday. Ahh, I remember it like 
                        it was... 

                                 BRIAN
                        Yesterday? 

                                 SCOTCH
                        An hour ago. 

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey stands with Janette on the mound.

                                 JANETTE
                        What do I do, Coach? 

                                 MICKEY
                        One of the greats once told me that 
                        real closers play with heart and 
                        grit. Let’s see what you got. 
           He puts the ball in her glove.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        But most importantly, just have 
                        fun. 

           He shoots her a wink and heads back to the dugout.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        Lewis needs one out to end this 
                        thing. Doesn’t seem like much, but 
                        it’s a tall order for someone who 
                        hasn’t pitched all season. And here 
                        comes the Giants big man trying to 
                        clear the bases. 

           THUMPING MUSIC matches the footsteps of...

           CU ON: A GIANT KID as he approaches the batter’s box, staring 
           Janette down.

           She narrows her gaze on him, resilient. She pitches and 
           NEARLY HITS HIM IN THE HEAD. He goes flailing to the ground, 
           frazzled, he pops back to his feet and shoots daggers at her.

           ANGLE ON: Mickey and Pickles in the dugout, impressed.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And a little chin music! Looks like 
                        she’s trying to show him who’s 
                        boss. 

           Trouble gets back on the rubber. She winds up and throws, the 
           batter swings with everything he has and CRACK! HE SENDS IT 
           FLYING down the left field line--

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And it’s back...back...headed for 
                        the next zip code! 

           The crowd tracks the ball with great anticipation. Janette 
           watches it fly towards the fence, scared. Mickey watches it 
           go, Pickles covers his eyes...

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And FOUL! Wow. A long strike to 
                        even the count. Talk about an early 
                        Christmas gift. 

                                 SCOTCH
                        Wait, what? It’s Christmas. Holy 
                        crap, IT’S CHRISTMAS?! 

           Scotch freaks out. Brian hangs his head.
           Trouble pitches again, THE BALL NEARLY FREEZES IN THE AIR 
           It’s a killer change-up and the batter is a day ahead of it, 
           throwing him off as he swings at nothing.

                                 UMPIRE
                        STRIKE TWO! 

           Mickey and Pickles high-five in the dugout.

                                 JEFF
                        Time! 

           Jeff walks over to his batter--

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to let this little 
                        girl strike you out? 

                                 GIANT KID
                        No, sir. 

                                 JEFF
                        Your team is depending on you, 
                        don’t let them down. 

           Giant Kid gets back in the box. He stares Janette down. She 
           tilts her head up, we see her eyes appear under the brim of 
           her hat. She stares back at him.

           The crowd is on their feet. Trouble winds up, throws, the 
           batter swings and WHACK! Makes perfect contact. 
           Back...back...back...

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        And this one definitely in fair 
                        territory.... 

           CU’S OF the crowd, players, coaches, as they track the ball 
           on it’s way out of the park...

           Autumn and Ally see it coming towards them in the outfield, 
           both running back, unaware as they run towards each other--

                                 MICKEY
                        SOMEBODY CALL IT! 

                                 ALLY
                        I got it! I got it! I got it! 

                                 AUTUMN
                        I got it! I got it! I GOT IT! 

           Ally stops running as Autumn LEAPS towards the fence, her 
           glove extended, attempting to rob the homer. 
           The ball HITS HER GLOVE and BOUNCES back into play, ALLY 
           LEAPS AND DIVES FOR IT!

           ANGLE ON: The dugouts, the crowd, the base runners...

           ALLY FALLS TO THE GROUND.

           She slowly opens her glove to find...the ball. The Umpire 
           looks on, puts his fist in the air--

                                 UMPIRE
                        OUT! 

           She pops up holding her glove high in the air, RUNNING 
           towards the field, HER WHOLE TEAM BOLTS TOWARDS HER, Mickey, 
           Pickles, and Tanner clear the dugout.

                                 BRIAN
                        SHE CAUGHT IT! SHE CAUGHT IT! A 
                        ROBBED HOME RUN TO END THE GAME! 

           The batter THROWS his helmet on the ground. Jeff hangs his 
           head. HUGE CHEERS from the Bandits crowd.

                                 SCOTCH
                        RUB MY TUMMY AND MAKE A WISH, THE 
                        BANDITS WIN! 

           The crowd rushes the field. Mickey meets Jeff at home plate 
           and reaches his hand out--

                                 JEFF
                        Good job, kid. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You were the guy to beat. 

           People celebrate around them.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        And hey, as fun as it was, you 
                        don’t have to worry about the 
                        bet...I’ll figure something out. 

                                 JEFF
                        Ace, I’m a man of my word. Plus, if 
                        my daughter’s gunna date a 
                        ballplayer, he’s going to be a 
                        working one. 

           Mickey smiles.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        But if you break her heart I’ll 
                        break that arm all over again. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Understood. 

           Jeff tousles his hair. Tanner runs over and kisses Mickey--

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, come on! I’m standing right 
                        here! None of that! 

           Tanner takes off her hat and covers her dad’s face with it.

           INT. ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH - SAME

           Scotch is CRAWLING ALL OVER BRIAN. FREAKING OUT.

                                 SCOTCH
                        They did it, Geoffrey! They did it! 

                                 BRIAN
                        For Pete’s sake my name is BRIAN! 

                                 SCOTCH
                        You got it, Pete! 

           Scotch tackles him to the ground.

           EXT. BALBOA FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           The celebration continues. Jeff walks to meet his wife--

                                 NANCY
                        You gunna be okay? 

           Jeff watches his girls celebrate.

                                 JEFF
                        Better than okay. 

           His face suddenly turns BEET RED when sees Matty run up to 
           Mackenzie and KISS HER!

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I’m gunna rip that boys face off! 

           Jeff RUNS AT HIM and chases him around the field. Debra 
           approaches Mickey--
                                 DEBRA
                        Your dad would be proud. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I know. 

           Pickles watches the celebration, a tear slowly drops from his 
           eye. We PULL OUT to find Betsy, Mel, and Belle watching--

                                 MEL
                        There’s no crying in baseball! 

                                 PICKLES
                        Yes there is! It’s so beautiful! 

           IN THE ANNOUNCER’S BOOTH...

           Teddy takes a seat behind the microphone.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah. This feels right. 

           He plugs his iPhone into the speakers and BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN’S 
           "BADLANDS" bursts in.

           Brian and Scotch are on the field. Brian looks disheveled.

                                 SCOTCH
                        Well, Brian, it’s been great 
                        working with you. 

                                 BRIAN
                        YES! You got it right! Finally, you 
                        got my name right! 

           Brian HUGS Scotch.

                                 SCOTCH
                        You’re weird, but I like you. 
                        Anyhoo, I got some Christmas 
                        shopping to do. See you around, 
                        Barry. 

           Brian’s face falls.

                                 BRIAN
                        I quit. 

           CU ON: Mickey and Tanner, smiling at each other, everyone 
           around them celebrating...
                                 TANNER
                        Looks like you figured out how a 
                        bunch of misfits can win a 
                        ballgame. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I just figured out how to have fun. 

           PULL OUT to an AERIAL SHOT...pulling back further and further 
           as we see everyone on the field. We continue to pull back as 
           Dave’s statue comes into frame...then the diner, the other 
           fields...until we have a perfect view of the whole ballpark.

           FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END
