           We hear the sounds of a train coming to a stop. 

           And read:

                      If we’re not supposed to dance,
                      Why all this music?

                      Greg Orr 
           OVER BLACK. 

           A stampede. The rush of commuters as they board a train. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                             (intercom)
                        Stand clear of the closing doors.

           As we hear the doors close, we open to --

           INT. TRAIN - EARLY MORNING. 

           Summer. New York City. The morning commute.

           149th St. station left in the dust as the 2/3 heads downtown. 

           The train is crowded, airless, miserable. 

           CREDITS ROLL AS WE SEE --

           A banker playing Candy Crush, a pregnant woman rubbing her 
           belly, a Sikh with a Chihuahua in his kaftan, a construction 
           worker reading the Wall Street Journal, triplets with a 
           Trinidadian caretaker, a homeless man combing his beard.   

           The MTA subway. The great democratizer. 

           We end on a lanky black teen wearing khaki pants, Penny 
           Loafers, and a button down which blooms sweat patterns. 

           This is SAUNDERS BELL (17). 

           His head is tilted at 45 degrees, ear buds are in, IG feed 
           scrolls across his tired eyes. Bored as can be. 

           But after checking his Casio watch, he smiles. And like 
           clockwork, here they come. 

           Right through the inter train doors. In SLOW MOTION. 

           All wearing the same uniform: black track pants, wife 
           beaters, flat brimmed Mets hats. 

           And on their feet? Air Force 1’s with leather wings 
           protruding from the heel, the Greek Gods of the subway. 

           The leader of the crew is an enthusiastic though chubby black 
           man with three days of stubble sprinkled on his tired face.  

           This is PRESTON SAMPSON (33).
                                 PRESTON
                        Rise and shine, ladies and 
                        gentlemen. Rise and shine. Welcome 
                        to the greatest show on earth...or 
                        at the very least today’s commute. 
                        Remember. One ride can change your 
                        life. Here. We. Go.

           A Puerto Rican beat maker fiercer than young Rosie Perez taps 
           on her iPhone. This is OLALLA “OOMPH” CORRAL (19).

           A catchy beat spews out of a scuffed purple bluetooth amp.  

           Oomph’s pint sized cousin launches into a crab walk. Though 
           neither big nor a man, this is RAFE “BIG MAN” CORRAL (9).

           After a few hat tricks, he throws to --

           LEE “YOUTUBE” JEONG (23), the videographer of the crew, who 
           taps record on an iPhone holstered to his winged sneaker. 

           He jumps on the center pole and starts pirouetting. 

           We see the faces of commuters roulette from his shoe POV. 

           He lands on the ground and takes a theatrical bow, eliciting 
           claps from the battle-weary passengers - a small miracle!

           And now Preston is up. 

           Though past his prime, the man can still hit.

           He begins with a Tone-Wop Foot Shuffle then weaves into a 
           spastic Harlem Shake.

           (NOTE: Some moves will be described in detail. Some won’t. 
           But all are real. And all are nasty as hell.)

           And now the others join in for the finale. 

           Slides and turns and flips and spins. They’re a combination 
           of acrobats and strippers and dancers and vaudevillians. 

           And they have a playful acrobatic subway-based style all 
           their own: Litefeet. 

           And as the beat breaks, all four members hit a Bad One in 
           unison - a fierce exclamation mark that ends the routine. 

           The look on Saunders’s face is pure amazement. 
                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Thank you very much! We are the 
                        Rise & Shine crew! Dancing in the 
                        greatest nation on the world!

           Big Man comes around with a vintage metal lunch box that has  
           Porky Pig on it. This is the Piggy Bank.  

                                 BIG MAN
                        Donation! Dollar dollar bill y’all.

           A few singles here and there. Not great but that’s the gig. 
           Saunders makes sure to throw a bill in the metal box. 

                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Appreciate you. 

                                 PRESTON
                        On to the next. 

           Rise & Shine push through the inter train doors. 

           Commuters return to whatever distraction is available. 
           Anything to forget you’re in a packed metal coffin. 

           As Saunders watches them go, a longing spreads over his face. 
           Because he’s ridden these trains his whole life. 

           But he’s never floated in them. 

           END CREDITS.

           EXT. BROADWAY/72ND STREET - MORNING.

           Saunders deftly wades through a gauntlet of strollers, 
           bankers, hot dog vendors, and young professionals. 

           He ends up at 81st and West End, in front of --

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - SAME.

           A progressive private school on West End Avenue. The hallways 
           are mostly empty - it’s summer. 

           We follow Saunders from behind as he moves towards --

           THE ENGINEERING LAB. 

           Open space under fluorescents. Industrial cabinets line the 
           perimeter. Pairs of TEENAGERS clik clak at computer stations 
           that connect by large cables to rudimentary automatons. 
           They tweak lines of code and watch as their robots move or - 
           in most cases - do absolutely nothing.  

           MR. VEASLEY (45), a bearded teacher with a sweater vest, 
           inspects the progress and offers ideas.  

           Saunders joins an overweight preppy girl who types away at a 
           work station. This is NORA HURWITZ (17). 

           They fist bump then get down to business.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        How’s Herman doing?

                                 NORA
                        Sleepy. Doesn’t want to move today. 

           She types some code into the console. HERMAN - the robot they 
           are programming - stays still. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I know the feeling. 

           Saunders takes over typing. 

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        Summer school’s an oxymoron. You 
                        got summer. You got school. Those 
                        two don’t mix. 

           Saunders hits return on the console. Robot Herman is 
           unimpressed. Nora takes back over, tweaking his code.

                                 NORA
                        You’ll be singing a different tune 
                        when MIT comes a-knocking.

           Nora presses enter and voila - one of Herman’s arms moves. Is 
           it Johnny5 or the Iron Giant? Not even close. But it’s 
           something. Nora smiles proudly. 

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. You’ve been riding my 
                        coattails since middle school. I’m 
                        cool with it at this point.

           Saunders looks out the window. But his head isn’t in the 
           clouds above. It’s in the tunnels below.

           INT. SUBWAY - LATER. 

           Saunders heads uptown, once again armored up: Head at 45 
           degrees, earbuds in, IG dancing across his eyes. 
           PHONE INSERT: Youtube’s feed of Rise hitting on the trains. 

           Saunders finishes the clip. Then plays it again. 
           And again and again and again. 

           EXT. BRONX - DUSK.

           Saunders weaves through an emcee hawking his mixtape, a 
           churro lady, a hustler selling loosies, two Nigerians selling 
           discount t-shirts - everything the Bronx can throw at him. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SUNSET.

           He ducks under chain link into an empty construction site.

           What’s he doing here? Gonna swing a hammer? Demo dry wall? 
           Nope. But he is about to get to work. 

           After making sure the coast is clear, he ditches his book bag 
           and grabs his phone. 

           He thumbs his way to Soundcloud. 

           Selects a track from a specific user: OOMPH. 

           And as he slides the volume up, we hear the beat that slaps 
           in his earbuds. 

           He climbs up the scaffolding, starts swinging monkey bar 
           style. Getting the limbs loose.

           And then it happens. 

           He vaults to a vertical pole and, using his hands, lifts his 
           entire body horizontal, every muscle straining. He spins 
           himself around and around. 

           Then wraps his legs around the pole, sends his torso and head 
           on a wild arc. Just using his feet, he rail slides down the 
           scaffolding. 

           And it becomes clear: He’s doing pieces of the Rise routine 
           from the train earlier. He knows their moves inside and out. 

           And not just doing it. Crushing it. He’s getting lite. And as 
           he does, we break from reality: 

           The bolts start to shake, the metal bars tense and bend, and 
           the scaffolding slowly dislodges from the ground. And for the 
           first time we realize: Newton got it wrong. 

           Gravity has nothing on Saunders. 
           INT. BRONX CONDO - NIGHT.

           A modest but well-appointed two bedroom condo. 

           Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme” on the Technics 1200.

           A large framed photo on the wall - “A Great Day in Harlem” - 
           shows the jazz greats who lived just 6 stops south of here. 

           In the kitchen, a man stirs a pot of penne. He carefully 
           spoons it onto two plates, the exact amount on each.

           This is a man who likes things just so. And no other way. 
           This is KHALIL BELL (45).

           Saunders comes in, sweaty from his scaffolding routine.

                                 KHALIL
                        Dinner’s ready. 

           Saunders washes his hands, splashes some water on his neck. 
           He takes a seat as his Dad puts a plate in front of him. 

           Saunders dives in with a fury. Khalil eats slowly. 

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        How’s school? That robot making 
                        moves or what?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I guess. 

                                 KHALIL
                        You guess?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        We’re making progress. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Good. That’s real good. Glad to 
                        hear you’re enjoying it. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (half under his breath)
                        Didn’t say that. 

           Khalil sets down his fork and knife, each the exact distance 
           from the plate, perfectly straight. Narrows his gaze.

                                 KHALIL
                        I grew up six blocks from here. 
                        Know what it was like back then? 
                        The Boogie Down? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KHALIL (CONT'D)
                        I’ll put it this way. No one had 
                        the chance to take AP engineering 
                        in Manhattan.

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (not this again)
                        I know where you grew up.

                                 KHALIL
                        You know where. But not how. 

           Saunders stares at his Dad, not interested in a lecture.

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        You think that class is cheap? You 
                        think I got nothing else to spend 
                        my money on?
                             (settling down)
                        I just...you got a real shot, man.  
                        MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, 
                        wherever you want. 
                             (beat)
                        I couldn’t take that shot. But I 
                        can throw up an alley-oop. 

           Khalil pantomimes lobbing an imaginary basketball. He leaves 
           his shooting hand up, waiting for Saunders. 

           Saunders rolls his eyes but nevertheless “dunks” it. 

           A familiar routine. 

           The two of them resume eating. In silence. 

           LATER. 

           Khalil works a crossword puzzle on the couch. Saunders 
           finishes up the dishes, heads into the living room. 

           He passes a small framed photo on the mantel of Khalil and 
           Saunders. Between them is a smiling beautiful woman.

           Noticeably absent from their lives now. 

           INT. SAUNDERS’S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

           Small but tidy. 

           On the wall is a poster showcasing the Alvin Ailey dance 
           theatre - a lithe dancer caught mid-leap.

           And on closer inspection we notice this dancer is the same as 
           the smiling woman from the family photograph.
           Saunders sprawls on the bed, an engineering book open nearby. 
           But that’s not what he’s studying. He’s studying his phone. 

           YOUTUBE’S FEED: Rise & Shine hitting on the trains.

           We push close on Saunders’s face till we can see the phone 
           light flicker in his eyes. 

           EXT. BRONX - MORNING - ESTABLISHING. 

           Aerial shot as the daybreak rouses the borough from sleep. 
           We fly past nine brick towers -- The Bronx River Houses. 

           PRELAP: A simple short riff plays on a Midi Keyboard. 

           INT. OOMPH’S APARTMENT - DAY.

           Popcorn ceiling, plastic on the couch, Jesus on the wall. 
           Dialysis machine in the corner. An old person lives here. 

           Or maybe used to live here. 

           Oomph works a small Midi keyboard on stacked milk crates. She 
           tickles the plastic ivories, bobs to the melody.

                                 BIG MAN (O.S.)
                        Huuuungry. 

           Big Man crawls into the room, a wife beater tied over his 
           head like a shipwrecked mariner. 

                                 OOMPH
                        So get some food. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Tastes better when you make it. 

           Oomph loops the beat, adds drums. 

                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                        I feel faint. 

           He mock collapses. Unable to resist her nephew’s charms, 
           Oomph goes to the kitchen and pours him a bowl of Fruity 
           Pebbles. His eyes light up --

           DRIP. DRIP. 

           -- but dim when the milk gallon offers only a single splash. 

           Oomph fills the remainder of the bowl with water. Big Man 
           slumps in disappointment.  
                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                        When’s the record deal coming 
                        through? We need those “Mo Money Mo 
                        Problems” problems.

                                 OOMPH
                        Just wait. After these slaps hit at 
                        Kingdome, it’ll pop off.

           Big Man smiles brightly, dreaming of that good life. But 
           after he shovels a spoonful of “breakfast,” the smile fades.

                        Water Pebbles. 

           INT. STOCK ROOM - MORNING.

           Goya products and various sundries stacked against a wall. 
           And shoe boxes incongruously stacked against another. 

           Youtube sits at a desk made up of cinder blocks and a long 
           sheet of plexi. On top are a few monitors.

                                 YOUTUBE
                        C’mon SneakerBoi69er. I know you 
                        want em. 

           Like a high frequency day trader, he’s got multiple windows 
           open: Ebay, FiteClub, Sneaker Don, Complex. 

           Youtube is sneaker reseller. And he’s tracking a potential 
           sale of gold Jordan 4’s.  

           On a shelf, a bodega cat meows from a throne of Doritos bags. 

                                 YOUTUBE (CONT’D)
                        Marked em down once already, Bo. 

           Bo meows quizzically. Youtube clicks on the computer. 

                                 YOUTUBE (CONT’D)
                        His buyer status is rated gold. 
                        Less then 10% returned. 

           Bo purrs. The auction goes on as planned. While he waits, 
           Youtube throws his phone into his shoe holster, practices 
           quick releasing it like an Old West gunslinger.

           We hear a chime on the computer. Youtube checks and -- yes! 
           The sale has gone through. He pumps his fist triumphantly. 

                                 YOUTUBE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I’m talking about, Bo!
           INT. BODEGA - MOMENTS LATER.  

           Youtube wraps up the Jordan’s using saran wrap from a 
           sandwich station. Bo naps on a Ramen 12-pack.

           Nearby, an older Korean woman guns price tags onto bottles of 
           Windex. This is Youtube’s mother, MRS. TUBE. (late 50’s). 

                                 MRS. TUBE

           Youtube and Bo share a commiserating look.

           Bo agrees, licks his paws. 

           INT. BRONX RIVER PROJECTS - MORNING.

           Elevator doors open revealing Preston, wearing the familiar 
           brown UPS uniform. We track with him to his one bedroom. 

           INT. PRESTON’S APARTMENT - SAME.

           Preston sets his keys down. A large boisterous woman in an 
           MTA uniform enters the living room. She’s buttoning her 
           shirt, unwrapping an Egg McMuffin, and applying makeup.  

           This is KEISHA (38).

                                 KEISHA
                        How was it?
           Preston shrugs, stoic. He clocks the gooey sammy, perks up.

                                 PRESTON
                        Can I get a McMuffin?

                                 KEISHA
                        You get a McNuffin. You’re training 
                        for that Kingdome competition.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Almost in fighting shape. 

           Keisha gives him a skeptical once over. 

                                 KEISHA
                        Keep eating your Wheaties.

                        See you at the office?

           Preston nods, gives her a kiss. She whirlwinds out the door.

           BEDROOM. 

           Preston sheds the stank uniform. And replaces it with track 
           pants, a wife beater, and his winged AF1’s. 

           He looks in the mirror: Ain’t pretty, but it’ll have to do.

           EXT. 174TH STREET - MORNING.

           Rise & Shine meet up outside the busy station. 

                                 PRESTON
                        How’s the count, Big Man?

           Big Man, munching on a churro like it’s a cigar, opens his 
           lunch box. In FAST MOTION, he counts the bills like a Vegas 
           croupier.

                        No bueno. And our socials?

           Youtube quick draws his phone from his holster, dials up 
           their analytics. 
                                 YOUTUBE

                        I don’t care what Showtime has. We 
                        ain’t Showtime. And they ain’t us. 
                        They work the parks, we work the 
                        trains. Totally different hustle. 

           Clearly this is a sore spot for Preston. 

           INT. TRAIN STATION - MOMENTS LATER.

           The crew makes their way through the station. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Kingdome is the baddest tournament 
                        all year. You wanna be somebody you 
                        gotta come correct. How we gonna 
                        enter with those kinda numbers? 

           Youtube quick releases his piece, dials up the Kingdome IG.

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Cardi’s a judge this year. And 
                        Complex is sponsoring!

                                 PRESTON
                        Forget Cardi. Forget Complex. 
                        How we hit is what matters. Period.

                        My guy. If we’re gonna play in the 
                        finals, we need an MJ to build the 
                        team around. Then we can play ball.
                                 PRESTON
                        You’re looking at him. 

           Youtube pops his retro flip up sunglass to get a closer 
           inspection at the older man. Preston waves him off. 

           They approach the station booth, where Keisha is at work. 
           She’s an MTA station agent. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Hello young lady. How’s the 
                        downtown train looking today? 

                                 KEISHA
                        Looks good. No delays. 

           She winks at him - a signal. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Good to know. Have a lovely day.

           She smiles at him as Rise swipes through the turnstile. 

           INT. TRAIN - MORNING.

           Once again, the daily summer commute for Saunders: 
           Earbuds in. Head at 45. Scrolling IG. 

           And that’s when he hears it. One of Oomph’s monster tracks? 
           Not exactly.

           Two MARIACHI SINGERS strum guitars, singing dolorous 
           canciones about unrequited love. A Litefeet banger this most 
           certainly is not. 

           He checks his watch, concerned. 

           And right on time, Rise pushes through the train doors. The 
           mariachi music hits them like a ton of bricks. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Oh hell no. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        What’s this rah-rah bullshit?

                                 PRESTON
                        Lemme handle it. 

           Preston approaches the two Mariachi singers. 
                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        These our cars. You get the 
                        lettered ones. We get numbered. 
                        Wider aisles. Higher ceilings. 

                                 MARIACHI #1
                        Los pasajeros don’t seem to care 
                        about tus reglas. 

           He head nods to some commuters shelling out singles. Preston 
           heads back to his crew in a huff. He nods to Oomph.

                                 PRESTON
                        Drop a beat. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Let’s just hop the next one.

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s the express. Fewer stops. 
                        That’ll halve our rush hour take.  
                        Drop a beat.

           Oomph sets down the scuffed amp, taps play on her phone. 
           Preston revs up, launches into his preamble.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Rise and shine, ladies and 
                        gentlemen. Rise and shine. Welcome 
                        to the greatest show on earth...or 
                        at the very least today’s commute. 
                        One ride can change your life. 
                        Here. We. Go.

           He transitions a Cheddar Bob Thread into a Tornado Spin. 

           Not to be upstaged, the Mariachis play louder. 

           Preston is pissed, ups the ante. He motions to Big Man. 

           They jump into a choreographed routine where Big Man attaches 
           to Preston’s torso, making it appear like the kid has chubby 
           adult legs. The crowd eats it up. 

           In response, one of the Mariachi singers launches into a 
           Jarabe Tapatio - the traditional Mexican hat dance. 

           It’s a Mexican/Bronx standoff!

           Youtube unholsters his phone to record. Most commuters pay no 
           mind. But Saunders is on the edge of his seat.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Time to dead these chollos. 
           Preston jumps onto a pole, starts to Peter Pan, spinning 
           round and round. Then he punctuates with a Kiss of Death. 

           But he doesn’t plant his hands properly. He falls down, assed 
           out on the subway floor. Directly in front of Saunders. 

           Saunders can’t help it. He giggles at the sight. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you laughin’ at? Think you can 
                        do better prep school?

           We push into Saunders’s face. 

           The sound fades away till all we can hear is the bump bump 
           bump of train over tracks. It gets louder, syncing up with 
           Saunders’s pounding heart. 

           He looks down at trembling legs, sweaty palms. And then, 
           before he even knows it, he’s standing up. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (frog in throat)
                        I can try. 

           All eyes on Saunders. Commuters, Rise & Shine, even the 
           Mariachi singers. All staring like W to the T to the F.

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                             (to Oomph)
                        Play “Brick Destroyer.”

                                 OOMPH
                        You know my songs? 
                             (to Big Man)
                        He knows my songs?

           Big Man shrugs. She sizes up the lanky nerd in front of her. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        I got you. One piping hot beat, 
                        fresh out the oven. 

           Oomph serves up the beat. Saunders head nods, shuffling back 
           and forth. He’s never danced in front of an audience. 

           But as the beat drops, he’s hit with a shot of adrenaline. 
           This is what Oomph’s music does to him. 

           Saunders jumps up onto the ceiling railing. Pulls his legs 
           between his arms like a gymnast and flips onto the floor.  

           A hush falls over the crowd. 
           Saunders then launches into a Litefeet dance routine that is 
           powerful, energetic, and somehow emotional. 

           Using dance, Saunders depicts his Jekyll and Hyde split 
           personality: a studious nerd and a powerful dancer. 

           He tries to “tamp down” his limbs. But it’s no use. Each have 
           a mind of their own and cannot be contained. 

           He then launches into a Butterfly Twist into a Tic Tac Toe.

           These are not easy moves to execute. And they’re definitely a 
           little rough around the edges. But the entire train now knows 
           what we already knew: this kid is undeniable. 

           As the song hits it’s final break, he nails a Stunna Dive. 

           The train erupts in applause as Saunders catches his breath. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                             (inspecting his phone)
                        Please tell me I got that. 

           Oomph comes over to Saunders. 

                                 OOMPH
                        That was fire.  

           And just as he was beginning to catch his breath, she dabs 
           him up, rocketing his heartbeat once again.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You’re fire...I mean...your beats 
                        are...fire. 

           Don Juan’s not so slick line is further compromised by his 
           blushing. And his feet shaking in his Penny Loafers.

           Big Man goes around collecting ones, fives, and tens.

           Even one of the Mariachi guys takes a single out of his 
           guitar case: Credit where credit’s due. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (P.A.)
                        This is....74th street. 

           BING BONG. The train doors open. Passengers rush out.

           Saunders grabs his book bag and heads to the doors. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (P.A.) (CONT’D)
                        Stand clear of the closing doors. 
           Saunders makes it to the platform just as the doors close. He 
           turns back to find Preston, still on the train, staring hard. 
           The veteran and the rookie. One on the train, one off. 

           The train whooshes away.

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY.

           Saunders works with Nora on their robotic project. 

                                 NORA
                        To initiate our intended sequence 
                        we need to effect six degrees of 
                        freedom. Three for position - 
                        left/right, forward/backward, 
                        up/down - and three for 
                        orientation. That’s the yaw, the 
                        pitch, and the roll. 

           She checks some of their code against a textbook.

                        But we are lacking in lateral, 
                        axial, and rotational compliance. 
                        Remember, we need Herman to exhibit 
                        complex dynamic behavior that is 
                        both accurate and repeatable. 

           Saunders is daydreaming about what happened on the train.

                        That’s one way to put it. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Each tiny movement executed in the

                        A dance? Bit of a reach, metaphor-
                        wise. It’s closer to synchronized 
                        swimming if the swimmers had a task 
                        to achieve or maybe like the inside 
                        of a clock, each part needing to 
                        work in service of the whole.

                        think about...

           The sound of Nora’s explanation fades out. All Saunders can 
           think about is floating on those trains. 

           INT. SAUNDERS BEDROOM - NIGHT.

           Saunders lays in bed, staring at his phone with wide eyes. 

           Youtube’s latest post shows him hitting on the train. Him! 
           Saunders. The one and only. In the flesh. Well...in pixels.

           But that’s not what he’s looking at. 

           He’s zoomed into Oomph, watching her as she watches him.  

           Replaying the clip, studying her every reaction for a clue. 
           What does she think about him?

           Headlights flash blue white shapes on the wall as we --

           INT. TRAIN - DAY.

           The shapes of light coming through the train windows. 

           Saunders, armored up and in battle position. He checks his 
           watch, we see the smile. He looks to the inter train doors.

           But they don’t come. Off his disappointed face --

           INT. 74TH STREET STATION - DAY.

           Saunders exits the train. Takes the escalator up. 

                                 PRESTON (O.S.)
                        Prep school. 

           Waiting at the top is Preston. He holds a brown shopping bag.

                        Lemme get at you for a second. 

           Saunders keeps walking, not trying to catch heat for his 
           upstaging of the elder statesman on his home turf. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I got class.

                        It’s summer.

                        Sorry about what happened 
                        yesterday. That was an accident.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Hold up, man. Hold up. That was no 
                        accident. You got the goods. 

           Saunders stops. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (pride)
                        For real? You think so?

                                 PRESTON
                        I mean it needs work. Way too 
                        tight. You need to relax. Plus your 
                        transitions are sloppy. And your 
                        sequences are out of order. Still. 
                        Diamond starts out a lump of coal.

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (hurt)
                        I’m not a dancer.

           Saunders keeps walking. Easier to just bury this side of him. 
           Preston walks alongside him.

                                 PRESTON
                        No, you aren’t. But with my 
                        training, you damn well could be. 
                             (beat)
                        So what’s your deal, man? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        What do you mean? 

                                 PRESTON
                        What’s your grind? Your hustle?

           Saunders looks at his shoes, hoping they’ll provide an 
           answer. But they keep quiet. Penny loafers don’t snitch.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay. How about what’s your name? 

           Now Saunders looks him in his eye. 
                                 SAUNDERS
                        Saunders. 

                                 PRESTON
                        There we go. Nice to meet you, 
                        Saunders. I’m Preston. 

           They shake hands. But Preston doesn’t let go. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Listen Saunders. Got a proposition 
                        for you. How would you feel about 
                        training with me? With my crew?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Me? I can’t -- I’m not --

                                 PRESTON
                        I’ll teach you. Everything you need 
                        to know. The moves, the tricks, the 
                        traps, the hustle. You got the 
                        talent. Just needs to be shaped. 
                             (in for the kill)
                        Let me shape it.  

           Saunders, a deer in headlights. Turns out when offered that 
           one thing you’ve been chasing, it’s hard to just accept it.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Something I want you to have. 

           Out of the brown paper bag, Preston pulls a pair of winged 
           Air Force 1’s. They glow. Saunders’s eyes go wide as saucers. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I don’t have cash for that right 
                        now. I appreciate --

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m not selling them to you. I’m 
                        giving em to you. 

           Saunders shakes his head. Can’t come up with any words.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Try em on. You don’t like the fit? 
                        Give em back this afternoon. 

           Preston walks away, leaving Saunders with the winged kicks. 
           He basks in their glow. Then snaps out of it. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (yelling after him)
                        This afternoon?
                                 PRESTON
                        Unionport Yard. East 180th street. 

           Preston descends back into the station. Saunders stays dead 
           still. He looks at the winged shoes. They shoot currents of 
           electricity through his body. 

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB - DAY.

           Nora is at the console, typing in code. 

                                 NORA
                        We’ve had success before sending 
                        individual actions to each node.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Kinda creates a weird Frankenstein 
                        effect. As if each limb and joint 
                        has a mind of its own.  

           Nora presses return. We see Herman spastically come to life 
           like a marionette controlled by an amateur puppeteer.

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                             (echoing Preston)
                        We need smooth transitions from one 
                        action to the next. Sequences 
                        executed to perfection, all 
                        occurring in the exact right order. 

           Saunders, inspired, whiteboards a new approach. 

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        Check this out. Each “body part” is 
                        comprised of dozens of nodes which 
                        in turn control other nodes. That’s 
                        the branch theory. But we need an 
                        executive command function. A 
                        purpose. So it’s not just separate 
                        commands to control the arms which 
                        control the hands which control the 
                        fingers which control the 
                        fetch/grab mechanism. We need an 
                        engine. A heart.

           He playfully throws the marker at her. 
           EXT. UNIONPORT YARD - AFTERNOON.

           An empty rail yard in the South Bronx. A dozen trains sit 
           motionless at bumper blocks. 

           Saunders walks between the trains with trepidation. What’s he 
           doing here? Why’s he wearing sneakers with wings on them? 

           He decides to bounce before he gets jumped or arrested.

                        They look good on you.  

           Saunders turns, startled. Oomph materializes out of thin air.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        How long you been creeping?

                             (feeling himself)
                        Oh yeah? So whatcha think? 

           Oomph walks around him. Close. Very close. The hair on his 
           neck stands at attention. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Jury’s still out. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        So what are we doing here?

           Their almost moment is interrupted as Big Man and Youtube 
           emerge from nearby train. 

           Big shakes Skittles into his mouth. (He’s got a sugar habit). 
           Youtube sports icy Jordan 6’s. (He’s got a sneaker habit).

                        They dream about us. 

           Saunders looks up to find Preston sitting on top of a train. 
           His legs dangle off the edge. And of course the winged AF1’s. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        See. Normally? A train’s just a 
                        sardine can on rails. Shuttling 
                        bored folks from A to B.

                        And every time the doors close, 
                        it’s our opening night. 

           Preston jumps off the train, lands in front of Saunders.

                        That’s what getting lite is all 
                        about. That freedom. That flow.

                        letting go of everything -- till 
                        it’s just you and the music, 
                        hurling through space. 
                             (beat)
                        One ride can change your life. 

           Saunders looks at the trains, the afternoon light kissing 
           them just right. And they do look different. Special.  

           Oomph drags out her scuffed amp and powers it up. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Got a track that’s perfect for you.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        For me?

           Oomph taps her phone. We hear the keyboard and bass intro to 
           a playful Litefeet track. It builds in intensity.

           We’ll call this Saunders’s Theme. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Whatcha think? You wanna get lite?
           Saunders smiles, wipes his sweaty palms on his AF1’s. 
           And just as the beat hits we --

           BEGIN INITIATION MONTAGE. 

           Preston heatedly choreographs inside the empty trains. 

           Saunders, Youtube, and Oomph follow suit.

           They go through the routine, each one after the next.

           Saunders is up. He executes well, but he’s stiff. 

           PAUSE MONTAGE.

                                 PRESTON
                        Too tight. Do it again. 

           He tries another Pin Drop. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Relax, man. You’re in your head. 
                        Getting lite ain’t about the head. 
                        Can’t think your way into this.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Okay. I get it. 

           Saunders goes again. Trying his hardest. Oomph smiles at him. 
           This kid’s got heart.

           After some tries, he nails the routine. Perfection. 

           He looks to Preston for approval. Nope.

                                 PRESTON
                        I need you to feel it.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        C’mon! That was perfect.

                                 PRESTON
                        You got the sequence right. But if 
                        you ain’t feeling it, it’s nothing. 

           RESUME MONTAGE.

           Now Preston gets Big Man in the mix, showing Saunders how to 
           throw the kid into an aerial spin. 

           Saunders tries a throw. Big Man goes flying, narrowly missing 
           the pole. 

           Big Man brushes himself off and shoulder checks Saunders. 
           Oomph smiles. She jumps onto the poles, does a few spins. 

           Saunders joins her, the two of them hanging from the rails. 

           Their dancing syncs up, a clear chemistry between them. 

           Youtube shoots the routine, his head bobbing the whole time. 
           And Preston nods his approval, a thought clearly forming in 
           his head: they may have just found their MJ. 

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. BRONX RIVER - SUNSET.

           As the sun sets, Rise & Shine along with their new addition 
           walk along the only fresh water river in the city.

                        Kingdome, baby baby. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Kingdome?

                        Wait till I get my money right. 

           Saunders stands there, the wheels turning.
                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold up, hold up. You’ve never been 
                        to Kingdome?

                        But we going this year.

                                 PRESTON
                        Enough about Kingdome. That’s end 
                        of the month. What about tomorrow?

           They reach a crossroads. Everyone lingers for a beat. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        We hittin’ or what?

                                 PRESTON
                        Good question. 

           He turns to Saunders. Saunders thinks it over and nods.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I’m down. 

           Youtube dabs up the crew, heads towards his train. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Let’s dip. I need two CC’s of 
                        Starburts and a Twix. Stat. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Nerd. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Nerds! That’ll work. Something. 

           Big Man heads down the road, kicking an empty soda can. Oomph 
           approaches Saunders. 

                                 OOMPH
                        I like your moves. Need some 
                        practice. But I like em.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Your moves are also -- likable.
                             (Don Juan takes his shot)
                        We should practice sometime. 
           He takes out his phone, ready for them digits. She ignores 
           the overture and hugs him before he has a chance to put his 
           AF1 any further in his mouth. 

                                 OOMPH
                        See you tomorrow. 

           She runs after her pint-sized cousin. Now it’s just Preston 
           and Saunders. OG sizes up his protege. 

                                 PRESTON
                        They fit okay?

           Saunders looks down at his shoes. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        They fit perfect. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Good. Get some rest. One thing to 
                        hit on an empty train. Totally 
                        different with passengers. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Where do we meet?

                                 PRESTON
                        8 in the morning. 174th street.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Everybody?

                                 PRESTON
                        We rise and shine as a family. Or 
                        not at all. 

           Preston heads to the housing projects. And Saunders heads 
           home. And the sun disappears behind the Hudson River. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT.

           Khalil is on the couch doing the crossword. Saunders enters.  

                                 KHALIL
                        9 letter word. Starts with “D.”  
                        Magician’s tricky act. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I dunno. 

           Saunders looks down, sees he’s still wearing his winged AF1s. 
           He quickly removes them, shoves them in his book bag. 
                                 KHALIL
                        You hungry?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Grabbed a slice after class.

                                 KHALIL
                        Deception. 

           Saunders stops in his tracks, caught red footed. 

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        Magician’s tricky act. 9 letters. 
                        Deception. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (relief)
                        Oh. Nice solve. I should do some 
                        problem sets. 

           He enters his room, shuts the door. Finally safe. 

           BEDROOM. 

           Saunders’s heart pounds from the thrill of his afternoon. He 
           shoves his engineering text books aside, dials up Youtube’s 
           social feed.   

           Once again, phone light flickers across his face.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER BLACK - we hear the sounds of the subway. 

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. 174TH STREET - EARLY MORNING. 

           Saunders meets the Rise camp outside the train station. The 
           crew huddles up. Preston lays out the run of play, mostly so 
           Saunders knows the deal.

                                 PRESTON
                        The morning commute. This is our

                        Soups. A few pole tricks. Keep it

           A hush falls over the crew. Saunders doesn’t follow.

                        What’s an Evil Knevel?

           INT. SUBWAY STAION - SAME.

           Big Man and Youtube slide down the center of the escalator. 
           Preston goes up to the MTA booth where Keisha helps a 
           customer with his demagnetized card.

           Keisha looks down at her MTA blues and blushes. When she 
           looks up, her man’s in the wind. 

           INT. TRAIN - LATER.

           We catch Preston finishing up his spiel.

                        ...A ride can change your life. 
                        Here. We. Go.

           Rise & Shine hit on the train. We see the routine they 
           practiced at the train yard. 

           With Saunders in the mix, it’s a whole different ballgame. 

           And commuters take notice. Waving bills in the air. Big Man 
           collects the proceeds. Piggy Bank gets well fed with green. 

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB - SAME TIME. 

           Nora works at the console. She presses enter. Herman waves to 
           her. She waves back. 
           She looks around. Every other team has at least two members. 
           But she’s all alone. She pulls out her phone. 

           TEXT MESSAGE TO SAUNDERS: “WYA?”

           INT. TRAIN - SAME.

           Saunders watches as Youtube and Preston mime being in super 
           slow motion, moving as if they’re underwater. 

           BUZZ BUZZ. 

           Saunders pulls his phone out, sees Nora’s text. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Damn. 

           He starts typing out a response. But before he finishes, 
           Oomph taps him on the shoulder. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Check this. It’s a duet. You down?  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You know I’m down. 

           She presses play on her phone. Then jumps on the rails. 
           Oomph’s music wafts into Saunders’s ears. Intoxicating. 

           He quickly pockets his phone, text message unsent, and jumps 
           on the rails. And they spin around each other, getting closer 
           and closer, looking into each other’s eyes the whole time. 

           It’s summer. The train is hot.

           But as Oomph and Saunders lock in, it gets even hotter.

           EXT. SCAFFOLDING - LATE MORNING. 

           With the morning commute over, our crew eats breakfast. 
           Bacon, egg, and cheese. High up on scaffolding. It evokes 
           that classic New York photograph “Lunch Atop A Skyscraper.” 

                                 PRESTON
                        How’d we do?

           Big Man opens up Piggy Bank, FAST MOTION hand counts. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        One sixty eight. 
                                 YOUTUBE
                        Hell yeah. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        And that’s after breakfast and re-
                        upping our swipes. And my %3 
                        accounting fee. 

           Oomph lightly messes up his hair. 

                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                             (a la Travolta)
                        Mah hair. Watch mah hair. 

           Youtube quick releases his phone, thumbs through it. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Caught wind of a basement battle 
                        this weekend. Could be a good look?

                                 PRESTON
                        Could be. Could be. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        That’s small potatoes. We gonna 
                        fuck up the Dome this year!

                                 PRESTON
                        Watch your mouth, small potatoes. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        My b. My b. We gonna kick ass at 
                        the Dome this year!

           Everyone smiles at Big’s outsized confidence. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Kingdome’s not to be taken lightly. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Come. On. After all these years? I 
                        can’t believe you don’t wanna stick 
                        it to Showtime. Make those fools 
                        regret turning they back on you. 

           Preston shoots him a look that shuts him right up.

                                 PRESTON
                        Finish up. We got work to do. 

           Preston walks along the scaffolding towards a freight 
           elevator, the mood clearly deflated. 
                                 YOUTUBE
                        Dumb ass. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        I’m just saying what we all 
                        thinking. Just cuz I happen to have 
                        the which-nuts to speak up... 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Which nuts?

                                 BIG MAN
                             (pointing crotchward)
                        Deez nuts!

           He cracks up. Youtube and Big Man finish their breakfast, 
           take off after Preston. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        What was that about?

                                 OOMPH
                        Preston used to hit with Showtime. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Showtime? 

                                 OOMPH
                        You know. “Ladies and gentlemen, 
                        it’s Showtime.” Original Litefeet 
                        crew. But since the vandal squad’s 
                        launched their assault, Showtime 
                        went above ground. Now they just 
                        work parks. So we take trains. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Bum deal. 

                                 OOMPH
                        No. Litefeet was born on the 
                        trains. And we keeping it there. 
                        Among the people, the commuters, 
                        the real New Yorkers. Showtime 
                        plays for tourists. They’re a boy 
                        band. We’re punk rock. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        So what happened with Preston?

                                 OOMPH
                        Never got the full story. All I 
                        know he parted ways with Showtime a 
                        few years back. Right after 
                        Kingdome. His first and last. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OOMPH (CONT'D)
                        Been steady building this clique 
                        ever since. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I had no idea.  

           She sees his concern. His compassion. His innocence.

                                 OOMPH
                        Lemme see your phone. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (excited)
                        New beat?

           Saunders hands her his phone. She works her magic on it. 
           Hands it back to him. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Bonus track. 

           She heads over to the elevators. Saunders looks at his phone. 
           Right there in the contacts is Oomph’s number.   

           Prep School got the digits! 

           Saunders hangs back, basking in the afterglow of being a 
           teenager with a crush in the thick of an NYC summer.

           He looks out over the city: So many people, so many stories. 
           But in this rare private moment, it’s his and his alone. 

           EXT. HARLEM - NIGHT.

           A cloudless muggy night. 

           We see the Apollo Theatre. Haring’s “Crack is Wack” mural. 
           And 2 Bros Pizza, home to the $1 slice. But we’re far from 
           there. We’re in East Harlem. Still dicey. 

           In front of a shuttered Metro PCS store, Youtube stunts a 
           pair of iced out baby blue Jordan 6’s to the crew. Saunders 
           rolls up, wearing his customary tight khakis.

                                 BIG MAN
                        You dress like that even at night?

           Saunders shrugs. Guilty as charged. 

           DARK STREET - LATER.

           Rise & Shine move with purpose though the night. 
                                 SAUNDERS
                        Thought we only hit on trains? 

                                 OOMPH
                        Only earn on trains. We’ll battle 
                        wherever there’s a floor.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Where exactly is this floor?

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Don’t worry. We’re close. 

           Two possums crawl out of a sewer. They look at the humans 
           like: the fuck you gonna do?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Close to what?

           They round a corner and approach --

           EXT. RESTAURANT SUPPLY COMPANY - SAME.  

           Security grille on the front. Youtube consults at his phone. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        C’mon. 

           Saunders looks to Preston. He nods. They head around back -- 

           EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME.  

           A great place to bury a body. Stealthily, they make their way 
           to a freight elevator. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Bruh. You for real right now?

           Youtube taps a combination on a security keypad. The elevator 
           doors open. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Abracadabra, fukkers.

           INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - SAME.  

           Shards of light stab through the rickety elevator. They play 
           across our crew’s nervous faces.
           INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - SAME.  

           Brimming with ominous industrial restaurant equipment. We 
           hear a faint murmur at the far end of the room. And, 
           incongruously, a bass-heavy beat.

                                 OOMPH
                        Not trying to jump in some Fight 
                        Club, man. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        I am. 

           Big Man windmills his arms. Oomph slaps him upside the head.  

                                 PRESTON
                             (sternly)
                        Will you two stop playing?

           They move towards the bass, approaching a set of double 
           doors. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Listen. If we ain’t up for this --

           He’s got a point. Maybe it’s smarter - and safer - to call it 
           a night. Oomph looks to Saunders. And that’s all he needs.  

           Saunders pushes through the double doors to --

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME.

           Boxes pushed against the walls. A portable utility light 
           shoots off the wall. A big ass amp producing bass so thick, 
           you feel it in your gut.

           Oh. And also. Forty of New York’s FIERCEST DANCERS. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Hail Cesar. Those about to die 
                        salute you. 

           The dancers are in a circle. 

           In the middle, an impossibly cut young man is floor rocking: 
           rotating his legs while he carrying the weight on his hands.  

           This is DEON (26). 

           He smoothly transitions to a head spin, picking up speed. The 
           crowd shows their love, oohs and ahhs raining down. 

           After a freeze, he catapults upright. 
           A RIPPED B-GIRL hands him a Yankees cap. He dabs up 8 other 
           DANCERS, all wearing Yankees caps.  

           This is the SHOWTIME CREW. Act like you know. 

           Deon clocks Preston, approaches with menacing swagger.

                                 DEON
                        Look what we got here. 

                                 PRESTON
                        What’s good, Deon? 

                                 DEON
                        Leaving floors in rubble. Making 
                        breakers wish they never laced up 
                        they boots. 

           Preston chuckles at the chest puffery. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Never one for modesty, huh?

                                 DEON
                        Not with these moves. 
                             (giving him a once over)
                        Damn sure look like you been eating 
                        your share of humble pie though.  

           Some Showtime dancers crack up. Big Man takes off his jacket, 
           about to throw down. Oomph holds him back with one hand. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Talk is cheap. The dance is what 
                        counts. 

           Deon mimes slapping his ear to get water out of it.

                                 DEON
                        Did y’all hear that? Thought I 
                        heard this ashy diabetic talking 
                        bout ‘the dance.’ 

                                 PRESTON
                        You heard me.  

           The crowd gets real quiet. All eyes on Deon. He smiles wide. 

                                 DEON
                        You ready for this, patna? 

                                 PRESTON
                        Bet. 
           Preston gathers his troops. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll open it up. Then you three 
                        enter with a weave. Then Saunders 
                        you’ll shut it down. And remember: 
                        loose not tight. 

           The team says nothing. Just wide-eyed with fear. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        What’s the problem?

                                 OOMPH
                        Are we ready for this? 

           Youtube, Big Man, and Oomph stay mum. Saunders nods. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        We’re ready. 

           Preston shoots him a look: thanks for stepping up. He then 
           nods to Oomph. She heads to the amp. A BIG DUDE WITH FACE INK 
           holds the cord, grittin’ on her. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Lemme get that.

                                 FACE INK
                        What do you say?

                                 OOMPH
                        Lemme get that...now.

           She snatches it out of his hands, plugs in her phone, and 
           dials up a banger.  

           We hear Oomph’s Litefeet remix of Frank Ocean’s “Pyramid.”

           She cranks the volume dial. (Her name is Oomph for a reason.) 

           Preston starts his rev up. 

           Showtime watch with folded arms, scowled faces.

           Preston launches into a Needle and Thread - the classic move 
           of linking an arm to a raised leg and pulling the standing 
           leg through.

           Then Oomph, Big Man, and Youtube enter, crisscrossing each 
           other on the beat; this is the Weave. 

           Big Man does a running flip on to Youtube’s shoulders. 
           Oomph works her way through an impressive routine - a Buck 
           One into a series of Knee Drops. 

           Preston and Saunders look on with awe and reverence. The OG 
           turns to the up and comer. 

                                 PRESTON
                        You’re up. 

           Nothing. Just sweaty palms and knocking knees. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        You got this. 

           Preston and Saunders share a moment. Saunders nuts up. Walks 
           to the middle of the dance floor.  

                                 DEON
                        Here comes the ace in the hole! 

           Snickers from the crowd as the lanky kid walks around in a 
           circle, getting warm. He launches into a top rock - a 
           precursor move - swaying side to side. 

           And then -- he just stays there. Caught in a loop. 
           Right foot out. Left foot out. Right foot out. Left foot out. 

           SAUNDERS’S POV: His legs doing the same thing, over and over.

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                             (to face ink)
                        Man, kill this noise. Next!

           Face Ink goes to switch out the track. Oomph boxes him out. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Touch my phone, I’ll slap the ink 
                        off your face.

           She deftly scrolls to Saunders’s theme - now with an added 
           bass line and some synth. The track pulses with new energy. 
           Saunders looks to Oomph. She nods to him. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        I got you. 

           And indeed she does. The music moves from the amp to his ears 
           down to his heart - a surge of electricity.  

           Saunders again looks to his feet and then...snaps out of it. 

           He launches into a few Floor Taps. And into an Aunt Jackie. 
           And then lands a Tic Tac Toe.
           And then be brings the mutherfucking ruckus. 

           Letting himself go buck wild on a Kiss of Death. The crowd 
           eats it up. Preston nods sagely. He knew he had it in him. 

           Some of the Showtime dudes are applauding. Some are “holding 
           each other back” in mock anger. And a few are picking their 
           jaws off the ground. One Showtime dancer whispers to Deon.

                                 SHOWTIME DUDE
                        The fuck is this kid?

           Deon smiles ruefully. 

                                 DEON
                        Competition. 

           As Saunders gets lite, the world breaks from reality.

           The boxes against the wall start jumping to the beat’s 
           waveform. All the Showtime guys shrink impossibly small. 

           It’s just him out there, in a flow state. 

           And then he goes in for the kill: The Evil Knevel.

           A collective inhale as the crowd sees what’s happening.

           Spins around on one leg - that’s the Peter Pan. 

           Then, using his working leg, he takes the lateral momentum 
           and straight launches into space. 

           The periphery goes blurry. Sound distorts. We’re on a 
           different plane now. Airborne. 

           He makes it around once. 

           We catch a few faces melting in the crowd. 

           But midway through the second flip, he hesitates. Not quite 
           sure he can land it. Doesn’t quite orbit all the way around. 

           And Saunders ends up eating a slice of warehouse floor.

           A collective exhale. The routine’s over. A new dancer takes 
           “center stage.” Rise dust off their man.

                                 YOUTUBE
                             (reviewing the footage)
                        That was epic!

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Delete that shit. 
                                 YOUTUBE
                        You crazy? A move ain’t a move 
                        unless I capture it on video.

           Preston puts his arm around Saunders.  

                                 PRESTON
                        It’ll come, man. Just gotta learn 
                        to let go. That’s the paradox. Only 
                        way to land it is being willing to 
                        fall on your ass. And then boom. 
                        Let your body do the rest. 
                             (beat)
                        But you got nothing to be ashamed 
                        about. We did what we came to do.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Which is what? 

           Preston looks across the dance floor to find the Showtime 
           dancers. Deon stares right back with that menacing grin.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Make em recognize. 

           And on that, Rise & Shine head back into the summer night. 

           INT. KHALIL'S CONDO - DAY.

           Early Sunday morning. 

           Saunders peeks out of his room. No sign of Khalil. Sleeping 
           in. He tiptoes to the --

           BATHROOM. 

           He looks himself over from every conceivable angle. Then 
           opens up the mirror and grabs his Dad’s cologne. He sprays 
           some into the air, and bunny hops into it. 

           In, then out. In, then out. A pretty fly routine. 

           He opens the door and -- Khalil. Standing right there.

                                 KHALIL
                        Why you messin’ with my Brute?

           Saunders pushes past him, beyond embarrassed. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Meeting a friend. 
                                 KHALIL
                             (wide smile)
                        Be back for dinner, playboy. 

           Saunders, mortified, rushes out the door. 

           EXT. UNIONPORT YARD - DAY.

           Saunders walks through the empty train yard. 

           He puts his hand on the metal giant like a horse trainer in a 
           stable. The train whisperer. 

                                 OOMPH (O.S.)
                        Preparing for the flood?

           Saunders turns to find Oomph in an empty train behind him. 
           She gestures to his high water khakis. His face goes hot. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        My school has a --

           She untucks his shirt. Pops his collar. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Better. 
                             (beat)
                        Is that cologne? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (changing subjects quick)
                        What moves you want to practice?

           Oomph sets her amp down. Scrolls on her phone. 

                                 OOMPH
                        You had me worried for a minute the 
                        other night in Harlem. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I get too inside my head sometimes.

                                 OOMPH
                        We can’t have that now can we?

           She taps play. Instead of a customary Litefeet banger, we 
           get..a slow track.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Not quite the BPM I was expecting. 
           She locks one leg on a pole, pirouettes around. Now, we know 
           Oomph is as badass as they come. But turns out she’s 
           seductive as well. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Gotta be ready for any tempo. Any 
                        beat thrown your way. You feel me?

           She pushes her back against Saunders, starts swaying to the 
           track. He matches her rhythm but keeps his arms at a 
           distance, careful not to misread the situation and overstep.

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        This ain’t prom. 

           She grabs his hands, leads them to her hips. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        Lemme ask you something. 

           She arches her head back and whispers in his ear. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        You in your head right now?

           He swallows hard. Listens to the intoxicating synth beat. 
           Feels her body pressed against his body. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        No. I’m with you. 

           The sleeping trains stay whisper quiet as the two teenagers 
           continue their slow dance.

           PRELAP: Wiz Khalifa’s “Young, Wild & Free” as we begin --

           THE COME UP MONTAGE. 

           -Saunders quickly eats breakfast and zips out the door. 
           Khalil notices: Why’s he so amped about summer school?

           -Rise & Shine hit on the train. In a big way. With Saunders 
           in the mix, their earnings are on point. 

           -Big Man finger counts their stack. Looks to Preston and 
           smiles like a shark. Preston nods back. Alright then. 

           -The Rise & Shine Dubsmash page. More likes, more followers, 
           more views. Living that #dancefluencer life. 

           END MONTAGE. 
           INT. KHALIL'S CONDO - NIGHT. 

           Khalil plates two filets of salmon next to asparagus. The 
           Davis/Coltrane duet “Kind of Blue” plays in the background.

           Saunders rushes out the door but before he escapes --

                                 KHALIL
                        Yo?

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (quick thinking)
                        My boy from Calhoun just got the 
                        new Madden. 

           Khalil mulls it over. Decides to play it cool. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Don’t stay out late. School night. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Bet. 

           Saunders splits. Khalil locks the door after him. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Bet? 

           He shakes his head. Looks like it’s dinner for one. 
           Jazz trumpet spills out of high end Harman speakers. 

           INT. PRESTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

           A Ron Browz fire beat blasts from a bluetooth speaker. 

           Youtube and Big Man are tethered to the TV, clowning each 
           other over a heated Madden game. 

           Saunders, Oomph, Preston, and Keisha dig into styrofoam 
           containers of fried rice and General Tso’s chicken.

                                 PRESTON
                        This my jam right here. 

           Preston tears open two sweet and sour packets, slathers the 
           noxious goo on the fried rice. He hands a few packets to 
           Saunders. Bon appetite. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Flavor to taste. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Is this Szechuan or Hunan? 
                                 OOMPH
                             (cracking up)
                        It’s hood Chinese, man. 

                                 KEISHA
                        You know. Bulletproof-glass window. 
                        Order by the pictures.

           Saunders nods, chomps on an egg roll. Hood Chinese isn’t 
           really a staple at Chez Khalil.  

                                 KEISHA (CONT’D)
                        I’m thirsty. 

           She slowly and theatrically rotates her head to Preston. 

                                 PRESTON
                             (sigh)
                        I’ll get us some drinks. 

           Preston heads to the kitchen. Keisha regards the young man 
           sitting in front of her for a beat. 

                                 KEISHA
                        Haven’t seen him like this for a 
                        minute.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Whatcha mean?

           Keisha shakes her head, smiles. 

                                 KEISHA
                        Got that fire back. That take on 
                        the world look. 
                             (a secret)
                        Might got something to do with you.

           Saunders shakes his head, embarrassed. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Look at this face! He’s blushing. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Shut up. This is just...my face. 
                             (shifting attention away)
                        Lemme ask you something. How come 
                        you let us hit on the trains? 
                        Like...couldn’t you get in trouble?

                                 KEISHA
                        My job’s to make sure the trains 
                        run on time. I take it seriously. 
                        How folks use the trains?

                        Not up to me. Long as you pay your 
                        fare, don’t bother no body, you can 
                        do as you please. The trains belong 
                        to the people. I believe that. 

           Preston returns with a teapot and cans of Arizona Iced Tea. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Arizona Iced or Bronx Hot?

           Saunders points to the kettle. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        My man. 

                                 BIG MAN
                             (yelling)
                        I’ll take Arizona. Two. Two cans.

           The crew continues eating. It’s messy and chaotic and loud 
           and uncouth. And Saunders grins from ear to ear. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY.

           A beautiful summer day. The park is brimming with NYU 
           students, tourists, chess grandmasters, and bucket drummers.

           Saunders and Oomph sit at the fountain, sharing a pair of 
           earbuds that snake from her phone. 

           They both nod to the same beat. She looks to him shyly. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Not like the usual stuff. It’s 
                        darker. More emotional. It’s got 
                        more...bite. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Bite?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        It gets inside you. 

                                 OOMPH
                             (embarrassed)
                        Just something I’ve been messing 
                        around with. 

           We sees how sensitive and careful Oomph is when it comes to 
           beats in progress. Sharing them with Saunders is a big deal. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I dig it. 
           They look into each other’s eyes. A moment. 

           He swallows hard, summons up all his courage. 
           Fuck it, you only live once, carpe diem, do or die.  

           He moves in for the kiss, mere inches from her face when --

                                 DEON (O.S.)
                        What time is it? 

                                 CREW (O.S.)
                        Showtime!

           On the other side of the fountain in the courtyard, we see a 
           throng of about 60 tourists surrounding the Showtime Crew. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Let’s bounce.

                                 OOMPH
                        Come on. You scared? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (yes)
                        No. 

           She pulls a reluctant Saunders through the throng.  

           COURTYARD. 

           Deon has lined up a nervous tourist family of 5, shoulder to 
           shoulder. The crowd eats up the well worn routine.  

                                 DEON
                        And remember. If I don’t make it, 
                        y’all don’t make it.

           He takes a running start and sprints towards the family. 
           Right in front of the bug-eyed Dad, he skids to a stop. 

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. Not sure I can make 
                        it. I just don’t know. 
                             (to the crowd)
                        Whatcha think? Y’all ready for dis?

           The crowd applauds. 

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        Nope. You ain’t ready. One more 
                        time. Y’all ready for this?

           Louder applause. Deon spots Saunders and Oomph in the crowd. 
           He skips over with some flash. 
                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                             (to Oomph)
                        What’s good, shorty? Couldn’t stay 
                        away from these moves? 

           Oomph rolls her eyes. Gestures at the routine.

                                 OOMPH
                        Just cuz you the ringmaster doesn’t 
                        mean you not a clown. 

           Deon smiles broadly. 

                                 DEON
                        Tell you what. Ditch Khaki Jack and 
                        come to Rucker tonight. I’ll show 
                        you some real moves. 

           He goes back to working the crowd.

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        I gotta know you mean it. 
                        One more time. You ready for this?

           The crowd applauds with vigor. A furious Saunders keeps his 
           arms crossed, not having it. 

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        Just what I thought. 

           Deon takes a running start, sprints towards the family. 

           He launches into a double flip, sailing right over the 
           tourist family and landing perfectly on the other side. 

           The crowd goes nuts. He bows theatrically. 

           And as he rises in SLOW MOTION, he looks right at Saunders, 
           that menacing look sending shivers down his teenage neck. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER.

           Saunders and Oomph walk around the park perimeter. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Don’t even sweat those guys. Been 
                        doing the same routine for years. 
                        At this point they’re a tourist 
                        attraction. Statue of Liberty, 
                        Empire State building, Showtime. 
                        What we do is way fresher. 
                                 SAUNDERS
                             (intimidated)
                        If you say so. 

                                 OOMPH
                        I say so. Everyone else will too 
                        once we splash at the Dome. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I don’t know. Steep price to enter. 
                        And even steeper price if we fall 
                        flat. Think it’s worth it?

           Oomph stops in her tracks. She faces Saunders. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Is it worth it? I’ll put it this 
                        way. You see the love my beats get 
                        online? How you think that 
                        translate in dollars? Nada. And the 
                        studio I work at? My boss won’t 
                        even give my SoundCloud a listen. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        That’s messed up. Only a matter of 
                        time before a junior engineer 
                        becomes a senior engineer. 

                                 OOMPH
                        I’m not actually a junior engineer. 
                             (hard to admit)
                        I’m the receptionist.  

           Oomph’s posturing was concealing a much more direr situation. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        Music ain’t a hobby. It’s my way 
                        out. For Big too. If I can’t prove 
                        financial stability, we could 
                        lose...everything. 

           The thought of being separated from Big Man makes her eyes 
           glassy with tears. Saunders grabs her hands. Gets real close. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I won’t let that happen to Big. And 
                        I won’t let that happen to you. 
                        We’re going to Kingdome.

                                 OOMPH
                        Promise?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Promise.
           EXT. BRYANT PARK - SUNSET. 

           Green island in a sea of midtown grey. New Yorkers claim 
           territory on the lawn in front of a large movie screen.    
           Saunders leads Oomph and Big Man to an open patch of grass.  

                                 BIG MAN
                        This is crazy. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Right? Free movie every Monday 
                        night during the summer. 

                                 OOMPH
                        How’d you know about this?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        My parents used to take me here.
                             (wistful)
                        Back in the day. 

           Oomph knows better than to pull on that thread.  

                                 OOMPH
                        So where should we sit?

           Saunders unfurls a blanket from his backpack. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        M’lady. 

           She takes a seat, smiling at the chivalry. But Big ain’t 
           having it. He stares at Saunders: “You gotta be kidding me?”  

           So Saunders produces a Snickers from his backpack. 
           Big Man accepts the bribe. That’ll work. 

           LATER. 

           The trio are sprawled out on the blanket watching “Indiana 
           Jones and the Last Crusade.” Indy and Elsa wander through the 
           Venetian catacombs. 

           Saunders carefully sidles up to Oomph. 

                                 BIG MAN
                             (whispers)
                        Easy does it, GQ Smooth. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (whispers)
                        I don’t need a chaperone. 
                                 OOMPH
                        Hush! 

                          BIG MAN
                                                        SAUNDERS
           Seriously. 
                                              Seriously. 

           Indy and Elsa stumble upon the tomb teeming with hundreds of -

                                 INDIANA 
                             (on screen)
                        Rats. 

           Big Man gulps as his eyes go wide in fear.  

           INT. TRAIN STATION - VARIOUS.

           Trains coming and going. Commuters rushing in out.
           The city never sleeps. And neither does the MTA. 

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB - DAY.

           Saunders rushes in. But before he can get to his seat, Mr. 
           Veasley pulls him aside with a “what gives” look. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Got held up on the train. 

                                 MR. VEASLEY
                        You’re a good student, Saunders. 
                        But if you’re not gonna show up to 
                        class, I can’t pass you. 
                             (rubs his nose bridge)
                        Every top tier research university 
                        you want to go attend is gonna 
                        require AP engineering. You know 
                        that. Please. Help me out here. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I get it. I’m sorry. 

                                 MR. VEASLEY
                        I’m not the only one you need to 
                        apologize to.  

           Veasley nods to Nora, working at her station. Alone. 

           Saunders slides down next to her. He holds out his hand for a 
           fist bump. She doesn’t even look up. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Sorry. 
                                 NORA
                        Are you? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        C’mon. I know you’ve been picking 
                        up the slack here. I just been busy 
                        with some important shit. 

                                 NORA
                        Excuse me?

           Saunders pulls out his phone. Shows Nora one of Youtube’s 
           videos: Saunders hitting on the trains. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Crazy right?

                                 NORA
                        That is crazy. Crazy that you would 
                        leave me solo on this project so 
                        you can...dance on subway cars? 

           That stings. Bad. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I’m still about Herman. But this is 
                        1’s and 0’s. Academic. Out there? 
                        That’s real life. When I’m on those 
                        trains it’s just --

           He puts his hands over his chest simulating a heartbeat. 

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        I feel free. 

                                 NORA
                        Sorry this is so oppressive for 
                        you. Some of us actually enjoy it. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        It’s an out of body experience. You 
                        wouldn’t understand. 

           She nods solemnly. Turns her face away to conceal the tears. 

                                 NORA
                        No. I guess I wouldn’t. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Nora. That’s not what I mea--
                                 NORA
                        When you look like me, you never 
                        know what it’s like to be out of 
                        your body. The world can’t help but 
                        to constantly remind you. 
                             (beat)
                        But I don’t need you to. 

           She gets up and rushes to the hallway. And Saunders is left 
           solo, wallowing in his callousness. He looks at Herman the 
           robot, who lays motionless. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Hell you looking at?

           He gets out his phone and taps out a quick message: “Yo”

           INT. STATION/TRAIN - LATER THAT DAY. 

           We follow Saunders and Oomph as they rush to hop on train. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Can you believe that shit?

                                 OOMPH
                        Maybe she’s right. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        What?!?!?

                                 OOMPH
                        You got a good thing going, 
                        Saunders. But this shit here is 
                        extracurricular for you. We do this 
                        because we have to. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You kidding me? Before this summer? 
                        There was iPhone glass between me 
                        and Rise. Between me and you.
                             (hard to find the words)
                        I had to keep a part of me hidden. 
                        Buried. But the last few weeks...I 
                        don’t know. It’s like I feel awake 
                        for the first time. I feel alive.

           He watches the station lights flash by, white streaks 
           disappearing into the past. 

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        You think I can go back to how it 
                        was? Back to watching on a screen? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been an observer my whole 
                        life. Now I got a stage. 
                             (shaking his head)
                        This is something I have to do. 

           Oomph nods at the confession. It clearly means a lot to her. 
           She scrolls through her phone, presses play on an ethereal 
           Space Odyssey-inflected track. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Then let’s do it.  

           The track builds. Saunders “listens” to an imaginary headset.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Ladies and gentlemen, can I have 
                        your attention? I’m getting word 
                        from NASA. Looks like we’re 
                        experiencing sudden gravity loss. 
                        Hold on to your seat!  

           As the beat drops, Saunders jumps up on the hand rails, 
           hanging upside down from them. 

           Oomph jumps up on the rails as well. 

           With the two of them hanging upside down, the camera rotates 
           180 degrees. The passengers are now “upside down” and our 
           couple is “right side up.”

           Saunders and Oomph astronaut walk using the hand rails. The 
           sides of the frame go blurry as the two teenagers, literally 
           head over heels, go through their lost in space routine. 

           It’s as if the only thing in the world that makes sense to 
           them is this suspended moment. Right here. Right now. 

           But the moment is harshly interrupted as the inter train 
           doors open to reveal a bearded DOOMSDAY PREACHER (70’s). He 
           carries a bible and has fury in his eyes.    

                                 DOOMSDAY PREACHER
                        Behold, the glory of Christ. 
                        His kingdom cometh. Beware the twin 
                        serpents of greed and doubt. 

           Oomph and Saunders jump off the rails and stand up.  

                                 OOMPH
                        Yo. Train’s taken.  

           The preacher takes wind of the insult.
                                 DOOMSDAY PREACHER
                        Beggars, the scourge of society. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Does it look like I’m begging? I 
                        don’t got a piece of cardboard with 
                        a scribbled sob story. I got a 
                        smile on my face. I got a spring in 
                        my step. You the one spouting sky 
                        is falling nonsense.

           The preacher gets right up in Oomph’s face.

                                 DOOMSDAY PREACHER
                        Fire and brimstone. She that 
                        blasphemes the word of God. 

                                 OOMPH
                        You wanna battle, let’s battle. 

           Saunders tries to hold her back. 

                                 DOOMSDAY PREACHER
                        Repent! Repent or judgement shall 
                        be visited upon you. 

           The preacher pushes Oomph. This flips a switch in Saunders. 
           He harshly throws the preacher to the ground. 

           Commuters either relocate or get out their cell phones. 

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SAME.

           The train doors open. Passengers stream out. Saunders and the 
           preacher spill onto the ground, grabbing limbs. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Saunders!

           Oomph points to the far set of stairs where TWO COPS hustle 
           towards the melee. She tries to free Saunders from the 
           preacher’s hold but it’s no use. He’s got Old Testament grip.   

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Go! 

           Caught between a rock and a hard place, Oomph jumps back on 
           the train just as the doors close. 

           The cops separate Saunders and the preacher. And as the train 
           leaves the station, Oomph watches in horror as the cops put 
           bracelets on Saunders. 
           INT. JUVENILE HOLDING CENTER - DAY.

           A COP processes Saunders from the intake line. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I already told you. He started it. 

                                 COP
                        Got multiple witnesses. You and 
                        your girlfriend were disturbing the 
                        peace. And panhandling. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (outraged)
                        I wasn’t panhandling.  
                             (disappointed)
                        And she’s not my girlfriend. 

                                 COP
                        Regardless. Dancing on the train is 
                        a quality of life crime. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Says who?

                                 COP
                        Says Bill Bratton. 

           Saunders throws up his hands. Who?

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Pioneered the broken window theory. 
                        Small crimes lead to big crimes. 
                        Since he became commissioner, we 
                        got an entire squad dedicated to 
                        you people. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Us people? Gimme my ticket so I can 
                        get up outta here. 

           Saunders is livid. Couldn’t get any more upset.

                                 COP
                        This is baby booking. Can’t release 
                        you without a parent or guardian. 
                        Have a seat. Your Dad’s on his way. 

           Turns out he can get more upset. 

           INT. HOLDING PEN - WHAT FEELS LIKE AN ETERNITY LATER.

           Saunders hangs his head, the dark thoughts swirling. 
                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Saunders Bell?

           Saunders braces for the fury. 

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           He buzzes them out of the holding pen into the intake area. 
           Khalil, dressed in business casual, signs release paperwork. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Hey. 

           Khalil sees him, gives him the long once-over.

                                 KHALIL
                        C’mon. 

           EXT. STREET - SAME.

           Khalil and Saunders walk through a busy street. No one pays 
           them any mind. They got their own dramas to contend with.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I can explain. 

           Khalil stops in his tracks. Stares hard at his son.

                                 KHALIL
                        What? Whatcha got to say, man? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t think --

                                 KHALIL
                        No. You didn’t. What happens to 
                        your applications if I can’t get 
                        this expunged? You think MIT admits 
                        kids with a rap sheet? What happens 
                        to your financial aid package? I 
                        can’t afford to send you to school 
                        on my salary. You think about any 
                        of that? You think about anything?
                             (pains him)
                        No. You didn’t. Instead you’re 
                        dancing for singles with a bunch of 
                        knuckleheads. Wearing them goofy 
                        ass shoes. 

           Saunders looks down at his winged shoes. And they’ve never 
           looked so pathetic - so unable to take flight. 
                                 SAUNDERS
                        They’re not knuckleheads. 

                                 KHALIL
                        No? Who are they? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (meekly)
                        The Rise & Shine crew. 

                                 KHALIL
                             (shaking his head)
                        The Rise & Shine crew. 

           He strong arms Saunders away from foot traffic behind 
           scaffolding, the two men bisected by a steel pole.

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        You’re willing to throw it all away  
                        for that? For that dollar in a hat 
                        hustle. Think that’s the realness? 
                             (beat)
                        Lemme tell you something, Saunders. 
                        You got it all twisted. Handling 
                        your business. Keeping your people 
                        safe. Doing the hard thing. Not the 
                        easy thing. That’s the realness. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Being trapped is not the same thing 
                        as being safe.  
                             (a risky gambit)
                        Just ask Mom. 

           That definitely stings. But Khalil doesn’t fold easily. 

                                 KHALIL
                        You live in my house you will 
                        follow my rules. I find you dancing 
                        with those losers again, your 
                        senior year’s gonna be at ROTC.
                             (fury)
                        Believe me.  

           Khalil descends the subway leaving Saunders in the stench of 
           the confrontation. Check mate. 

           INT. KHALIL’S APARTMENT - MORNING.

           Saunders gets ready for school. He’s rooting around his 
           closet. Khalil appears in the doorway, holding the AF1s.
                                 KHALIL
                        Imma hold onto these. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        What? Why?

                                 KHALIL
                        Why? So you don’t jeopardize your 
                        scholarship. Lose everything we’ve 
                        been working towards. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t you get it? I’m trying to 
                        save your life, man. Let’s go. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Huh? 

           EXT. STREET - DAY. 

           Khalil walks Saunders to the Tremont train station. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        This is the B,D. 

                                 KHALIL
                        That’s right. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I need a 2,3. 

                                 KHALIL
                        This drops off Central Park West. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        That’s not my route. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Is now. 

           Khalil’s no fool. Saunders gets what he’s up to.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You don’t need to treat me like 
                        some sort of child. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Act like a man, I’ll treat you like 
                        a man. 

           Saunders starts to protest. Realizes it’s futile. He descends 
           into the station under his father’s watchful gaze. 
           INT. SUBWAY - SAME.

           Saunders shuffles to the train station. He checks his phone. 

           IPHONE TEXT FROM OOMPH: “U ok?”

           Saunders is torn. Not sure what to say. So he pockets the 
           phone. And boards the arriving train.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - BREAK ROOM - DAY.

           Oomph looks down at her phone, waiting for a reply that 
           doesn’t come. A STUDIO ENGINEER hands her a sheet of paper. 

                                 STUDIO ENGINEER
                        Can you take care of this?

           The engineer heads back to the live room and starts 
           bullshitting with an EAGER BAND. All dudes.  

           Oomph looks down in her hands to find: their lunch order. 

           RECORDING STUDIO OFFICE. 

           Oomph punches in the restaurant’s phone number into the 
           office phone. The beeps sync up with a melancholy Litefeet 
           track which continues into --

           INT. UPS FACILITY - DAY. 

           Preston loads boxes onto the truck. He scans them in one by 
           one. The beeps from the scan sync up with the track. 

           INT. BODEGA - DAY. 

           Youtube tags Goya products with a label gun, punctuating the 
           beat. Mrs. Tube and Bo carefully monitor his progress.   

           INT. OOMPH'S APT. - SAME

           Big Man watches cartoons while pouring a Pixie Stick down his 
           throat. This sprinkles some flavor on the track.

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB - DAY. 

           Without Litefeet, Saunders has rededicated himself to Herman 
           who is now moving a good bit more. 

           It’s almost as if he’s doing a herky jerky robot to the beat.
           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT. 

           Everyone’s gone for the night. It’s all dark. Except for one 
           single light in the corner which spots onto a body hunched 
           over a Midi keyboard. Oomph.

           With utter focus, she puts the finishing touches on the 
           melancholy track we just heard.  

           And now we get it. Just as Saunders turns emotion into dance, 
           Oomph has the same special alchemy with music. 

           She lets the final note die out, leaving her in silence. 

           Then she turns off the lights so we can’t see her tears. 

           INT. KHALIL'S CONDO - NIGHT.

           Saunders and Khalil eat dinner. Not a word between them.  

           LATER. 

           Khalil does the crossword. Saunders finishes the dishes. 

           INT. SAUNDERS BEDROOM - LATER.

           Saunders lays in bed looking at his phone. But it’s not a 
           Litefeet clip. It’s the Alvin Ailey Youtube page. 

           PHONE INSERT: Balletic modern dancers perform dramatic 
           choreography on a starkly lit stage. 

           Tight on Saunders’s eyes as he pinch zooms in -- 

           PHONE INSERT: His mother, lithe and muscled. Leaping with 
           abandon, utterly free and unencumbered. 

           And that’s when he feels the eyes. Watching him. He goes to 
           the Alvin Ailey poster of his Mom, graceful and free. He 
           stares hard at the poster, tears welling up.

           Her freedom came at a cost. Not just to Khalil. But to him. 

           IPHONE DING. 

           He grabs his phone to find himself tagged in --

           AN INSTAGRAM STORY: A dance battle taking place at Rucker 
           Park. Rise & Shine are there. And so are Showtime. 

           He’s got a tough decision to make. He looks back at his 
           mother who stares right back at him. 
                                 SAUNDERS
                        I’m done. 

           Time to bury this side of himself. He removes the push pins. 
           Shoves the poster under his bed.

           He carefully opens his bedroom door, looks into the hallway. 
           Khalil’s door is closed, no light from the gap. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT.

           Saunders carefully climbs down the fire escape. 

           At the bottom rung he jumps off, landing as softly as 
           possible. He looks back up, the lights still off. 

           Saunders heads into the night.

           EXT. RUCKER PARK - NIGHT.

           Harlem. 155th and Fredrick Douglass Blvd.

           A basketball court but not just a basketball court. 
           This is hallowed ground: Kareem, Dr. J, and Wilt all plied 
           their trade here.  

           Flood lights splash onto bleachers filled with a few dozen B-
           BOYS, B-GIRLS, and VARIOUS FANS.

           On the court, Showtime are putting the finishing touches on 
           an elaborate routine that has the crowd in a fever pitch.

           Six Showtime dancers fall into formation and execute a 
           perfectly choreographed break dance routine. 

           Deon takes a running start from the baseline and does two 
           aerial flips over all six men.

           He sticks the landing, holds out his arms: ta-da.
           The crowd erupts into applause. 

           IPHONE POV: We see the whole proceedings. 

                                 PRESTON (O.S.)
                        Will you put that down?

           Wider to reveal Oomph, Preston, Big Man, and Youtube all 
           sitting in the bleachers. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Doin’ it for the gram.
           Off of Preston’s withering look, Youtube pockets his phone. 

                                 PRESTON
                        We’re up. 

           The crew doesn’t move.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        What’s the problem? 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Built our routine around Saunders. 
                        And...we got no Saunders.

                                 PRESTON
                        We’re a team with him. We’re a team 
                        without him. So what’s it gonna be?

           Big Man, Oomph, and Youtube all look to each other. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Cried two tears in a bucket. Fuck 
                        it. Let’s take it to the stage. 

           They look at Big Man. He nods. Course he’s seen House Party.

           They hop onto the court - centerstage. Oomph plugs her phone 
           into an amp. A retro-inflected Litefeet banger rings out.  

           Then they launch into Kid’N’Play’s famous one footed hop 
           dance into two thread-the-needles. 

           They go for a few hat tricks and body throws. They don’t 
           quite land. So they tap out. Preston and Youtube take over. 

           They launch into a spirited Litefeet routine: Synchronized 
           Gangsta Lean into an Aunt Jackie. But they’re out of sync.

           The energy is draining out of the bleachers. 

           And that’s when Saunders steps out of the shadows.

           Youtube fist pumps. Big Man runs over, gives Saunders a hug. 
           But Oomph hangs back, maybe hurt from the ghosting. Or maybe 
           sensing the sea change in Saunders. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Where you been?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Busy with school I guess.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Phone stop working too?
           Saunders stands there. Defiant. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t matter. Time to battle. 

           They circle up around Preston. But Saunders stays outside. He 
           summons all his courage for what he has to say. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        This is it for me.  

                                 PRESTON
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        After this, I’m done. 
                             (can’t meet their eyes)
                        I wanted to tell you in person.

           Oomph tries her hardest to fight back tears. And in the 
           smallest voice possible, she states what she believed in her 
           heart was an indisputable fact --

                                 OOMPH
                        You promised. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        This has been the best summer of my 
                        life. But I’m supposed to be on a 
                        different track. 
                             (resigned)
                        Gotta get off while I still can.  

           Oomph steps away, not willing to let him see how badly this 
           hurts. And he watches her go, clearly pained. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Dome’s in three days, man. Crush it 
                        there and a bullshit misdemeanor 
                        becomes a badass extracurricular. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        And what if we don’t crush? What 
                        then? I can’t risk it. I’m sorry. 

           Preston gets up in his face. 

                                 PRESTON
                        So you’re a tourist? A fair weather 
                        fan? Taps out when the going gets 
                        tough? Is that it?
                                 SAUNDERS
                        You don’t know me. You don’t know 
                        what I gotta deal with. 

                                 DEON
                             (calling out)
                        Ay yo. Y’all gonna flirt or y’all 
                        gonna dance? Cahmon now. 

           An impasse. No one makes a move. 

                                 PRESTON
                        I know all I need to know.

           Saunders looks at the crowd. At his team. His former team.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        No. You don’t. None of you do.
                             (to the crowd)
                        I’m not doing this for them. 
                             (to Rise)
                        And I’m not doing this for you. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m doing this for me. 

           Saunders walks to the amp, hooks up his phone. Scrolls to a 
           Litefeet track from SoundCloud. 

           He presses play. An intense Litefeet banger plays. 

           We haven’t heard this one. Head down, Saunders walks to 
           center court, all eyes on him. 

           BEGIN RUCKER PARK DEMOLITION DANCE.

           We circle around our man twice. 

           His hand pounds against his chest to the beat. The track’s 
           beat, yes. But his heartbeat too. 

           He revs up. And then he goes for it. Leaping with abandon. 
           A spastic, furious, impassioned dance. 

           We see the pain and the ecstasy. The brain and the body. 

           His controlling father. His free spirited mother.  

           We pick out faces in the crowd, enraptured by this young man 
           leaving everything on the blacktop. 

           YOUTUBE’S IPHONE: immortalizing the routine in 1’s and 0’s. 

           And finally Saunders ends the routine with increasingly angry 
           Lock In’s. One after the other. Again and again. 
           A jackhammer looking to get to the center of the earth. 
           Trying to bury this side of him once and for all. 

           The song ends. 

           AND THE DEMOLITION IS OVER.

           A hush over the crowd. Silent. Stunned. 
           All we hear is the rush of the Harlem River. 

           And the blood pulsing through the veins of a 17 year old boy.

           With tears streaming down his face, Saunders heads out into 
           the dark night. 

           Alone.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER BLACK. 

           The sounds of a train speeding through a track.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY.

           TWO TWEENS in oversized NBA jerseys hawk bags of M&M’s. 

                                 TWEEN #1
                        One dollar. One dollar. 

                                 TWEEN #2
                        Peanut M&M’s. Only peanut left.

                                 TWEEN #1
                        Raising money for team uniforms. 

           Saunders watches their routine. He used to work these trains. 
           But no longer. Still. Gotta respect the hustle.

           He fishes out a single. Tween #2 skips over, grabs the bill. 
           Offers Saunders a bag. He glumly shakes his head no. 

                                 TWEEN #2
                        You don’t want it?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Nah. 

                                 KID #2
                        So why you pay for it?

           Saunders exits at his stop. Game recognize game. 
           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB - DAY. 

           Saunders and Nora work in the lab. Nora at the computer. 
           Herman, obeying their code, attempts to pick up a box. 

                                 NORA
                        You gonna mope all day? 
                             (nods to Herman)
                        Got one pile of junk not pulling 
                        his weight. Don’t need another. 

           Saunders takes a stab at the code. Presses enter. The robot 
           is stiff and rigid. No traction on picking up the box. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I spent so much time perfecting the 
                        moves. Honing them. Working them 
                        within an inch of their lives. And 
                        I won’t even get a chance to show 
                        em off when it really counts. 

           Saunders tries again. Presses enter. Herman does a bit better 
           but still can’t perform the task. 

                                 NORA
                        Maybe that’s not what it’s about.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Huh?

                                 NORA
                        Maybe the goal isn’t perfect.  
                        Maybe the goal is to just let go. 

           Saunders looks at her. Chewing over the words. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        To let go. 

           Saunders heatedly types code into the console. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY. 

           In the live room, a spirited recording session takes place. 
           Musicians, entourage, producers. All bobbing to the music. 

           Oomph watches hungrily from behind partitioned glass. The 
           studio engineer at the console looks over a menu book. 

                                 STUDIO ENGINEER
                        Left your ProTools session open 
                        last night. 
           Oomph’s eyes go wide. Is that a fireable offense? 

                                 OOMPH
                        Shit. My bad. Everyone was gone for 
                        the night. I was just messing --

                                 STUDIO ENGINEER
                        Try adding a high hat on the 2 and 
                        4. And pitch your snare an octave. 
                             (beat)
                        Pretty dope. 

           The studio engineer hands Oomph his lunch order, goes back to 
           fiddling with the EQ nobs. Oomph smiles proudly. A small win.

                                 OOMPH
                        I’ll go call this in. 

           INT. CALHOUN SCHOOL - LAB.

           Saunders is focused intently on the computer console. 

                                 NORA
                        You can’t introduce that much 
                        randomness. The executive function 
                        will hiccup on the variables. 

           He presses enter. A beat. Then Herman bends at the waist but 
           can’t quite get purchase on the box. Saunders goes back to 
           the keyboard, adjusting his code. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You said it yourself. It’s not 
                        about controlling every single 
                        variable. So what if we try ceding 
                        a measure of control in favor of 
                        guided randomness.   

                                 NORA
                        Guided randomness? 

           Saunders nods, a truth about robotics now dawning on me. But 
           also, maybe, so much more. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        It’s like...does your brain control 
                        your heart? Or is it the other way 
                        around?  

           Nora sees where he’s going. She takes over the console and 
           adds a few lines of code. 
           They go back and forth, their collaboration picking up speed. 
           And then they step back to admire their handiwork. Not half 
           bad. Saunders gestures to the keyboard. 

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        Ladies first.

                                 NORA
                        I insist. 

           Saunders presses enter. And this time, Herman bends at the 
           waist, grabs onto the box and...miraculously picks it up.  

           Nora yelps in joy. Mr. Veasly comes over. 

                                 MR. VEASLEY 
                        What was in that code?

                                 NORA
                        Created a feedback loop where each 
                        node could respond to data from the 
                        other as opposed to the executive 
                        function determining each action. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Loose instead of tight.

                                 MR. VEASLEY
                        Loose instead of tight?

           Saunders remembers a sage piece of advice he was once told. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Gotta be willing to fall on your 
                        ass. Then trust your body to do the 
                        rest. 

                                 MR. VEASLEY
                        Don’t remember that specific 
                        analysis being in the curriculum 
                        but whatever gets you there. Let’s 
                        see if you can replicate with non-
                        standard geometries. 

           Veasley walks away. 

           Saunders should be beaming with joy. But he’s not. There’s 
           something almost melancholy about him. 

                                 NORA
                        What’s the matter? We’re so close.
                                 SAUNDERS
                        It’s easy for Herman to embrace 
                        uncertainty. He’s got no baggage. 
                        No memories of the past, no dreams 
                        for the future.
                             (beat)
                        He doesn’t know what it’s like to 
                        disappoint the people you care for. 

           Nora sees how much missing Kingdome weighs on Saunders. She 
           checks her calculator watch. 

                                 NORA
                        You know, if you hustled, you still 
                        could make it to Coney. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        My Dad would kill me. Plus we gotta 
                        iterate with non-standard 
                        geometries.  

                                 NORA
                        Yeah, you’re right. 
                             (beat)
                        But I could take care of that. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I already let down one team. Can’t 
                        let down another.

                                 NORA
                        You’ve been riding my coattails 
                        since middle school. I’m used to it 
                        by now. It’s up to you, Saunders. 
                        You just have to figure it out. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Figure it out?

                                 NORA
                        Does your brain control your heart? 
                        Or is it the other way around? 

           She used his line on him! The nerve. He thinks long and hard 
           on what that essential question means for him. And then he 
           lets out a small smile, knowing what he has to do. 

           He holds out his fist for a bump. Nora slaps it away. 

           And gives him a hug.

           He slides his Aeron over to Khalil. Gives him the phone.

           Saunders, leaving the storied park in rubble with his moves.

           Khalil’s face clouds over with rage. He keeps watching as we 
           see his distorted reflection in the screen’s glass.

           Khalil walks straight to the elevator, a man on a mission. 

           The elevator doors close. 
           INT. BRONX RIVER HOUSES - AFTERNOON.

           The elevator doors open. 

           Out comes Preston, wearing his UPS browns, exhausted. He 
           walks to his unit. Saunders waits for him.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hell you want?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Need to talk to you.

                        I’m busy. 

           Preston unlocks his door, enters. But he can’t close it. 
           Saunders has put his shoe in the threshold. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Move your foot.

                        Move your foot. 

           Saunders stays put. Preston throws his hands up, walks 
           inside. Saunders follows. 

           INT. PRESTON'S APARTMENT - SAME.

           Preston puts a kettle on boil. Crosses his arms, a statue.

                        please leave me alone. All I want 
                        is to drink my tea in peace and

           The kettle starts to boil. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Make em recognize? Lemme tell you

                        was living in a group home in East 
                        Tremont. Used to tie my shoes to my 
                        wrist while I slept. Otherwise 
                        they’d be gone in the morning. 

           The kettle whistles. He pours the boiling water in a mug. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get me wrong. I came up. Got 
                        me a girl. Got me a team. But that 
                        don’t erase the fact that I’m an 
                        overweight black man from the Bronx 
                        without a high school diploma who 
                        drives for UPS. There’s a limit to

                        it don’t last forever.

           Preston drops a bag in his mug. Watches as the clouds of tea 
           spread and twist in the hot water. Random and unpredictable.

           He looks up at Saunders. Resolute.

                        Not at all.

           Big Man in boxers and a wife beater. Speaks into the 
           intercom. Behind him, Oomph makes macaroni and butter. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        You know I’m with it. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Who’s that?

                                 BIG MAN
                        Saunders! Wants to go to Kingdome! 
                        Let’s do this thing!

                                 OOMPH
                        Hang up.  

                                 BIG MAN
                        You serious?

           She nods. Dead serious. 

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED. 

                                 BIG MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (intercom)
                        You know I’m down for the cause but 
                        cuz is straight trippin’. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Put her on. 
                                 BIG MAN
                             (to Oomph)
                        Wants to get at you.

           Oomph shakes her head. 

                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                             (intercom)
                        No dice, man. 

           Saunders hangs his head. It’s a lost cause. Or is it? 

           He balances his phone on the callbox, scrolls through Oomph’s 
           SoundCloud. And then jams a penny into the intercom button.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Tell her to come to the window. 

                                 BIG MAN
                             (to Oomph)
                        You gotta see this. 

           Oomph comes to the window and looks down at --

           Saunders presses play on the phone, cueing up the emotional 
           track that Oomph played for him at Washington Square Park. 
           The one with “bite.”

           Like Cusack in “Say Anything,” he screams up at the window.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Oomph!

                                 OOMPH
                        Go away! 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I know you’re mad. You don’t have 
                        to talk to me. But I’m not leaving 
                        till you peep this.  

           Saunders takes a deep breath. And launches into a routine 
           where he evocatively portrays two sides of a budding teenage 
           relationship. 

           The courtship. The push. The pull. The love. The pain. 

           He does a one legged flip to indicate head over heels. He 
           then splays out on the ground - a body on life support, one 
           hand indicating heartbeat, the other showing the EKG wave.

           We see Oomph’s stone cold expression begin to thaw. 
                                 BIG MAN
                        Prep school got game. 

           And indeed he does. Cusack never had moves like this. 

           EXT. PROJECTS - LATER. 

           Oomph exits the apartment complex with Big Man. She gently 
           pounds a fist on Saunders’s chest.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I messed up. I didn’t...I’m sorry.  

           Oomph hangs him out to dry for a beat. Then --  

                                 OOMPH
                        I didn’t come down to hear some 
                        mumbly mouth apology. I just don’t 
                        like to disappoint my fans. Don’t 
                        go getting a big head now. 

           Out of the doghouse, he can’t help but smile. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Never. 

           The two of them get close, grinning like school yard crushes.

                                 BIG MAN
                        I don’t mean to interrupt. But if 
                        y’all are done flirting, Kingdome 
                        is in less than two hours and --

           He opens up Piggy Bank. 

                                 BIG MAN (CONT’D)
                        Our stacks are depleted. So 
                        according to my calculations...
                             (his counting routine)
                        We need more cabbage. 

                                 OOMPH
                        I got an idea. 

           Oomph grabs an arm from each and pulls them away. 

           EXT. DYCKMAN TRAIN STATION - LATER. 

           A YOUNG STREETWEAR ENTHUSIAST stands impatiently. 
           In front of him, Youtube holds a shoebox against his chest. 
           This is clearly painful, dropping a kid off at school for the 
           first time painful.

           Oomph, Big Man, and Saunders stand a few feet behind.

                                 YOUTUBE
                             (to the crew)
                        I don’t think I can. 

                                 OOMPH
                        It’s okay. You can do it. 

           Youtube opens up the shoebox revealing the iciest pair of 
           custom tiger camo Jordan 3’s - a collector’s item. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                             (to the buyer)
                        You’ll treat em right? Clean em 
                        with a tooth brush? Never wear em 
                        in rain? Store em in a temperature 
                        controlled dry environment? Not too 
                        dry though! Otherwise it’ll micro-
                        crease the leather.

                                 STREETWEAR ENTHUSIAST
                             (what’s wrong with him)
                        Yeah man. For sure. 

           Youtube gives up the box in exchange for a wad of cash. 
           Streetwear Dude heads out with his new pair of kicks. 
           Youtube, heartbroken, calls after him.

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Send me pics every few weeks okay?! 
                        Just so I know they’re okay.  

           Big Man, Youtube, and Saunders comfort their friend.

                                 OOMPH
                        You did good, man. You did good. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Yo. Are you crying?

                                 YOUTUBE
                             (wiping his eyes)
                        This shit is mad emotional. 

           Big Man rolls his eyes, finger-counts their stack. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Still about fitty short. 
                                 YOUTUBE
                        Imma get em back. 

           Before he can catch the Jordans, Saunders holds him back.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        We’ll make it up on the way. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Registration ends in an hour. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        So we better stop wasting time.  

           PRELAP: One of Oomph’s beats ramps up...

                                 SAUNDERS (CONT’D)
                        And start hitting.  

           INT. TRAIN STATION - MOMENTS LATER. 

           SLOW MOTION inserts punctuating the beat: 

           -Metro-card sliding through the swiper. 

           -Turnstile advancing. 

           -An escalator sucks grey steps into its metal mouth.

           -Train lights blast out of a dark tunnel. 

           -The crash of commuters, exiting and entering. 

           -Winged AF1s and one pair of loafers run on the platform. 

           The doors close shut as we enter --

           INT. TRAIN - AS THE BEAT BREAKS.  

           Our team starts to hit. Even without Preston, they still make 
           a mean troupe.  

           Youtube does a few mournful hat tricks to commemorate his 
           Nike chickadees leaving the nest. 

           But then he comes on strong with a Tic Tac Toe into a Needle 
           and Thread. He lands it and takes a bow. 

           A smattering of applauses from the captive audience. 

           Now Saunders and Big Man take pole position. Literally. 
           The child and the teenager jump onto the vertical metal, 
           hoisting themselves parallel to the ground. 

           Oomph spins them like a pinwheel. First they move slowly. 

           Then they pick up speed, twirling faster and faster. Round 
           and round they go. 

           The commuters are jarred out of their subway stupor and begin 
           to pay attention. Dollar bills start flashing in the air. 

           ANOTHER TRAIN. 

           Oomph throws on a track for herself. She air keyboards to the 
           beat for her rev up. 

           And then jumps on the handrails and links her feet to them.   

           Upside down, she “walks” on the ceiling until she gets to a 
           pole and catapults down into a James Brown split. She pulls 
           herself upright by the collar. 

           And this makes the register go ca-ching.  

           AND YET ANOTHER TRAIN. 

           Saunders’s solo routine. 

           He revs up with his head down, slowly bobbing and weaving. 

           And then he jumps to the base of the pole, every muscle in 
           his body straining as he lifts himself up. 

           And as the beat starts to build, Saunders climbs the pole, 
           hand over hand. 

           He goes higher and higher, his face a contortion of 
           concentration and ecstasy. He’s still climbing. 

           And once again we break from reality. 

           As Saunders climbs the pole, it stretches impossibly higher, 
           the roof of the car no longer the terminus. It seems to 
           stretch to infinity. 

           The commuters must be 100 feet below, looking up in awe. 

           And we feel the speed. The height. The weightlessness. 

           This is what it feels like to get lite. 

           BOOM!
           The fantasy sequence is interrupted as the inter train doors 
           open to reveal the doomsday preacher. 

                                 DOOMSDAY PREACHER
                        Unholy works of the flesh.
                        The scourge must be smote.

           The preacher pushes through commuters to wage his holy war. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        C’mon! 

           Saunders catapults off the pole. He and Youtube book to the 
           opposite inter train doors. Oomph scoops up her amp. Big Man 
           collects the last bill.

           NEXT CAR. 

           Rise enters the next car where they find --

           A group of GIRL SCOUTS hawking thin mints and Samoas. 

                                 GIRL SCOUTS
                        Thin mints. Samoas. $5 a box!

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (to the crew)
                        Keep moving!

           They “pardon me/excuse me” their way through annoyed 
           commuters. Almost to the next car. 

           But as Big Man passes the girl scouts, time SLOWS DOWN.

                                 GIRL SCOUTS
                             (slowed down/distorted)
                        Thin mints. Samoas. Thin mints. 

           This siren call has shipwrecked many a sailor/dieter. 

                                 OOMPH
                        Big! Close your ears! Don’t listen!

           But it’s too late. Big Man reaches into the lunch box, counts 
           out ten singles. Does the deal. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        Two boxes of thin mints. 

                                 GIRL SCOUTS
                             (seductive)
                        No Samoas?
           She’s got a point. Big Man opens the lunch box again. But 
           before he can spend more earnings on his sweet tooth, 
           Saunders grabs him under his arm. 

                                 BIG MAN
                             (thrashing)
                        No!!! The Samoas!!!

           And just as the preacher enters this car, they rush to the --

           NEXT NEXT CAR. 

           Finally. Safe. 

           But then we hear it. The soft strumming. A mournful trumpet. 

           The Mariachis are on this car. 

                                 OOMPH
                        You gotta be kidding me.

                                 BIG MAN
                        They tryin’ to take Pelham 123.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Hurry!

           They navigate to the far side intra train doors --

           IN BETWEEN CARS.

           Saunders opens the doors to the next next next car. And 
           that’s when he spots them on the far side: TWO COPS. 

           They clock him as well.

                                 COPS
                        Stop!

           Straddling subway cars ain’t legal and he’s caught dead to 
           rights. The cops push through the throng of commuters. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Head back!

           But the preacher is gaining ground from the other side. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Keep going!

           Stuck between a rock and a hard place. And that’s when Big 
           Man sees it: The emergency break. 
                                 OOMPH
                        No!

           Too late. Big Man hops on top of a seat and pulls the lever. 

           SCREEEEEEECH!

                                 CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                             (intercom)
                        Ladies and gentleman please remain 
                        calm. There is a situation on the 
                        train. The police have been 
                        notified. We should be moving 
                        shortly. Please be patient.

           Chaos and confusion. 

           Commuters are pissed/scared. The preacher and the Mariachis 
           start beefing. And the cops are closing in. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        This way!

           Big Man abandons the lunch box, climbs on top of the train. 
           The other three look at each other. This is crazy. 

           But they’ve come too far to fall. 

           So they climb. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - AGENT BOOTH - DAY.

           Keisha counts a few bills, hands a MetroCard to a customer. 
           The dispatch intercom crackles alive. 

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        Downtown N train stopped between 
                        25th street and 36th street 
                        stations in Brooklyn. Four 
                        panhandlers in tunnel. Last seen 
                        dancing on West End Line. Three 
                        adults, one child. Police notified. 

           This description gets Keisha’s attention. 

           She walks to a subway map and traces Brooklyn’s West End 
           Line. All the way to Coney Island. 

           She looks to her co-worker who is filing paperwork with 
           headphones on, oblivious to the call. 

           Keisha looks at the intercom, weighing bad options. 
           INT. TUNNEL - SAME.

           It’s 100 degrees and in Smell-O-Vision you’d get hit with a 
           waft of garbage, exhaust, and urine. 

           Rise fires up their torches (iPhone flashlights). The cones 
           of light strobe through the dark tunnel.

           They crouch low and move carefully along the train top.

                        We’ll beat em if we hurry.  

           Behind them, in the not too far distance, we see the crawl of 
           flashlights from the transit cops. 

           Saunders grabs Oomph’s hand. They put the pedal to the metal.

           Eventually, they reach the end of the train.

                                 OOMPH
                        What now?

                        Perhaps avoid it. Fuck you think?

           They shine their phones onto the ground. A family of bloated 
           rat scurries out of the muck. 

           Big Man’s eyes go wide.

           EXT. STREET/INT. UPS TRUCK - DAY. 

           Preston drives the truck. A stocky know-it-all co-worker, UPS 
           GREG (30’s), rides shot. They’re both in brown short sleeves 
           and short shorts. Styling graciously provided by UPS. 

           UPS Greg holds a big bottle of vitamins, his most recent get-
           poor-quick scheme. 

                                 UPS GREG
                        ...and I get a piece of every

                        a piece of every customer they 
                        enlist. On and on and on. First 
                        check I got was like whoa. You 
                        gotta be shitting me.

                                 PRESTON
                        That’s a pyramid scheme.

                        Works great if you’re towards the 
                        top of the pyramid. Plus that’s not 
                        even my side hustle. That’s my side 
                        side hustle. Do home reno too. 

           Preston rolls his eyes.

           INT. TUNNEL - “DAY.”

           Rise walks along the catwalk that hugs the tunnel wall. 

           They’re almost at the platform of the next station when they 
           clock two NYPD COPS among the rush hour commuters.

           INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SAME.

           An express train has been “inexplicably” rerouted to this 
           station. The doors open, rush hour commuters spill out. The 
           cops do their best to keep above the fray but it’s no use.

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Now!

           Rise emerges from the platform and disappear into the throng 
           of people, slipping away undetected. 

           EXT. STATION/GREENWOOD CEMETERY - 5PM.

           Rise exit the crowded station at 36th street. Once they’re 
           above ground, they sprint two blocks away from the melee. 

           They post up near Greenwood Cemetery and catch their breath. 
           Naturally, Youtube posts a story.

           We pick out a few familiar faces: 

           Street ball legend RAF ALSTON (aka Skip to my Lou), NBA 
           eccentric RON ARTEST (aka Metta World Peace), sneaker 
           aficionado BOBBITO GARCIA (aka Kool Bob Love).  

           Basically, if you don’t have an insane alias, what are you 
           even doing here? Take your ass to Coachella.

           Under a Hot 97 banner, FUNKMASTER FLEX mans the 1’s and 2’s. 

           And then we see her. The one. The only. CARDI B.  

           She grabs a mic, throws her head back, and unleashes --

                                 CARDI B
                        Okuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrr!

           Her Bronx trumpet echoes throughout the entire peninsula 
           announcing that the games have begun. 

           The boardwalk jumps up and down to the beat. Any more bass 
           and it’d crack off into the ocean. 

           We dolly zoom into Saunders’s stunned face, completely 
           overwhelmed by the spectacle.  

           Welcome to Kingdome, indeed. 

           But before Rise can jump into the melee and take the crown, 
           we hear that voice.
                                 KHALIL
                        Saunders. 

           Saunders whips around to find his father, clawing through the 
           crowd, a messenger bag on his side. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Dad. 

           They size each other up. Then: Khalil holds out his phone 
           showing the Rucker Park video that’s gone viral.  

                                 KHALIL
                        Saw your video. Turns out I wasn’t 
                        the only one. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Must be the algorithm. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Must be. 

           Khalil looks over at the Rise & Shine crew - Saunders’s 
           newfound family for whom his son is risking everything. 

           The crew knows well enough to give these two some space. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I fucked up. I’m sorry. But you 
                        have to understand why I came. This 
                        is something --

                                 KHALIL
                        No. You listen to me. There’s 
                        something I need you to hear.  

           The longest beat yet. Maybe ever. Saunders braces for it.

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        When I was your age, all I wanted 
                        was to be an emcee. 

           Saunders’s eyes bug out. This is what he wants to say? 

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        KRS. Melle Mel. Slick Rick. If you 
                        headed to Disco Fever on Jerome on 
                        any given weekend? Odds were you’d 
                        catch one of them in a cipher. 
                        Hell, I battled Pete Rock before 
                        anyone even knew who he was.
                             (picturing it)
                        Came correct too. 
           Saunders wraps his head around this version of his father. 

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        But when I took up with your 
                        Mom...well...that dream kinda faded 
                        away. Her dance career was just 
                        starting. Wasn’t room enough for 
                        both of us to be chasing. 
                        Especially when you came along. 
                             (beat)
                        And, if I’m being honest, I 
                        resented her for it. She got to 
                        pursue her passion. 
                             (beat)
                        I...took a job in IT. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Dad --

                                 KHALIL
                        That was my choice. And I’m good 
                        with how things shook out. Truly. I 
                        am. But know this. I’m not gonna 
                        punish someone I love for pursuing 
                        their passion. Not again.  
                             (beat)
                        When I saw you dancing in that 
                        video, it was --
                             (choking up)
                        Saw a side of you I never seen 
                        before. You got something, 
                        Saunders. Something special. 

           He zips open his bag and pulls them out - the winged AF1’s. 

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        I can’t make your choices for you. 
                        But whatever they may be? I need 
                        you to know. I’m down for them. 

           He hands over the shoes. Saunders is tongue-tied.

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        Put em to good use. 

           Saunders hugs his Dad. Holding on to him hard. The man who 
           clipped his own wings so his kid could fly. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        We gotta go!

           Khalil lets go of Saunders, finally ceding control. 
                                 KHALIL
                        Good luck. 

           Saunders doesn’t know what to say. To acknowledge all that 
           his Dad has done for him. Is doing for him. 

           He settles for --

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Thank you. 

                                 PRESTON
                        We gotta register. 
                             (grabbing hands)
                        Link up!

           Like 3rd graders on a field trip, they form a chain link and 
           wade through the crowd. 

           Youtube is at the end of the chain so he can record with his 
           free hand. Preston is the tip of the spear. Saunders, in the 
           middle, turns around as his Dad recedes into the crowd. 

           By looking back, Saunders jerks the chain and accidentally 
           causes Preston to take a bad step - straining his ankle.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Damn!

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You alright?

           He hops a bit, trying to take pressure off the bad foot. 

                                 PRESTON
                        I’ll be fine. 

           Saunders supports him as they make it to the --

           REGISTRATION TABLE. 

           Manned by two VETERANS, imposing old school hip hop heads. 

           This tournament’s been going for decades and these guys are 
           the gatekeepers. They’ve seen it all. They are not interested 
           in any of your bullshit. 

           Youtube and Big Man rush the table.

                                 VETERAN #1
                        Registration is over. 
                                 BIG MAN
                        But...

                                 VETERAN #1
                        Over. 

           The crew steps to the side. 

                                 BIG MAN
                             (to Preston)
                        What do we do? These some hard men.

                                 YOUTUBE
                        It’s like the DMV run by DMX.

                                 PRESTON
                        I got this. 

           Preston limps up to the table. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Fellas. My apologies for the 
                        tardiness. That’s on me. 
                             (plops down a stack)
                        But we got the entrance fee.  

           The veterans confer for a second. Begrudgingly sign them up. 
           Youtube looks over the clipboard.  

                                 YOUTUBE
                        It’s an ampersand. The “and.” 
                        Rise ampersand Shine. 

           The veterans punish him with a withering gaze.  

                                 YOUTUBE (CONT’D)
                        Your way’s fine too. All good. 

                                 VETERAN #2
                        You’re short. Late fee registration 
                        is six hundo. Only five bills here. 

           This is all the money Preston has in the world. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Please. I’m good for it. I’ll hit 
                        you next week. Word is bond. 

                                 VETERAN #1
                        Can’t do it. 

           A tense moment. And then --
                                 DEON (O.S.)
                        I got the late fee. 

           Deon, along with the rest of Showtime, emerge from the crowd.  
           He peels off five twenties. Looks right at Preston.

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        Got history with this OG. Used to 
                        be one of us. Matterafact, last 
                        time he hit with Showtime was at 
                        Kingdome. You remember that don’t 
                        you, Preston? Back in the day? 

           Preston stays quiet. 

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                        We was ready to snatch the crown. 
                        Routine on lock. Center stage. Jump 
                        onto the court and...all a 
                        sudden...we down a man. 

                                 SHOWTIME DUDE
                        Straight Houdini’d. Poof!

           Saunders looks to Preston: Say something! Defend yourself! 
           But Preston says nothing, clearly ashamed at the memory.

                                 DEON
                        That’s right. Bitch ass got stage 
                        fright. Left us high and dry.
                             (beat)
                        We lost that year. But it made us 
                        stronger. Kings of the dome ever 
                        since we 86’d this dead weight. 

           Showtime slap hands. Pumping themselves up. 

                                 DEON (CONT’D)
                             (to Preston)
                        So what you say? Gonna snatch the 
                        crown this year? Or you gonna 
                        disappear again? 
                             (deadly)
                        No excuses this time, patna. 

           Showtime walks into the crowd followed by their entourage.

           We hear an airhorn blow. The street ball game is over. Time 
           for the dance competition. The veterans close up shop. 

                                 VETERAN #1
                        Good luck.  
           Preston nods to the veteran. Then looks to his crew. Oomph, 
           Big, Tube, Saunders. Each realizing what they’re up against. 

           And it’s steep.  

           EXT. KINGDOME - CENTERSTAGE - LATER.

           A group of high school DOUBLE DUTCHERS swing rope. The crowd 
           shows em some love.  

           Cardi B and Flex watch from a cordoned-off area. FAB FIVE 
           FREDDY has joined them as well as JAQUEL KNIGHT (Beyonce’s 
           choreographer). 

           These are the judges. 

           At the far side of the bleachers, Rise has carved out a 
           little section for themselves. Oomph stares at the judges 
           table, wide-eyed in awe at being this close to her heroes.  

                                 OOMPH
                        This is crazy.

           Preston ices his foot. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        You good?

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m good. 

           Saunders takes a seat next to him. The other three continue 
           spazzing out about the nearby talent. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        How is it? For real. 

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s fine. Trust me. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Can I?

           Is he talking about the ankle? Or something else.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Past is the past, man. 
           A blur of feet and legs navigate the impossibly fast 
           revolutions of the nylon jump ropes. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        You sure about that?

                                 PRESTON
                        I can’t explain it. I wanted it so 
                        bad I could taste it, man. Believe 
                        me: I wanted it. I had the goods. 
                        And then, when they called our 
                        name...when it was in front of me --

           He shakes his head. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. I panicked.

                        Took a while for me to bounce back 
                        from that. I was in a stupor, man. 

           He looks to Saunders, his foot throbbing. His heart 
           throbbing. 

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Rise & Shine ain’t just a name. 
                        It’s a wake up call. 

           Saunders chews it over as the Double Dutchers take a bow 
           which brings us to --

           THE CONTENDERS MONTAGE. 

           -The judges score the Double Dutchers.  

           -Then the Rock Steady Crew - famous breakers - take center 
           stage. They windmill, robot, head slide, and baby spin. 

           -Judges confer and take notes. 

           -Some West Coast Krumpers do their thing - stomps, jabs, 
           chest pops, and arm swings. 

           -Rise watch from the bleachers. The competition is fierce.

           -It’s standing room only and still the crowd keeps growing. 

           END MONTAGE. 

           The flood lights turn off. Center stage is dark.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (PA system)
                        New York City. What time is it? 
                                 CROWD
                        Showtime!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (PA system)
                        I can’t hear you!

                                 CROWD
                        Showtime!!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (PA system)
                        What time is it?

                                 CROWD
                        Showtime!!!

           CA-CHUNK. 

           Every flood light fires up full blast. 

           All 9 members of Showtime run out onto the basketball court, 
           hyping the crowd into a frenzy. 

           NYC has real love for Showtime. 

           Deon leads the troupe in an 8-man weave that includes rolls, 
           jumps, somersaults, and flips. 

           They work a routine in perfect unison, like some mixture of 
           Busby Berkeley meets the Harlem Globetrotters. On steroids.

           The crowd goes ape. 

           Cardi, Flex, Fab, and Jaquel applaud from the judge’s booth. 

           Deon conducts the orchestra like a maestro. 

           He points to the left side - 3 Showtime dancers, flat on the 
           ground, start fish jumping over each other.

           He points to the right - same thing. 

           The 6 “fishes” form the base layers of a pyramid. 

           He points up and two dancers comes flying in, adding to the 
           human structure. 

           And then Deon takes a running start and hurls himself onto 
           the top of the pyramid. Boo ya!

           Ladies and gentlemen. 

           That is Showtime.
           BLEACHERS. 

           Thunderous applause. 

           Rise & Shine look more like Seated and Dimmed. 

                                 BIG MAN
                        We have to go after that?

           Showtime run to their corner receiving a hero’s exit.   

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                             (on PA)
                        Next up is Rise & Shine. 

           All five members remain seated, the fear palpable. 

           Impatient murmurs from the crowd. 

           Oomph summons up all the courage she can muster and walks 
           over to the judge’s table, hands Funkmaster Flex her iPhone.  

                                 FUNKMASTER FLEX
                        What’s this?

                                 OOMPH
                        A bomb. Press play to detonate. 

           The judges all look at each other. Who is this fearless 
           warrior queen? Flex plugs the explosive device to the amp. 

           A Litefeet banger comes on. It’s fiercer and more intense 
           than what we’ve heard previously.  

           Youtube and Big Man join her center stage. 

           They launch into a “Monkey in the Middle” routine where Big 
           Man climbs up one of them and then flips to the other.  

           The audience eats it up like a Nathan’s hot dog. 

           We pick out a familiar face in the crowd - Mrs. Tube! 

           And of course Youtube’s Mom sports a flat brimmed Mets cap. 
           She cheers wildly.

           Saunders propels from his seat to join them. 

           He revs up and busts an Aunt Jackie into a Slattery Guap.

           Then all four break into a Brotherhood Shuffle.   

           It’s heated and impassioned. 
           Now time for the group routine. 

           Saunders looks over to the bleacher section for their leader. 

           But it’s empty. Preston nowhere to be found. Another 
           disappearing act. Saunders winces but keeps moving.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                             (to the crew)
                        Follow my lead.  

           Saunders live steps to the basketball hoop. 

           He uses the basketball pole as if it were a subway pole, 
           pirouetting around and around. 

           The crowd goes nuts at the ingenuity. 

           Big Man runs over, catapults off Saunders onto the hoop. He 
           does his signature hat tricks hanging from the rim. And 1! 

           Youtube and Oomph jump on as well, all three spinning in 
           tandem at different heights but at the same speed.  

           From the far baseline, out of the shadows, emerges an 
           overweight man with a severe pimp schlep. He “limp dances” 
           onto the court and posts up at the half court line. 

           The crowd whips up into a frenzy. 

           The crew hears the added excitement. Why the extra commotion? 
           They look center stage as a spot light blasts on --

           On Preston.

           As the track grows, he turns himself into a one-legged crane. 

           That’s right: Just like Daniel-San in Karate Kid. 

           On the working leg, he carefully whips around, seeing the 
           judges, the crowd, the Showtime crew. 

           And after 360 degrees, he stops. Still on one leg. Facing his 
           crew. His team. He looks right at Saunders. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Rise?

           Saunders slowly smiles. He knows what to do.   

                                 SAUNDERS
                        And shine.

           Preston nods. He looks to the others. 
                                 PRESTON
                        Rise?

                                 THE OTHERS
                        And shine!

                                 PRESTON
                             (to himself)
                        That’s right.

           Preston, clearly in pain, crouches low on his one good leg 
           and after a beat -- launches into the air, landing the 
           Webster (tricky one legged flip). 

           The crew runs over to him, propping up their leader. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Not bad for an old man. 

                                 PRESTON
                        Think you can do better prep 
                        school?

                                 SAUNDERS
                        I can try. 
                             (to Oomph)
                        Got a beat for me?

                                 OOMPH
                        Thought you’d never ask. 

           Oomph runs over to the judge’s table. Works her phone. 

                                 FUNKMASTER FLEX
                        Wait. These are your beats?

                                 OOMPH
                        Course. Act like you know.  

                                 CARDI B
                        Hell yeah.

           Flex and Cardi B look at each other: which one of us is 
           signing her. But before they can draw up a term sheet, a 
           familiar beat comes on --

           Saunders’s Theme. 

           But this time it’s more filled out and dramatic. Oomph, Big 
           Man, Youtube, and Preston gather at the sidelines. And our 
           man takes center stage.

           In the background we can see the Cyclone, Coney’s near 
           hundred year old rollercoaster. It climbs to its apex. 
           As it does, Saunders revs up, working himself into a fury. 

           The Cyclone reaches the top. The Atlantic undulates below. We 
           see the crowd swaying to the beat.

           And then CRASH. 

           The Cyclone dives down, twisting and turning. 

           Saunders hits the floor, a rapid fire tornado spin. 

           The Cyclone picks up speed, threatening to fly off the rails.

           Saunders in a flow state, letting go as his limbs take on a 
           life of their owns.

           After the third turn, the train enters a camelback hill.

           Oomph, Big Man, Youtube hold their breath. On Saunders, sweat 
           kicking off him like sparks off a fire.

           The train hops again, barrels towards its final drop. 
           Tight on Preston. Willing him to do it. 

           And as the train hits its final drop, we go SLOW MOTION. 

           As Saunders launches into it. That’s right. 

           THE EVIL KNEVEL. 

           Lights flicker. Sound drops out. The background goes blurry.  

           And for now, it’s just our man. Rotating in space. All we 
           hear is his breathing. He’s alone up here. Untethered.

           The twinkles of cell phones from the crowd creates a 
           constellation of planets and stars. 

           He finishes one turn. Moves to the next. At this speed, the 
           torque is powerful. 

           He wobbles a bit. Then finds his way. Moves through the final 
           turn, twisting and turning at the same time. 

           If only he could stay up here. It’s easier. No expectations. 
           No demands. But it’s time to land. 

           And as he hits the Kiss of Death, we resume REGULAR SPEED. 

           MISSION COMPLETE. 

           In the crowd, the glass on every cellphone shatters, the Evil 
           proving impossible to capture. 
           And even though they’re gonna need serious phone repair, the 
           crowd nevertheless bursts into applause. 

           Rise rushes center stage to hoist up their man, his legs 
           wobbly from being in a different atmosphere. 

           Youtube holds up his phone. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Shatter proof casing. I got it. 

           Oomph puts her arms around Saunders. 

                                 OOMPH
                        I like your moves, Prep School.   

           Saunders looks into her eyes and realizes he has some 
           unfinished business to attend to. And that’s when he grabs 
           her and kisses her like his life depended on it. 

           And maybe it does. 

           EXT. KINGDOME - LATER. 

           The judges confer among themselves, comparing notes and 
           scorecards. A gold trophy on the table in front of them. 

           And in the crowd, we pick out faces of all of our dancers -

           Rocksteady, Showtime, Double Dutchers, Krumpers, Rise. 

                                 CARDI B
                             (on the PA)
                        Ooooopa! This was no easy decision. 
                        Y’all were fire, oh my God. Up to 
                        me, I’d dole out hardware to all 
                        y’all.
                             (beat)
                        But the winner of this year’s 
                        Kingdome Classic is --

           The sound cuts out. We get close on the faces of our crew.

           They’re sweaty and exhausted yet adrenalized with nervous 
           anticipation. Hoping that the Gods of Hip Hop and the Angels 
           of New York City shine down on them on this most holy day.   

           All are looking up, except Preston. He looks at his winged 
           shoes, a slight smile on his face. 

                                                              FADE OUT.
           OVER BLACK. 

                                 CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                        The next - Manhattan Bound F train -
                        will be departing in - 2 minutes. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND F TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT. 

           This is where the F train starts. And where our story ends. 

           A car sits on the tracks, its doors open as passengers board. 

           Rise & Shine sit on the platform bench, in no hurry to board. 
           Saunders holds a trophy. He should be ecstatic. But he’s not. 

           And now we’ll notice that the trophy is silver. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Second place. After all that. 

           Big Man thumbs through a stack of bills.

                                 BIG MAN
                        Second still pays. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        But we had it. We had it.

           Big Man walks into the train, continues organizing their 
           earnings. Oomph drapes her arms around Saunders. 

                                 OOMPH
                        There’s always next year. 
                        Assuming you stay in town. 
                             (cherry on top)
                        And I’m not on tour with Cardi.

           He smiles at the bravado. It’ll suit her well at the heights 
           to which she’s destined to climb. He looks down at his shoes. 
           The winged AF1’s, battle-worn. 

                                 OOMPH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, Prep School. I got 
                        you. 

           She heads in after Big Man. Youtube looks at his phone. 

                                 YOUTUBE
                        Your Evil is off the charts. I’m 
                        already getting partnership offers. 

           And then he sees it, peeking out: the coveted blue check. 
                                 YOUTUBE (CONT’D)
                        I got verified. I got verified!
                             (tearing up)
                        This shit is mad emotional for me 
                        right now. 

           Youtube walks into the train. Big Man gives him a hug. Down 
           to two. Preston limps over, puts an arm on Saunders.  

                                 PRESTON
                        Proud of you, man.  

                                 SAUNDERS
                        Why? Showtime won. We lost.  

                                 PRESTON
                        We didn’t lose. Not even close, 
                        man. Not even close. 
                             (beat)
                        Thank you, Saunders. 

                                 SAUNDERS
                        What for?

                                 PRESTON
                        Taught this old dog a new trick.

           They dab it out. Preston limps onto the train. 

           And now it’s just Saunders. He looks out at Coney, a magical 
           place he won’t soon forget. And even if it doesn’t last 
           forever, in this moment - right here and right now - you can 
           see it all over his face: 

           He’s found his lite.
