          "Emma, what the FUCK were you thinking?!" 

          - My dad, after I tripped balls on my first edible at his wedding. 
           INT. HAZEL’S APARTMENT - HAZEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           HAZEL WILSON (24, cropped hair) stares up at the ceiling. 

           We widen to reveal that she’s on a bed. In her underwear. 
           Specifically, that aggressively floral pair that somehow 
           comes in every Target pack. 

           ILANA (late 20s, in lady boxers) sits at the foot of the bed, 
           about to go down on Hazel. She gestures at Hazel’s panties. 

                                 ILANA
                        Can I take these off? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Maybe just leave them on for a 
                        couple more minutes. 

                                 ILANA
                        But you said... 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yup, downtown. Down there. That’s 
                        the plan. I’m working up to it. 
                              (high, British voice)
                        Be ready in a second, governor! 

                                 ILANA
                        Did you just... voice your vagina? 
                        And have it call me “governor”?

                                 HAZEL
                        Yes. I mean no. 

           Ilana lies down beside Hazel. 

                                 ILANA
                        Hazel. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Ilana. 

                                 ILANA
                        I’m not going down on you in these 
                        circumstances. 

           Hazel tries to keep a straight face. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (very deep)
                        Is this better? 

           Ilana can’t help but laugh. 
                                 ILANA
                        Absolutely not. 

           Ilana moves in to kiss Hazel, but just then Hazel’s phone 
           lights up.

           ON PHONE: A call from “DAD” is incoming. The contact photo is 
           of GABE WILSON (50s, rail-thin, an older male version of 
           Hazel). He isn’t smiling. Not really his thing. 

           Hazel declines the call, flips the phone over, and smiles 
           sheepishly at Ilana. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Sorry. 

                                 ILANA
                        It’s okay... 

           Ilana’s about to lean back in when Hazel jumps up. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m hungry! Wanna eat something? 
                        Other than me out? I was thinking 
                        Thai...

           INT. HAZEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A minuscule NYC apartment that looks hardly lived in. There 
           aren’t even any plants in here for Hazel to kill. 

           Hazel sits on the couch beside Ilana, empty Thai food 
           containers scattered on the coffee table. Ilana is in the 
           midst of showing Hazel pictures on her phone. 

                                 ILANA
                        My mom loved Pride. I have never 
                        seen a woman over fifty literally 
                        drink frozé all day. Look at this 
                        legend. 

           ON SCREEN: Ilana grins beside her MOM, who wears a rainbow, 
           troll doll-esque wig and is mid-happy whoop, ecstatic to 
           support her daughter. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Awww. She looks like she’s the 
                        best. 

           Hazel glances over at a DRAWING she has framed on her wall of 
           a girl and her mom. Ilana notices. 

                                 ILANA
                        Is that your mom? 
                                 HAZEL
                        My six-year-old rendering of her, 
                        yeah. 

           Ilana crosses to get a better look. The drawing is way better 
           than anything a normal six year old could produce. 

                                 ILANA
                        You drew this at six? Have you ever 
                        thought about doing a before and 
                        after type thing? Recreate this, 
                        but with you guys now? 

                                 HAZEL
                        She actually... died. Pretty soon 
                        after I did that. 

                                 ILANA
                        Oh, God. I’m so sorry. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No, it’s fine! I mean, if she were 
                        still around she’d probably be 
                        disappointed I’m not a famous 
                        illustrator by now. My dad 
                        certainly is! 

           Hazel laughs to show she’s okay, which does more to prove 
           that she is not. Ilana sits back down beside her.  

                                 ILANA
                        Do you still draw? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Try to.

           Hazel reaches under the table and pulls out a sketchbook. She 
           pages through to some drawings of a dog playing at a park. 
           They’re good, but so focused on being realistic that they 
           feel a little generic. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        I did these in Central Park last 
                        week. 

                                 ILANA
                        I’ve got an uncle in publishing. 
                        He’s always open to picture book 
                        pitches. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No way. I’ll have to come up with 
                        something! 
                                 ILANA
                        Now there’s a situation where your 
                        voices might come in handy. 

           Hazel smiles as Ilana scooches closer. Ilana touches Hazel’s 
           cheek and moves in for a kiss.

           Hazel keeps her eyes open for a few moments of it, then pulls 
           away. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Wanna watch something? 

           Ilana looks frustrated.

                                 ILANA
                        I’ve gotta be honest, this is 
                        starting to feel a little personal. 

                                 HAZEL
                        What do you mean? 

                                 ILANA
                        You crotch-called me wanting to 
                        have sex tonight, then you changed 
                        your mind, and now you won’t even 
                        let me kiss you. What is going on? 

                                 HAZEL
                        I just -- I guess I’m not -- out. 
                        To everybody.

                                 ILANA
                        Okay. Are you gay? 

                                 HAZEL
                        As the day is long. 

                                 ILANA
                        Cool, so you’re out to me. You 
                        don’t need to be out to anyone else 
                        but yourself. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Right, that’s right. 

           Hazel brushes Ilana’s hair from her face, continuing to talk 
           herself down. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Like, why am I thinking about my 
                        dad right now? Stupid. 

           Ilana looks at Hazel like she’s crazy. 
                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Not in a sexual way! 

           Hazel hurriedly kisses Ilana, and this time Ilana pulls away. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

           Hazel and Ilana stand outside Hazel’s dingy brick apartment 
           building. Hazel’s in the doorway, Ilana on the steps. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Please come back inside. No more 
                        voices. No more stuff about my 
                        homophobic dad. 
                              (Cookie Monster voice)
                        No combination of the two. 
                              (Russian accent)
                        Pinky promise, comrade. 

                                 ILANA
                        I know we’ve hung out a few times 
                        now, but I’m at a place in my life 
                        where I need to be with someone 
                        who’s comfortable with herself. 
                        Happy with herself. Because you 
                        deserve to be. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I would be happy. If you’d just 
                        come back in. 

                                 ILANA
                        That’s not how being happy works, 
                        Hazel. 

           Hazel reaches out and hugs Ilana. 

           Ilana gives Hazel’s shoulder a squeeze, then separates 
           herself and heads down the street, leaving Hazel standing 
           alone.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR (MOVING) - NEXT DAY

           Hazel rides the subway, scarfing down a bagel. Across the car 
           from her, a man and a woman snuggle in their seats. 

           Hazel’s phone VIBRATES with another call from “DAD”. She 
           declines it again.  

           When she looks back up at the couple, she sees the woman lean 
           over to kiss the man. 

           Hazel shoves the rest of the bagel into her mouth and averts 
           her eyes. 
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Hazel sits a couple feet away from MASON (7), the boy she 
           babysits. He grinds crayon into coloring book while she 
           sketches. 

           ON HAZEL’S PAD: She’s drawing a realistic rendering of Mason.  

           She fixes one line, then chews her lip, studying her work. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yo, Mason. Come over here. What do 
                        you think?

           Mason peers over Hazel’s shoulder. 

                                 MASON
                        It’s illegal for you to draw me. 

                                 HAZEL
                        What?! No it’s not. I’m your 
                        babysitter! 

                                 MASON
                        You gonna put me on a milk carton 
                        or something? 

           Hazel stares at him, horrified. 

                                 MASON (CONT'D)
                        ‘Cause if so, they’d totally be 
                        able to find me! Looks great! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Jesus Christ, Mason, you are so 
                        dark. How do you even know about 
                        kids on milk cartons, you’re like, 
                        a minute old. 

                                 MASON
                        I was born in the wrong time. And I 
                        prefer to give interesting 
                        compliments. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m pretty sure you’re gonna grow 
                        up to be a sociopath. 

                                 MASON
                        People don’t grow up to be 
                        sociopaths, they just are ones. 
                                 HAZEL
                        No, something bad happens to them 
                        and then they become sociopaths. 

                                 MASON
                        So are you one? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Are you serious right now? 

                                 MASON
                        Sociopaths are anti-social. You 
                        never talk about friends. Or 
                        family. Or a boyfriend. 

           Hazel opens her mouth, then closes it again. Damn this kid 
           has her number. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’d love to redirect some of this 
                        creative energy into something 
                        constructive. I’m trying to come up 
                        with picture book ideas. You’re a 
                        consumer, what are you looking for? 

                                 MASON

                                 HAZEL
                        That’s... I mean yeah, that’s fair. 
                        I don’t know if I can bring a child 
                        to a pitch meeting, though.

           INT. HAZEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel sits on the couch watching a NATURE DOCUMENTARY that 
           features an adorable baby harp seal and its mother. 

                                 SERIOUS BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The mother harp seal remains glued 
                        to her baby for twelve days after 
                        she gives birth, not even leaving 
                        to eat. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Awwww. 

                                 SERIOUS BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But after that period, the mother 
                        is off to mate again, leaving the 
                        pup stranded. It will not develop 
                        the ability to swim for forty-five 
                        more days. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Wait, what?! 

                                 SERIOUS BRITISH NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Thirty percent of pups will die.

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh my God! 

           Suddenly there’s a KNOCK at her door. Hazel stops the 
           documentary and opens up to see her neighbor AUBREY (late 
           20s, infectious smile) standing there with a package. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Hey! Got another one accidentally 
                        delivered to me. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks so much, sorry about that. 
                                 AUBREY
                        It’s not your fault. Wilson and 
                        Watson, poor mailman can’t keep us 
                        straight. 

           Aubrey hands the package over to Hazel, whose face falls when 
           she sees that it’s from DAVID’S BRIDAL. 

                                 AUBREY (CONT'D)
                        Everything okay? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh, yeah. Anything from my dad 
                        stresses me out, and this is for 
                        his wedding. 

                                 AUBREY
                        My dad’s a lot to deal with, too. 
                        If you ever want talk anything 
                        through, I’m just a three doors and 
                        two letters away!

           Hazel laughs way too loudly. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Because... yeah, yeah I get it. 
                        That was good. 

           Aubrey laughs back, delighted. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Have a good night! 

           Hazel quickly shuts the door and shakes her head at her 
           awkwardness, then forces herself to rip open the package. 

           Inside is a BRIDESMAID DRESS from her dad, ridiculously 
           frilly and an unflattering yellow color. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh God. 

           INT. HAZEL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hazel stands in front of the mirror. The yellow dress is way 
           too small -- it won’t zip all the way up. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh God. 

           She reluctantly calls “DAD” and brings her phone to her ear. 

                                                       INTERCUT WITH: 
           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - WORK-OUT ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Gabe picks up. He’s got a Fox News article open on his tablet 
           while he jogs on a treadmill. He knocks the speed down to a 
           walking pace.

           His bulldog ROMNEY (you better believe he’s named after Mitt) 
           tongues a Kong in a nearby dog bed. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hey Dad. 

                                 GABE
                        Hello, Hazel. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hi. 

                                 GABE
                        You said that. 

           She mouths “yikes” to herself. 

                                 HAZEL
                        So, uh, I’m a bridesmaid? 

           Gabe wipes his brow with a towel. 

                                 GABE
                        That’s why I’ve been trying to call 
                        you all month. We decided that we’d 
                        love to have you in the wedding 
                        party. 

                                 HAZEL
                        But -- I mean Dad, I’ve never even 
                        met her. You only started dating-- 

                                 GABE
                        Eight months ago. Stranger things 
                        have happened. And you know, if 
                        there’s anyone you’d like to bring 
                        home, as a date, I’m sure I can add 
                        him to your flight on Saturday. 

           Hazel blinks at her reflection. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No thank you. 

           An awkward silence falls. 

                                 GABE
                        How does the dress fit? 
                                 HAZEL
                        It’s tiny, I mean, a tiny bit 
                        small. 

                                 GABE
                        Bee insisted you try it on there so 
                        you could go in for any alterations 
                        it needs. We want maximum family 
                        time while you’re here.

                                 HAZEL
                        “Family time”? 

                                 GABE
                        Yes. Time with the family. Charge 
                        my Amex and make sure you pack it. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m... I’m excited to see you. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Me... me as well. 

                                 GABE
                        Do you need a ride from the 
                        airport? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Jenny will get me. 

                                 GABE
                        Great. 

           Silence falls again. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll see you soon. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah. Bye Dad. 

           INT. DAVID’S BRIDAL - NEXT DAY

           A FEMALE EMPLOYEE (30s) leads Hazel through racks of dresses.

                        Alterations aren’t the answer, we 
                        need to get you the same dress in a

                        just way too small.

                        Really, it’s minuscule on you! Like 
                        it belongs to a doll inst--

                                 HAZEL
                        Uh-huh, we’re on the same page. 

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        So who’s getting married?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        My dad. To a woman I’ve never even 
                        seen. 
                              (admitting)
                        Not that I’ve really made much of 
                        an effort. 

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE
                        Maybe it’ll be fun, help you guys 
                        reconnect! Weddings are so special. 
                        They have this incredible way of 
                        bringing everyone together. 

           The Female Employee grabs a larger version of the yellow 
           dress and holds it up to Hazel by a mirror.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE (CONT'D)
                        So much better, right? 

           Hazel forces a smile at her reflection. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Totally. 

           INT. LYFT (MOVING) - DAY

           Hazel sits in a Lyft with her suitcase beside her. She stares 
           at her boarding pass on her phone: “LGA to OAK”. She sips a 
           White Claw wrapped in a paper bag, attempting to take the 
           edge off the reality of traveling home. 

           Her phone rings with an incoming FaceTime call from “JENNY”. 

                                                       INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. JENNY’S ANCIENT HATCHBACK (MOVING) - THAT MOMENT

           JENNY GUZMAN (late 20s, Hazel’s cousin, stoner with a big 
           heart) drives with one hand and smokes a joint with the 
           other. 
                                 JENNY
                        What’s up cuzzz?! Just finished 
                        teaching my last class and now it’s 
                        SPRING BREAK, baby! So psyched for 
                        you to get home to B-Town! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Berkeleyyyy, B-B-B-B-B-Towwwwn! 

                                 JENNY
                        Hold up, have you been drinking? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Nope. 

                                 JENNY
                        Really? Because you’re giving off a 
                        strong drunk-Hazel vibe. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Unsubstantiated allegations. 

                                 JENNY
                        No judgement here girl, I just hope 
                        you’re stopping at three Claws. 
                        After that you get pre-tty wild. 

           Hazel glances into the open backpack at her feet. Close to a 
           dozen empty Claw cans already rattle inside. Uh-oh. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Totally, anything more than that 
                        would be EXCESSIVE! 

           EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DEPARTURES - DAY

           Hazel lugs her suitcase out of the Lyft and makes a beeline 
           for a TRASH CAN, which she dumps all the empty White Claw 
           cans into. A TSA Agent on a smoke break raises his eyebrows 
           at her. Hazel laughs nervously. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Already ditched my liquids before 
                        security, you’re welcome!

           INT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT SECURITY - SCREENING - DAY

           Hazel sways slightly in line for security. The guy in front 
           of her moves up. It’s now Hazel’s turn to organize her 
           belongings to be X-rayed, but she’s a little too sloshed to 
           fully focus. A FEMALE TSA AGENT notices. 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT
                        Large electronics need to come out.
           Hazel thinks for a moment, then dumps her AirPods into their 
           own plastic bin, which she pushes down the line. 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT (CONT'D)
                        No, that’s not... okay. 

           Hazel puts her phone in another all by itself and slides it 
           down. Seeing the guy in front of her take off his jacket, 
           Hazel peels off her own sweatshirt and goes right for the 
           next layer underneath, pulling it up to reveal her bra. 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT (CONT'D)
                        Miss... Miss! 

           She gestures for Hazel to cover herself. 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT (CONT'D)
                        Just the outer layer. Please. 

                                 HAZEL
                        But nine-eleven... 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT
                        Excuse me?! 

           ADJACENT TO THIS PASSENGER SECURITY LINE is the one for 
           pilots and crew. A female flight attendant named WALLIS 
           SCHAFER (early 40s, all smile lines and curls) spots Hazel 
           and the Female TSA Agent and picks up bits of what’s being 
           said-- 

                                 HAZEL
                        But is an aerosol technically a 
                        liquid or a gas?! 

                                 FEMALE TSA AGENT
                        You are really cruising for a 
                        random selection right now. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m so sorry, I’m just genuinely 
                        curious!

           Seeing how badly this young woman is struggling, Wallis 
           crosses over into the regular line. 

                                 WALLIS
                        Hey Monica, I’ve got this one. 

           The Female TSA Agent shakes her head and turns away. 

                                 WALLIS (CONT'D)
                              (to Hazel)
                        Hey hon, I’m Wallis.
           Hazel looks like a puppy who just peed on the carpet. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hi. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to 
                        cause a problem... I think I drank 
                        too much. 
                              (then, quietly)
                        Turns out there are still laws when 
                        you’re drinking Claws. 

                                 WALLIS
                        It’s all right, here, let’s get you 
                        organized... 

           Wallis reaches over to rearrange Hazel’s bins. 

           Hazel stares at her open-mouthed, like this woman is a 
           beautiful guardian angel -- because she basically is.

           INT. OTHER SIDE OF AIRPORT SECURITY - LATER

           Wallis watches as Hazel puts her shoes back on. 

                                 HAZEL
                        You totally saved my butt. Can I 
                        get you a drink or something to 
                        thank you? 
                              (realizing)
                        I won’t be drinking anything else, 
                        obviously. 

                                 WALLIS
                              (laughing)
                        I’m flying in a bit, but I’d be up 
                        for a coffee. 

           INT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT TERMINAL - COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Hazel and Wallis sit across from each other drinking from 
           coffee cups. Hazel’s still-intoxicated brain pieces things 
           together. 

                                 HAZEL
                        So you must’ve been in the crew 
                        line, but you still stopped to help 
                        me. That was so nice of you, you 
                        didn’t have to do that!

                                 WALLIS
                        It was my pleasure. 
                              (gestures at uniform)
                        Helping is my job. 
                                 HAZEL
                        On the plane though, right? 

                                 WALLIS
                        I don’t see it that way. 

           Wallis smiles and takes another sip. 

                                 WALLIS (CONT'D)
                        Where are you headed? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Bay Area, to visit family. I’m 
                        kinda dreading it, honestly. 

                                 WALLIS
                        No kidding, I’m headed to the Bay 
                        Area as well! 

                                 HAZEL
                        For a layover? Or... how long do 
                        flight attendants usually stay 
                        somewhere?

                                 WALLIS
                        It’s actually my new-ish home base! 
                        My son moved to San Francisco and I 
                        wanted to be closer to him. I like 
                        it a lot so far. 

                                 HAZEL
                        That’s sweet that you moved for 
                        your son. 

                                 WALLIS
                        So tell me, what drove you to drink 
                        so much before making it through 
                        security? People usually wait until 
                        they hit the Wolfgang Puck. I’m 
                        honestly shocked that place hasn’t 
                        lost its liquor license. 

           Hazel takes a long sip of coffee and stares at the table. 

                                 HAZEL
                        This girl I really liked basically 
                        told me I’m not “out” enough. I’m 
                        just... not really where I want to 
                        be. Where I need to be. In any 
                        aspect of my life. 
                                 WALLIS
                        You’ll get through it. Share 
                        yourself with the world, and 
                        someone wonderful will want to 
                        share themselves back. I promise. 

           Hazel looks up and locks eyes with her. There’s a spark here. 

                                 HAZEL
                        If I didn’t know any better, I’d 
                        say you were coming onto me... 
                        kidding! Kidding! Totally kiddin--

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT TERMINAL - BATHROOM - DAY

           Hazel and Wallis make out in a one-stall bathroom! Hazel is 
           going for it, still a little drunk, thrilled to be wanted. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (between kisses)
                        I wasn’t kidding...

           She presses Wallis up against the wall and moves her hand 
           down the curves of her body. Wallis reaches to pull Hazel’s 
           shirt off when suddenly--

                                 PA ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
                        This is the final boarding call for 
                        flight two-eight-three to Oakland, 
                        California. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Shit. That’s me. 

           The women disentangle themselves. Hazel shoulders her 
           backpack, but looks reluctant to go. 

                                 WALLIS
                        It’s okay hon. You don’t want to 
                        miss your flight. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It -- it was great meeting you. 
                        Have a nice visit home. 

                                 WALLIS
                        Right back at you. I hope it goes 
                        better than you’re expecting it to. 

           Hazel grabs the handle of her suitcase and turns for the 
           door... then back to Wallis. 
                                 HAZEL
                        This might be weird, but, um, thank 
                        you. This is the first time I’ve 
                        ever done anything like this. And I 
                        think it’s because you made me feel 
                        so... okay. 

           Wallis smiles her infectious smile. 

                                 WALLIS
                        Plus you’re still a teensy bit 
                        drunk, which never hurts. 

           INT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY - DAY

           Hazel hustles down the jetway, shaking her head as she 
           replays the interaction. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (muttering to herself)
                        “Thank you”? 

           But then she can’t help but break into a smile. It felt so 
           good to do something fun, something that made her feel a 
           little less alone. 

           She takes out her phone, navigates to Facebook, types in 
           “WALLIS”... then stops. She doesn’t even know the woman’s 
           last name. 

           Hazel SIGHS and puts her phone away. Oh well. 

           EXT. OAKLAND AIRPORT / INT. JENNY’S HATCHBACK (MOVING) - DAY

           Hazel climbs into the passenger’s seat of her cousin Jenny’s 
           ancient, low-to-the-ground ride. 

                                 JENNY
                        Cuzzzzzzzzz! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Jennnyyyyyy! 

           Jenny pulls out from the curb and looks over to assess Hazel. 

                                 JENNY
                        Dude. What happened? 

                                 HAZEL
                        What do you mean? 
                                 JENNY
                        Something happened! I can see it on 
                        your face! Dare I say, a glow of 
                        sorts?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        There’s no glow. It’s just 
                        skincare. 

                                 JENNY
                        You do not do skincare. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Maybe I started! 

                                 JENNY
                        HAZEL! 

                                 HAZEL
                        JENNY!

                                 JENNY
                        SHARE! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay, fine! I hooked up with 
                        someone!  

                                 JENNY
                        YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! 

           Jenny throws her hands up in celebration, causing her to 
           stray from her lane. A car HONKS. Jenny realizes her error 
           and regains control of the car.  

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Whoops! THIS IS AMAZING! Who. When? 
                        Where? HOW?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        I lied and definitely drank more 
                        than three Claws. I was los-ing it 
                        at security and this flight 
                        attendant stepped in to help me. 

                                 JENNY
                        That is the most rom-com shit I’ve 
                        ever heard! 

                                 HAZEL
                        She was really cool. She said this 
                        thing, “Share yourself with the 
                        world.” 
                                 JENNY
                        GAAAY! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh my fucking God. 

                                 JENNY
                        I’m kidding, I’m so sorry, you know 
                        I’m kidding.

                                 HAZEL
                        I’ve been dreading this trip 
                        because my dad still believes me 
                        being a lesbian was a one-time 
                        thing when I was twelve. But I 
                        think... I’m finally gonna come out 
                        to him. 

                                 JENNY
                        YES! GOD! FIN-AL-LY! 

           Jenny rummages in the glove compartment.

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        I am so proud of you. Making out 
                        with a flight attendant, deciding 
                        to come out to your pops, this is 
                        cause for celebration. 

           Jenny’s paying no attention to the road and the car swerves a 
           bit again. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Can I help with...

           But Jenny has found what she’s looking for: a BIG-ASS DOOBIE. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (laughing)
                        Thanks, but no thanks. 

           Jenny shrugs and lights it for herself. 

           EXT. GABE’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Jenny parks in front of a two-story house with wood shingles 
           and exits the car with Hazel. 

           Jenny’s mom/Hazel’s aunt ALISON (50s, perm that belongs in 
           the 1980s and gel flip-flops that belong in the early 2000s) 
           sits on the porch with a sun reflector, trying to bounce as 
           much weak Bay Area sun as possible onto her bosom. 
           Beside her sits her mother-in-law/Jenny’s grandmother on her 
           dad’s side, MARIANNA GUZMAN (80s, quick-witted and spry). 

                                 ALISON
                        Yayyy! The giiirls have arrrrrived! 

           Both Alison and Marianna stand and the two sets of women 
           embrace. Alison holds Hazel to her very firm chest. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (muffled)
                        Great to see you, Auntie Alison. 

                                 ALISON
                        Oh this is perfect, you came just 
                        in time, I can spill the tea while 
                        it’s still pipin’ hot! 

           Alison finally lets go. 

                                 ALISON (CONT'D)
                        Marianna here is head over heels 
                        for a veteran in her home! 

           Marianna SMACKS Alison’s shoulder good-naturedly. 

                                 MARIANNA 
                        Don’t call it a “home” to my face! 
                        And I’m a grieving widow, not a 
                        schoolyard hussy. 

                                 JENNY
                        Speaking of schoolyard hussies, 
                        Hazel kissed somebody at the 
                        airport! 

                                 ALISON
                        WHAT?! 

                                 HAZEL
                              (quietly)
                        Jenny, why?

                                 ALISON
                        Oh Hazel, was he handsome?! Can we 
                        invite him to the wedding?! I’m 
                        sure your dad would be thrilled to 
                        reinstate your plus-one! 

           Hazel hesitates... 

                                 HAZEL
                        It was actually a...
           She loses her nerve. Everyone stares at her expectantly. 

                                 JENNY
                        If you’re doing what I think you’re 
                        doing, keep going. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        Who was it?

                                 ALISON
                              (concerned)
                        It wasn’t an emotional support 
                        animal, was it? 

                                 JENNY
                        Mom, are you suggesting Hazel 
                        frenched a dog? 

                                 ALISON
                        Well she trailed off! Are “hairies” 
                        still a thing?

                                 JENNY
                        Furries.
                              (to Hazel)
                        Now what you were going to say will 
                        sound beyond normal. 

           Hazel steels herself. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It was a she, not a he. 

           Alison looks surprised for a moment. She recovers, but still 
           looks a little uncomfortable. 

                                 ALISON
                              (forced)
                        That is some big, big news! 

                                 MARIANNA
                              (genuine)
                        I’m happy for you, Hazel.  

                                 JENNY
                              (close eye on Alison)
                        Yes, we are all VERY HAPPY and VERY 
                        SUPPORTIVE! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks, guys. Just please keep it 
                        on the down low for now. I’m gonna 
                        find a time to tell my dad myself. 
                                 ALISON
                        This is one piece of gossip I don’t 
                        think my brother will want to hear 
                        from me. It’ll be fine, though. 
                        Probably. Bee really has made him 
                        less grouchy! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Really? 

           Alison nods vigorously, and Hazel allows herself to look 
           cautiously hopeful. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Hazel, Jenny, Alison, and Marianna go inside, where Gabe 
           makes breakfast with his brother-in-law/Hazel’s uncle VICTOR 
           (50s, man of few words; his wife Alison has enough for both 
           of them). 

           Romney the bulldog waddles right for Hazel, very excited to 
           see her. Hazel kneels down to pet him, grateful to delay the 
           reunion with her dad. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Romney! You’re all grown up, huh 
                        bud? 

           Hazel sees Gabe’s loafers approaching. She stands, and he 
           lifts his arms slightly. She looks surprised... but lets the 
           hug happen. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Hi, Dad. 

                                 GABE
                        It’s good to see you, Hazel. 

           They step back from each other. Gabe smooths down his fleece 
           awkwardly. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I, um, like the hair. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks. I know you’ve always liked 
                        it longer. 

                                 GABE
                        This is... nice. If you’re happy 
                        with it. 
           He and Hazel notice that the entire family is watching them, 
           seemingly rooting for them to get along. Finally Victor steps 
           forward. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Welcome home, Hazel. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks, Uncle Victor. 

                                 VICTOR
                        How is everything going in the Big 
                        Apple? Any traction with your art? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Right now I’m working on a picture 
                        book pitch to share with a 
                        publisher. 

                                 ALISON
                        How cool! 

                                 GABE
                        That’s great.  

           Hazel smiles, relieved to have made it through a positive 
           reunion. 

           Just then Gabe lights up at someone who has just entered the 
           room behind Hazel. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        My Wallaby! Hazel’s here! 

                                 ALISON
                              (to Hazel)
                        Oh, you are going to love Bee. 

           Hazel turns around to see none other than Wallis standing in 
           the doorway to the living room. 

           Hazel blinks to make sure her eyes aren’t playing tricks on 
           her. Nope. Wallis is still there. 

                                 GABE
                        Bee, meet my daughter Hazel. Hazel, 
                        meet my fiancé Bee. 

           Hazel tries her best to keep her jaw from fully dropping. 

           Wallis is Bee. 

           Gabe’s fiancé. 
           Hazel’s soon-to-be step-mom. 

           Yiiikes. 

           Hazel and Bee stare at each other, both trying to hide their 
           horror and shock. Bee is doing a better job than Hazel is. 

           The family looks from woman to woman, unclear on what’s 
           happening. 

           Finally Bee breaks eye contact with Hazel and smiles at Gabe. 

                                 BEE
                        I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. Hazel 
                        just looks different from all the 
                        pictures I’ve seen. 

           She gestures to a PHOTO posted on the fridge of early high 
           school Hazel standing awkwardly beside her father. Hazel has 
           long, flowing hair. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (raspy)
                        I-I cut my hair a little while ago. 

           Jenny looks at Hazel strangely. 

                                 JENNY
                        You need some water, girl? 

           Hazel waves her off. 

                                 BEE
                              (to Hazel)
                        Well I think it looks great. 

           Hazel forces herself to blink and smile back at Bee. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thank you.

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel sits on a couch looking shell-shocked between Gabe and 
           Bee. Victor, Marianna, and Jenny sit on another couch 
           opposite them. 

           The family is playing charades, and Alison’s up. She mimics 
           arguing with someone, then turns around to play the other 
           person who argues back. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Argument! 
                                 JENNY
                        She said it’s a movie. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        There are arguments in every movie! 

                                 ALISON
                        Not like this one! 

                                 JENNY
                        You can’t talk, Mom!  

           Alison mimics holding her hands to her chest, pining. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Sad? 

                                 JENNY
                        Romeo and Juliet. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        That’s a play! 

                                 JENNY
                        Oh my God! 

           Jenny’s phone RINGS with the timer. 

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Great. We didn’t even get one. 

           Alison shakes her head at her team. 

                                 ALISON
                        It was Titanic! 

                                 VICTOR
                        How was that Titanic? 

           Jenny eyes her grandmother, who looks like she’s gearing up 
           to say something. 

                                 JENNY
                              (to Marianna)
                        Do not say that was a boat. It’s a 
                        movie, abuelita. 

                                 MARIANNA
                              (not convinced)
                        Mm-hm. 

           Alison sits down on the arm of the couch. 
                                 ALISON
                        First I was Leo and Kate arguing 
                        about who gets to float on the 
                        piece of wood, and then I was old 
                        Kate clutching the necklace I was 
                        painted naked wearing. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Oh. Wow, I did not get any of that.  

                                 JENNY
                        What about miming “I’m king of the 
                        world”? AKA the most iconic scene 
                        from Titanic?  

                                 ALISON
                        Well I think that’s certainly up 
                        for debate. 

                                 JENNY
                              (to Hazel)
                        Ugh. You guys are up. 

                                 BEE
                        I’ll go! 

           Hazel watches with dread as Bee stands and picks a slip of 
           paper. Bee reads it, then puts it down and mimes cranking an

                        Movie. 

           Bee touches a finger to her nose. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Nose? 

                                 HAZEL
                        She’s saying you got it right. 

           Bee holds up four fingers. 

                                 GABE
                        Four words. First word is... 

           Bee mimes making out with someone. Hazel looks horrified. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Kiss. Embrace.

           Okay, Bee is now full-on gyrating. Hazel wishes for death. 
                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Sex! 
                              (to Hazel)
                        That was so clear, why aren’t you 
                        guessing these? 

           Bee holds up the number four. 

                                 HAZEL
                        F-fourth word. 

           Bee mimes having a roof over her head. 

                                 GABE
                        House? Sex house? Sex cave! 
                              (to Hazel)
                        What do you think?!

           Jenny is dying laughing. Bee side-steps, miming house after 
           house. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Street. Neighborhood. CITY! SEX AND 
                        THE CITY! 

           Bee touches her nose and goes to pick up the next slip of 
           paper. Gabe looks at Hazel, irritated. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        How did you not get that? You 
                        wasted most of your adolescence 
                        watching that crap. 

           Hazel folds in on herself even more. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Guess I’m just really bad at 
                        charades. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel and Jenny stand across from each other in a second-
           story guest room. 

           A poster of Bob Dylan is hung up, a stack of middle school 
           textbooks from the class Jenny teaches sits on a desk, and 
           the closet is populated by Jenny’s clothes.  

                                 HAZEL
                        Looks like you’ve already made 
                        yourself at home for the week. 
                                 JENNY
                        Dude, what’s up? You are the best 
                        at charades. One time you got 
                        “She’s the Man” just from me 
                        pointing at myself. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I mean, that was pretty clear.

                                 JENNY
                        What is going on with you?! You 
                        know I’ll get it out of you. The 
                        question is whether you share now 
                        or later, after I’ve called you out 
                        in front of everyone else! My 
                        mom’ll probably go live on Insta, 
                        she just learned how!

           Hazel swallows. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Remember how I told you I made out 
                        with someone at the airport? 

                                 JENNY
                        Vividly. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay. Well. That person... 
                              (then)
                        Was Bee. 

           Jenny blinks at Hazel. Then bursts out laughing. 

                                 JENNY
                        Oh my God, you are still so bad at 
                        messing with people! You have to 
                        pick something that might actually 
                        be believable, I can’t even--

                                 HAZEL
                        Jenny. I am dead. Serious. 

           Jenny stops laughing and actually takes in how upset and 
           scared her cousin looks. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        She was the flight attendant! But 
                        she introduced herself as Wallis, 
                        not “Wallaby” or “Bee”...

           Hazel trails off helplessly. 
                                 JENNY
                        Oh my God. You’re dead serious. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yes! Unfortunately, yes! Is this 
                        all a bad dream? Will I wake up 
                        soon?! 

           Hazel pinches herself, then reaches over to pinch Jenny. 

                                 JENNY
                        OW! What are you doing?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        I don’t know! I’m desperate! 

                                 JENNY
                        How could this have happened? 
                        Haven’t you seen any photos of 
                        her?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        No! I haven’t even spoken to my dad 
                        in like, months. “Irish Catholics 
                        don’t do feelings” -- he’d rather 
                        talk to a bottle than to me. Plus 
                        it seems like things have moved 
                        super fast between them.

           Hazel gestures at a PHOTO on the wall of her eight-year-old 
           self beside Jenny and the rest of the family on a field (Gabe 
           holds a soccer ball), then at another framed SELF-PORTRAIT 
           Hazel did as a tween of herself with much longer hair. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        And whatever pictures Dad showed 
                        her don’t look anything like me! 

           Jenny shakes her head in disbelief. 

                                 JENNY
                        You have to say something. Uncle 
                        Gabe -- your dad -- is about to 
                        marry this cheater in six days! 

                                 HAZEL
                        I haven’t talked to him about 
                        anything since my mom died two 
                        decades ago! How am I supposed to 
                        bring something like this up?! 

           Hazel struggles to suck in enough oxygen. 
                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Plus, he seems a tiny bit... nicer. 
                        I’ve been home for multiple hours 
                        and I haven’t seen him with a 
                        scotch yet. He hugged me. 

                                 JENNY
                        Hazel. This is HUGE. You’ve gotta 
                        at least feel him out. 

           Hazel stares at the ground, a knot growing in the pit of her 
           stomach. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - GABE’S STUDY - LATER

           Hazel sits across from Gabe in his study. Everything seems to 
           be made out of oak and dark leather. A portrait of Ronald 
           Reagan hangs on the wall. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (re: portrait)
                        I see you got a new one. 

                                 GABE
                        The other’s in my office at the 
                        business school. Need to keep up my 
                        conservative brand. The university 
                        pays me for my “diverse” 
                        perspective! 
                              (then)
                        What did you want to tell me?

                                 HAZEL
                        Dad, before I came here, I...
                              (then)
                        Sorry, I’m gonna need a drink for 
                        this.  

           Her eyes instinctively move to a glass-fronted cupboard to 
           Gabe’s left... which is completely empty. 

                                 GABE
                        I don’t keep anything in the house 
                        anymore. Off the sauce, can you 
                        believe it? Bee helped get me 
                        there. 

                                 HAZEL
                        T-that’s great. 
                                 GABE
                        I’m, well, I’m sorry that my 
                        drinking hurt our relationship at 
                        times. After your mom died, I let 
                        it get a little out of hand. 

           Hazel swallows, unsure whether it’s okay to agree with this. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        You can go ahead and say whatever 
                        you’ve got to say sober. Are you in 
                        some kind of trouble? 
                              (joking)
                        Is it about a boy? 

           But Hazel has lost her nerve. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I, I just wanted to ask... if I 
                        could keep getting your help with 
                        rent. Since this pitch hasn’t 
                        turned into anything yet. 

                                 GABE
                        You’ve been getting monthly direct 
                        deposits from me since college. Why 
                        are you suddenly all worked up? 

           Hazel forces a smile and shrugs, ashamed on so many levels. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Just my pride, I guess. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel reenters the room to find Jenny splayed out on the bed, 
           scrolling through her phone. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I couldn’t do it. 

                                 JENNY
                        Hazel! 

                                 HAZEL
                        He’s not drinking anymore, there 
                        isn’t even any alcohol in his 
                        office! She helped him do that.

                                 JENNY
                        What happened to coming out to him? 
                        If this doesn’t prove liking women 
                        wasn’t a phase, I don’t know what 
                        would.
                                 HAZEL
                        This would be the worst possible 
                        way to come out! He made it very 
                        clear when I was twelve how 
                        embarrassed and ashamed he’d be to 
                        have a gay daughter. 

                                 JENNY
                              (realizing)
                        And if that gayness led to you 
                        blowing up his relationship, 
                        however accidental...

                                 HAZEL
                        Exactly. Whatever happened with me, 
                        Bee’s clearly good for my dad. I 
                        just need to keep a low profile. 
                        Survive the week. Please, promise 
                        you won’t say anything. 

           Jenny pauses. Then--

                                 JENNY
                        Okay. It’s not my secret to tell. 

           Hazel hugs her. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thank you. 

           Jenny heads over to the couch by the window, which she cracks 
           open. She puffs a joint out into the cool Berkeley air. 

           When she turns back, she sees that Hazel is staring at her. 

                                 JENNY
                        You want? 

           To her own surprise and Jenny’s, Hazel reaches out to accept 
           the joint. She takes a hit, coughs, then sits back on the 
           couch. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It’s fine. I’m gonna be fine. How 
                        hard can it be? 

           Jenny puffs the joint again, then hands it back to Hazel. 
           Hazel breathes in deeper this time, hands it back, and closes 
           her eyes.

           POV HAZEL as she opens them again: Spots of colors and lights 
           subtly become more noticeable as she looks out at the tree-
           filled neighborhood. 
                                 JENNY
                        Good, right? 

           Hazel nods. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT DAY

           Hazel enters just as Romney finishes inhaling the last of his 
           food. She kneels down to pet him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Good breakfast, bud? 

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        He’ll eat anything, including one 
                        of my cufflinks the other month. 
                        Came out bright gold. 

           Hazel looks up to see that Gabe stands by the breakfast 
           table. He holds out a gift card. 

           Bee sits at the table wearing a look of pure dread -- she 
           already knows what’s coming. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I was brainstorming activities for 
                        you gals and remembered my finance 
                        students talking about this Korean 
                        spa place in Oakland. 

           When neither Hazel nor Bee respond, Gabe keeps going, still 
           holding out the card to Hazel. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        You ladies love to get pampered, 
                        right? This will give you a chance 
                        to bond. 

           Finally Hazel takes the gift card from him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thank you. 

           Just then Alison walks in and sees what Hazel’s holding. 

                                 ALISON
                        O-M-G, you’re going to Banya? Did 
                        you know--

           INT. “BANYA” KOREAN SPA - LOBBY - DAY

           Hazel and Bee accept plastic flip-flops from the HOSTESS 
           behind the spa’s front desk. 
                                 HOSTESS
                        No clothing inside the spa. 

           Hazel and Bee stare at her, both praying they misheard. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m sorry, did you say “no”-- 

                                 BEE
                        As in none, at all...

                                 HOSTESS
                              (are you stupid)
                        Clothes. 

           So they’re about to be butt-naked in front of each other. 

           INT. “BANYA” KOREAN SPA - POOLS - MOMENTS LATER

           Hazel and Bee are (tastefully shot) completely nude and 
           seated in the same small pool. It’s extremely awkward. 

                                 BEE
                        The water is remarkably clear. 

           Hazel glances down at it, then snaps her neck right back up. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (Dracula voice)
                        Yes, yes it is. 

                                 BEE
                        What was that? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Sorry, I kinda do voices when I’m 
                        nervous. 

           Silence falls again... until Hazel can’t take it anymore. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        I just need to know for sure. Did 
                        you know who I was? 

                                 BEE
                        I swear I didn’t. I never would 
                        have done that. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Well, you still, I mean... why did 
                        you do it? Cheat on my dad? Is he 
                        your... beard? 
                                 BEE
                        I’m bisexual, but it had nothing to 
                        do with that. I really do love your 
                        father. 
                              (then)
                        I suppose I’m not the first person 
                        to do something completely stupid a 
                        week before my wedding. But now 
                        that it’s me who did the completely 
                        stupid thing, it somehow feels 
                        extra completely stupid. 

           More silence as the women struggle to figure out how to 
           possibly interact with each other. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It couldn’t have come out of 
                        nowhere. Were you having second 
                        thoughts or something? 

                                 BEE
                        No, it was truly just an off day. I 
                        was feeling lonely and insecure, 
                        just like you were. I’m one hundred 
                        percent certain that I want to 
                        marry him. 

           Hazel thinks this over.

                                 HAZEL
                        You guys do seem good together. 
                        You’ve chilled him out a little.

                                 BEE
                        Yes. Yes, I think so.

                                 HAZEL
                        So, just so you know, since you’re 
                        sure you want to go through with 
                        this -- I’m keeping what happened 
                        to myself. My dad doesn’t even know 
                        I’m gay. 

                                 BEE
                        Really? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah, really. Have you met him?

                                 BEE
                        He knows about my orientation. 

           This hits Hazel pretty hard. 
                                 HAZEL
                        Wow. Okay. 

                                 BEE
                        He really doesn’t know his own 
                        daughter’s? 

           Hazel shakes her head. 

                                 BEE (CONT'D)
                        Have you...

                                 HAZEL
                        I’d really rather not get into it, 
                        if that’s okay. 

                                 BEE
                        Okay. It’s just a bit of a shock. 

                                 HAZEL
                        All of this is a bit of a shock. 

           Just then a female employee gestures for them to get out of 
           their pool. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Oh... we have to move onto the next 
                        pool already? 

           The female employee gestures more aggressively. Bee stands 
           and Hazel shields her eyes -- then sees that a large group of 
           much older, naked women are approaching their pool. 

           Hazel is forced to stand and follow Bee, covering as many 
           bits of herself as possible. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel, Jenny, Alison, Victor, Marianna, and Bee gather on the 
           couch in front of the TV. Gabe pops a disc into the DVD 
           player. 

                                 GABE
                        Bee had all the old VHS tapes 
                        transferred so we could watch home 
                        videos. 

           Alison CLAPS with excitement. Gabe sits down with the remote 
           and navigates to play “1997”. 

           ON SCREEN: Toddler Hazel and Jenny giggle as they ricochet 
           around the same living room that the family sits in now. 
                                 JENNY
                        Awww it’s us, Hazel! 

           All of sudden Toddler Hazel gets a serious look on her face. 
           She abandons her playmate and retreats under the coffee 
           table. Toddler Jenny looks puzzled. 

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God, privacy poo! 

                                 HAZEL
                        What? 

                                 ALISON
                        That’s right, she always did that! 

                                 JENNY
                        If you had to go, you would retreat 
                        so hard from whatever you were 
                        doing! 

           Everyone but Hazel laughs at the memory, including Bee. 

           On screen, Toddler Jenny tries to wiggle under the table to 
           join Toddler Hazel. 

                                 TODDLER JENNY (FROM SCREEN)
                        Why you under here?

                                 TODDLER HAZEL (FROM SCREEN)
                        Go AWAY! 

           Back in the present-day living room, Gabe chuckles. 

                                 GABE
                        No need to be embarrassed, everyone 
                        poops. 

           Finally Hazel lets herself smile, then laugh at her overly-
           serious younger self shoving her cousin away on screen. 

                                 HAZEL
                        You did not know when to back off. 

                                 JENNY
                        Still don’t! 

           For a moment the entire family is smiling and laughing... 
           until Hazel’s mom NAOMI (30s, the human embodiment of 
           sunshine) enters the home video’s frame. Cameraman Gabe 
           trains the lens on her. 

                                 GABE (O.S., FROM SCREEN)
                        Hello there. 
                                 NAOMI (FROM SCREEN)
                        Oh hellooo! 

           Naomi mugs and vamps for the camera. Toddler Hazel excitedly 
           climbs out from under the table, grabs a piece of paper, and 
           hands it to Naomi. 

           Camera zooms in to show that it’s an EARLY DRAWING of Hazel’s 
           that features unrealistic, creepy-cute, long-legged hairy 
           monsters. 

                                 NAOMI (FROM SCREEN) (CONT'D)
                        Beautiful! Look at those long legs. 
                        Bet they’re fast huh? 

           Toddler Hazel nods solemnly, still holding it out for her mom 
           to take. 

                                 NAOMI (FROM SCREEN)  (CONT'D)
                        For me? I love i--

           CLICK. The TV screen goes dark. 

           Everyone looks over to see that Gabe’s hand is shaking around 
           the remote, his face ashen at the sight of his late wife. He 
           clears his throat. 

                                 GABE
                        Sorry. I forgot... I forgot she was 
                        on that one. 

           Nobody else knows if they should say something, much less 
           what. Bee puts her hand on Gabe’s. Hazel looks down at the 
           carpet. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - SECOND STORY BALCONY - NIGHT

           Hazel closes the bathroom door and pads back toward her 
           childhood bedroom-turned-guest-room.

                                 BEE (O.S.)
                              (hushed)
                        Gabriel, I am serious. 

           Curious, Hazel peers down from the balcony, from which she 
           can see a small patch of the first-story kitchen. 

           BELOW: Gabe pours himself a glass of scotch. Bee stands 
           behind him, hands on hips. 

                                 GABE 
                        I haven’t had a glass in months, 
                        all right? 
                                 BEE
                        My point exactly! 

           Gabe spins around and takes a big sip right in Bee’s face. 

                                 GABE
                        Okay? Did the world end? Christ. 

                                 BEE
                        Gabriel? 

           Gabe’s face slowly crumples at his actions and the weight of 
           the day. Bee holds her hand out like a disappointed parent. 

                                 BEE (CONT'D)
                        Gabe. 

           Gabe hands the still-full glass to her. Bee tosses it into 
           the sink, then wraps her fiancé in her arms. 

           ABOVE: Hazel tears her gaze away and walks back to her room, 
           disturbed. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NEXT DAY

           We’re close on Hazel’s face as Jenny’s hands play with 
           Hazel’s hair, framing it this way and that. Hazel has her 
           eyes closed. 

                                 HAZEL
                        What are you doing with it? 

                                 JENNY (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry about it! Keep ‘em 
                        shut!

           Suddenly Hazel hears a loud BUZZ and her eyes flash open. 

                                 HAZEL
                        NO! 

                                 JENNY (O.S.)
                        No sudden movements! 

                                 HAZEL
                        I did not give you verbal consent 
                        to shave me! 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL that Jenny has indeed shaved the back of 
           Hazel’s head. Hazel sits with her back to the mirror. 

           Jenny’s own hair is wrangled into a pony-hawk (á la American 
           Idol’s Sanjaya). Both women are dressed to go out -- Jenny in 
           a jumpsuit and Hazel in jeans and a blazer.
                                 JENNY
                        Your hair gave me verbal consent. 
                        Close them! 

           Hazel grudgingly closes her eyes. Jenny spikes Hazel’s hair. 

                                 HAZEL
                        What kind of product are you using? 

                                 JENNY
                        Can you please just be a little 
                        more zen about this make-over? 
                        You’re gonna love it.  

                                 HAZEL
                        But it feels like gel, like sixth 
                        grade, looked-it-up-online-years-
                        later-and-it-definitely-causes-
                        cancer gel. 

                                 JENNY
                        I’m making you look awesome. Okay, 
                        open! 

           Hazel does... and is dismayed. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I look like an eight year old boy 
                        in 2003. 

                                 JENNY
                        But in a good way, right?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        In a GAY way! My dad’s gonna hate 
                        it!

                                 ALISON (O.S.)
                        Girls, hurry up! 

                                 JENNY
                        Too late to change it let’s go! 

           Hazel takes one last look at her reflection and follows Jenny 
           out of the room. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Why is Bee’s son planning the 
                        bachelorette party again? 
           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Hazel and Jenny walk in to find Bee, Alison, and Marianna 
           gathered around COLLIN (early 20s, bedazzled bomber jacket, 
           twink with major cruise ship host energy). 

                                 COLLIN 
                        Hi hi hiiiiiii! 

           He yanks Hazel and Jenny into a quick group hug, then steps 
           back to fully take them both in. 

                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        Jenny, yes? And Hazel! Um, STEP-
                        SISTER MUCH?! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah, that’s um, me. 

                                 COLLIN
                        I love it. Oh my God. So excited 
                        for tonight. Are you excited?! 

                                 JENNY
                        Hell yes!  

           Collin rummages in a bag and starts handing out printed tank 
           tops. Bee’s reads “I’M THE BRIDE, BITCH” and everyone else’s 
           say “BRIDE OR DIE”. 

                                 ALISON
                        These are perfection! 

           Alison tosses a hot pink boa around her neck. 

                                 ALISON (CONT'D)
                        I am ready to parrr-tayyyy! 

                                 MARIANNA
                        Give me one of those. 

                                 COLLIN
                        You got it, babe! 

           Collin tosses Marianna a boa, then drapes a couple around 
           Jenny and Hazel. Just then a KNOCK sounds on the open door. 

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        Everybody decent? 

                                 BEE
                        Yes, hon. 
           Hazel shoots Jenny a look re: Collin. Hazel can’t imagine her 
           dad reacting very well to how out and proud he is. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (quietly)
                        This should be good. 

           Gabe walks in and raises his eyebrows at Hazel’s hair. 

                                 GABE
                        Did you do something new there? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Um, Jenny did. 

           Hazel swallows, but Gabe just nods... then turns and smiles 
           warmly at Collin. 

                                 GABE
                        Hey buddy, bring it in here!

           Gabe pulls Collin into a hug -- a quick man-hug, but a hug 
           nonetheless. Hazel blinks, surprised. Jenny looks pointedly 
           at Hazel: see, he’s changed! 

                                 COLLIN
                        Liv-ing for that shirt, Gabe! The 
                        Brawny man called, he’s pissed you 
                        stole his look! 

           Gabe looks down at his shirt, pleased. 

                                 GABE
                        Why thank you. How’s the dance 
                        studio going?  

                                 COLLIN
                        Enrollment is sky-rock-et-ing. I 
                        think the kids have a shot at State 
                        this year! I can honestly say it 
                        literally all hinges on Sarah L.’s 
                        ability to moonwalk by the end of 
                        April. 

           To Hazel’s continued shock, Gabe smiles through his poor 
           understanding of Collin’s answer. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m thrilled for you and wish Sarah 
                        L. all the best. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Thanks, “Pop”! 
           Bee comes over to put an arm around her son and gestures at 
           her shirt. 

                                 BEE
                        These are great, Collin. And you 
                        remembered our rule, right? No... 

                           BEE (CONT'D)
                                                        COLLIN
           Strippers.
                                             Strippers!

           INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT

           A MALE MODEL lies across a small, draped stage, fruit 
           scattered all around him. He lifts himself up enough to take 
           off his shirt, tosses it away, and reassumes the position. 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL that each bachelorette party guest sits 
           behind an easel with a glass of wine. This is a sip and 
           paint. Collin grins at Bee. 

                                 COLLIN
                        So there’s kiiind of a stripper. 

           Bee takes a big sip of wine, squints at the model’s newly-
           nude torso, and carefully adds a nipple to her painting. 

                                 BEE
                        You know what, I’ll allow it. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Nice attention to detail! 

           Meanwhile Hazel frowns from her meticulous pencil sketch of 
           the model wearing a shirt to the model who is no longer 
           wearing a shirt. Her drawing is good: still realistic, but 
           with slightly more stylized proportions. 

           Collin comes to look over Hazel’s shoulder. 

                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, you are really good! 

                                 BEE
                              (calling over)
                        She’s a professional artist. 

           Alison leans way back in her seat to check out Hazel’s work. 

                                 ALISON
                        Ooh-la-la, you capture the male 
                        form so well, you’d never know--

                                 JENNY
                        Mom.
           Alison winks and goes back to her own painting. Hazel takes a 
           big gulp of wine. 

                                 COLLIN
                              (to Hazel)
                        It’s super cool that you’re an 
                        artist! If you wanna get out ahead 
                        of it, I think it’s safe to assume 
                        the pants will be removed in like T-
                        minus five minutes. 

           Hazel glances over at Bee, who’s back to painting and 
           chatting with Alison. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (to Collin)
                        How do you and your mom... I mean, 
                        enjoying a stripper together, you 
                        guys must be super close. 

           Collin grins and plops down beside her. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Total trial by fire. My adoptive 
                        mom left us when I was only five.

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh my God, I’m so sorry. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Don’t be. We became best friends 
                        after that. She was already a 
                        flight attendant, so she taught my 
                        classes in terminals and I did my 
                        homework at thirty-six thousand 
                        feet. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Are you serious? 

                                 COLLIN
                        Looking back, it was crazy. When I 
                        went to public high school I was 
                        ahead of everybody, too! And 
                        somehow she made it to almost every 
                        single one of my diving meets.

                                 HAZEL
                        She’s... a really special person. 

           Realizing how earnest this came out, Hazel takes another huge 
           sip of wine. Collin grabs a nearby bottle and tops her off. 
                                 COLLIN
                        When I moved to SF from Austin I 
                        was super worried about her. Then 
                        she followed me here -- she always 
                        needs somebody to take care of, 
                        even in her free time. 

           Hazel nods. Collin spots Bee helping Alison blend paints and 
           laughs. 

                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        See? Anyway, I figured I should 
                        find her somebody her own age, so I 
                        made her a Tinder account... enter 
                        your dad, who makes her really 
                        happy! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Tinder? 

                                 COLLIN
                        Yeah, Gen X is weirdly classier 
                        about it. 

           Just then the model removes his pants, sooner than expected. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Is my dad... always cool? About you 
                        being gay? 

                                 COLLIN
                        He gets a little overwhelmed 
                        sometimes, but I tend to have that 
                        effect on people. Thanks for 
                        breaking him in for me!

                                 HAZEL
                        What do you mean?

                                 COLLIN
                        Oh, sorry... you’re gay too, right? 
                        The hair, your aunt, my beeping 
                        gaydar?  

           Hazel looks shocked. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Um, I... yeah. I’m just not that 
                        out. Especially to my dad. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Really? Wow, my bad. Here I was 
                        assuming he’s chill. 
                                 HAZEL
                        It’s fine. When I was a kid, he 
                        made it very clear that it wasn’t 
                        okay. This one time... 

           Hazel stops herself, realizing she’s not ready to share. She 
           shrugs and drinks more instead. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Long story short, you’d think 
                        growing up in the Bay Area would’ve 
                        made me out and proud, but the 
                        place doesn’t always matter-- 

                                 COLLIN
                        It’s more about the people. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Right. So my romantic life’s pretty 
                        screwed. 

           Collin nods, sympathetic. 

                                 COLLIN
                        For whatever it’s worth... I think 
                        you should try to have another 
                        conversation with him. I mean, he’s 
                        marrying a bisexual woman. 

                                 HAZEL
                        But does he think your mom’s 
                        bisexuality was “just a phase”? 

           Collin thinks this over.

                                 COLLIN
                        I’m not actually sure. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I think the answer matters. A lot. 

           Just then Hazel and Collin see that the model is going for 
           his underwear. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Oops, told him not to do that, give 
                        me one sec. 
                              (hurrying over)
                        Luca. Luca, no full frontal! 
           INT. THE CASTRO’S “THE LAST CALL” - NIGHT

           The party has migrated to a neon-lit, gay San Francisco bar. 
           Everyone is gathered around a large punch bowl, sipping from 
           their own straw. 

                                 ALISON
                        This is dangerous! How do I know 
                        how much I’m drinking?! 

           Alison almost falls off her chair and has to grab onto Jenny 
           for support. 

                                 JENNY
                        I think it’s safe to say “way too 
                        much”? 

           Hazel looks pretty wasted too, but she keeps sucking down 
           more punch. 

           Just then THREE WOMEN in their 30s/early 40s approach the 
           table. LAURIE and VIVIAN are a couple, and the other is a 
           strikingly tall woman in cat eye glasses named NOELLE. 
           Thrilled, Bee jumps up to greet them all. 

                                 BEE
                        You guys made it! 

                                 NOELLE
                        Hurried over from SFO as soon as I 
                        found out my crew was delayed! 

                                 LAURIE
                        We’re sorry we missed the sip and 
                        paint, our babysitter was late. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        Hey Collin! 

           While Collin greets the women, Bee turns to the core group. 

                                 BEE
                        These are my college besties Laurie 
                        and Vivian, and my fellow flight 
                        attendant gal pal Noelle. 

           Greetings are MURMURED amongst all the women. Noelle plops 
           herself down in the open seat beside Hazel. 

                                 NOELLE
                        How do you fit into this wild 
                        bunch? 
           This suddenly feels like a big question for Hazel. She 
           scrambles to string together a coherent answer. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m just, uh, the soon-to-be 
                        stepdaughter. 

                                 NOELLE
                        Great to meet you! 

           Bee points across the table at Laurie. 

                                 BEE
                        You pumped and dumped, right? 

                                 LAURIE
                        Benji is six! 

                                 BEE
                        You breastfed him for four of those 
                        years! 

                                 LAURIE
                        You are the worst! 

           Laurie downs a shot that Vivian passes her and raises the 
           empty glass at Bee to prove her point. 

           As the older women joke around good-naturedly, Hazel 
           continues to drink. 

           INT. THE LAST CALL - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

           Music THUMPS. Drink in hand, Hazel dances opposite Jenny. 
           What they lack in ability they make up for in over-the-top 
           enthusiasm. 

                                 JENNY
                        YOU BETTA MAKE IT RAIN, HAZEL! 

           Hazel hands Jenny her drink and does the sprinkler move. She 
           pretends to get “stuck” pointing at Collin. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Oh OKAY, you want me to come out 
                        there?! 

           Bee watches from the bar beside the other women as Collin 
           shimmies out onto the dance floor to join Hazel and Jenny. 
           Noelle laughs at the spectacle.  

                                 NOELLE
                              (quietly, to Bee)
                        Your stepdaughter is smoking hot. 
           On the floor, Collin grinds on Jenny while Hazel does the 
           “shopping cart” dance move. Bee tries to play it very cool. 

                                 BEE
                        Is she?

                                 NOELLE
                        She’d totally be your type, if she 
                        wasn’t your fiancé’s daughter. 

           Bee looks pale. Noelle smacks her on the arm playfully. 

                                 NOELLE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, lighten up! I’m just joking 
                        around! 

           Out on the dance floor, Jenny speaks into Hazel’s ear. 

                                 JENNY
                        Ten o’clock, cute girl. 

           Hazel looks across the room. A CUTE GIRL is indeed talking 
           with a couple friends. She stops to smile at Hazel, who 
           awkwardly puts one more imaginary item in her cart and then 
           stops dancing, self-conscious. 

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        Thoughts? 

                                 HAZEL
                        She is cute, but I don’t even know 
                        if she’s gay. 

                                 JENNY
                        Hazel, we are in The Castro. How 
                        many more rainbow flags do you 
                        want? 

           It’s true, there are a lot of rainbow flags hung up in here. 

                                 HAZEL
                        That could just be another slightly 
                        less festive bachelorette party 
                        with straight attendees. 

                                 JENNY
                        Please just say hi? 

                                 HAZEL
                        No, okay? 
                              (then)
                        I’m sorry. I gotta pee. 

           Hazel hurries away. 
           INT. THE LAST CALL - WOMEN’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Hazel pokes at her spiked hair in the mirror. Suddenly Bee 
           enters. 

                                 BEE
                        Hey! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hi. Are you having fun? 

                                 BEE
                        Absolutely, how about you? 
                              (off Hazel’s nod)
                        Noelle thinks you’re cute.

           Hazel doesn’t return Bee’s smile. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Bee... is my dad treating you okay? 

           Bee’s smile disappears, too. 

                                 BEE
                        Of course. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I heard you guys arguing last night 
                        and it sounded kinda serious. 

                                 BEE
                        Oh, that. Just a little backslide. 
                        Your dad still overdoes it 
                        sometimes, but he’s getting a lot 
                        better. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay. I just wanted to check. 

           Suddenly the bathroom door flies open and Alison (cosmo in 
           hand) walks in accompanied by Jenny. 

                                 ALISON
                              (wasted)
                        What’s going on in heeeere? Is 
                        Hazel coming out to you Bee?! 

                                 JENNY
                        MOM!  

                                 ALISON
                        Oh noooooooo, I’m sorry! Shhhhhh! 
                                 HAZEL
                        It’s fine, Auntie Alison. Bee 
                        already knows. 

           Alison throws an arm around Hazel. 

                                 ALISON
                        You think your daddy’s bad, if your 
                        grandmother was still alive, WOOOOO-
                        WEE! But I think it’s so exciting 
                        to have a lesbian niece! 

                                 JENNY
                              (re: Alison’s drink)
                        Do not finish that.   

                                 ALISON
                              (to Hazel)
                        When’re you gonna tell him? Ooooh, 
                        Bee, you’re half gay, maybe you 
                        could help her! Or half help her...

           Jenny forcibly removes Alison’s cosmo. 

                                 JENNY
                        I’m going to help you out by 
                        blaming your horrible phrasing on 
                        this beverage. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m not planning to tell him 
                        anymore, Auntie Alison. 

           Alison frowns. 

                                 ALISON
                        Oh. Really? Booooooo! 

           Hazel forces a smile. 

           INT. GABE'S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Hazel stirs in the bed beside Jenny to a KNOCK on the door. 

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        Hazel? 

           Jenny groans and throws a pillow over her head as she rolls 
           away from the sound. 

           Hazel struggles to sit up, rubbing her eyes. She’s pretty 
           damn hungover. 
                                 GABE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hazel, wake up.

           Hazel pads to the door and opens it. Gabe is suited up in 
           full athletic apparel. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (whispering)
                        What? 

                                 GABE
                        I thought we could go for a run. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It’s seven in the morning after the 
                        bachelor and bachelorette parties. 

                                 GABE
                        And the Wilson Family Soccer Cup is 
                        fast approaching!

                                 HAZEL
                        Are we actually doing that? 

                                 GABE
                        It’s a tradition! Come on! Up and 
                        at ‘em! 

           Hazel realizes she’s not going to be able to get rid of him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        All right, I have to get dressed. 

           EXT. UC BERKELEY - DIRT TRACK - DAY

           Hazel wheezes as she tries to keep pace with Gabe. He’s not 
           going all that fast, but it’s still a real hungover struggle 
           for Hazel. She’s not looking so hot. 

                                 GABE
                        How’s dating going? I know you 
                        didn’t want to bring anyone to the 
                        wedding, but there must be 
                        somebody. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Not really, Dad. 

                                 GABE
                        I just want to see you taken care 
                        of. A nice guy. You can’t wait 
                        around until everyone gets too old 
                        and bitter.

                        Men become even more badly-behaved 
                        after the first round of divorces. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 GABE
                        And say you want kids... at twenty 
                        four, you have about ten more years 
                        to start dating, get my blessing of 
                        course, and then--

                                 HAZEL
                        I think I might puke. 

           Hazel runs to the side of the track and holds onto a fence to 
           steady herself. Gabe joins her, but she waves him ahead. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Just keep going. Keep...

           For a second it really doesn’t look good, but then Hazel is 
           able to swallow. 

                                 GABE
                              (chuckling)
                        You guys “went hard” last night, 
                        huh? 

                                 HAZEL
                        It was a bachelorette party. 

                                 GABE
                        Right, and I’m sure Collin made it 
                        as over the top as he is. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I thought you liked him. 

                                 GABE
                        Doesn’t mean he’s not over the top. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Because he’s gay? 

           Gabe looks uncomfortable. 

                                 GABE
                        It’s the whole... act. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Of being gay. 
                                 GABE
                        Sure. If you want to back me into a 
                        corner, yes. 

                                 HAZEL
                        And you also think Bee just 
                        experimented in college, right? 

                                 GABE
                        What?

                                 HAZEL
                        The fact that she’s been with 
                        women, had a kid with one -- that’s 
                        “experimentation” to you. 

                                 GABE
                        I don’t think this is an 
                        appropriate conversation for us to 
                        be having. 

           Hazel sighs. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah. You’re right. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           A hungover Hazel, Bee, Jenny, and Alison sit around the 
           dining room table, staring in awe as Marianna cracks an egg 
           into a glass, then sucks it down like it’s nothing. Hazel 
           tries not to gag. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        Anybody else want one? 

                                 JENNY
                              (weak)
                        No thank you, abuelita. 

           Gabe, freshly showered, enters with Victor. 

                                 GABE
                        How’s everyone doing? Hazel told me 
                        you guys got wild last night. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Us boys had steak, cigars, 
                        football, the works.  

                                 BEE
                              (to Gabe)
                        Did “the works” include alcohol? 
           She tried to phrase it casually, but Gabe’s hackles 
           immediately go up. 

                                 GABE
                        We can discuss that later. 

                                 BEE
                        Just curio--

                                 GABE
                        I said later. This is not a 
                        conversation for the family, what 
                        is wrong with you? 

           Bee and Gabe stare each other down. It’s extremely tense. 
           Alison finally pulls out her phone for a distraction. 

                                 ALISON
                        Here’s a taste of our night... 

           Alison shows a photo that includes all of the group’s 
           renderings of the sip and paint model, captured in various 
           stages of undress. 

                                 MARIANNA
                              (proud)
                        The buck-naked one is mine. 

                                 ALISON
                        Hazel’s was fantastic as usual. 

           Gabe barely glances at the photo. 

                                 GABE
                              (to Hazel)
                        So you can appreciate the male 
                        form. 

           Another tense silence falls. 

                                 VICTOR
                        I’m thinking of making my famous 
                        arroz tonight. There’s some stuff 
                        I’m missing, though -- coriander, 
                        more garlic--

                                 HAZEL
                        I’ll come with you. 

           INT. BERKELEY BOWL - PRODUCE - DAY

           Victor and Hazel walk through the produce section of a hippy-
           dippy grocery store. Victor stops to study gloves of garlic, 
           carefully working to pick out the best one. 
                                 HAZEL
                        My dad drank last night? 

           Victor nods reluctantly. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Quite a bit. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Ugh. I guess I really thought Bee 
                        was helping him. 

                                 VICTOR
                        She can make a difference, but I 
                        don’t know that she can change him. 
                        First he has to want to change. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Do you think they’re good together?   

                                 VICTOR
                        That’s a difficult question, 
                        observing from the outside. No 
                        relationship is perfect. I think of 
                        it more like a big balance sheet. 

                                 HAZEL
                        How do you mean? 

                                 VICTOR
                        Do I like that Alison inserts 
                        herself into every interpersonal 
                        conflict in Rohnert Park? Not 
                        particularly. She got herself 
                        involved in a guinea pig custody 
                        dispute last week. And there were 
                        more legal gray areas than you 
                        would think. Huge time suck. 
                              (then)
                        But I do admire her belief that 
                        people are good at their core, if 
                        they’re just informed about the 
                        right thing or pointed in a better 
                        direction.  

                                 HAZEL
                        Huh. Hadn’t thought about Alison’s 
                        love of gossip that way. 

                                 VICTOR
                              (laughing)
                        You see? And maybe nobody else 
                        does. Your father’s balance sheet 
                        is his own, as is Bee’s.

                        I believe your instincts are right -
                        - they’re happier with each other 
                        than without. 

                                 HAZEL
                        So as long as that’s true...

           Victor selects the perfect clove and puts it into his basket. 

                                 VICTOR
                        But of course, that’s just my two 
                        cents. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks, Tio Victor. 

                                 VICTOR
                        You got it. 
                              (checking list)
                        Can you look for cumin? 

           INT. BERKELEY BOWL - ANOTHER AISLE - DAY

           In search of cumin, Hazel stops in front of a syrup display. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Cruelty free syrup? But how... 

           Suddenly someone past the display catches Hazel’s eye: a 
           woman we’ll later come to know as LINDSAY (mid 20s, vibrant), 
           currently studying two different types of almond flour. 

           We get CLOSE IN ON Lindsay’s face and match to--

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - HAZEL’S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           YOUNG LINDSAY (12)’s excited face. We WIDEN again to take in 
           a full circle of middle schoolers, including YOUNG HAZEL 
           (also 12, cute mess of braces and flyaway mermaid hair) who 
           sits directly across the circle from Lindsay. 

                                 TWEEN BOY
                        Hurry up Hazel, spin! 

           A TWEEN GIRL claps her hands.

                                 TWEEN GIRL 
                        Seven minutes in heaven! Seven 
                        minutes in heaven! 

                                 YOUNG HAZEL
                        I’m going! 

           Hazel spins a plastic Diet Coke bottle.
           POV BOTTLE: It passes pimpled, mortified, and/or thrilled 
           faces until it lands on... Young Lindsay. 

           The room erupts into CHEERS and “OOOOOOOH”s. Hazel and 
           Lindsay’s faces both burn with excited embarrassment. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - HAZEL’S CLOSET - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Young Hazel and Lindsay face off in a closet with a single, 
           dim light illuminating them. 

                                 YOUNG HAZEL
                        Do you wanna just wait seven 
                        minutes? 

                                 YOUNG LINDSAY
                        That’s cheating, right? 

                                 YOUNG HAZEL
                        I guess s--

           Lindsay leans forward and kisses Hazel. 

           At first Hazel keeps her eyes open, hardly believing this is 
           happening to her -- then closes them too and kisses back. 

           She’s living 100 percent in this beautiful, tweenage dream 
           come true... 

           Until Gabe throws open the door. 

           Hazel and Lindsay immediately part, but Gabe has already 
           seen. He sways in the doorframe, consumed by intoxicated 
           rage. Behind him, all of Hazel’s friends look scared. 

                                 GABE
                        What the FUCK is going on here?! 

                                 YOUNG HAZEL
                        Nothing, Dad--

                                 GABE
                        Get the hell away from her! 

           Gabe yanks Hazel out of the closet by the arm. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Over a decade of church and I find 
                        you in a closet with a girl?! What 
                        were you thinking?!

           Mortified, Hazel takes in Lindsay and her friends’ shocked 
           faces. They’re all frozen with no idea what to do and no 
           power to act even if they did. 
                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I ASKED YOU A GODDAMN QUESTION! 

           Gabe lunges for her again and Hazel flees from the room. 

           EXT. GABE’S STREET - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Hazel runs like hell down the street with Gabe chasing after 
           her. Tears streak her face. 

                                 GABE 
                        STOP, RIGHT NOW! 

           Sober and young, Hazel is more agile and takes a sharp turn 
           into a side yard. 

           She leaps into a tree and clambers for higher ground -- then 
           freezes again as Gabe lumbers past. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Hazel. HAZEL ANNE WILSON! 

           Hazel squints her eyes shut in fear and pain. 

           When Gabe finally moves on, Hazel lets the arms of the tree 
           hold her as sobs wrack her body. 

           INT. BERKELEY BOWL - BACK TO PRESENT

           Present-day, adult Hazel is right where we left her in front 
           of the syrup display. 

           She swallows and takes a step toward adult Lindsay... just as 
           another, SLIGHTLY OLDER WOMAN walks up to Lindsay from the 
           other end of the aisle, pushing a stroller with a TODDLER in 
           it. The woman and Lindsay lace fingers -- together. 

           Hazel hurries away. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - LATER

           Hazel alternates between applying mascara and swigging down a 
           White Claw. 

           We PAN OVER to see Jenny pulling on Doc Martens to pair with 
           the thrifted dress she has on. 

                                 JENNY
                        Pace yourself, we’ve gotta take 
                        direction at the rehearsal dinner. 

           Jenny palms something out of her sock drawer and pops it into 
           her mouth. 
                                 HAZEL
                        What was that? 

                                 JENNY
                        What was what? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Whatever you just put in your 
                        mouth. 

           Jenny debates whether to tell for a moment, then comes clean--

                                 JENNY
                        An edible. 

                                 HAZEL
                        And I’m the one not pacing myself?! 

                                 JENNY
                        Dude, edibles are practically 
                        vitamins to me. 

           Hazel finishes applying mascara and turns to her cousin, 
           reaching out and wiggling her fingers. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Gimme. 

                                 JENNY
                        It would be unbelievably rash to 
                        embark on your first edible journey 
                        right now. 

                                 HAZEL
                        But I’m nervous. The joint helped 
                        me chill out before -- can’t you 
                        hook it up for ya girl? 

                                 JENNY
                        Counterpoint: you just referred to 
                        yourself as “ya girl.” 

                                 HAZEL
                        Please. I need to get out of my own 
                        head right now. 

           Jenny sighs and stands to check her eyeliner in the mirror.

                                 JENNY
                        Hazel, no. It’s a terrible idea. 
                              (then, re: make-up)
                        I need more light. 
           Jenny leaves for the bathroom. Hazel eyes Jenny’s closed 
           drawer. She waits a beat... then yanks the drawer open and 
           rifles through socks to find another gummy edible. 

           She unwraps it and pops it into her mouth. 

           INT. JENNY’S ANCIENT HATCHBACK (MOVING) - DAY

           The sun sets as Jenny drives to the rehearsal dinner. Alison 
           rides shotgun and Hazel sits in the back. 

           Jenny twists around to check on Hazel. She sees that Hazel is 
           opening and closing her mouth rhythmically as she stares out 
           the window. The edible is already starting to take effect. 

                                 JENNY
                        Are you okay? 

           Hazel focuses her gaze on Jenny. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Great. 

           POV HAZEL: The colors of the passing wooded landscape are 
           brilliant, popping in and out of focus in Hazel’s vision. 

           The edible is already affecting her much more strongly than 
           the joint did...

           INT. REHEARSAL DINNER VENUE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel stares at her reflection in the ladies’ bathroom 
           mirror, trying to get her shit together. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Ride it out. Ride. It. Out. 
                              (then)
                        What does that mean? 

                                 JENNY (O.S.)
                        Hazel? 

           Jenny comes up behind Hazel. Hazel gets very confused and 
           overwhelmed as Jenny’s reflection appears beside her own. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (whispering)
                        Where are you? 

                                 JENNY
                        Hazel, did you take one of my 
                        edibles after I told you not to?
                                 HAZEL
                        Yes. I mean no. 

                                 JENNY
                        Oh my God. Fuck! Are you insane?! 
                        That’s a chill dose for me but not 
                        for you. Let me cover, I’ll just 
                        tell everyone you got sick or 
                        something. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m fine! I can keep it together. I 
                        swear! 

           Jenny does not look convinced.

           INT. REHEARSAL DINNER VENUE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           We’re CLOSE ON Hazel’s wide eyes.  

           WIDEN TO REVEAL that she stands at the back of a room with 
           chairs set up to face forward and replicate what the wedding 
           ceremony will look like. Hazel clutches Romney’s leash. 

           In front of Hazel and Romney stand Jenny and Collin, Alison 
           and Victor, then Laurie and Vivian in pairs. Noelle, the maid 
           of honor, stands directly in front of Hazel. Gabe is at the 
           front of the room and Bee directs from the side. 

                                 BEE
                        Okay guys, go ahead and walk down 
                        in pairs! 

           The pairings walk down the aisle, keeping even intervals. 
           Collin and Jenny vogue together.

                                 COLLIN
                        Groomsman realness...  

                                 JENNY
                        Bridesmaid stunning...

                                 NOELLE
                        We all look so good! And we’ll look 
                        even better in our yellow! 

           Bee smiles self-consciously. 

                                 BEE
                        Thanks for humoring me. 

                                 LAURIE
                              (playfully)
                        Anything for you, bridezilla! 
           Bee laughs. Hazel blinks and slowly wets her lips with her 
           tongue. 

                                 BEE
                        Okay Hazel, you can go ahead and 
                        walk Romney down whenever you’re 
                        ready. We’re working on rigging up 
                        a little ring holder on his collar 
                        that’s going to be precious! 

           Hazel stares down at Romney, who glances back at her with his 
           adorably droopy eyes. Hazel’s get even wider. 

                                 BEE (CONT'D)
                        Hazel, are you okay? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah, totally! 

           We move into Hazel’s HIGH POV as a second “Weed Hazel”, 
           covered in green face and body paint, appears beside the real 
           one. (NOTE: All conversations between Weed Hazel occur in 
           real Hazel’s head and are V.O.; their mouths do not move.) 

                                 WEED HAZEL
                        What are you doing?! They’re going 
                        to know you took me! GO! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Are you... the weed? 

                                 WEED HAZEL
                        Of course I am! Now start. Walking. 

           Hazel takes a step forward--

           SPLIT SCREEN: 

           On one half of the screen, the regular reality of what’s 
           happening (chyron-ed “REALITY”) plays out: Hazel walks Romney 
           down the aisle toward Gabe and the rest of the wedding party.

           On the second half of the screen, Hazel’s stoned brain’s 
           interpretation of what’s happening (chyron-ed “HAZEL’S 
           BRAIN”) also plays out. Weed Hazel walks beside real Hazel. 
           At the front of the room, the entire family is gathered 
           together and MURMURS SUSPICIOUSLY at her. 

                                 WEED HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        You are so high. What if you feel 
                        this way for the rest of your 
                        life?! Has it been seconds, years, 
                        BOTH?! ACT NATURAL! 
           Hazel glances down at Romney, who speaks to her in her own 
           voice. 

                                 WEED HAZEL (THROUGH ROMNEY) (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get married. 

                                 HAZEL
                        O-okay...

           END SPLIT SCREEN. Hazel stands in front of her dad, looking 
           completely freaked out. 

                                 GABE
                        Are you sure you’re all right? 

                                 HAZEL
                              (high-pitched voice)
                        Great. 

           Romney licks Hazel’s leg. She kneels and hugs the dog to her, 
           then lets him lick her right on the mouth -- and licks back. 
           Gabe grimaces. 

           INT. REHEARSAL DINNER VENUE - DINING HALL - NIGHT

           Everyone is mostly done with dinner. Hazel struggles to focus 
           on Collin as he CLINKS a spoon against his glass and stands 
           up across the table from Bee and Gabe. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Hey everybody, I just wanted to say 
                        some words about my mom. 
                              (to Bee)
                        You are such a giver. I was anxious 
                        about moving away, and then about 
                        you coming here and being lonely. 
                        To be honest, I was prepared to 
                        nominate you for Queer Eye before 
                        Gabe came along! 

           Everyone chuckles, some more naturally than others--

                                 HAZEL
                        Ha. Ha. Ha. 

           Jenny shoots Hazel a look, but luckily nobody else notices. 

                                 COLLIN
                        I would’ve LOVED to meet Bobby! He 
                        might not be as pretty as Antoni, 
                        but the man can furnish a damn 
                        house. I said what I said. 
                              (then, smiling at Bee)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        But that wasn’t necessary, because 
                        you found a great new partner in 
                        crime in Gabe. Someone who 
                        appreciates how special you are 
                        just as much as I do.

           Bee glances at Gabe, who has his eyes on Collin. Collin 
           raises his glass. 

                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        Here’s to you, Ma. 

           The family drinks. Gabe sticks to water. Hazel sees how happy 
           Bee looks as she beams at her son, and how Gabe smiles at 
           Collin in fake acceptance. 

           Making a snap decision as Collin takes a seat, Hazel stands 
           up unsteadily, glass held in a vise-grip.  

                                 HAZEL
                        Hello everyone. My name is Hazel. 

                                 JENNY
                              (whispering)
                        Oh God. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’d like to start by saying that 
                        I’m happy for you, Dad. When Mom 
                        died it was really hard. 

           Everyone blinks back at her. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        I guess... I probably shouldn’t 
                        bring her up here, tonight, but -- 
                        I did. Sorry. 
                              (to Gabe)
                        I’m glad you found someone you can 
                        talk to, because you and I... we’ve 
                        never talked all that much. But 
                        it’s time I said something. 

           Jenny holds her breath, beyond stressed out. What is Hazel 
           about to spill?

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        I want you to stop asking me if I’m 
                        dating. I don’t think it’s... an 
                        appropriate conversation for us to 
                        be having. 

           Jenny relaxes, but it’s still a very tense moment as Hazel 
           waits for Gabe to respond. Finally--
                                 GABE
                        I’ll lay off from here on out. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thank you. 

           We PAN OVER see that Hazel and Gabe’s moment is hitting one 
           person especially hard: Bee. She’s deep in thought. Gears 
           turning. Suddenly she stands. 

                                 BEE
                        I have something to say, too. 

           Hazel and Jenny both tense. What is Bee about to spill?! 

           But as Bee looks across the table at Hazel, she suddenly 
           seems to change her mind. Bee clears her throat awkwardly. 

                                 BEE (CONT'D)
                              (to Gabe)
                        I’m excited to marry you in three 
                        days! 

           Gabe grins and stands to kiss her. 

           Suddenly Weed Hazel pops into existence. 

                                 WEED HAZEL
                        You’re gonna puke. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No I’m n--

           Hazel leans over and PUKES onto the carpet. Everyone looks on 
           in absolute shock. 

                                 WEED HAZEL 
                        See? I was totally right. 

                                 ALISON
                        Oh no, I’m an empathetic hurler--

           Alison PUKES on the ground too. Gabe GAGS--

           EXT. BERKELEY MARINA - CESAR CHAVEZ PARK - PATH - NEXT DAY

           Hazel and Jenny run along a path that has the Bay on one side 
           and rolling green hills on the other. Jenny doesn’t look 
           happy.

                                 JENNY
                        You take my edible, cause a puke-
                        storm all around me, then force me 
                        to run before I have to run. 
                                 HAZEL
                        And I’m sorry for all of it, but 
                        warming up is important. 

                                 JENNY
                        Okay well, I’m warm!

                                 HAZEL
                        I just really wanna do well in this 
                        Wilson Family Soccer Cup. 

                                 JENNY
                        Is it even a good idea for us to 
                        support this tradition? You tend to 
                        wind up crying, which usually makes 
                        me cry. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I was a kid the last time we did 
                        this, and yes, I may have devolved 
                        into tears at my dad’s criticism, 
                        but this game is going to be 
                        different. 

                                 JENNY
                        Is it, though?

                                 HAZEL
                        I may have hallucinated and fully 
                        embarrassed myself last night, but 
                        my dad did say he’d stop talking to 
                        me about men! That’s progress! I 
                        wanna keep it going. 

           Hazel and Jenny loop back around. 

           EXT. BERKELEY MARINA - CESAR CHAVEZ PARK - FIELD - DAY

           Hazel and Jenny approach the field where the rest of the 
           family (including Collin) is gathered, all wearing athletic 
           apparel. Alison and Victor set up cones to mark off goals.

           POP IN ON GABE AND BEE, who argue out of earshot of everyone 
           else. Gabe looks worse for the wear. 

                                 BEE
                        You don’t think I should be upset 
                        that you started drinking like a 
                        fish as soon as I went to bed? The 
                        night of our rehearsal dinner? 

                                 GABE
                        I still made it out here, didn’t I? 
                                 BEE
                        It’s not about waking up on time, 
                        it’s about going back on all the 
                        work we’ve done! 

                                 GABE
                        You haven’t done any work! 

           Tears spring up in Bee’s eyes. 

                                 BEE
                        I just... want my partner in crime 
                        back. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m the same guy I’ve always been.

           POP BACK WITH HAZEL AND JENNY as they make it onto the field.  
           She watches Gabe walk away from Bee. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Shit. My dad’s hungover. 

                                 JENNY
                        Did you see Bee about to confess? I 
                        don’t think they’re doing very 
                        well. 

           Hazel and Jenny make it over to the rest of the family. Bee 
           comes to stand beside Alison. 

                                 GABE
                        Welcome to the Tenth Annual Wilson 
                        Family Soccer Cup. Victor and I 
                        will be your team captains. 
                              (to Victor)
                        Would you like to pick first? 

                                 VICTOR
                        You go ahead. 

                                 GABE
                        Hazel, c’mon over here. 

           Hazel can’t help but smile wide at her dad picking her first. 
           She jogs over. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Jenny! 

                                 JENNY
                        Just warning you, Hazel already 
                        tired me out with a warm-up.
           Victor rolls his eyes. 

                                 GABE
                        Wallaby. 

           Bee walks over. 

                                 ALISON
                              (to Victor)
                        You better pick me next, hon!  

                                 VICTOR
                        You?! I need Mamá as goalie! She’s 
                        a wall! 

           Marianna grins and wiggles her fingers playfully at Alison as 
           she crosses to join Victor’s team. Now only Alison and Collin 
           are left. 

                                 GABE
                        Ali--

                                 BEE
                              (quietly)
                        Gabe. 

           Gabe turns to Bee, irritated. They speak in hushed tones as 
           Hazel awkwardly stands beside them. 

                                 GABE
                        Yes? 

                                 BEE
                        You should pick Collin. 

                                 GABE
                        It’s my team. I want to pick my 
                        sister. 

                                 BEE
                        He’s always been picked last! 

                                 GABE
                        Maybe there’s a reason for that. 

           Bee stares at Gabe in disbelief. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (whispering)
                        Dad...
                                 BEE
                              (to Gabe)
                        I cannot believe you. He won state 
                        in diving, asshole. 

           Gabe clenches his jaw and faces forward. 

                                 GABE
                              (raising voice)
                        Collin. 

           Not having heard any of this, Collin jogs over. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Oooo, such contentious 
                        deliberations! Glad you made the 
                        right choice!  

           Bee puts an arm around her son. Meanwhile, Alison pouts. 

                                 ALISON
                        I can’t believe I’m last! 

                                 VICTOR
                        You’re not exactly in competition-
                        ready shoes, mi amor. 

           TILT DOWN to reveal that Victor is 100 percent correct.

                                 ALISON
                        They’re flats! 

           EXT. BERKELEY MARINA - CESAR CHAVEZ PARK - FIELD - LATER

           The game is in full swing: Gabe, Bee, Hazel, and Collin 
           versus Victor, Jenny, Marianna, and Alison. 

           Gabe dribbles the ball down the field. Victor comes up and 
           steals the ball from him. 

                                 GABE
                        SHIT! 

           Victor runs away with it. Bee calls from a little ways up the 
           field. 

                                 BEE
                              (to Gabe)
                        It’s okay, you--

           Gabe runs after Victor, leaving Bee behind. 

                                 GABE
                        Go after it! 
           Bee looks disappointed, and Hazel notices. 

           EXT. BERKELEY MARINA - CESAR CHAVEZ PARK - FIELD - LATER

           Hazel runs down the field with the ball, then kicks it over 
           to Gabe. Hazel pumps her fist at the successful pass. 

                                 JENNY
                        Nice one. 

           Gabe kicks the ball at Bee, who stands right by the goal 
           that’s defended by Marianna. Bee stays flat-footed and 
           Marianna swoops in to make an interception. 

                                 GABE
                        Are you serious?! 

                                 BEE
                        I’m sorry, I’ve never pretended to 
                        be an athlete... 

           Gabe just shakes his head and runs after Jenny, who now has 
           the ball. Jenny is good, deftly dribbling down the field. 
           Hazel runs alongside her. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (quietly)
                        Hey, let me steal it. 

                                 JENNY
                        No way! 

                                 HAZEL
                        C’mon, my dad will lose his mind. 

                                 JENNY
                        But would he believe it? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Jennyyyyyyyyy...

           Jenny sighs and pretends to fumble the dribble, letting Hazel 
           steal it. Gabe lights up behind them. 

                                 GABE
                        NICE! Well done, Hazel! 

           Hazel grins as she turns back toward their goal with the 
           ball. She manages to dribble past Alison. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Go! All the way, you got this! 
           Victor comes in hot, but Hazel is unstoppable with her dad’s 
           praise pushing her forward. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Bee, fucking move! 

           Bee hustles out of the way as Hazel kicks the ball into the 
           goal past Marianna. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        GOAAAAAAAAAAL! 

                                 HAZEL
                        YES! 

           Hazel and Gabe run around, pretending to be airplanes to 
           celebrate the goal. 

           It’s a beautiful moment for Hazel -- until she sees Bee 
           standing off to the side, crying. She stops abruptly. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Dad, she’s really upset. You’ve 
                        been pretty hard on her. 

                                 GABE
                        She’s practically playing for the 
                        other team she’s so bad. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Right, but this is supposed to be 
                        fun... 

           Gabe looks nonplussed. 

                                 GABE
                        The Wilson Family Soccer Cup has 
                        never been about fun. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Just go talk to her. Please? 

           Gabe sighs and jogs over to Bee. 

                                 GABE
                        Hey, what’s wrong? 

                                 BEE
                        What’s wrong? You can’t treat me 
                        like this! 

                                 GABE
                        I’m sorry. I get competitive. 
                                 BEE
                        That is not an apology. 

           Collin joins the arguing couple.  

                                 COLLIN
                        Mom, are you okay? 

                                 GABE
                        She’s fine. 

                                 COLLIN
                        I was actually asking her. 

                                 BEE
                        I’m okay Collin, just give us a 
                        second. 

           Collin glares at Gabe. 

                                 COLLIN
                              (to Bee)
                        Let me know if you change your 
                        mind. 

           Collin walks away, over to the soccer ball. He kicks it into 
           the air and starts to juggle it deftly. 

           Nearby, Hazel and Jenny watch Gabe and Bee’s continuing 
           argument, which they can’t hear from this distance. 

                                 JENNY
                        That looks familiar. Except it’s 
                        usually him and you. 

           Hazel watches as Bee throws up her hands and storms off the 
           field toward the parking lot. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah. It usually is. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Hazel is on her way to the guest room and sees that the door 
           to Gabe’s room is open. Bee sits on the bed with her back to 
           Hazel. 

           Hazel thinks for a moment, then KNOCKS on the open door. Bee 
           looks over her shoulder. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hey. Can I come in? 

           Bee nods. She’s been crying. 
                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        My dad’s a really bad sport, huh. 

                                 BEE
                        It’s more than that. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I know. 

           It hurts Hazel to see Bee in the kind of pain she’s 
           experienced herself so many times. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        He shouldn’t have talked about 
                        Collin that way. And I should’ve 
                        said something in the moment... I’m 
                        sorry. 

                                 BEE
                        I thought he’d accepted him. He’s 
                        my son. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Have you talked to Collin about it 
                        at all? 

                                 BEE
                        No, he’s never overheard anything. 
                        You heard his toast, he’s so glad I 
                        found someone. And I’m the parent. 
                        I can handle my own stuff. 

           A moment of silence. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I think... I need to tell you a 
                        story about my dad. So you have all 
                        the facts. For your relationship 
                        balance sheet.

                                 BEE
                        What’s the story? 

           Hazel takes a deep breath and sits down next to Bee. 

                                 HAZEL
                        When I was twelve, he caught me 
                        kissing a girl in a closet. My 
                        heart dropped out of my butt when 
                        he opened the door. He’d taught me 
                        that being gay was choosing to be a 
                        freak... but my first kiss didn’t 
                        feel like a choice. It -- happened 
                        to me, and it felt like magic.

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (then)
                        He chased me out of the house, in 
                        front of all my friends. Up a tree. 
                        I stayed there for hours. When I 
                        finally went back, the door was 
                        locked. He either did it on 
                        purpose, or got so drunk he forgot 
                        to leave it open. Neither option’s 
                        great. I spent the night on the 
                        back porch. 
                              (then)
                        So that’s why I’ve never come out 
                        to him. My dad scares me, Bee. 

           More tears fall down Bee’s face. She reaches for Hazel’s 
           hand.

                                 BEE
                        Oh Hazel. I am so sorry. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It’s okay. I was only able to get 
                        out when I left for college. But 
                        you -- you can leave whenever, if 
                        you want to. 

           Bee wipes her face. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        My dad’s not good for you. You 
                        should talk to him. Maybe even... 
                        tell him the truth. About what 
                        happened at the airport.  

                                 BEE
                        I can’t put you in the middle of it 
                        like that. It wasn’t your fault. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Then just tell him you cheated. It 
                        could be an out. Because... deep 
                        down, have you been looking for 
                        one? You almost said something at 
                        the rehearsal dinner. 
                              (then)
                        Are you happy? 

           Bee certainly doesn’t look it. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        For once, I think you gotta secure 
                        your own mask before helping 
                        others. 
           Bee cracks a smile.  

                                 BEE
                        You just used a flight attendant 
                        phrase on me. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (smiling back)
                        I know, I’m honestly pretty proud 
                        of myself right now. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE GABE'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Hazel paces outside Gabe’s study. Gabe and Bee’s MUFFLED 
           VOICES can be heard inside. 

           Hazel continues to pace, back and forth, back and forth. 

           Suddenly the door opens. Hazel lunges away, trying to act 
           natural... but it’s just Bee, alone. She closes the door 
           behind her, defeated. 

                                 BEE
                        I couldn’t do it. 

           Hazel looks disappointed, yet again recognizing herself in 
           Bee’s situation. Bee holds up a bottle of scotch.

                                 BEE (CONT'D)
                        I did get this new bottle out of 
                        there, though. So there’s that. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Have you talked to him about going 
                        to AA? Instead of just taking his 
                        bottles away? 

                                 BEE
                        He won’t go. 

           Hazel looks disturbed as she watches Bee walk away, cradling 
           the bottle helplessly. 

           INT. GABE’S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

           Hazel sinks down onto the couch. Jenny reads on the bed. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Bee clearly shouldn’t marry my dad. 
                        I told her to tell him the truth -- 
                        even just that she cheated -- but 
                        she couldn’t do it. 

           Jenny puts her book down. 
                                 JENNY
                        Then if you think it’s important 
                        for him to know the truth, it’s up 
                        to you to tell him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I don’t know... 

           Jenny shakes her head and returns to her book. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        What? 

                                 JENNY
                        Nothing. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No, you clearly have something to 
                        say. 

           Jenny puts the book back down.

                                 JENNY
                        I don’t get it. You recognize 
                        there’s a moral imperative to tell 
                        the truth, but you’re still so 
                        obsessed with pleasing your dad 
                        that you’re about to let him enter 
                        into a completely toxic marriage 
                        and take a nice lady down with him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m not obsessed with pleasing him. 

                                 JENNY
                        You had hair down to your ass for a 
                        decade because he liked it. You’re 
                        not out to him. You don’t say a 
                        word about your mom because you 
                        know it would upset him. You don’t 
                        tell him to go to AA. 

                                 HAZEL
                        But if I confronted him, he’d just--

                                 JENNY
                        How do you know what he would do? 

                                 HAZEL
                        It’s, it’s not my job to be his 
                        parent. He’s mine! 
                                 JENNY
                        I’m just saying, you and Bee can’t 
                        keep enabling him and expect a 
                        different result. 

           Hazel doesn’t have a response ready for this.

                                 JENNY (CONT'D)
                        You know I’m living here because my 
                        dad doesn’t want me to teach, 
                        right? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Wait, what? 

                                 JENNY
                        You didn’t think I’d hang a Bob 
                        Dylan poster up for one week, did 
                        you? 

                                 HAZEL
                        I mean, maybe... you’re a true fan.
                              (then)
                        Why didn’t you tell me? 

                                 JENNY 
                        Because you get so weird about your 
                        dad. And honestly, I get weird 
                        about mine, too. He said he didn’t 
                        sacrifice everything to come here 
                        and have his daughter make next to 
                        nothing. But it’s my passion, and 
                        it turns out your dad understands 
                        that. So I moved out, and it was 
                        really hard at first, but my dad’s 
                        starting to accept it. 
                              (then)
                        We’re adults now, Hazel. Not kids 
                        who can’t control our surroundings, 
                        not angsty teenagers whose only 
                        goal is to get out.

           EXT. TREE - LATER

           The sun sets as Hazel sits hunched in the same tree she hid 
           from Gabe in at 12.

           She’s drawing a WEDDING SCENE in her sketchbook that’s 
           rivetingly unlike anything we’ve seen her do so far. 

           Everyone looks spindly and dark -- especially Gabe, who 
           stands at the altar, staring down his bride-to-be as she 
           strides toward him. 
           EXT. BERKELEY’S GOURMET GHETTO - NEXT DAY

           Hazel walks down the street, shopping bag filled with last-
           minute items for the wedding. 

           Up ahead she spots Lindsay, the grown-up version of the girl 
           Gabe caught her with in the closet. She’s just unloaded a 
           stroller and the Toddler from a parked car. 

           Hazel looks like she might sprint in the opposite 
           direction... but she doesn’t. She steels herself--

                                 HAZEL
                        Hey, Lindsay? 

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Hazel and Lindsay sit across from each other. The Toddler 
           alternates between gnawing on a hunk of baguette and the side 
           of a board book. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        He’s my girlfriend’s. I didn’t know 
                        if I was ready for the 
                        responsibility when she got full 
                        custody, but now I really look 
                        forward to our days together while 
                        she’s working. 

           Hazel smiles at the Toddler, who grins back. 

                                 HAZEL
                        What does your girlfriend do? 

                                 LINDSAY
                        Heads up the city’s public 
                        transportation initiative. She was 
                        actually the one who helped get the 
                        BART seats changed to plastic back 
                        when she was only an intern. 

                                 HAZEL
                        So you can finally see what you’re 
                        about to sit in! Please thank her 
                        for her service. 

                                 LINDSAY
                              (laughing)
                        She’s a total catch. We’re probably 
                        going to move in together soon. 

                                 HAZEL
                        That’s awesome. 
                                 LINDSAY
                        How about you, are you seeing 
                        anyone? 

                                 HAZEL
                              (German accent)
                        No, I am not at zee moment. 

                                 LINDSAY
                              (laughing)
                        You still do your voices.

                                 HAZEL
                              (haughty British accent)
                        Forever and always. 
                              (normal voice)
                        I am thinking about trying to start 
                        dating, though. More seriously. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        That’s awesome, too. 

           Hazel takes a deep breath. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I, um, I’ve always wanted to say... 
                        I’m really sorry for what happened 
                        at my birthday party. I know it was 
                        such a long time ago, but I’m still 
                        so embarrassed. 
                              (then)
                        Especially that I stopped talking 
                        to you afterwards. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        Oh, girl, it’s all good! It was 
                        such a long time ago, we were just 
                        kids. It’s wild how your dad 
                        literally forced us out of the 
                        closet. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (laughing)
                        You’re so right. I actually still 
                        haven’t officially come out to him, 
                        isn’t that lame?

                                 LINDSAY
                        Absolutely not! That guy scared the 
                        crap out of me and he wasn’t even 
                        my dad! 
                                 HAZEL
                        He’s going full groomzilla right 
                        now and it’s so much to deal with. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Well... 
                              (then)
                        Do you guys have anywhere to be 
                        right now? 

           EXT. CODORNICES PARK - LATER

           Lindsay cracks up at the story Hazel’s just completed as they 
           watch the Toddler run around the jungle gym. Hazel smacks her 
           playfully. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It’s not funny! I had no idea who 
                        she was! 

                                 LINDSAY
                        It’s a little funny! 

           Hazel can’t help but crack up a little, too. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay, it’s a tiny bit funny. I 
                        thought Bee was perfect for my dad, 
                        but now I see how dysfunctional 
                        they are. Their relationship is 
                        just like... an older version of my 
                        dad and me. Except romantic. Ugh, 
                        this is such a weird disaster. What 
                        am I supposed to do? 

                                 LINDSAY
                        I feel like you have to say 
                        something. 

           Hazel looks down at her feet. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I was afraid you were gonna tell me 
                        that. It’s just that... I’m not so 
                        great at speaking up. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        You did at the rehearsal dinner. 
                        And your dad listened. 
                                 HAZEL
                        I was on a bunch of Claws and my 
                        first ever edible. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        You’re worthy of being heard, cross-
                        faded or not. You’ll figure out the 
                        right thing to do. 

                                 HAZEL
                        How can you be so sure? 

                                 LINDSAY
                        First kiss intuition. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (laughing)
                        That is so not a thing. 

           The women smile at each other. 

                                 HAZEL  (CONT'D)
                        I’m so happy I ran into you. 

           EXT. POINT REYES - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           A caravan of family vehicles drives into a small town 
           surrounded by forest. It’s very lush and NorCal-y. 

           INT. JENNY’S ANCIENT HATCHBACK (MOVING) - DAY

           Hazel sits in the backseat, wedged between Alison and Victor. 
           Jenny drives and Marianna rides shotgun. 

           The trees to the right thin out, allowing a brief view of the 
           gray coastline. Hazel stares until more trees get in the way. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Could we make a quick detour? 

           EXT. POINT REYES - LIMANTOUR BEACH - DAY

           Hazel walks along the shoreline beside Jenny and Marianna. 
           Alison and Victor are close behind.  

                                 HAZEL
                        My mom’s ashes have probably spread 
                        to every corner of the world by 
                        now, but I still feel closest to 
                        her here. Where we let her go. 
                                 MARIANNA
                        The people we lose are always with 
                        us. Whether we feel them there or 
                        not. 

           Tears spill down Hazel’s cheeks. Jenny puts an arm around 
           Hazel. Alison and Victor catch up. 

                                 HAZEL
                        My dad was so much happier before 
                        my mom died, wasn’t he? 

           To Hazel’s surprise, Alison looks at her like she’s crazy. 

                                 ALISON
                        Absolutely not. My brother has 
                        always had problems, Hazel. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        And he will continue to have them 
                        as long as he believes that his 
                        happiness lies outside of himself. 

           Victor nods his agreement. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Listen to these ladies. They’re 
                        always right. 

           Hazel smiles her gratitude and looks back out at the ocean.

           INT. WEDDING VENUE - WOMEN’S SUITE - DAY

           Bee sits amongst the folds of her wedding dress, which is 
           like something out of a fairytale. She looks gorgeous... and 
           deeply unhappy. Alison (in a yellow bridesmaid dress) leans 
           over her, helping put the finishing touches on Bee’s make-up. 

           Marianna wears a dark blue velvet dress and fluffs her hair 
           in a mirror. Hazel and Jenny stand in front of other mirrors, 
           clad in their matching yellow bridesmaid dresses. Vivian, 
           Laurie, and Noelle (also in yellow) chat nearby. 

           Collin enters, looking fabulous in a yellow suit. He kisses 
           his mom on the cheek. 

                                 COLLIN
                        ‘Kay, TRUTH TIME, I was terrified 
                        of this whole yellow situation, but 
                        we are completely pulling it off! 

           Bee smiles at her son.
                                 BEE
                        You look fantastic, as always. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Says the stunning BRIDE! 

           Just then there’s a KNOCK on the door. 

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        How’s it going in there? 

                                 HAZEL
                              (to women)
                        I’ve got it. 

           She walks over and begins to open the door. 

                                 GABE (O.S.)
                        Whoa whoa whoa! It’s bad luck for 
                        me to see her before the wedding! 

           INT. WEDDING VENUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Hazel joins him in the hall and shuts the door behind her. 

                                 GABE
                        She is still in there... right? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah. But Dad... I’m just... not 
                        sure you guys are a great match. 

                                 GABE
                        Excuse me? 

           Hazel looks a little shaken, but does her best to stay 
           strong.

                                 HAZEL
                        Are you happy? 

                                 GABE
                        She makes me happy, yeah. 

                                 HAZEL
                        No, are you happy, Dad? 

                                 GABE
                              (getting irritated)
                        I don’t understand the question. 
                                 HAZEL
                        You’ve gotta work through your own 
                        stuff to be a good partner. And... 
                        you haven’t really done that, Dad. 

                                 GABE
                        Is this how you think you’re 
                        supposed to talk your father on his 
                        fucking wedding day? 

           Gabe shakes his head and storms away down the hall. Hazel 
           watches him leave, immensely conflicted. 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A small Catholic church. Gabe stands at the altar, hands 
           clasped in front of him. A PRIEST (60s) stands beside him in 
           white robes. 

           The pews are mostly filled with distant family members and 
           friends/coworkers of Gabe and Bee. 

           EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Hazel (with Romney on his leash) stands with the rest of the 
           wedding party at the church’s closed front door. Wooded hills 
           loom all around. 

           MUSIC starts to play inside the church. Bee takes a deep 
           breath, playing off her emotion as nerves. Alison smiles 
           wide. 

                                 ALISON
                        Show time! 

           Collin glances back at his mom and offers her an encouraging 
           grin as he pulls the doors open. 

           INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           The bridesmaids and groomsmen now stand on either side of the 
           altar. 

           Hazel follows Romney down the aisle. The ring case attached 
           to his collar bounces with each step the dog takes and 
           everyone AWWWWs at him. 

           Hazel walks up the steps with Romney and hands Gabe the 
           rings. She locks eyes with him, but he quickly looks away. 

           Hazel takes a seat in the front pew beside Marianna. Romney 
           settles down on the carpet at their feet. 
           Once Noelle makes it to the front of the church, the STRAINS 
           of “Bridal Chorus” fill the room. 

           Bee walks past the pews slowly, face hidden by her veil. 

           She finally passes Hazel and Marianna’s aisle and ascends the 
           steps to stand across from Gabe. He reaches out to lift her 
           veil, revealing that Bee’s face is stained with tears. Gabe 
           raises an eyebrow, but she just waves him off. 

           Hazel sees how startled and upset Collin is to see his mom so 
           unhappy. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Welcome, everyone. We are gathered 
                        here today to celebrate before God 
                        the marriage of a man and woman who 
                        love one another. 
                              (reading from Bible)
                        “Love is patient, love is kind. It 
                        does not envy, it does not boast, 
                        it is not proud. It does not 
                        dishonor others, it is not self-
                        seeking, it is not easily angered, 
                        it keeps no record of wrongs." 

           Hazel frowns. 

                                 PRIEST  (CONT'D)
                        And now Gabriel and Wallis have 
                        prepared personal vows for one 
                        another. 

           Gabe takes a piece of paper from his pocket and clears his 
           throat. 

                                 GABE
                        My Wallaby. When I met you, I was 
                        in such a dark place -- and had 
                        been for a long time. But you 
                        pulled me out, and for that I am 
                        eternally grateful. You make me a 
                        better man. 

           Bee forces a smile and takes the paper Noelle hands to her. 

                                 BEE
                        Gabe. I am so glad to have found a 
                        companion in you. I feel less alone 
                        when we’re together. Like I have 
                        someone I need, who needs me back. 

           Gabe smiles back at her.  
                                 PRIEST
                              (to the audience)
                        Before we continue with the 
                        traditional vows, I must ask if 
                        anyone has an objection to this 
                        union. 

           Everyone in the wedding party except for Gabe and Bee 
           exchanges looks. 

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                              (to audience)
                        Please speak now... or forever hold 
                        your peace. 

           A moment passes. Another. It doesn’t look like anyone is 
           going to come forward. 

           We move CLOSE IN ON Hazel. We hear her HEART POUNDING. 

           She finally stands up shakily. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I-I have an objection. 

           Every single eyeball in the entire church is on Hazel. 

           Jenny’s eyes widen. Is Hazel really about to do this? 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Dad... 
                              (swallows)
                        Bee cheated on you... with me. 

           Every single jaw in the entire church drops accompanied by 
           GASPS. Jenny desperately tries to keep her proud smile under 
           control.

                                 COLLIN
                        I’m sorry, WHAT?! 

           Gabe is white as a sheet. Bee glances from him to Hazel. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m gay, Dad. Like, mega-gay. I 
                        always have been. When I had a 
                        crush on Emmy in “Dragon Tales”, 
                        when you caught me in the closet 
                        with Lindsay, and when I made out 
                        with a nice, helpful female flight 
                        attendant in a LaGuardia Airport 
                        bathroom. 
                                 VICTOR
                              (whispering, horrified)
                        LaGuardia? 

                                 ALISON
                              (shrieked)
                        In a bathroom?! 

           Everyone in the audience looks even more horrified at these 
           specifics, if that’s even possible. 

                                 HAZEL
                        It was a single stall. 

           Some “OHHHHH”s rise from the audience. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Gabe)
                        Neither of us knew who the other 
                        person was, I promise. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        But how could you not?! 

           Hazel sighs, tired of explaining. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I used to have long hair, and I’d 
                        never seen a photo of Bee. 

           More “OHHHHH”s from everyone. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Gabe)
                        I’m sorry to share it like this. 
                        I’ve been too scared until right 
                        now -- when I realized I really do 
                        object, based on everything I know. 
                        But maybe I’m wrong, maybe you are 
                        happy, and love is patient and kind 
                        and everything else. In that case, 
                        please keep going. 
                              (then)
                        I just want you both to be happy. 
                        Actually happy. 

           Gabe looks from his daughter to Bee. What he sees on his 
           fiancé’s face is pure relief. She shakes her head at him. 

           There are still more “OHHHHH”s from the audience as they 
           realize Bee is telling Gabe she does not want to do this--
                                 JENNY
                              (to audience)
                        Okay, I’m sorry, can you guys 
                        please be quiet?! 

           Gabe turns and hurries past the extremely confused and 
           horrified Priest to pull on the door beside the organ pipes, 
           trying to get the hell out of here -- but it’s locked. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Sir... 

           With no other exit, Gabe runs down the aisle past everyone 
           and out the back door, head down and mortified. 

                                 ALISON
                        Oh my God. My brother’s a runaway 
                        groom!  

           Hazel gathers up her skirt and sprints after Gabe! 

           EXT. WEDDING VENUE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Gabe has almost made it to the property’s front gate. Hazel 
           trails him. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Dad, stop, we need to actually TALK 
                        about this! 

           Gabe does not stop and turns onto the sidewalk. 

                                 GABE
                              (calling back)
                        Just go back to New York, NOW! 
                              (to himself)
                        Of course I had to leave my car at 
                        the damn hotel... 

           Hazel stops in her tracks, heartbroken that he’s told her to 
           leave. All the wedding guests (except for Bee and Collin) 
           spill out of the venue to stare at Hazel and watch Gabe 
           continue down the block. 

           Hazel takes in the MURMURING guests who gaze at her in shock 
           with no idea what to do -- just like her middle school 
           friends did before Gabe chased her from the house all those 
           years ago. 

           Hazel turns back to see her dad disappear around the corner. 
           It takes everything inside of her to make the decision. 

           She runs after him. 
           EXT. POINT REYES ROAD - DAY

           Hazel runs after Gabe down the winding road lined with trees. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Dad, stop! 

           He looks over his shoulder, sees her coming, and speeds up.  

           EXT. AROUND ANOTHER BEND - DAY

           Hazel continues after Gabe. She’s now just a few feet behind 
           him, but Gabe is so determined that he’s not letting her 
           close the distance. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (breathing hard)
                        Stop... I’m serious...

           EXT. AROUND YET ANOTHER BEND - DAY

           Hazel and Gabe have slowed to a jogging pace. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m so... tired... and I know 
                        you... are too... 

           EXT. WOODED STRAIGHTAWAY - DAY

           Hazel is now beside Gabe, but he still won’t stop stumbling 
           forward. They both pant, exhausted. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Dad... please... 

           Gabe finally gives up and bends over, hands on thighs, done. 
           Hazel spots tears mixing with the sweat on his face. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Dad? 

                                 GABE
                        I’m so ashamed. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I know, and I’m sorry I kept it a 
                        secret, I really am, but you have 
                        to know we didn’t realize who the 
                        other person was, I never would 
                        have--

                                 GABE
                        No. I’m ashamed of myself. 
           Hazel looks surprised. Gabe straightens up. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I fucked up. So badly. You saw 
                        her... she... she doesn’t want to 
                        be with me. And you’re right, it’s 
                        because I’m a mess. Everyone I 
                        love... leaves. 

           He wipes at his eyes, shocked and angry to find tears there. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I didn’t leave. Even when you told 
                        me to. Because I want you to 
                        change. I need you to change, Dad. 

           Hazel’s eyes fill with tears, too. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been so afraid of you since 
                        Mom died. And even before. You 
                        drink and you get mad and you’ve 
                        never seemed to like who I am. 
                              (then)
                        I can never tell if I’m more 
                        ashamed or thrilled to see your 
                        money dropping into my account. 
                        Because it’s the only sign I have 
                        that you care. 

           Gabe thinks for a moment. 

                                 GABE
                              (quietly)
                        I know I need to change. I really 
                        do. But... I... I don’t know if I 
                        know how. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Well, I think we could both start 
                        by not running from each other 
                        anymore. Emotionally and literally. 

           Gabe shakes his head at how crazy this entire situation is -- 
           and suddenly can’t help but smile. He starts to laugh. 

                                 GABE
                        I’m sorry... I just... “literally” 
                        running from each other... 

           Hazel lets herself laugh too, and it feels amazing. Soon 
           they’re both straight-up dying on the side of the road. 

           Gabe is the first one to pull it back together. 
                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I was raised in a different place, 
                        different time. But if you like...

           He clears his throat. Hazel waits, but he seems to be stuck. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Women. 

                                 GABE
                        Yes, um, that. I can’t understand 
                        it. But I guess I can try to... let 
                        you do your thing. 
                              (then)
                        But not with my ex-fiancé. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Yeah no, that is definitely not 
                        happening. 

                                 GABE
                        Good. Good. 

           He shakes his head in disbelief. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        I still can’t believe it. A 
                        LaGuardia bathroom stall? 

                                 HAZEL
                        Again, it wasn’t a stall, but yeah. 

           Gabe grimaces. 

                                 GABE
                        So how...

                                 HAZEL
                        I think it’s best if we don’t get 
                        into the other details. 

                                 GABE
                        Yup, you’re right. 

           Hazel spots the ocean, visible through the trees. Gabe 
           notices. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        Your mom would be proud of you. For 
                        helping me out. 

                                 HAZEL
                        She’d be proud of you for letting 
                        me. 
           EXT. GABE’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           Hazel, Gabe, Jenny, Alison, Victor, and Marianna are all 
           seated around the table. Everyone eats in silence. 

           Finally Alison can’t take it anymore. 

                                 ALISON
                              (to Hazel)
                        I’m sorry, but I have to ask -- how 
                        far did you guys go? 

                                 JENNY
                        Mom. 

                                 ALISON
                        I said I was sorry! This is just so 
                        strange. It would be like if Victor 
                        and Jenny made out with the same 
                        person. Who wasn’t me.

                                 GABE
                        That is accurate, yes. 

                                 MARIANNA
                        Where is Bee? 

                                 GABE
                        With Collin. 

                                 ALISON
                        I wonder if those two have ever 
                        kissed the same person. 

                                 JENNY
                        Mom! NO! You cannot say things like 
                        that! 

           Hazel takes in the confused faces at the table. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Guys, I’m sorry again. For 
                        embarrassing the family and 
                        everything. 

                                 GABE
                        Don’t apologize, Hazel. 

           Hazel looks surprised. 

                                 GABE (CONT'D)
                        We can move on. 
           EXT. GABE’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NEXT DAY

           Hazel’s suitcase is packed and on the porch. Hazel pulls away 
           from a group hug with Alison and Marianna. 

                                 ALISON
                        We love you. Come back as soon as 
                        you can. Who knows, maybe Marianna 
                        will be engaged to her handsome vet 
                        by then! 

           Marianna swats at Alison. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I hope so! 
                              (under her breath)
                        Just please, don’t put us in yellow 
                        again.  

           Marianna winks at Hazel as she moves on to hug Victor. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        It was nice to see you, Tio Victor. 
                        Thanks for the relationship advice. 

                                 VICTOR
                              (chuckling)
                        Don’t pin this on me. 

           Hazel glances at Jenny. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Just so you know... Jenny’s a 
                        really talented teacher. I mean, 
                        she eventually taught me how to not 
                        run away from others when I had to 
                        poop. And many other things. 

           Victor smiles slightly. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Noted. 

           Gabe picks up Hazel’s suitcase as Hazel kneels down to say 
           good bye to Romney, who snorts and grunts with excitement as 
           he licks her face.

                                 HAZEL
                        You’re such a good boy, Romney. You 
                        take care of Dad, okay? 

           Romney BARKS. Sounds like he will. 
           Hazel follows Gabe to Jenny’s car. Jenny unlocks it and hops 
           into the driver’s seat. Gabe loads Hazel’s suitcase into the 
           back, then turns to Hazel. 

                                 GABE
                        Call. If you feel like it. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I will. 

           Gabe pulls out Hazel’s framed self-portrait of herself as a 
           tween and hands it to her. 

                                 GABE
                        I think you should have this with 
                        you. While you’re in the artistic 
                        trenches over there. 

           Hazel takes it and pulls her dad into a hug. 

           INT. JENNY’S ANCIENT HATCHBACK (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Hazel watches her family get smaller in the side mirror. 

                                 JENNY
                        Thanks for saying that to my dad.

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks for calling me on my 
                        bullshit. 

                                 JENNY
                        I am beyond proud of you. 

           Jenny rummages in the glove compartment and pulls out a 
           joint, which she offers to Hazel. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (laughing)
                        You’re such a bad influence. 

                                 JENNY
                        You STOLE an edible from me! 

                                 HAZEL
                        I KNOW, I’M SORRY! 

           INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - SECURITY - DAY

           Hazel moves up to the front of the line. She looks around. No 
           Bee. She didn’t realize that she was irrationally hoping to 
           see her until this very moment. 
           INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT BAR - DAY

           Hazel sits at an airport bar, full wine glass in front of 
           her. She looks at her phone, deciding whether to go through 
           with what she’s about to do... then brings it to her ear. 

           It RINGS: once, twice. 

                                 BEE (FROM PHONE)
                        Hello? 

                                                       INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. HAWAIIAN SPA - THAT MOMENT

           Bee and Collin sit together in a hot tub. They’re in bathing 
           suits (thank God). Bee’s in a new yellow one-piece. The color 
           looks great on her, and she looks so much happier than she 
           did in white. 

                                 HAZEL 
                        Hey Bee. It’s Hazel. 

                                 BEE
                        Oh, hi Hazel. How are you? 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m good. At the airport heading 
                        home. 

                                 BEE
                        Collin’s actually here too, I’m 
                        going to put you on speaker. 

           Bee touches a button. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Hey Hazel! 

                                 BEE
                        I decided to go ahead and take the 
                        honeymoon I had planned. 

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m glad. You deserve it. 
                              (then)
                        I’m sorry for spilling the beans in 
                        the middle of the wedding. There 
                        was probably a much better way to 
                        handle it -- but I clearly didn’t 
                        manage to figure out what it was. 
                                 BEE
                        It was the best thing that could’ve 
                        happened. You told him the whole 
                        truth when I wasn’t strong enough 
                        to. Thank you. 

                                 HAZEL
                        You’re... you’re welcome. 

           Both women smile on either ends of the phone. Bee repositions 
           herself against a jet. 

                                 COLLIN
                        It’s nice you guys made up, but I’m 
                        still super duper mad at you, 
                        Hazel! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Shit. I’m sorry, Collin. 

                                 COLLIN
                        You violated the sanctity of 
                        bachelorette-hood by not confiding 
                        in me. I can keep a secret! 

           Hazel laughs, relieved. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Totally my bad. 

                                 COLLIN
                        But truly, I appreciate you having 
                        her back when I didn’t know 
                        everything that was going on. 
                              (then)
                        And for giving me the gift of 
                        knowing that my mom pulls! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks?

                                 BEE
                              (to Collin)
                        Please don’t. 

                                 COLLIN
                        It’s the truth, geez! 

                                 HAZEL
                        Cool. Well. I guess... this is 
                        probably good-bye. 
                                 BEE
                        Unless we run into each other at 
                        another airport someday. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Stranger things have happened. Bye, 
                        Bee. 

           END INTERCUT. Hazel hangs up and notices that her wine glass 
           is still full -- she didn’t drink any of it throughout that 
           entire conversation. 

           She smiles to herself. It feels like a fresh start. 

           She stands, grabs her bags, and walks away from the glass. 

           INT. NEW YORK PUBLISHING OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           Hazel sits on a couch beside Mason. They’re both dressed to 
           impress. Hazel wears her hair spiked, the way Jenny styled it 
           for Bee’s bachelorette party. She has a blank-covered MOCK-UP 
           BOOK in her lap. 

           Mason finishes flipping through a picture book and tosses it 
           back onto the glass table in front of them. 

                                 MASON
                        This is shit. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (hissing)
                        Mason! We don’t know if it’s one of 
                        theirs! 

                                 MASON
                        If it is, we’re about to make a 
                        sale. 

           A female ASSISTANT (20s) enters the room. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Robert will see you now. 

           She notices Mason. 

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT'D)
                        Hey buddy! You tagging along? 

                                 MASON
                        I’m her agent. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Oh... oh, okay. Follow me. 
           INT. NEW YORK PUBLISHING OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Hazel and Mason sit across from ROBERT (40s), a publisher. 

           Hazel holds the mock-up picture book open to a page that 
           features an illustration of Romney the bulldog panting in 
           excitement at a silver engagement ring. The illustration is 
           done in the “weirder” style Hazel developed in Berkeley. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Meet Romney, a super friendly, 
                        grunt-y bulldog who’s just found 
                        out he’s going to be the ring 
                        bearer for his owner’s wedding! 
                              (deep voice, as Romney)
                        Doggone, I’m so excited! 

           Hazel turns the page. Romney looks startled, mid-swallow -- 
           the shape of the diamond ring cartoonishly protrudes from his 
           furry throat. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (voicing Romney)
                        Whoops, that’s not kibble! 
                              (narrating)
                        Unfortunately Romney always gets a 
                        liiittle over-excited during 
                        dinnertime -- it becomes a real 
                        feeding frenzy situation. He 
                        accidentally swallows the ring! 

           Hazel turns to the next page. On the left Romney has his paws 
           up on a jewelry counter. On the right the human salesperson 
           points at the door. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Romney tries to find a replacement, 
                        but sadly the local jewelry store 
                        doesn’t sell to dogs. 

           On the next page, Romney enters a pawn shop run by an elderly 
           terrier. On the right side Romney walks back out, dejected. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        But Romney isn’t ready to just roll 
                        over, so he hits up his local dog 
                        pawn shop...
                              (Romney voice)
                        C’mon, throw me a bone! 
                              (narrating)
                        But unfortunately, all of the rings 
                        are way outside of Romney’s price 
                        range. 
           The next two-page spread features a series of illustrations 
           of Romney looking sick to his tummy as he avoids his owner in 
           different parts of the house. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Keeping such a big secret makes 
                        Romney feel more and more ill -- 
                        like he needs some kind of big 
                        release...

           She turns the page. On the left, Romney hunkers down in the 
           backyard. And on the right, he turns around to see THE RING 
           atop the turd he just produced! 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Romney finally poops out the ring! 
                              (Romney voice)
                        Ahhhhh, I don’t feel so ruff 
                        anymore. 

           On the next two page spread, Romney walks down the aisle at 
           his owner’s wedding with the ring attached to his collar. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Everything is going according to 
                        plan at the wedding...

           Hazel turns the page for another two-page spread of Romney’s 
           owner with the ring, confused that it’s turned bright gold. 
           Romney looks exceedingly nervous. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        Strangely, the ring’s journey 
                        changed the metal’s color from 
                        silver to gold -- exactly what 
                        happened when the real-life Romney 
                        ate one of my dad’s cufflinks. 
                        Romney is anxious... 

           Hazel turns to the last page. The owner puts the ring on his 
           bride’s finger and Romney barks in celebration. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        But it turns out that everyone 
                        thinks the ring is even more 
                        beautiful than before! 
                              (Romney voice)
                        Now say ‘I do’! Raise the woof for 
                        true love! 

           Hazel closes the book but keeps her eyes on it, suddenly self-
           conscious now that she’s fully returned to the real world 
           across from the Publisher.
                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                        It’s meant to be a story about how 
                        sometimes, what seems like disaster 
                        can turn into something really 
                        special. 

                                 PUBLISHER
                        I love it. 

           Hazel looks up to see that the Publisher is beaming with 
           excitement. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Really? 

           Hazel’s expression fills with pure joy. Mason leans over the 
           table to extend out his hand to Robert. 

                                 MASON
                        Mason Curry, I’m excited to start 
                        talking terms with you. 

           Robert shakes Mason’s hand, confused. Hazel gently pulls 
           Mason back by the shirt. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (quietly)
                        Mason, I need you to play it cool 
                        right now. 
                              (to Robert)
                        I’M SO FUCKING EXCITED! 

           It’s the start she’s been dreaming of. 

           INT. HAZEL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hazel sits on the couch, scrolling through her phone. 

           ON SCREEN: We see that Hazel has texted Ilana a thank you 
           message for introducing her to Robert. Ilana writes back, “Of 
           course! Good luck with everything.” 

           Suddenly a call comes through from “DAD”. Hazel picks up.

                                                       INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. GABE'S HOUSE - GABE'S STUDY - THAT MOMENT

           Gabe sits in his leather chair, one hand reaching down to 
           scratch Romney behind the ear. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Hey Dad. How’d it go? 
                                 GABE
                        I walked in, got a free cup of 
                        coffee and a cookie, then walked 
                        right back out. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Okay, well, that’s at least a half-
                        step in the right direction of 
                        attending an AA meeting. Good job. 

                                 GABE
                        How was the pitch? 

                                 HAZEL
                        The publisher wants to move 
                        forward! 

                                 GABE
                        That’s amazing. 
                              (to Romney)
                        You’re going to be a star, Romney!  

           Suddenly there’s a KNOCK at Hazel’s door. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Sorry, someone’s at the door. 

                                 GABE
                        Talk to you later. 

           Hazel hangs up and opens her door to find her neighbor Aubrey 
           standing there with another incorrectly delivered package. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Delivery for Wilson, NOT Watson. 
                        Can I add “Back-Up Mailwoman” to my 
                        resume yet? 

           Hazel laughs and accepts the package. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Thanks so much. 

           Aubrey hesitates at the door. Hazel shifts from foot to foot. 

                                 HAZEL (CONT'D)
                              (super high voice)
                        Hey, crazy idea... 

                                 AUBREY
                              (very low voice)
                        What is it?
           Hazel giggles, overjoyed that her nervous tic has been 
           reciprocated. 

                                 HAZEL
                              (regular voice)
                        Would you maybe wanna come in? I’d 
                        love to take you up on your offer 
                        to talk dads.

                                 AUBREY
                        Yeah, I’d like that! 

           Aubrey walks into the apartment. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Awesome, because I have the 
                        craziest story for you. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Bet I can top it. 

                                 HAZEL
                        You wanna put money on that? 

           Hazel closes the door on us. 

                                        THE END
