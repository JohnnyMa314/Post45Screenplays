                        No.

                                 TY (V.O.)
                        Are you physically capable of not 
                        saying "fuck"?

                                 CAROL (V.O.)
                        Are you physically capable of rational 
                        behavior?

                        saying.

                        Well I don't speak Korean, so that's 
                        difficult--

                        Mr. Warner, we'd like to remind that 
                        this is our fifth meeting [with you]--

                                 CAROL (V.O.)
                        I'm aware [of that]--

                        No, I'm aware of that. It's my

                        Really.

                                 TY (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 CAROL (V.O.)

                        it's just not right.

                                 CAROL (V.O.)
                        So in your mind, what's wrong with it?

           FADE IN:

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - DAY

           We are looking up into the faces of three people, all of whom 
           are standing and staring down at us. The person in the middle 
           is a middle-aged Korean FACTORY OWNER. To his left is CAROL 
           NICHOLS (early 30's) -- an unconventionally attractive, foul-
           mouthed ball-buster. To his right is TY WARNER (late 30's) -- 
           a perfectly-groomed guy with boyish good looks and the eyes 
           of a zealot.

                                 TY
                        I don't know what's wrong with it.

                                 CAROL
                        So maybe nothing's wrong with it.

                                 TY
                        So maybe you should suck my cock, 
                        Carol.

                                 CAROL
                        You know what, I'll look for it next 
                        time I'm down there.

                                 FACTORY OWNER
                        Mr. Warner, if I can ask--

                                 TY
                        You don't have to ask, I'll tell you.

                        be home right now. Everything's 
                        perfect -- the hair, the body, it's 
                        all working for her. But there's 
                        something--

                                 FACTORY OWNER
                        What is the meaning, "She's not home"?--

           Created using Celtx

                                                (to the factory owner)
                        Do not, I am fucking begging you--

                                 TY
                        Her personality, it's not coming 
                        through to me.

           REVERSE ANGLE -- We reveal what Ty, Carol, and the factory 
           owner are looking at. It's a toy cat: a beautiful-quality 
           plush Himalayan sitting alone on a metal table. (Note that 
           this toy is not a Beanie Baby -- it's a prototype for the 
           very first product ever produced by Ty Inc.)

           It is also revealed that we are inside a large, windowless 
           building filled with workers churning out one type of 
           product: stuffed animals. Ty, Carol, and the factory owner 
           are standing off to the side with three or four other 
           WORKERS/SEAMSTRESSES -- everyone's attention is on the cat.

                        we're talking about, it's a goddamn 
                        stuffed cat, it doesn't have a

                        yes, she does have personality.

                        people have yet to come up with a 
                        single prototype that [captures]--

                                 CAROL
                        For starters, you could stop calling

                                 TY
                        She is a she.

           Ty picks up the cat and holds her so she's face-to-face with 
           the factory owner.

                                 TY
                        All you have to do, is hold her. Feel 
                        the way she moves.

           Ty moves his fingers, massaging the cat's soft body.

                                 TY
                        And when you're looking into her eyes 
                        and she's looking back, you know she's 
                        real and you know you want to take her 
                        home. Don't you?

           Ty pushes the cat even closer to the factory owner's face. 
           The factory owner looks more than a little freaked out at 
           this point.

           CLOSE ON Ty's face as he stares at the factory owner with 
           relentless, bloodless intensity.

                                 TY

           many rounds of plastic surgery.

           We reveal that he is sitting across from SARAH, a 
           professional-looking young woman in her late 20's. She is 
           clutching a legal pad and pen. Ty is holding out a plush toy 
           called a Beanie Boo for her inspection. (Beanie Boos resemble 
           Beanie Babies, with huge, colourful eyes.)

           Sarah looks mildly bewildered. A few beats of silence.

                        Do you like him?

                                 SARAH
                        I like the eyes.

                                 TY
                        What about his eyes specifically?

                        They're very -- they're very wide, and 
                        innocent...

           Ty keeps looking at her expectantly.

                                 SARAH
                        ...but also... very alert, and kind of 
                        energized, and -- shiny. The pupils 
                        are very large, I like that.

           A beat.

                                 TY
                        He looks like he's high on cocaine, is 
                        that what you're saying?

                                 SARAH
                        Not intentionally, no.

           Ty opens the briefcase at his feet and puts the Beanie Boo 
           inside, snapping the case closed.

           A few beats of silence. Eventually, Sarah reaches into her 
           own briefcase and retrieves a small audio recorder.

                                 SARAH
                        Is it okay if I record this?

                                 TY

                        I suppose not.

           Sarah starts the recorder and places it on the table between 
           them. Ty watches her do this, his expression scrutinizing.

                                 TY
                        How old are you, anyway?

                        I was about ten when it really started 
                        to pick up. The craze. I remember it.

                                 TY
                        So do I.

           Another silence.

                        Fire away. What do you need to know?

                                 SARAH
                        Why don't you just... start at the 
                        beginning?

           Ty looks out the window. Smiles to himself, humourlessly.

                                 TY
                        A very good place to start, right?

           We can tell from the look in his eyes that it's not.

           EXT. WARNER HOUSE - DAY

           A summery afternoon in the Chicago suburbs. A young, good-
           looking guy stands on the front step of a handsome two-story 
           house, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else in the 
           world. He carries a suitcase. This is a 22-year-old Ty 
           Warner.

           After a few beats, the front door opens and we meet Ty's 
           father, HAROLD "HAL" WARNER (mid-50's) -- slickly handsome, 
           charming when he wants to be.

           Hal looks at Ty, evaluating. Almost remembers to smile.

                                 TY
                        Or just the son.

           After an awkward beat, Hal steps aside to let Ty enter the 
           house. The door shuts behind them.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - DAY

           The house is grand, but dark and dead-feeling. Ty's steps 
           slow a few feet into the foyer. He turns to face his father.

                        Where's Joyce at?

                                 HAL
                        She's in her room.

                                 TY
                        And Mom, she's--

                                 HAL
                        In her room.

                                 TY
                        Yeah.

           Ty breaks his father's gaze and starts upstairs.

                                 HAL
                        Ty.

           Ty turns, reluctantly.

                                 HAL
                        You and me -- we're going to have 
                        dinner and we're going to have a chat.

                                 TY
                        It's been a long day.

                        It's non-negotiable.

           Hal walks off into another room. Ty watches him go, and then 
           continues trudging upstairs.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

           Ty puts his suitcase down outside the closed door to a 
           bedroom. Presses his ear to the door and hears nothing. 
           Knocks gently.

                                 TY
                        Mom?

           No one answers. After a moment's hesitation, he slowly twists 
           open the doorknob and enters--

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - GEORGIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

           A sparsely-decorated room. A woman sits on the bed, facing 
           the window with her back to Ty. She's middle-aged, painfully 
           thin, with a look on her face that suggests she's not 
           altogether sane -- which she isn't. This is Ty's mother, 
           GEORGIA (late 40's).

                                 TY
                        Hi Mom.

           Georgia turns her head. Sees Ty. Doesn't react.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Hello Ty.

           Ty walks slowly to come and sit on the bed next to her.

                                 TY
                        I'm back.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Mm-hm.

           But her mind is elsewhere. After a moment, she turns to him--

                                 GEORGIA
                        I heard men come into the house.

           A beat.

                                 TY
                        One man came into the house, and that

                                 GEORGIA
                        It's the intelligence agency, they're 
                        co-conspirators--

                                 TY
                        Mom--

                                 GEORGIA
                                                (more urgently)
                        Your father is in on it. He's trying 
                        to--

                                 TY
                        Mom, listen--

                                 GEORGIA
                        He's trying to murder me. They're all 
                        in on it. They're here. Do you 
                        understand, I'm not safe here--

           Ty takes his mother by the shoulders, gently. Looks into her 
           eyes and speaks slowly and clearly.

                                 TY
                        Mom. This is Ty. I love you. And I can 
                        promise that you're safe here. No one 
                        is in on anything.

           Georgia's breathing evens out as she focuses on Ty, but her 
           expression does not soften.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ty is leaning over a sink, closely examining his reflection 
           in the mirror. He doesn't simply stare -- he pokes and prods, 
           squeezes and stretches skin -- looking for flaws and finding 
           them everywhere. It's a routine that's uncomfortable to watch 
           -- one that's suggestive of an inner torment much deeper and 
           darker than the leftover insecurities of adolescence.

           Then -- Ty jumps as he catches sight of a girl behind him in 
           the mirror. He whips around to see his 18-year-old sister, 
           JOYCE, standing in the bathroom doorway.

                                 TY
                        Joyce, you scared the shit out of me.

                                 JOYCE

                        I'm glad to see you.

                                 JOYCE

                        What the hell are you doing in here?

                                 JOYCE
                        I didn't hear the water running.

                                 TY
                        Let's go to your room.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - JOYCE'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Joyce is sprawled on her bed, smoking a cigarette with the 
           window open. Ty sits on the floor in front of her.

                                 TY
                        It was a scorcher of a Tuesday, same 
                        old six o'clock shift, I was putting 
                        in the hours... and then who should 
                        walk in the door and sit at my station 
                        but The Hustler himself.

                                 JOYCE
                                                ("get out")
                        No. Paul Newman?

                                 TY
                        Yes.

                                 JOYCE
                        What was he like?

                                 TY
                        Wait for it. So I get myself together 
                        and I go over and I take his order. 
                        Club sandwich and soda. I get it for 
                        him, I say nothing.

                                 JOYCE
                        This story is not paying off.

                                 TY
                        Wait for it. So he finishes, pays the 
                        check -- nice tip, by the way -- and 
                        just as he's about to leave, he looks 
                        straight at me -- you know he's got 
                        those eyes -- and he says "Son, you're 
                        the first person in a long time who's 
                        had the decency to treat me like a 
                        human being and not some good for 
                        public consumption." And so of course 
                        then I say how much I admire his work 
                        and he's a hero of mine and I'm 
                        actually trying to break into the 
                        business myself -- and then I swear to 
                        God, Joyce, he says, "You give me your 
                        number, and if a part ever comes up in 
                        one of my movies, we'll be sure to 
                        give you a ring."

           Ty looks up at Joyce, gives a shrug and a wistful half-smile.

                                 TY
                        So who knows. Hollywood might call me 
                        back yet.

           Joyce looks awestruck for a few beats. And then--

                                 JOYCE
                        Bullshit.

           They burst into laughter.

                                 TY
                        You should have seen your face--

                                 JOYCE
                        You're such an asshole--

                                 TY
                        But that was pretty good, right? You 
                        have to admit--

                        Oh yeah, you really had me there for a 
                        minute--

                                 TY
                        I did though! You swallowed it whole!

           Joyce shakes her head and smiles at her brother.

                        laugh. If you keep doing it, I'll 
                        forgive you for leaving me alone with 
                        them for four years.

           Ty's expression turns serious.

                                 TY
                        How are things here?

           Joyce's smile slips, and then disappears altogether.

                                 TY
                        Do you talk to Dad?

                                 JOYCE
                        What do you think.

                                 TY
                        So -- who do you talk to?

                                 JOYCE
                        Who do you talk to?

           They look at each other, unsmiling.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ty is standing over an old grand piano in the middle of the 
           room, his expression a strange mix of nostalgia and 
           apprehension.

           Eventually he sits down on the bench. Slowly, uncertainly

           raises one hand. He places his fingers on the dusty keys, but 
           does not play -- lost in a memory.

           Then -- Ty jumps as the silence is shattered by his father's 
           voice, calling to him from another room:

           Ty and Hal sit across from each other at the dining table, TV

                        but...

           Hal ignores this.

                        very well be a toy salesman.

                        It goes like this, Ty: You can take 
                        the job, or you can find another by 
                        the end of the week. Otherwise, you're 
                        out of the house.

           Ty won't meet his eyes. He's pissed and humiliated.

                                 TY
                        You know Mom thinks you're trying to

                        I think she needs help that you're not 
                        giving her.

                        Mom, Joyce--

           Ty stands up and moves from the table.

                        You gonna make me?

           A long look between them. And then Ty leaves the room. After 
           a few seconds, we hear the front door slam.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT (LATER)

           In the backseat of a car parked on a quiet residential seat, 
           we find Ty and an attractive woman in her late 30's/early 
           40's (NANCY). They're half-dressed, sharing a cigarette.

                        Except I'm not next door anymore. When 
                        did you sell the house?

                                 NANCY
                        After the divorce. I got custody of 
                        the girls. The ex got custody of most 
                        everything else.

                                 TY

                        And you were in Los Angeles all this 
                        time.

                                 TY

                        Because I found out it's possible for 
                        the star at school in Kalamazoo, 
                        Michigan to be the guy who never gets 
                        a callback in Hollywood, California. I 
                        didn't want to park cars and wait 
                        tables for the rest of my life in a 
                        city that was indifferent to me.

                        get off on the feeling of being the 
                        big man. Also, I refuse to be a

                        wouldn't look at all like the big man. 
                        He'd look like the man who brought in 
                        under him the young stud who beat the 
                        old goat at his own game.

           Ty looks at her, intrigued against his will.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - TY'S BEDROOM - DAY

           The next day. Alone in his childhood room, Ty opens the 
           drawer of his bedside table and removes from within it a 
           worn, old-fashioned teddy bear.

           Ty stares at it for a few moments before sitting down on the 
           bed. He examines the bear's face and stitching. Presses his 
           nose to the top of its head, breathes in deeply. The look in 
           his eyes is that of a person torn between wanting to remember 
           and wanting to forget.

           Eventually, he gets up and returns the bear to the drawer. 
           Closes it firmly.

           CLOSE ON his face as he stands perfectly still, lost in 
           thought.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - TY'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Ty works at his desk, drafting what looks like a short speech 
           on scrap paper. He mumbles to himself, scratching out lines 
           and adding new ones.

           INT. WARNER HOUSE - TY'S BEDROOM - LATER

           In a scene vaguely reminiscent of De Niro in            , Ty 
                                                        Taxi Driver     
           stands in front of a full-length mirror -- alternating 
           between styling his hair, practicing a certain type of 
           million-watt smile, and rehearsing what sounds like a sales 
           pitch (which we will hear in full in the following scenes).

           EXT. NORMA'S TOYS - DAY

           The door of a small-town toy shop opens to reveal a frumpy-
           looking, middle-aged store owner (NORMA).

           Before she can speak, Ty -- standing in front of her, holding 
           a sample trunk -- flashes a well-practiced million-watt 
           smile.

                        Hi Norma. My name is Ty Warner, I'm a 
                        representative from the Dakin Toy 
                        Company. If you have time today, I'd 
                        love to take you through our line of 
                        plush products.

           He's slick, subtly flirtatious. Norma's almost breathless.

           INT. NORMA'S TOYS - BACK ROOM - DAY

           The sample trunk is open. Ty is holding the stuffed dog we 
           saw in the previous scene for Norma to take a look at.

                                 TY
                        I think the ultimate question, Norma, 
                        is this: What makes a toy a "him", and 
                        not an "it"? If you ask me, it comes 
                        down to a certain intangible quality I 
                        think is best described as "presence".

           Ty locks eyes with Norma. She's mesmerized.

                                 TY
                        When you're looking into his eyes and 
                        he's looking back, you know he's real 
                        and you know you want to take him 
                        home. Don't you?

           OFF Norma's face--

           EXT. NORMA'S TOYS - DAY

           Ty blows out of the shop with his trunk. There's a swagger in 
           his step now. He puts his sunglasses on, and music kicks in.

           In a SERIES OF SCENES, we see the doors to three different 
           small-town toy shops open, and Ty flash his million-watt 
           smile for three different SHOP OWNERS. The third owner is a 
           surprisingly attractive young woman. We see Ty winning over 
           the first two shop owners with his pitch -- and we see him 
           fucking the third, attractive shop owner against the wall in 
           the back room. We end with CLOSEUPS of three different hands 
           signing off on order forms.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Ty exits yet another shop and swaggers down the sidewalk. He 
           is now 35. He is wearing a long fur coat and a top hat and 
           carrying a cane. Eventually, he arrives at a white Rolls-
           Royce, gets in, and starts up the engine.

           We're in the glass-walled office of HAROLD NIZAMIAN, CEO of 
           Dakin (50's). Harold is sitting behind his desk while

                        neither of us can deny that Ty Warner

                        You're saying he's confident?

                                 VIRGINIA
                        I'm saying he's an asshole.

           The door to Harold's office opens. This time, sales 
           supervisor PAUL ROCHE (40's) enters.

                                 NIZAMIAN
                        Hello Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        Sir. I'd appreciate it very much if 
                        you were to fire Ty Warner.

                                 NIZAMIAN

                                 VIRGINIA
                        See?

           At that moment, we hear the soft rap of knuckles on glass. 
           Virginia and Paul turn around to see Ty Warner, with his fur 
           coat, top hat and cane, waving at them from outside 
           Nizamian's office. His smile says he knows exactly what 
           they're talking about.

           Nizamian smiles and waves back. Virginia and Paul do not. 
           Once Ty has stopped waving and moved out of sight--

                        Is he bad at his job? Can you honestly 
                        tell me he's not good at what he does?

                                 PAUL
                        No sir, he's the best salesman I've 
                        ever seen. I'm telling you he's a 
                        conniving egomaniac and a toxic 
                        presence in this workplace, and that's 
                        gotta count for something.

                                 NIZAMIAN
                        It does. Unless we're talking about 
                        the best salesman we've ever seen.

           INT. DAKIN INC. - DAY

           We follow Ty through the offices of one of the most 
           successful plush toy companies in the industry. The people he 
           passes watch him -- their expressions vary from awe (the 
           young female employees) to distaste (everyone else). Ty 
           either smiles/winks at the people he passes (the pretty young 
           female employees) or ignores them (everyone else).

           INT. DAKIN INC. - OUTSIDE TY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ty turns a corner to head in the direction of his secretary's 
           desk. The secretary we recognize as Carol Nichols.

                                 TY
                        Hi Carol.

                        Lowell and Sons wants to double their

                        recommendation. Same with Canton

                        Youngstown.

           She glances up at him.

                                 CAROL
                        What's with the pimp costume?

                                 TY
                        Peacocking. It's a sales tactic.

                                 CAROL
                        Yeah, I bet it's really effective.

                                 TY
                        It is.

           He starts to swagger past her to his office door.

                                 TY
                                                (mock-dramatically)

                        over 13 years now, Carol, and let me 
                        tell you: it's all about the people. 
                        Understanding them, their psychology, 
                        what makes them tick and gets them hot--

                                 CAROL
                        It's funny, because I wouldn't 
                        necessarily describe you as a "people 
                        person". Did I tell you Paul Roche 
                        wants to meet you in his office after 
                        lunch? Again?

           Ty stops.

                                 CAROL
                        Why exactly do you insist on fucking 
                        with him?

                                 TY
                        I don't fuck with him. I just don't

                                 CAROL
                        What gave you that impression?

           But there's a hint of a smile at the corner of her mouth.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Ty and Joyce sit in a booth by the window. Joyce is now in 
           her early 30's -- older, thicker, and more miserable.

                                 TY
                        Have you seen Mom recently?

                                 JOYCE
                        No.

                        I went to visit her a few weeks ago. 
                        She's not good, Joyce. We really have 
                        to take her to see somebody.

                                 JOYCE
                        You take her to see somebody.

                                 TY
                        I'll tell you who should take her to 
                        see somebody is Dad. Whether or not 
                        they're still married is irrelevant -- 
                        there are certain responsibilities you 
                        don't get to divorce your way out of.

                                 JOYCE
                        Can we just talk about something else? 
                        I feel like I never see you anymore. 
                        And I feel that way because, in fact, 
                        I never see you anymore.

                                 TY

                        So that's it? You're done? You're 
                        gonna work at Dakin for the rest of

                        The Wizard of Oz was a little bald 
                        balloonist and he was also a con-man

           INT. TY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           An immaculately-kept condo filled with sumptuous furniture 
           and art. An expensive grand piano sits in one corner. A 
           Rolling Stones record sits in an expensive record player, the 
           stylus in the last groove. Despite all the luxurious 
           trappings, there is a distinct air of gloom in this place.

           Ty, dressed in a robe, stands in front of an ornate mirror, 
           examining his face. A strange kind of torment lurks behind 
           his eyes as he stares at himself.

           Then, abruptly, he walks away from the mirror.

           INT. TY'S CONDO - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Ty sits hunched over his desk, working on a sketch of 
           something with laser-like focus. He's surrounded by pages of 
           notes, fabric samples, stuffed animals from several different 
           brands (some of them half-ripped apart), and rough sketches 
           of plush toys that do not yet exist.

           This is Ty's secret passion project, an outlet that for some 
           reason brings him total peace. His face is relaxed, his eyes 
           no longer simmering with that quiet torment.

           INT. DAKIN INC. - NIZAMIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ty is standing in front of Harold Nizamian.

                                 TY

           A long silence.

           Harold's smile is kind but it's clear his mind is made up.

                        I'll talk it over with Virginia.

           INT. TY'S CONDO - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Ty is leaned back in his office chair, staring dejectedly at 
           his sketches and fabric samples. Then -- the phone on his 
           desk rings.

           He listens -- and his face is suddenly tight with panic.

                                 TY
                        Mom? Mom, what is it?

           He takes the receiver away from his ear, stares at it -- the 
           person on the other end has hung up. After a moment, he jumps 
           to his feet.

           INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ty, Joyce and Hal (now in his late 60's) stand in the hallway 
           outside a patient room, speaking to a DOCTOR. In the room, we 
           see Georgia (now in her early 60's), sedated in bed.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Now we'll keep her here for a while 
                        just to get her symptoms under 
                        control, but you have to remember that 
                        this is a lifelong illness. You need 
                        the right treatment and you need 
                        consistent treatment to manage it 
                        effectively. The good news is that 
                        with a combination of medication and 
                        therapy, and a strong support system, 
                        I'm confident she'll be able to lead a 
                        relatively normal--

                        Is it bad that we didn't bring her in 
                        until now?

           A beat.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Ideally, with paranoid schizophrenia, 
                        you want an early diagnosis and 
                        treatment, but the important thing is 
                        we know now.

           Joyce and Hal look at the ground. Ty is ashen-faced.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I've got to run, but if you have any 
                        other questions, just let the nurse 
                        know.

           The doctor leaves. There is a long silence.

                                 TY
                                                (to himself)
                        I can't believe this.

                        He said the important thing is we know 
                        now--

                                 TY
                        You knew what was wrong with her. You 
                        knew for 30 years.

                                 JOYCE
                        Ty, just--

           But Ty doesn't listen. He turns and strides down the hallway, 
           headed for the exit.

           INT. TY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ty paces the room, drink in hand -- seething, mind whirring.

           And then -- he stops. He has come to a decision about 
           something. He walks over to a phone and dials a number. Waits 
           while it rings.

                                 TY
                        Yeah, hi -- it's Ty Warner. I need a 
                        favour. And before you say anything, 
                        let me tell you that I'm willing to 
                        pay.

           INT. DAKIN INC. - NIZAMIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           The phone rings. Harold Nizamian, his eyes on paperwork, 
           answers.

                                 NIZAMIAN
                        Yep.

                        Put them on.

           He listens -- and reacts.

                                 NIZAMIAN
                        He's doing what?

           INT. DAKIN INC. - NIZAMIAN'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

           A folder full of paper is tossed onto Nizamian's desk.

           There are three men in Nizamian's office -- Nizamian, Paul 
           Roche, and a PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

                        Yeah, pretty much what they said. 
                        Warner's pitched his own line of plush 
                        toys to 15 Dakin accounts. He's got 
                        sketches and some prototypes -- must 
                        have used your manufacturers. Looks 
                        like he's gearing up to launch his own 
                        business.

           Nizamian and Paul look at each other. Paul looks positively 
           euphoric. Nizamian looks resigned.

                                 PAUL
                        Now what?

           A long pause.

                                 NIZAMIAN

           EXT. TY'S CONDO - NIGHT

           Hal stands outside the front door, pounding it with his fist.

                                 HAL
                        Ty! TY! Open the goddamn door!

           INT. TY'S CONDO - TY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ty is packing a suitcase. Hal is furious.

                                 HAL
                        A competing business? What in the fuck 
                        were you thinking?

                                 TY
                        Is that really of great relevance to 
                        you?

                                 HAL
                        I got you this job!--

                                 TY
                        And I said thank you--

                        doing something like this could mean 
                        for me? Are you even remotely 
                        cognizant of the fact that you may 
                        have put my job at risk?

                                 TY
                        You'll retire soon anyway, does it 
                        really make that big a difference?

                                 HAL
                        And what about you, huh? What are you 
                        going to do now? You with your 
                        sparkling academic record and your 
                        wildly impressive resume?

                                 TY
                        I don't know, but the one thing I do 
                        know is that I don't want to end up 
                        peddling someone else's product for 
                        the rest of my life.

                        stop pretending otherwise.

           A long silence. Hal seems to get what this is really about.

                                 HAL
                        Let me tell you something, guy: I am 
                        not the villain in your story, no 
                        matter how much you wish I was. I am 
                        not responsible for your mother's 
                        illness. I am not the cause of 
                        everything that has gone wrong and 
                        will go wrong in your life. You think 
                        I don't care about you? I do. You 
                        think I haven't helped you out? I 
                        have. You think you're nothing like 
                        me? Guess what, you are. And don't 
                        ever forget it. Don't ever forget that 
                        you are the son of one Harold Warner, 
                        and that your name is H. Ty Warner, 
                        and that first initial which you oh-so-
                        conveniently dropped from the time you 
                        could press a pen to paper stands for 
                        something.

                        You want to point the finger at me and 
                        say I failed, fine. Maybe I did. But 
                        I'll point the finger right back, 
                        because the truth is you failed too.

                        life on it.

           Ty snaps the suitcase shut and picks it up. Holds his 
           father's gaze.

                                 TY
                        Fuck off and die, Dad.

           INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY

           We're back in the high-rise building in 2013 Chicago. The 
           audio recorder is still on the table between Ty and Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        I was wondering if we could talk more 
                        specifically about your childhood.

                                 TY
                        What specifically about it?

                                 SARAH
                        Your mother suffering from untreated 
                        mental illness. Your father being 
                        perhaps not absentee, but at the very 
                        least frequently absent. The fact that 
                        it put you in the position of having 
                        to care for both your sister and your 
                        mother at a very young age. Far from 
                        having a happy childhood, it sounds to 
                        me like you were deprived of any real 
                        kind of childhood.

           Ty thinks about this. Doesn't like it, but kind of nods.

                                 TY
                                                (re: Sarah's notes)
                        Is that what you're going to say?

           A beat.

                                 SARAH
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 TY
                                                (grimly)
                        Whatever you think will work.

           handsome-as-ever Ty Warner (now 38) is lounging poolside.

           TITLE: 1983. Sorrento, Italy.

           Over this, we hear a phone ringing, and then a message being 
           left on an answering machine.

                                 JOYCE (V.O.)
                        Hi Ty. It's your sister. Just 
                        wondering if you're planning on coming 
                        home or speaking to me ever again. 
                        Maybe call me back sometime. Unless 
                        you're dead. At this point, I have no 
                        reason to believe you're not.

           Ty takes a sip from an elegant-looking cocktail.

           EXT. PIAZZA TASSO - DAY

           Ty, dressed impeccably, strolls down a shopping street.

           Suddenly, he stops dead in his tracks. Something in a store 
           window has caught his eye: a display of exquisite plush 
           Himalayan cats.

           INT. SORRENTO TOY SHOP - DAY

           Ty handles one of the cats in the store, examining it with 
           his trademark intensity. It's soft and floppy, and brings to 
           mind a certain bean-filled plush product that Ty will launch 
           a decade later.

           Ty approaches a STORE CLERK. Tries to speak Italian.

                                 TY
                        Puoi aiutarmi, per favore?     chi fa?
                                                   Uh,        

           The store clerk babbles in Italian. The two of them go back 
           and forth, both irritating the other.

                                 TY
                        No --         who makes it, who -- oh,

           Hal Warner in tennis whites is rallying with a MALE FRIEND

           And then he collapses from a sudden, violent heart attack.

           INT. SORRENTO VILLA - NIGHT

           Ty paces his bedroom, talking on the phone. His expression 
           says he can't believe his good luck.

                                 TY
                        No, that's -- I mean it's terrible. 
                        Such a shock. A terrible shock. And -- 
                        sorry, you said something about a 
                        bequest? A bequest to me? Yes. How 
                        much did you say it was again?

           He hangs up with a satisfying CLANG--

           A plane touches down on the runway.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Ty and Carol sit across from each other in a booth.

                        Yes.

           A beat of silence as Carol just stares at him.

                                 CAROL
                        It's an industry in decline, Ty. Kids 
                        today don't want stuffed cats, they 
                        want computers. Video games, not 
                        fucking velveteen rabbits. A homegrown 
                        startup doesn't stand a chance against 
                        Applause and Dakin and--

                                 TY
                        How is Dakin?

                                 CAROL
                        What? Oh, I -- yeah, I left. About six 
                        months after you... left.

           At first, this surprises Ty. Then he decides it doesn't.

                                 TY
                        Even better.

           They clink glasses. Music kicks in and will continue over the 
           following SEQUENCE...

           INT. O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Ty and Carol, suitcases in tow, stride through the airport 
           with purpose.

           EXT. SEOUL INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - DAY

           Ty and Carol walk down a street lined with towering 
           factories, both looking lost.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - DAY

           In CLOSEUPS, we see a prototype of Angel the plush Himalayan 
           cat being constructed.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - LATER

           The finished prototype is tossed into a bin for disposal.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - ANOTHER DAY

           More CLOSEUPS of a slightly different, possibly improved 
           Angel prototype being made.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - LATER

           The second prototype is tossed into the disposal bin.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTORY - ANOTHER DAY

           In quick SUCCESSIVE SHOTS, we see three more rounds of 
           prototypes hurled into the bin.

           INT. SEOUL TOY FACTOR - ANOTHER DAY

           From the same angle used in the opening scene, we see the 
           faces of Ty, Carol and the factory owner. Ty is staring down 
           at us, considering. Carol and the factory owner are staring 
           at Ty.

           REVERSE ANGLE -- The final, finished version of Angel the 
           stuffed cat.

           A long silence. And then Ty finally says--

                                 TY
                        Yep. That's good.

           After a moment of stunned silence, Carol and the factory 
           owner look at each other -- and then celebrate silently 
           behind Ty's back.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Ty sits at his desk, pen in hand, hunched over a piece of 
           paper on which he has sketched ideas for company names/logos. 
           He encloses the word "warner" in a heart, and then looks at 
           it critically.

           After a moment, he crosses it out. Draws another heart, this 
           time containing the word "ty".

           CLOSE ON a red, heart-shaped hang tag containing the word 
           "ty". We PULL BACK to reveal a trunkful of plush Himalayan 
           cats, each with a "ty" tag dangling from one ear. After a 
           moment, the trunk is snapped shut.

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)

           With two large trunks in tow, Ty and Carol weave their way 
           through crowds of vendors and reps unloading/hauling their 
           merchandise. Ty is dressed to the nines, wearing sunglasses.

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           A huge space with hundreds of booths decked out with toy and 
           gift products. The place is packed, but it's easy to spot Ty 
           and Carol at a cherry-red booth loaded with four varieties of 
           gorgeous plush cats.

           Ty is in his glory again, the trade show equivalent of the 
           Stones at Hyde Park. In QUICK CUTS, we see him giving his

           INT. ORIGINAL TY WAREHOUSE/DISTRIBUTION CENTER - DAY

           Ty is standing with a young warehouse worker (BRIAN) in the 
           middle of an aisle lined on either side with cardboard boxes. 
           Each box is stamped with a red heart that reads "ty".

           Ty is now in his late 40's -- a little cockier, a little 
           glossier, and inevitably a little older.

                        This is all outgoing, organized by 
                        ship date. East Coast is this side, 
                        West Coast that side--

                        Once every two months, we're due for 
                        one on the 25th.

                        Reported to and recorded by me.

           Ty nods in approval.

                                 TY
                        Good. Good job, Brian.

                                 BRIAN
                        Thanks, Mr. Warner.

           Brian starts heading back up the aisle. Ty watches him go, 
           quietly impressed. Then--

                                 TY
                        You didn't take your vacation.

           Brian turns.

                                 TY
                        I thought you said you were going to 
                        take a few days off. You were here all 
                        last week.

                                 BRIAN
                        I know, it's just -- I figured I kinda 
                        need the money.

                                 TY
                        You're in college, right?

                                 BRIAN
                        Yeah, and with rent on top of 
                        tuition...

           Brian hesitates. Then--

                                 BRIAN
                        I mean, I could stay with my parents, 
                        but with my dad, I--
                                                (beat)
                        It's just better to get out on my own, 
                        you know?

           Ty nods slowly.

                                 TY
                        I do.

           Brian half-smiles and turns around again. Ty is left alone, 
           digesting their conversation.

           INT. ORIGINAL TY HEADQUARTERS - DAY (LATER)

           The original, modest Ty Inc headquarters. The company is 
           clearly successful, but this is only the calm before the 
           Beanie Baby storm.

           Our attention is focused on a large corner office for two 
           reasons: the door says "T. WARNER", and we can hear a very 
           heated conversation taking place inside it. The 20 or so 
           employees working in the main area are trying and failing not 
           to eavesdrop.

           INT. ORIGINAL TY HEADQUARTERS - TY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Ty sits at a desk covered with Beanie Baby prototypes. His 
           sister Joyce stands in front of him.

                                 JOYCE
                        I asked you a question.

                                 TY
                        In my mind it was rhetorical.

                                 JOYCE
                        No, I want an answer. I want you to 
                        attempt--

                                 TY
                        I want you to leave so I can get back 
                        to work.

                                 JOYCE
                        Playing with beanbags?

                        Where the hell were you on 
                        Thanksgiving?

           Ty doesn't answer.

                                 JOYCE
                        I invited you to dinner with my 
                        family. You said you'd be there and 
                        you weren't. You didn't even call--

                        Can I just ask you one question?

           He holds up a prototype for a pink pig Beanie Baby 
           (Squealer).

                                 TY
                        Do you think this one looks a bit like 
                        a penis?

           Joyce just stares at him.

                                 JOYCE
                        I'm starting to understand... that you 
                        really just have absolutely no 
                        interest in any kind of relationship 
                        with me whatsoever. No interest in 
                        getting to know my children, your 
                        nieces and nephews. It has taken me 
                        upwards of 40 years, Ty, but I am 
                        finally coming to terms with the fact 
                        that you genuinely do not give a fuck

                        do it with. Jesus, you're no better 
                        than Dad!

                                 TY
                        Joyce, the one thing I ask of you is 
                        that you never -- ever -- compare me 
                                          ____               
                        to Dad again. Okay? I am nothing like 
                        Dad. You're like Dad. Let me ask you 
                             ______                          
                        this: Who's the one who pays for mom's 
                        apartment and all her treatment, and 
                        who takes her calls when she's being 
                        abducted by aliens, and who visits her 
                        in that place when she stops taking 
                        her drugs and slips off the brink of 
                        insanity into the abyss? That's all 
                        me, sis!

                        to breathe, right? Someone dares to 
                        care about Ty Warner, well watch out, 
                        because he'll do whatever it takes to

           Joyce pushes past Carol and exits. Carol moves to stand in

           Carol blinks in surprise. For a moment it looks like she's 
           going to push for details, but then she seems to decide 
           against it.

                        Who cares about losing control? What's 
                        that compared to losing sales?

                        It goes against our brand values. It 
                        makes them look cheap, and mass-

           Carol stands and heads for the door.

                                 CAROL
                        Think about it.

                        And I'm sending the prototypes back. 
                        They're not right.

           Carol pauses with her hand on the doorknob. She closes her 
           eyes, as if praying for patience.

                                 CAROL
                        I pray for you to one day realize that 
                        you make these decisions with very 
                        little regard for what's right and 
                        what's wrong. You do the things you 
                        do, Ty, because you like playing God.

           And with that, she leaves, closing the door behind her.

           Ty leans back in his chair, thinking. His gaze drifts... and 
           happens to catch his reflection in the computer monitor on 
           his desk. He studies it for a moment, and then rubs his face 
           in his hands, suddenly exhausted.

           The rubbing gradually becomes slower, more deliberate, and 
           more contemplative. He's feeling skin that's looser than it 
           used to be, lines that were not there ten years ago. 
           Eventually, he pulls his face taut with his fingers and puts 
           his elbows on the desk. He stares down into the unseeing eyes 
           of the Beanie Baby prototype on his desk.

           Ty, sitting in a patient examination chair, scrutinizes his 
           blotchy face in a handheld mirror.

           dyed hair and bleached teeth -- snaps off his plastic gloves.

                        I did six units in that site. I

           He takes one long last look and then puts the mirror down.

                        some... minor alterations.

           He indicates different parts of his face -- nose, chin, eyes, 
           etc. Fishbein nods.

                                 TY
                        What's your opinion on that?

                                 FISHBEIN
                        Well, listen, Ty -- you're a good-
                        looking guy, alright? You'll never 
                        hear me say otherwise. But the truth 
                        is everyone's got something they wish 
                        they could change. My opinion is if 
                        the money's no problem, then what the 
                        hell's stopping you?

           OFF Ty's look--

           INT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

           Ty drives in his Rolls-Royce. His face now shows the first 
           signs of plastic surgery -- subtly shaped and stretched 
           tighter.

           He passes a toy shop, and notices his plush cats displayed in 
           the window. After a moment's thought, he pulls over.

           INT. CHICAGO TOY SHOP - DAY

           Ty enters the store. His eyes rake over the various offerings 
           as he makes his way over to the plush toy section. Once 
           there, he realizes that there is one other customer in the 
           store: an attractive redhead in her early 30's. We will soon 
           know her as FAITH MCGOWAN.

           Ty subtly checks her out -- notices that she is holding and 
           looking over one of his plush cats. He quietly moves to stand

           beside her before speaking up.

                                                (re: the cat)
                        What do you think of them?

           Faith looks up, surprised.

                                 FAITH
                        Sorry?

                                 TY
                        The cats. What do you think of them?

           Faith looks slightly uncomfortable with the fact that a grown 
           man in a toy store has just asked for her opinion on stuffed 
           cats, but she also looks like she thinks Ty is good-looking.

                                 FAITH
                        I... think they're beautiful. I've 
                        been standing here trying to talk 
                        myself out of buying one of each.

                                 TY
                        Do you mind me asking what it is you 
                        like about them?

                        What I like about them, you mean like 
                        specifically?

                                 TY
                        Yes.

                                 FAITH
                        Well... they look real, I suppose. And 
                        they feel real. I remember my aunt had 
                        three Himalayan cats, just like this 
                        one -- I used to chase them 
                        relentlessly when I was a little girl, 
                        trying to catch them so I could hold 
                        them in my lap like baby dolls. I 
                        still remember how soft and boneless 
                        they felt -- better than blankets.

           Ty's gaze is very intense. Faith suddenly feels awkward.

                                 FAITH
                        Anyway, this one reminds me of that.

           She looks back down at the toys. Ty smiles.

           Faith hesitates. Glances at him.

                        I've got kids.

                        I didn't think you were buying for 
                        yourself.

                                 FAITH
                        No, I mean -- if you're hitting on me, 
                        which I think you might be, I just -- 
                        I thought you should know. Not all 
                        guys are good with kids.

           Ty smiles more widely, kind of laughs.

                        What?

           He extends his hand. After a moment's hesitation, Faith

                        We divorced two years ago. I actually

                        God, it feels like yesterday.

                        It was-- yeah. I mean, it wasn't good. 
                        Mostly it was just so hard on the 
                        girls. That was the only thing that 
                        made me wonder at the time if I should 
                        stay in it -- I didn't want them to 
                        grow up feeling like they didn't have 
                        a family, you know? I still feel

                        right now that you don't do your kids

                        Um... well, I suppose since I told you 
                        what I do, it's only fair that you 
                        tell me what you do.

                        Well, it's been a couple of different 
                        things. Right now I work in a lighting 
                        store.

                        Yes.

                                 TY
                        Okay. Interesting.

                                 FAITH
                        In here? Very nice. Very romantic.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           An all-white, modernist mansion in the affluent suburb of Oak 
           Brook. Ty has added substantially to the collection of 
           beautiful furniture and artifacts we saw in his condo.

           Faith is sitting on the sofa, taking it all in. Ty enters 
           after a moment with a drink for each of them.

                                 FAITH
                        You have... a beautiful place.

                                 TY
                        Why, thank you.

           He hands her a drink. They each take a sip. There is a semi-
           awkward silence in which Faith notices Ty's grand piano.

                                 FAITH
                        And a beautiful piano.

           They look at each other.

                                 FAITH
                        Do you play?

                                 TY
                        I do, in fact.

                                 FAITH
                        Any chance of an impromptu 
                        performance?

           Ty hesitates.

                                 TY
                        Oh, why not.

           He puts his drink down, gets up and walks over to the piano. 
           Sits down at the bench. After a moment, he launches into 
           Nocturne no. 13 in C minor by Chopin. He's fantastic.

           Faith is mesmerized. She slowly rises and walks over to the 
           piano to listen and watch. When Ty finishes, there's a moment 
           of silence before she speaks.

                                 FAITH
                        Who taught you to play like that?

                                 TY
                                                (not looking at her)
                        My mother. She was an incredible 
                        pianist. Is.

           Again, Faith senses that the right course of action is to not 
           ask further questions.

                                 FAITH
                                                (re: the bench)
                        May I?

           Ty makes room for her and she sits. After a moment, she 
           starts playing the melody line for something like "My 
           Favourite Things".

                                 TY
                        You play too.

                        Yeah, just a little.

           Ty listens for a little while, and then joins in, each 
           playing one hand/part. It sounds pretty good.

           Eventually, they turn to look at each other.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ty and Faith in bed that same night. They are turned on their 
           sides, facing each other.

                        Tell me more about making toys.

                                 FAITH
                        I don't know. Anything.

           A beat. Then--

                                 TY
                        Do you want to hear about the new 
                        line? Otherwise known as the greatest 
                        idea I've ever had?

                                 FAITH

                                 TY
                        They're called Beanie Babies.

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Another trade show. The Ty Inc. booth is far bigger and more 
           glamorous than it was a few years prior. About ten different 
           Beanie Babies are displayed front and center.

           TITLE: 1994.

           Ty himself is off to the side, talking to Carol.

                                 CAROL
                        There was one guy who asked if they 
                        were defectives and another who said 
                        it looked like--

                        Road-- yeah, how did you [know that?]--

                                 TY
                        Does it matter how I know that?

                                 CAROL
                        No.

           They stand in silence for a moment.

                                 CAROL
                        They're five-dollar beanbags, Ty. You 
                        honestly thought that was going to 
                        become our bread and butter?

                                 TY
                        I did and still do.

                        dollars today that isn't garbage. I

                        themselves for not thinking of it 
                        first.

                        Redesign -- they're already in

                        into a fucking brick wall. And Peanut 
                        the Elephant -- the blue's too dark. 
                        Baby blue, no more royal blue.

           We slowly PUSH IN on the Beanie Babies, focusing in 
           particular on Peanut the royal blue elephant (who will soon 
           become a much more significant character in this story).

                        One each. Or two each. How much are 
                        they -- five bucks? We can do two 
                        each.

           INT. GIFT STORE - DAY

           CLOSE ON two pairs of small hands placing two Beanie Babies 
           apiece on the counter. One is Peanut the royal blue elephant.

           TITLE: 1995. Chicago.

           The hands belong to CHRISSY (9) and JOEY (7), who are 
           accompanied by their mother MARYANN GALLOWAY (late 30's/early 
           40's) -- the archetypal 90's Midwestern soccer mom.

           The store owner, RICHARD (50's), smiles at Maryann as she 
           gets her wallet out.

                                 MARYANN
                        What kind of mother resorts to bribery 
                        to make her kids go to the swimming 
                        lessons they asked her to pay for? I 
                        mean, for cryin' out loud.

                                 RICHARD
                        You do what works, Mom.

                                 MARYANN
                        Yeah, well -- I said they could choose 
                        what they wanted and this was it. All 
                        the kids at the school are going nuts 
                        for these things.

                                 RICHARD
                        Kind of cute, aren't they?

                                 MARYANN
                        Yeah. Kind of.

           Richard rings up the Beanie Babies. He notices the blue 
           elephant among the selection -- picks it up.

                        little guy here, he's one of the last 
                        of his kind.

           Maryann nods, half-listening. Then something clicks with her.

                                 MARYANN
                        What do you mean?

                                 RICHARD
                        Peanut the elephant, they don't make 
                        him in royal blue anymore. The rep 
                        from the company, he says that from 
                        now on all Peanuts will be made in 
                        baby blue only. What we're looking at, 
                        Mom, is an endangered species.

           Maryann nods slowly, staring at Richard ... cogs turning.

           Maryann and her friend, fellow soccer mom PENNY SADOWSKI 
           (late 30's/early 40's) are sitting at a large desk. Maryann 
           is typing up some kind of price list on a computer. Penny is 
           on the phone, with a pencil and legal pad in front of her.

           It is important to note that almost every available flat 
           surface in this home office is cluttered with collectible 
           items -- snow globes, figurines, antique plates, etc.

                        No mouth. Is his name Inky? Look in 
                        the red tag. Does it say Inky?

           The sound of kids rough-housing outside the office has 
           reached worrisome decibels. Maryann shouts over her shoulder--

                                 MARYANN
                        Kids!! Keep the noise down, we're 
                        working in here!!

           Penny hangs up the phone--

                        I just got 21 Inkys from a gift shop

           At that moment, the office door opens. PETER GALLOWAY (late

                        Hi Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Maryann. Penny. Hello to you both. 
                        Again.

                                 MARYANN
                        You're home early.

                                 PETER
                        You're working late. Which is strange, 
                        because you don't work for IBM 
                        anymore.

                                 MARYANN
                        It's just a little project Penny's 
                        been helping me out with.

                                 PETER
                        Is it the same little project that's 
                        racked up a $1,200 phone bill?

                                 MARYANN
                        That needs explaining -- you see, 
                        we're investing in an emerging market.

                                 PETER
                        And what market would that be?

           A beat.

                                 MARYANN
                        It's-- there are these little stuffed 
                        animals, and they're just so darn cute 
                        and they're really popular with the 
                        kids at school and some of them are 
                        really hard to find. So Penny and I -- 
                        we're tracking down the rare ones, and 
                        we're gonna sell duplicates at the

                                 PETER
                        Duplicates?

                                 MARYANN
                        We want one of each for ourselves. Our 
                        kids. So we need duplicates.
                                                (beat)
                        Long story short, we're investing in 
                        an emerging market.

           A long beat as Peter stares at his wife. Then--

                                 PETER
                        I don't want to see another $1,200 
                        phone bill. I don't care how darn cute 
                        the things are.

           With that, Peter shuts the door. A beat of silence.

           INT. ORIGINAL TY HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A meeting with executives and senior managers. Carol sits 
           next to Ty, who is much more interested in the two new Beanie 
           prototypes he's examining than what's being said.

                        some interest from a number of major 
                        retailers, but--

                                 TY

                        It's funny, because I like "steady"

           Ty and Carol fall silent and turn back to John, who has been 
           trying to talk over their argument.

                        In the past three weeks, 37 stores in 
                        Cook County placed emergency orders 
                        for Beanie Babies. They all want to 
                        know if they can triple their original 
                        shipments.

                        I had the account execs call each 
                        store, try to figure out if there was 
                        some kind of correlation. The only one 
                        we could find was that every location, 
                        until recently, had in stock at least 
                        one discontinued Beanie character.

                        shape of the fucking snout and spends

                        for kids who aren't going to know the 
                        fucking difference. Remember just last 
                        week? He came to the sudden, all-
                        important realization that Pincher the 
                        Crab looked maybe a little too much

           Beanies in his hands without seeing, his mind a million miles 
           away -- suddenly working a million miles a minute.

                        that has to do with anything, but 
                        obviously if these people want triple

                        Holland, 1630's. Tulips were hip, they 
                        were the hot new thing from Turkey. 
                        The Dutch, they liked tulips. Nothing 
                        funky, nothing crazy, just a healthy 
                        -- one might say steady market for 
                        tulips in 17th-century Holland, okay? 
                        Then something happened. Someone did 
                        something or God smiled down or who 
                        knows what the fuck but someway or 
                        another these tulips got sick, they 
                        got a disease. And as a result of that 
                        disease, a single sickly bulb would 
                        bloom not in solid colour, but in one 
                        of hundreds of patterns that ranged 
                        from flamed to feathered to speckled 
                        to striped. Sounds nice, right? That's 
                        because it was. But all prettiness 
                        aside, this commodity was suddenly 
                        defined by a darker, sexier, much more

                        want to make cold hard cash on fucking 
                        flowers? And suddenly, Carol, that 
                        cute little tulip market wasn't so 
                        steady anymore. It was a raging

                        You were right. Marketing. We need a 
                        marketing strategy. And I'm not 
                        talking about a 10-second distraction 
                        on boob tube. I'm talking about 
                        urgency, unpredictability -- the 
                        thrill of the chase. We're going to 
                        get people off on buying plush.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           While their children play, Maryann and Penny stand with about 
           ten other SOCCER MOMS -- all of them trading Beanies for 
           other Beanies or cold hard cash. It looks like a drug deal.

           Maryann works on her hands and knees, putting plastic 
           protectors on the hang tags of roughly 50 Beanie Babies lined 
           up on the floor.

           With much squealing of tires, another SOCCER MOM swings into 
           a parking spot. Jumps out the moment the car stops moving and 
           runs for the mall entrance.

           The two women sit in silence, both looking as though they

                        And then they've announced 20 new 
                        releases...

           Another long, ringing silence -- and then both women slam 
           their phones down and spring to their feet.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           We're blinded by the flash of a professional camera.

           A photo shoot for a magazine is taking place. Ty smiles 
           toothily in a red turtleneck, his arms full of Beanie Babies.

           Over this, we hear Ty being interviewed by a female 
           journalist.

           INT. STUDIO - LATER

           While various ASSISTANTS adjust the lighting and backdrop for 
           the shoot, Ty sits off to the side, getting his makeup 
           touched up. The JOURNALIST, a woman in her late 30's/early 
           40's, sits across from him.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        This is your first in-depth interview 
                        since the craze went national. No 
                        public appearances. Employees are 
                        forbidden from talking about you to 
                        the press. You show up to toy fairs in 
                        disguise? I mean, how do you explain 
                        all that?

                                 TY
                        I don't think there's any explaining 
                        to do. Yes, I'm uncomfortable with the 
                        idea of life in the public eye. What I 
                        am comfortable with is the giving of a 
                        performance. You're allowed to be 
                        somebody else when you're on stage or 
                        on camera -- in front of an audience. 
                        It's escapism, for all parties 
                        involved. It's not the same thing, not 
                        ______

                        world access to the person beneath the 
                        persona.

           The journalist takes a note. Then--

                        What do you have to say about the 
                        status of these toys as collectibles 
                        -- the so-called secondary market for

                        nonetheless good for business. It's an 
                        amazing time we're living in. No one 
                        has to go to the market anymore, the 
                        market comes to you -- all at the 
                        click of a mouse. And that's what 
                        we're looking at now. A free market.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        It would. Unless, of course, the 
                        market is not as transparent as we've 
                        been led to believe.

                                 TY
                        I don't follow.

                        That which is scarce is valuable.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        I don't question your reasoning. But 
                        the mere appearance of scarcity -- 
                        that would be another story. Correct?

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ty is sitting with Faith's daughters LAUREN (8) and JENNA (6) 
           at the kitchen table, over which dozens of Beanie Baby 
           prototypes have been spread. Jenna is holding and closely 
           examining a leopard Beanie. Ty watches for her reaction.

                                 TY
                        Now, Jenna, I'm gonna ask you a 
                        question. And I want you to be 
                        brutally honest with me, you 
                        understand?

           Jenna nods solemnly.

                                 TY
                        Do you think he looks a little too 
                        much like a cheetah?

                                 LAUREN
                        She doesn't even know what a cheetah 
                        is!

                                 TY
                        Lauren, I want your thoughts in just a 
                        second, but right now we're going to 
                        hear from Jenna.
                                                (to Jenna)
                        Remember -- you are your own person. 
                        Your opinion is valid. More than that, 
                        it matters. Don't worry about what 
                        your sister says, and don't you dare 
                        worry about hurting my feelings. What 
                        I need from you now, is the truth.

           The girls hang on to his every word.

                                 TY
                        So -- are you ready?

           Jenna nods.

                                 TY
                        Does he look a little too much like a 
                        cheetah?

                                 JENNA
                        Yes.

           Ty grimaces, slaps a hand over his forehead.

                                 TY
                        I knew it. Oh, the agony!

           The girls laugh. At this point, we see Faith standing in the 
           kitchen doorway, watching and glowing. After a moment, she 
           enters the room and claps her hands together.

                                 FAITH
                                                (to Jenna and Lauren)
                        Okay you two. Bedtime. Non-negotiable.

           Jenna and Lauren protest but eventually scamper out of the 
           room. Faith joins Ty at the table to help him gather up the

           Created using Celtx                                          
           toys in peaceful silence. For a moment, it's a scene of 
           perfect domestic bliss. And then Faith speaks.

                                 FAITH
                        You, my friend, are a natural.

           Something about the praise makes Ty feel vaguely 
           uncomfortable. He smiles, trying to keep it light.

                                 TY
                        Or a top-grade toy supplier.

                                 FAITH
                        No, I'm serious. They don't get like 
                        that around anybody, let alone...
                                                (beat)
                        It's just the fact that they have -- 
                        you know, a man in their lives now, 
                        one who actually listens and talks to 
                        them like they're real people... It's 
                        a very welcome change.

           Ty goes over to the sink, pours himself a glass of water. His 
           back is to Faith, his face taut and expressionless.

                                 TY
                        I really appreciate you saying that.

           He refills the water glass. Faith glances over at him, 
           sensing that something's off.

                                 FAITH
                        Do you want to go up, or...?

                                 TY
                        Yeah, you go on ahead. I'll be there 
                        in a sec.

           Faith hovers for a moment, and then--

                                 FAITH
                        Okay.

           She exits, leaving Ty alone with unwanted thoughts.

           INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY

           We're back in 2013 Chicago -- Ty's interview with Sarah is 
           still underway.

                                 SARAH
                        Are you good with children?

                                 TY
                                                ("are you kidding")
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        It's not a ridiculous question. You 
                        make a product for children, you seem 
                        to have a good sense of what they 
                        like. Would you describe yourself as 
                        nurturing in any way?

                                 TY
                        I don't have kids.

                                 SARAH
                        Faith McGowan's children lived with 
                        you for almost ten years. How would 
                        you characterize your relationship 
                        with them during that time?

           A beat.

                                 TY
                        I'm not answering-- Why the fuck are 
                        you asking this?

                                 SARAH
                                                (slightly impatient)
                        Because we need to write and file a 
                        sentencing memo listing the reasons 
                        why you shouldn't be thrown in prison

                        accounts for more than a decade. Your 
                        role as a parent or guardian is a 
                        potential mitigating factor.

           A long silence. Ty looks down.

                                 TY
                        I owned up to it. I'm otherwise law-
                        abiding.

                                 SARAH
                        That's not enough.

                        I don't have anything more to give.

                                 SARAH
                        So you're prepared to go to jail.

           Ty doesn't answer. Sarah studies his face. Then--

                                 SARAH
                        Do you think you deserve it?

           A long pause.

                                 TY
                        Does that matter?

                                 SARAH
                        It does to me.

           They look at each other -- both trying to figure the other 
           out.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ty and Faith are asleep. After a moment, the phone starts 
           ringing. Ty answers.

                        What happened?

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Ty parks his car and stumbles out. He half-jogs towards the 
           entrance of the apartment building...

           ...and it is revealed that the police and an ambulance are 
           pulled up there. A few ONLOOKERS have gathered. Ty's mother, 
           Georgia, now in her late 70's, is being forcibly restrained 
           by paramedics. She's in a nightgown, and screaming at the top 
           of her lungs.

           A POLICE OFFICER approaches Ty.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Sir, is this--

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Okay, so there's been an incident -- 
                        [we're taking her]--

                                 TY
                        You know what, she's probably -- she's

                        okay--

           The situation is both embarrassing and heartbreaking for Ty. 
           He's barely able to keep it together.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Later that night. Ty finally arrives home. He closes the door 
           behind him and leans against it for a moment, eyes closed.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Ty enters the darkened bedroom. He takes off his jacket, but 
           doesn't move towards the bed -- just stands there, 
           motionless.

           Then -- he realizes Faith is awake as her voice sounds in the 
           darkness:

                                 FAITH
                        Ty?

           A beat.

                                 TY

                                 FAITH
                        What happened?

           Ty resumes undressing.

                                 TY
                        Nothing. You can go back to sleep.

           Faith sits up, turns on the light.

                                 FAITH
                        Is she okay?

           Faith hesitates.

                        Do you -- could we talk about it?

           Silence. Then--

                                 TY
                        I'd rather not.

           Down to his underwear, he starts walking and passes the bed.

                                 FAITH
                        Where are you going?

                        Bathroom.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Ty examines his face in the mirror. That strange torment is 
           back in his eyes. He appears to be fighting a panic attack.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Ty sits on an OR stretcher in a gown as Dr. Fishbein finishes 
           making pen marks on his face for various surgeries.

                                 FISHBEIN
                        So you're good to do it all at once?

                                 TY
                                                (humorless)
                        Would I be here with a faceful of 
                        magic marker if I wasn't?

                                 FISHBEIN
                        Fair enough, fair enough.

           But still, Fishbein seems to hesitate. Ty stares him down.

                        Do you have something you'd like to 
                        say?

                                 FISHBEIN
                        Hm? No, I was just...
                                                (beat)
                        I just want to make sure you're 
                        thinking this through. It's been five 
                        years. You've had two facelifts, three 
                        rhinoplasties. We can talk about the 
                        chin and jaw reconstruction, but I'm 
                        hesitant to do more work around the 
                        eyes at least for the time--

                                 TY
                        Doc?

           Fishbein falls silent. Ty continues to stare at him -- a 
           relentless, bloodless gaze we've seen before.

                                 TY
                        I appreciate your concern, but I don't 
                        want it. I'm not paying you to treat 
                        me like some kid who doesn't know any 
                        better. I'm paying you to do as I say. 
                        And I think it's about time we get 
                        this out in the open, because the 
                        truth is you're not doing as I say. 
                        You haven't been, and you're still 
                        not. And if I have to come back here 
                        one more time and ask you to finish 
                        what you fucking started, I might just 
                        scream.
                                                (beat)
                        I'm the architect, doc. You're in 
                        construction. Do your job, and do it 
                        well.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ty, Faith, and her daughters watch TV together in semi-
           awkward silence. The awkwardness likely has something to do 
           with the fact that Ty's entire head is swathed in bandages.

           INT. TY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           We're at the new, glass-walled Ty Inc headquarters. Ty 
           himself, his face now starting to resemble that of a wax 
           figure, walks down a hallway past several offices. A few 
           EMPLOYEES openly stare.

                        Good morning to you too, Carol. Thanks 
                        for the welcome back.

                        wanted to recruit a sixth-grade girl 
                        to testify as an expert witness?

           Establishing shot of a sprawling estate overlooking the 
           Pacific in Montecito, California.

           INT. MONTECITO MANSION - DAY

           Ty is being shown around the lavish interior by a noticeably 
           pretty REALTOR.

                        Classic Italianate architecture. 
                        Limestone columns out on the terrace 
                        there. All these beautiful bay windows 
                        -- you get gorgeous light coming 
                        through here in the morning--

                                 TY
                        I'll take your word for it. In fact, 
                        I'll take it period.

           The realtor turns to face him, eyebrows raised.

                                 REALTOR
                        You'll take it?

                                 TY
                        I'll take it. And then I'll take you 
                        to dinner.

           The real estate agent tries to not be charmed, and fails.

                        I'm not for sale.

           Ty flashes her The Smile.

                                 TY
                        That doesn't mean you can't be bought.

           Music kicks in and continues over the following SEQUENCE...

           INT. CAR DEALERSHIP (SANTA BARBARA) - DAY

           Ty splurges on a number of luxury cars.

           INT. LUXURY CAR (SANTA BARBARA) - NIGHT

           Ty makes out with ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 1 in one of those 
           luxury cars.

           Ty splurges on a number of suits and pairs of shoes.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE (SANTA BARBARA) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           New shoes are pushed off and a new suit falls to the ground 
           as Ty moves to the bed with ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 2.

           INT. HIGH-END FURNITURE STORE (SANTA BARBARA) - DAY

           Ty splurges on expensive furniture, including a new sofa.

           INT. MONTECITO MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ty sits on the new sofa while ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN 3 gets 
           on her knees.

           END SEQUENCE

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - DAY

           Ty talks on his cell phone while driving a relatively 
           nondescript car.

                        meeting with my realtor and I'm lost 
                        in the middle of fucking--

                        You can tell them that they will get 
                        their shipments when they get them,

                        Carol, you're not--

           As Carol cuts him off again, Ty notices a woman (JENNIFER, 
           mid-30s) standing near the entrance to a parking lot, handing 
           out flyers.

                                 TY
                        Carol, this has been fun, but I'm 
                        hanging up now. I will probably not 
                        call you back. Bye-bye.

           Ty hangs up and pulls over. Rolls down his window to address 
           Jennifer--

                                 TY

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - LATER

           Ty stands outside his car with Jennifer, who has just 
           finished writing out directions on the back of a flyer.

                                 JENNIFER
                        --Then you'll turn right onto De La

                        --That turns into it, yeah.

                        Thank you.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh, it's no problem.

                                 TY

                        And I'm not an easy guy to please.

                        here in the U.S., and I can't get it

           Ty drives, lost in thought.

           After a few beats, he abruptly turns the car around -- 
           driving back to Jennifer.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Ty pulls up in front of a school in suburban Chicago, in line 
           with other cars for the 3pm pickup. Jenna and Lauren, wearing 
           backpacks, run up to his car and open the rear passenger 
           doors.

                        Hi guys.

           As they get in, Ty turns his head to look at them.

                        I know that she didn't because I saw 
                        inside her pencil case on Tuesday and

                                 TY
                        You threaten legal action.

           Both girls start to laugh.

                                 TY
                        Or -- or, better yet, you tell her you 
                        have mob connections, and then suggest 
                                                       _______ 
                        she hands it over if she wants to 
                                  _______ 
                        avoid any trouble.

                                 LAUREN
                        But what if she doesn't believe me?

                                 TY
                        I'll buy you a new one.

           A happy, contended moment of silence ensues.

                        What about you, Jenna? Any news to 
                        report?

                                 JENNA
                        We started our family tree projects. 
                        I'm using gold pen for the links and 
                        labels.

                                 TY
                        That's a classy choice.

                                 JENNA
                        Yeah. I have a question, though. Do I 
                        connect the branch for you to Mom's 
                        name, or mine? At first I thought it 
                        should say "stepfather", but Mom said 
                        maybe just a separate box, and "father 
                        number two".

           Ty, suddenly ashen-faced, takes a long time to respond.

                                 TY
                        You know -- I don't know, I think I 
                        probably shouldn't be on there at all.

           Jenna looks surprised -- not yet hurt.

                        Why?

                                 TY
                        Well, I'm not married to your mother, 
                        so I'm not a stepfather. And I'm 
                        obviously not your father, so... It 
                        isn't... probably not the proper 
                        thing, to include me.

                        I wouldn't want you to get marks off 
                        for that.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Faith shuts the door and rounds on Ty. Her voice is low, face 
           incredulous and furious.

                                 FAITH
                        Did you say that to her?

                                 TY
                                ____                         
                        This is such a crazy [overreaction]--

                                 FAITH
                        Did you or did you not tell Jenna that 
                        she couldn't put you on her family 
                        tree?

                                 TY
                        No, I said -- what I said was just 
                        __                                 
                        that there's no real legitimate place--

                                 FAITH
                        The implication being, of course, that 
                        you're not her family.

                                 TY
                        That is not remotely how it -- it was 
                        a conversation about schoolwork, it 
                        was -- whatever, irrelevant. The point 
                        is you're taking this completely out 
                        of context, and--

                                 FAITH
                        I don't need the context to understand 
                        what you [said]--

                        them about what they're doing in 
                        school, don't ask me to pick them up--

                                 FAITH
                        My sister broke her hip, Ty, I didn't 
                        exactly plan on--

                                 TY
                        --Middle of a fucking weekday, I had 
                        to jam out of a meeting and a 
                        conference call. And for that matter 
                        -- just out of curiosity -- would you 
                        mind telling me why their father 
                        couldn't pick them up?

           He places almost imperceptible emphasis on the word "father". 
           Faith looks as though she's been slapped.

                                 FAITH
                        What?

                                 TY
                        It's a reasonable question, I'm just 
                        saying there's another guardian in the 
                        picture who would seemingly have that 
                        responsibility--

                                 FAITH
                        And you're saying you don't have that 
                        responsibility?

                                 TY
                        No, I never said that--

                                 FAITH
                        You didn't invite them to live in your 
                        house? You don't put clothes on their 
                        backs and food on their plates? You 
                        don't care about them feeling safe and 
                        happy and loved?

                                 TY
                        Of course I do -- I'm not saying that--

                        Then what are you saying?

                                 TY
                        I'm saying -- well, I'm just saying 
                        the truth, really. I'm saying that

           Created using Celtx                                          
                        they're not my children, that -- you 
                        know, technically, I'm not responsible 
                        for them, and I never... I never said 
                        I wanted to be their father. I never 
                        said you could tell them I was. It's 
                        -- you know. I'm truly, honestly sorry 
                        that I hurt Jenna's feelings, and I 
                        will apologize as many times as 
                        necessary, but I don't think I'm the 
                        cause of any confusion here. That's 
                        all I'm saying.

           A long silence ensues. Faith looks wretched.

                                 FAITH
                        So I'm... putting things together, and 
                        if you could just confirm...
                                                (beat)
                        You not wanting to marry me... that's 
                        part of it. Isn't it.

                                 TY
                        What?

                                 FAITH
                        Because for a while there, I thought 
                        it was just about me. The relationship 
                        between you and me, I mean. I thought 
                        you liked the control -- which you do. 
                        I know that for a fact. You like me 
                        being at your mercy. Screw-up single 
                        mother without a penny to her name, 
                        that's certainly part of it.
                                                (beat)
                        I thought that you, for any number of 
                        reasons, couldn't bring yourself to 
                        make the commitment to me -- to set 
                        boundaries of a certain type. 
                        Although, at this point, I must admit 
                        -- I doubt that exchanging vows would 
                        do anything to dampen your enthusiasm 
                        for fucking other women.

           A beat. Ty's mouth opens slightly, but he doesn't deny it.

                        You thought I didn't know? I know. And 
                        I forgive you -- over and over again. 
                        I shouldn't, but I do. You think you 
                        hide them so well, but I know the 
                        shape of your demons, and I know

                        there's damage that can't be undone. I 
                        can accept it. I can forgive it. What 
                        I cannot forgive is you passing on 
                        those demons and that damage to my 
                        daughters.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He slams the door behind him, seething. After a moment, he 
           turns his head to look down the hallway. Sees a bedroom door 
           open and Jenna's face peeking out of it. She sees him seeing 
           her and quickly shuts her door.

           CLOSE ON Ty's face, reacting.

           INT. TY HEADQUARTERS - TY'S OFFICE - NIGHT (LATER)

           Ty and Carol sit on the floor. Ty is nursing what is probably 
           not his first drink, trying to put his thoughts into words.

                                 TY
                        I think it--
                                                (beat, then slowly)
                        It's my opinion that people... 
                        shouldn't be responsible for each 
                        other, like that. This idea of 
                        belonging to each other -- promising 
                        things, that you'll always... It's 
                        dishonest. And it's inappropriate, and 
                        it's impractical. And the truth is 
                        that no one should ever, ever, make 
                        those promises because we change. 
                        We... do wrong. We go bad. We... we 
                        are not made perfect.
                                                (beat)
                        Do you know what I mean?

                                 CAROL
                        I never know what you mean. I can take 
                        a guess.

                                 TY
                        Then do that.

                                 CAROL
                        Nothing's made perfect, you know. 
                        Nothing real. Life, as it should be 
                        lived, isn't perfect. To believe 
                        otherwise, to see the world that way 
                        -- it just isn't healthy, Ty.

                        I don't agree with you.

           A long pause. When Carol speaks again, her tone is gentler.

                                 CAROL
                        You didn't have it easy, I know that. 
                        But I also know that there are people 
                        out there who had it worse, and I know 
                        that even they have a choice. You 
                        always have the choice to be a good 
                        person.

                                 TY
                        What does that even mean? "A good 
                        person"?

           Carol doesn't answer.

                                 TY
                                                (irritable)
                        I suppose you're a good person?

                                 CAROL
                        I could be a lot better.

           Another pause.

                                 TY
                        What about Faith?

           Carol hesitates.

                                 CAROL
                        I think that Faith is kind, I think 
                        that she is decent, and I think that 
                        her intentions are pure.

                        Is she... a good fit for you?... I 
                        don't know. Who is, right.

           The question hangs there just long enough for a thread of 
           tension to build between the two of them.

                                 TY
                        Can I ask you something?

           More silence.

                                 TY
                        Just -- for the record... I think 
                        you're a good person.

                                 CAROL
                        That's nice of you to say.

                                 TY
                        I think you're good for me.

           A beat.

                                 CAROL
                        We're good for each other.

           What happens next is a moment. For a few breathless beats, 
                                ________                              
           they allow their faces to touch. They don't kiss, but the 
           contact is somehow just as intimate. At one point, Ty presses 
           his nose to the top of Carol's head, breathing her in.

                                 CAROL
                                                (almost to herself)
                        This is not--

           She pulls away. Composes herself.

                                 CAROL
                        You don't want this.

           Surprisingly -- or perhaps not -- Ty listens to her, nods. 
           And just like that, the moment has passed.

                                 TY
                        So what do I do?

                                 CAROL
                        You go home. You say sorry. You love 
                        them as best you can.

                        And maybe try to stop fucking whoever 
                        it is that you're fucking. That's a 
                        lofty goal. But I can dream, can't I?

           Carol stands up.

                                 TY
                        I'm gonna stay for like a half hour.

           Carol thinks for a moment. Shakes her head and smiles 
           strangely.

                                 CAROL

                        thought I'd see the fucking day. And 
                        I'm not sure I ever wanted to see the 
                        fucking day.

                                 TY
                                                (getting up)
                        Well, you're gonna see it.

           A beat of slightly awkward silence.

                                 TY
                        Do you -- can I walk you down to your 
                        car, or--?

                                 CAROL
                        I'm fine.

                                 TY
                        You sure?

                                 CAROL
                        Yep.

           She smiles, crosses the room to the door. Hesitates, then--

                                 CAROL
                        You're not a bad person, you know.

           Ty looks up at her. Half-smiles.

                                 TY
                        That's nice of you to say.

           Another look between them -- and then Carol leaves.

                        I'm the billionaire asshole egomaniac 
                        toymaker who scammed the American

                        I'm not. I'm just trying to understand

                        The governor of Mississippi invites 
                        Theodore Roosevelt on a hunting trip 
                        following the resolution of the Coal 
                        Strike in 1902. After three days in 
                        the lowlands, most of the party have 
                        caught their kills, but the President 
                        has yet to shoot at anything, and what 
                        he wants is a bear. So his guides take 
                        it upon themselves to track down an 
                        American black bear -- they let the 
                        dogs loose, corner it, tie it to a 
                        tree. And then they get the President 
                        and say "Here's your bear; go ahead 
                        and shoot." But the President refuses 
                        to shoot, saying that to do so would 
                        be "unsportsmanlike". Interesting 
                        choice of words. "Unsportsmanlike."

                        News of the President's... compassion 
                        spreads across the country, and 
                        appears in the Washington Post as a 
                        political cartoon. A toymaker named 
                        Morris Michtom sees this cartoon and, 
                        with a few prototypes and the 
                        President's approval, starts selling 
                        what he refers to as "teddy bears".

                        Except they leave out the part where 
                        Roosevelt, disgusted by the bear's old 
                        age and sickly appearance, orders his 
                        men to put the thing out of its 
                        misery, and instead of setting her 
                        free they slit Teddy's bear's throat.

           Beat. And then Ty finally looks up at Sarah with dead eyes.

                                 TY
                        Does that answer your question?

           EXT. TOY STORE - DAY

           The camera moves up a line of somewhere between 50 and 100 
           people, mostly adults, snaking around the exterior of a mom-
           and-pop toy store in small-town America. They are feverish, 
           agitated, like club-goers hoping to get into Studio 54.

           And then -- the tension reaches new heights as the people in 
           line catch sight of a UPS truck rounding the corner. The 
           truck is tailed by at least five other cars.

           The UPS DRIVER takes in the scene...

                                 UPS DRIVER
                        Holy sh...

           INT. TOY STORE - DAY

           The owner, PHIL, and an employee, LORI, peer at the chaos 
           outside.

           Then -- a loud knock at the back of the store startles them.

           INT./EXT. - TOY STORE/BACK ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Phil opens the store's back door to reveal the UPS driver. In 
           the alley behind him is the truck.

                                 PHIL
                        Got 'em?

                                 UPS DRIVER
                        Yep. Man, I would not wanna be you 
                        right now.

           The two men walk to the back of the truck. The driver opens 
           it up to reveal stacks of cardboard boxes, each stamped with 
           a red heart that reads "ty".

           INT. TOY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Phil and Lori empty the boxes onto several large tables set 
           up in the middle of the store. As they do this, the chaos 
           outside reaches its peak. People are thumping on the doors,

           Created using Celtx                                          
           actually shoving each other for a better spot in line.

           Phil and Lori look at each other, more than a little afraid. 
           They nod. Phil heads to the door. Unlocks and opens it--

           And with that, the stampede pushes through, and a weirdly 
           awesome song kicks in (preferably Green Day's "American 
           Idiot"). The music will continue through the following 
           SEQUENCE, which consists of both recreations and actual news 
           footage of the Beanie Baby craze at its peak...

           INT. ANOTHER TOY STORE 1 - DAY

           In another toy store in another part of America, a stampede 
           pours in. Another set of "ty" boxes are ripped open, and the 
           Beanie hunters fight over the contents like jackals fighting 
           over meat.

           INT. ANOTHER TOY STORE 2 - DAY

           And another. In this store, two CREEPY-LOOKING MEN get in a 
           fight over a Beanie. One guy shoves the other into a display 
           of toys. As a fist connects with a mouth with a bone-
           crunching SMACK, we cut to--

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           CRACK. Ty's nose is broken as he lies on the table, 
           unconscious.

           EXT. MCDONALD'S - DRIVE-THROUGH - DAY

           The line-up of cars stretches as long as the lines for the 
           toy stores. Lots of honking. POLICE OFFICERS are directing 
           traffic. The DRIVER of the car pulled up next to the pick-up 
           window verbally assaults a terrified MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE.

           The camera PUSHES IN on the pick-up window until we enter...

           INT. MCDONALD'S - KITCHEN - DAY

           Chaos reigns. Food flies, grease spatters exposed skin, 
           employees trip over each other, the phone rings off the hook.

           We move into...

           INT. MCDONALD'S - ORDERING AREA - DAY

           The place is packed, strewn with garbage, filled with 
           shouting people and screaming children. The average customer 
           picks up between five and ten Happy Meals, chucks the actual

           Created using Celtx                                          
           meal, and keeps the Teenie Beanie included in the box. 
           (Teenie Beanies, by the way, are exactly what they sound 
           like.)

           Near the end of the line-up, two MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN get into 
           an argument/screaming match, which ends with one shoving the 
           other into the drink dispenser.

           We cut from a CLOSEUP of one woman's wild eyes to--

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Ty, under the knife again, getting another eye job.

           INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

           A throng of SUBURBAN MOMS run,                 -style, toward 
                                          Chariots of Fire               
           a Hallmark store with a sign outside announcing a new 
           shipment of Beanies. One actually shoves a KID out of the way 
           as they join and jockey for position in the massive line-up, 
           which several SECURITY GUARDS are trying unsuccessfully to 
           get under control.

           INT. HOME OFFICE - DAY

           A HUSBAND and WIFE in the middle of a bidding war for a rare 
           Beanie on an Internet auction site lose their shit when the 
           computer crashes. The husband tries desperately to reboot 
           while the wife screams for him to hurry up.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           A Beanie Baby convention, where dealers and collectors come 
           together to sell and trade on the secondary market. Many are 
           shouting into walkie-talkies and cell phones. The scene looks 
           like the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

           CLOSEUP of a hand fitting a plastic protector onto a hang tag 
           with a SNAP--

           CLOSEUP of Ty's face being injected with Botox.

           INT. TOY FACTORY - DAY

           CLOSEUP of Beanie after Beanie after Beanie coming off the 
           production line.

           QUICK CUTS of Ty getting another facelift, a neck lift, and a 
           chin implant.

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           A CUSTOMS OFFICER rips open the bags of a WOMAN re-entering 
           the US, finding and seizing roughly 40 Beanie Babies. (The 
           woman was attempting to smuggle them into the country, in 
           violation of the "one-Beanie rule" enforced by the U.S. 
           Customs Service.) The scene is reminiscent of a drug bust.

           INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           An actual drug bust. A couple of young HEROIN ADDICTS are 
           arrested. An OFFICER opens the trunk of their car to find a 
           huge pile of stolen Beanie Babies.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A masked THIEF breaks into a car. He takes only one item 
           inside -- a retired Beanie Baby on the dashboard.

           EXT. TOY STORE - NIGHT

           A man in his 60's stares at a display of Beanie Babies in the 
           store window. Suddenly -- he tenses. Turns around...

           ...to see a man in his late 20's standing behind him with a 
                                                                ______

           The music stops abruptly. There is a beat of silence. And 
           then the gun fires.

           INT. MARYANN'S HOUSE - STORAGE SPACE - DAY

           A small room filled with literally hundreds of mint-condition 
                                              ________                   
           Beanie Babies. They all have plastic protectors on their red 
           hang tags. The collection is meticulously organized.

           Maryann Galloway carefully makes space for two new, tag-
           protected Beanies. Once they're in place, she consults with a 
           massive homemade checklist. Ticks off two new boxes.

           INT. MARYANN'S HOUSE - MARYANN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Maryann sits at the computer, typing an article about Beanie 
           Baby prices. On her desk, we see several copies of a thick

           Created using Celtx

           monthly magazine,                               . We also see 
           a local newspaper, the headline of which states: "MAN SHOT TO 
           DEATH OVER BEANIE BABY DEAL GONE BAD."

           She works in perfect silence, until--

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Maryann!

                                 MARYANN
                        I'm in the office!

           After a few beats, the door opens and Peter enters.

                                 PETER
                        What happened to Joey?

           Maryann doesn't turn around, keeps typing.

                                 MARYANN
                        Joey?

                                 PETER
                        Your son.

                                 MARYANN
                        He's in the den watching TV, isn't he?

                                 PETER
                        I mean what happened to his face. He's 
                        missing a tooth, for Christ's sake.

           Maryann finally stops typing and turns around.

                                 MARYANN
                        Peter, I want you to calm down. He'll 
                        be perfectly fine.

                                 PETER
                        I didn't ask if he'll be perfectly 
                        fine, I asked what the hell happened.

                                 MARYANN
                        We swung by a Beanie convention on the 
                        way home from school. One of the 
                        vendors had Princess Diana bears, and 
                        there was a bit of a mad dash. Some 
                        turkey knocked him over -- he had his 
                        hands in his pockets so his face hit 
                        the pavement. He's perfectly fine.

                                 PETER
                        And what were you doing, dragging the 
                        kids to one of those buffalo 
                        stampedes?

                        The sitter cancelled.

                                 PETER
                        Again I ask, what were you doing?

                                 MARYANN
                        Peter, I'm happy to talk, but can we 
                        do it later? I'm on a deadline for the 
                        magazine, and I really just need this 
                        time free of distractions.

                                 PETER
                        I can think of bigger distractions.

                                 MARYANN
                        And what is that supposed to mean?

                                 PETER

                        reality.

           the room to stand in front of a glass display case, which 
           contains a few of Maryann's most valuable Beanie Babies. The 
           focal point of the collection is the royal blue elephant 
           Beanie called Peanut, covered with a glass dome.

           He opens the cabinet and carefully pulls out Peanut.

                        That's Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant. 
                        That's 6,000 dollars.

                                 PETER
                        Says who?

                                 MARYANN
                        Put him down.

                                 PETER
                        Him?

           Peter works Peanut in his hands. Fingers the tag protector.

                                 PETER
                        What would you do if I took the tag 
                        off?

           Maryann's eyes pop slightly.

                                 PETER
                        If I take the tag off, it's worthless, 
                        right? But wouldn't he be happier with 
                        that thing out of his ear?

           Maryann gets to her feet. Her face is white, posture rigid.

                                 MARYANN
                        You wouldn't [dare]--

                                 PETER

                        like a child?

           Peter almost smiles, gives a small laugh of disbelief. And 
           then he tosses Peanut at Maryann's feet.

                                 PETER
                        I'll leave you to it.

           He exits the room.

           CLOSE ON Peanut, lying prostrate on the carpeted floor.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS NEW YORK PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Ty is walking with a DESIGNER and ARCHITECT through a 
           construction zone that makes up the entire 52nd floor of the 
           Four Seasons Hotel in New York City. (Ty's face is now almost 
           as waxy and tight from plastic surgery as it is in the scenes 
           with Sarah in 2013.)

                        So nine rooms, 4,300 square feet. I 
                        want four balconies, and then floor-to-
                        ceiling windows on all sides -- 360-
                        degree views of the skyline. This is 
                        the tallest hotel in Manhattan, right?

                        marble fireplace right there in the 
                        seating area. Skylights -- can we do 
                        skylights? Diamond skylights?

           Ty stops pacing.

                        Is this going to end badly?

           A few beats of silence. Then--

                                 SCHUMACHER (O.S.)
                        You hold all the cards, Ty. It's just 
                        a matter of playing them right.

           Schumacher hangs up. Ty stands perfectly still -- nerves 
           shot, mind whirring.

           EXT. CAROL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

           It's pouring rain. Ty stands outside the front door, pounding 
           it with his fist.

           The door opens after a few beats to reveal Carol in her 
           dressing gown -- Ty's fist is raised in mid-air, about to 
           knock again. Carol gapes at him.

                                 CAROL

           moment, she wanders in and starts going through the drawers 
           of Ty's desk -- sifting through scribbled notes, sketches, 
           receipts and invoices.

           Eventually, she comes across a white Beanie Baby bear with a 
           red heart on its chest.

           She picks it up. Stares at it. And then hurls it as hard as 
           she can at the window. It hits the window pane nose-first, 
           leaving a smudgy scratch on the glass.

           Faith walks over to the window -- feels the scratch with her 
           fingertip. Her expression is unreadable.

           Faith is in bed, phone to her ear, dressed for bed -- 
           emotionally drained. She closes her eyes, and then opens them 
           before saying--

                        I don't want to live together anymore.

           A beat.

                                 TY
                        You're right. It's not my place.

           Faith's face twists slightly. There's a silence in which she 
           gets herself under control.

                                 FAITH
                        Have a safe flight.

           And with that, she hangs up.

           INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS - NIGHT

           Ty looks out the window as the plane flies over Chicago.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Ty enters, suitcase in hand. Exhausted.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Ty pours himself a drink, still wearing his plane clothes.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           There's a Christmas tree twinkling in a corner, wrapped 
           presents underneath. Ty stands staring at it before he lets 
           himself fall back onto the sofa with his drink.

           He sits still for a moment, and then shifts, feeling 
           something underneath him. He pulls out from between the 
           cushions a well-worn Beanie Baby -- one of the original "old 
           face" teddy bears. Ty stares at it, turns it over in his 
           hands.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - JENNA'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Faith's daughter Jenna, now about 10, is lying in bed on her 
           stomach, reading. Her door is half-open.

           Ty appears in the doorway. He knocks lightly and she looks 
           up.

                                 JENNA
                        Hi Ty.

                        Hi Jenna.

                        Is your mother asleep?

                                 JENNA
                        I think so. She went to bed early. How 
                        was New York?

                                 TY

                        It's Christmas Eve, you know. You 
                        should be asleep too.

                        minutes.

                                 TY
                        Okay.

           A beat. Ty holds up the Beanie Baby he found in the sofa.

                                 TY
                        Is this yours?

                                 JENNA
                                                (sitting up)
                        Hey, you found him!

                                 TY
                        He was between the couch cushions 
                        downstairs--

                                 JENNA
                        I was looking all over for him 
                        yesterday.

           Ty tosses her the Beanie and she catches it.

                                 JENNA
                        Thanks Ty.

                                 TY
                        You're welcome.

           Jenna goes back to reading, but Ty lingers in her doorway.

                                 TY
                        He's pretty beat up, that bear of 
                        yours.

                                 JENNA
                        Yeah, I guess so.

           Ty hesitates, then--

                                 TY
                        You know, I can get you a new one if 
                        you want. That exact version.

           Jenna looks up at him, faintly surprised.

                                 JENNA
                        Um... thanks, but that's okay.

                        It's no trouble, really.

                                 JENNA
                        I know, but -- Brownie's special.

           Ty nods. Jenna turns back to her book. But then--

                                 TY
                        Why?

           Jenna looks up at him again.

                                 TY
                        Why is he special?

           Again, Jenna looks surprised, like the answer should be 
           obvious.

                                 JENNA
                        Because I've had him since I was 
                        little.

           Ty digests this -- it hits him hard. Her simple explanation 
           causes him a kind of pain he can barely understand.

           INT. TOY STORES - NIGHT

           David Bowie's "Come and Buy My Toys" plays. In various closed 
           toy stores, we see piles of Beanie Babies -- glassy-eyed, 
           unsold, unwanted.

           INT./EXT. TY'S CAR - NIGHT

           The music continues as Ty, still in his plane clothes, drives 
           through the lonely streets of Chicago.

           EXT. TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

           Ty's car pulls up in front of what looks from the outside 
           like a nursing home.

           INT. TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

           Ty, accompanied by a middle-aged NURSE, walks down a hallway 
           lined with patient rooms. They stop in front of the door to a 
           room near the end of the hall.

                                 NURSE
                        Might already be asleep.

           She knocks lightly. No response. She opens the door slightly.

                                 NURSE
                        You can go in. Shout if you need 
                        anything.

           She walks off. After a moment of hesitation, Ty enters--

           INT. TREATMENT FACILITY - GEORGIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           --to see Georgia propped up in the bed. Her eyes are closed, 
           but it's unclear whether she's asleep or not.

           Ty stands frozen for a moment, and then walks to sit in the 
           chair beside the bed. He watches his mother for a few beats. 
           As if sensing his presence, she slowly opens her eyes.

                                 TY
                        Merry Christmas, Mom.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Merry Christmas.

           They stare at each other.

                                 GEORGIA
                        It's quiet tonight.

                                 TY
                        That's good.

           Silence. Ty can't think of anything else to say. Except--

                                 TY
                        You know, I--
                                                (beat)
                        I made a billion dollars this year. 
                        Did you know that?

           Georgia shakes her head a little.

                                 GEORGIA
                        No.

           Another silence. Ty seems to struggle with himself.

                                 TY
                        Are you proud of me?

                                 GEORGIA
                        Yes.

           Created using Celtx                                          
           But her expression is unchanged. There is absolutely no 
           tenderness in it. Ty registers this.

                                 TY
                        ...Do you think about me when I'm not 
                        with you?

           Georgia thinks for a long time before answering.

                                 GEORGIA
                        I never knew I didn't want to be a 
                        mother until the moment I became a 
                        mother.

           Ty was braced for an answer like this, but it still hurts. He 
           nods, trying to keep his face from twisting.

                                 TY
                        I think maybe... you only ever realize 
                        that you wanted a different life when 
                        it's too late to have it.

                                 GEORGIA
                        Hmm.

           She closes her eyes, at peace. Ty lets a few tears fall.

           EXT. TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

           Ty walks out of the front entrance, headed to where his car 
           is parked. He glances up, and stops dead in his tracks.

           Joyce stands in the parking lot, staring at him. He stares 
           back, until she breaks the silence.

                                 JOYCE
                        How'd it go?

           Ty sort of shrugs. He looks utterly wretched.

                                 TY
                        You know.

           Ty closes his eyes -- keeps them closed for a moment too 
           long.

                                 TY
                        No.

                                 JOYCE
                        Mm. We have that in common now.

           She retrieves cigarettes and a lighter from her purse.

                                 JOYCE
                        My ex gets Christmas with the kids he 
                        can't pay for. Explain to me how that 
                        makes sense. You can't, because it 
                        doesn't.

                        Anyway. I figured it's better sitting 
                        with her than sitting alone.

           Ty doesn't say anything. He's staring at nothing, almost 
           completely unaware of his surroundings -- all of his 
           attention turned inward.

           Joyce lights up. She's not looking at Ty, hasn't realized 
           that anything's wrong.

                                 JOYCE
                        So I read about this whole, uh, mass 
                        retirement thing.
                                                (exhale)
                        You gonna go through with that?

           Again, Ty is silent. Joyce glances at him, sees his face -- 
           reacts.

                                 JOYCE
                        Ty?

           But it's as if Ty can't hear her. Joyce looks almost worried.

                                 JOYCE
                            __ 
                        Ty. Ty.

           The note of urgency in her voice finally pulls Ty out of his 
           trance. His eyes meet hers.

                        What's going on?

           Ty breathes deeply. Closes his eyes again. Once again, he 
           appears to be fighting a panic attack.

                                 TY
                        I can't look at you, I just...

                        fix what--

           He steadies himself. And then finally--

                                 TY
                        I need you... to let me go.

           A beat. Joyce nods, her face unreadable.

                                 JOYCE
                        Okay.

           Ty nods. He walks away.

           Joyce turns to watch the back of him for a moment, and then 
           heads toward the facility.

           INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Back in the high-rise in 2013 Chicago. CLOSE ON Ty's face as 
           he looks out the window again, watching the city at night.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Okay, I think we're done here.

           Ty turns his head to see Sarah putting the recorder back in 
           her briefcase. She's packing up, getting ready to go.

                                 TY

                        Yes, I think we've got enough.

           Ty nods silently.

                        Thank you.

                                 SARAH
                        Enjoy the holidays, and I'll see you 
                        in the new year.

           Ty doesn't move, faces the window again -- thinking. Then, as 
           Sarah is shrugging on her coat--

                                 TY
                        Can I ask you something?

           She stops, looks up at him.

                                 SARAH
                        Of course.

           Ty hesitates. And then--

                                 TY
                        Why do you think I wanted to make toys 
                        for children.

           Sarah gives him a long, hard look.

                        My grandfather gave me my first plush 
                        toy. A Steiff teddy bear. I took him 
                        everywhere with me -- to nursery 
                        school, to church. He was with me when 
                        I got my first booster shot, and again 
                        for five stitches and a broken ankle. 
                        He slept in my bed until I was eight, 
                        and then again starting the year I 
                        turned 13 -- the year my parents 
                        divorced -- until the year I turned 18 
                        and moved out of the house. I still 
                        have that bear. I'll never get rid of 
                        him.

                        ones we depend on to make us feel safe

                        stop needing it.

                        Mr. H. Ty Warner.

           INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

           A courtroom packed with media and onlookers. The prosecution 
           and the defence are on their feet for Judge CHARLES KOCORAS' 
           sentencing. The defendant is Ty Warner. Note that Sarah is a 
           member of his legal team.

           TITLE: January 2014.

                                 KOCORAS
                        The guidelines call for a prison term 
                        of 46 to 57 months. It's the sentence 
                        recommended by the prosecution. It's 
                        the sentence I would expect to give in 
                        most cases of this nature.
                                                (beat)
                        However, in this particular case... I 
                        find that a just decision -- for those 
                        inside and outside this courtroom -- 
                        may only be reached by taking into 
                        account the moral character of the man 
                        standing in front of me.

           A few murmurs.

                                 KOCORAS
                        I refer to letters written by Mr. 
                        Warner's friends, his employees, those 
                        who describe themselves as recipients 
                        of his tremendous charity. Most of the 
                        acts detailed in these letters were 
                        done privately and quietly. It is 
                        clear to me that they were motivated 
                        by the purest of intentions. I can say 
                        without hesitation that I have never 
                        had a defendant in any case 
                        demonstrate the level of humanity and 
                        concern for the welfare of others as 
                        has Mr. Warner.

           Louder murmuring. The PROSECUTION looks outraged. Ty wears 
           his poker face -- but he glances over to lock eyes with Sarah

                        The defendant is hereby sentenced to 
                        two years probation, 500 hours 
                        community service, and $100,000 in 
                        fines and costs.

           The gavel bangs.

           EXT. CHICAGO COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Rain comes down in sheets. Ty shields his face from 
           photographers, moving quickly from the crowd into a limo.

           Over this, we hear various news stories--

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

           Utter silence. Ty is the only passenger. He stares out the 
           window at the streets of Chicago.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

           In a SERIES OF SCENES, we see:

           In the foyer -- Ty hangs up his coat, takes off his shoes.

           In the kitchen -- Ty pours himself a drink.

           In the living room -- Ty plays his grand piano.

           In the bathroom -- Ty leans over the sink, staring at his

           face in the mirror.

           Finally, in his home office -- Ty sits at his desk, looking 
           at Beanie Boo prototypes. He reaches for his drink, takes a 
           sip -- thinking.

           INT. CAROL'S HOUSE - HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Carol, now in her 60's as well, is reading an article about 
           Ty's sentencing on a laptop computer.

           Then -- the smartphone on her desk starts to ring. Carol 
           looks at it for a few beats. Picks it up, and then answers.

                        Yep.

                                 CAROL
                        I just heard -- well I read, actually, 
                        about the...

                                 TY
                        Yeah.

                                 CAROL
                        It's good. I mean, you know, it's 
                        better than what you were... prepared 
                        for, I guess.

                                 TY
                        It is.
                                                (long pause)
                        He said I was a good person.

                                 CAROL
                        He did.

                        Maybe you are.

                        ...Maybe...

           There's a long silence.

                                 CAROL
                        Are you--

                        Are you okay, Ty?

           Ty doesn't react. Doesn't speak.

                                 CAROL
                        ...Ty.

           Another long silence. Then, finally--

                                 TY
                        I'm alone.

           Carol stills. She is suddenly on the verge of tearing up.

                                 CAROL
                                                (more urgently)
                        Are you okay?

           Ty breathes in deeply. Nods.

                                 TY
                        Yep.

           Carol pauses, torn between saying more and leaving it.

                                 CAROL
                        You can't lie to me, you know.

                                 TY
                        I know.

           They stay on the phone, not speaking.

           INT. TY'S OAK BROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Ty sets his drink on the bedside table. Sits heavily on the 
           bed. After a few beats, he glances over at the bedside table. 
           Reaches over -- but not for the drink. Instead, he pulls open 
           the drawer and retrieves from within it...

           ...his old, worn teddy bear.

           Ty examines the bear's face and stitching. Presses his nose

           -- and then opens them. Staring straight ahead at nothing.

           POSTSCRIPT:

           Collectors voted to save Beanie Babies from discontinuation. 
           Production resumed in 2000, with a bear named The Beginning.

           Ty Warner never married. His relationship with Faith McGowan 
           ended in 2001, and she received a lump sum payment for an 
           undisclosed amount. He attended her funeral in June 2013.

           Ty's estimated net worth is $2.7 billion. In addition to Ty 
           Inc., he owns hotels and resorts in New York, California, 
           Hawaii and Mexico.

           In March 2020, the Four Seasons became the first hotel in New 
           York to provide free housing for medical personnel on the 
           front lines of COVID-19. The operation was Ty Warner's idea, 
           and paid for by him.
