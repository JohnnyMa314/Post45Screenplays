           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

                                 MRS. HALL
                        Ally. Do you think you might ever 
                        get around to starting?

           MRS. HALL, 30s, with an I’ve-Got-A-Lesson-Plan-To-Get-Through 
           focus, stands front of a FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM, gazing at:

           ALLY NICKERSON, 12. With lively eyes that register 
           stubbornness and vulnerability in equal measure. 

           The STUDENTS around her SCRIBBLE AWAY. Ally’s page is blank.

                                 ALLY
                        Could you repeat the prompt please?

                                 MRS. HALL
                             (irritated)
                        What are three things the Ancient 
                        Egyptians introduced that shaped 
                        our civilization?

           She’s right over Ally. If we hadn’t noticed earlier, it’s 
           unavoidable now: Mrs. Hall’s very pregnant.

           Ally inhales, starts to move her pen across the page...

           She’s drawing. A profile, in the Egyptian Priestess style. 
           Artfully, playfully caricaturing Mrs. Hall’s features.

                                 MRS. HALL (CONT'D)
                        We’re writing, Ally. Not drawing.

                                 ALLY
                        I thought we were coming up with an 
                        answer, Mrs. Hall. I’m answering.

                                 MRS. HALL
                        Ally. Do the assignment.

           Ally holds up her page: Mrs. Hall’s priestess portrait is 
           part of a column of beetles and bird heads.

                                 ALLY
                        Hieroglyphics. That’s one.

           Mrs. Hall leans in: clearly, even though she’s a fine soul, 
           she has put Ally on the list of: I Have 25 Students And 
           Limited Resources; You, Sister, Take Up Too Much Of My Time.
                                 MRS. HALL
                        A paragraph. Now. Please! Just give 
                        it your best.

           Ally returns the tight smile. Looks down to her hand now... 
           and finishes the priestess’s expression: a dour frown.

                                 MRS. HALL (CONT'D)
                        I mean it.

           Ally stops, takes a deep breath. Something in her...giving 
           up. She takes the page...  And CRUMPLES IT UP. Points to it 
           there in the center of her desk. 

                                 ALLY
                        And paper. The Ancient Egyptians 
                        invented paper. Two down. 

           She looks up, and stubbornly meets Mrs. Hall’s GLARE.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        And one to go.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Ally stands alone. And alone, whatever armor she wears to 
           make it through the day has fallen away. She looks all-but-
           overwhelmed - and hides it by standing right up close to...

           A BULLETIN BOARD covered in PSAs: Drink Water Not Sugar! 
           Handwashing Is Your Superpower. Helmets! Be Hard-Headed!

           Ally begins REARRANGING THEM, making deft folds and tears 
           here and there before tacking everything back in place.

           She sits, slumps, looks sullenly across the way past...

           The FRONT OFFICE LADY, a scowling I Used To Be Into Punk sort 
           now trapped in a blouse and skirt...

           To THE DOOR. An ominous door. The PRINCIPAL”S OFFICE door...

           THUMP! A MAN, late 20s, PLOPS DOWN by Ally. Extricates an I-
           pad. Scans it for his notes. Exhales. Seems...nervous.

           Ally steals a glance: nose bent, stocky frame can’t fit in 
           the buckety child-sized seat. And his front tooth DANGLES. 

                                 FRONT OFFICE LADY (OC)
                        Brody Daniels?

           He snaps the tooth back in place with his tongue, twists to 
           see Front Office Lady has come into the hall.  
                                 FRONT OFFICE LADY (CONT'D)
                        No need to wait out here. These 
                        seats are for our troublemakers.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oh. Oh, right. The troublemakers.

           She returns to her desk. MR. DANIELS pivots to face 
           Ally...and gives her a THUMBS UP. Ally’s unsure what it 
           means: Go Troublemakers? Wish me luck? 

           The Door suddenly OPENS. A bickering COMMITTEE GROUP exits...

           Leaving the over-extended PRINCIPAL - MRS. ORO, 60s in The 
           Doorway. She signals Mr. Daniels that she needs him to wait. 
           And shakes her head at Ally and points the way: In. 

           Ally stands. Behind her, the board is now a CLEVER COLLAGE: 

           The Handwashing kid cleans up in the giant glass of water, 
           the Helmet kid, headbutts the thug in the No Bullying poster.

           INT. MRS. ORO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ally sits in the hot seat, while Mrs. Oro scans her computer 
           screen.  She picks up an Etch A Sketch Mrs. Oro keeps on her 
           desk. Turns its knobs - something’s taking shape: A SNOWMAN.

           Mrs. Oro locates a file. Sees Ally looking down at her lap. 

                                 MRS. ORO
                        Ally Nickerson. The records from 
                        your last school still aren’t here.

           In ALLY’S LAP: The Etch-A-Sketch line keeps skittering 
           through the gray: A HOT SUN bearing down on the snowman...

                                 ALLY
                        Which last school? I mean.. this is 
                        my...seventh.
                             (trying for light)
                        Lucky seven?

                                 MRS. ORO
                        As you’re interested in numbers, 
                        how about these? You’ve been at 
                        Liston Middle School for six weeks. 
                        You’ve been sent here eleven times.

           The ETCH A SKETCH -as the snowman holds up a branch arm..to 
           give the sun a DEFIANT “You’ll Never Melt Me!” FIST.
                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        We’ve had zero luck getting your 
                        parents in. So it would be 
                        infinitely wonderful if we can just 
                        learn from you. Why do you think 
                        you so frequently disregard your 
                        teacher and disrupt your class?

           Mrs. Oro leans in towards Ally, who erases the Etch-A-Sketch 
           and looks up, dodging eye contact, to an INSPIRATION POSTER.  

           In its background a HAND REACHES ACROSS ABOUT TO GRASP 
           ANOTHER HAND.. It’s covered in LARGE LETTERS - A QUOTE...

           Mrs. Oro turns in her seat, looking at the poster too.

                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        A useful strategy. Isn’t it? How 
                        about we read it aloud together?

           ALLY’S POV: The letters make no sense. The longer we look at 
           them, the more UNSTABLE they seem: shimmering...

                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes...

           SKITTERING like beetles, trails BLURRING, letters shifting...

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t need to read it aloud, Mrs. 
                        Oro. Believe me, I get it. 

                                 MRS. ORO
                        I don’t know about that. I think 
                        you might need to work on it. How 
                        might we start?

           She awaits a response. Ally’s looking cornered....

           But there’s a knock, and the Office Lady opens the door -- 
           for a pushy DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR type who shoulders in...

           And Ally’s instantly up and on her way. Mrs. Oro moves to 
           deal with the incoming - and still call after Ally...

                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        Mrs. Hall begins maternity leave 
                        tomorrow. New teacher. New start. 

           Ally skirts the still-waiting Mr. Daniels’ gaze, her features 
           locked in a struggling-not-to-be-humiliated glower.
                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want to see you here again. 
                        To be clear: once more and you’ll 
                        be heading to lucky number eight.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Students lingering, playing, chatting... filing out into a 
           neighborhood of old houses and bland apartment buildings. 

           We’ll get to know these kids later..but here’s a glimpse: 
           Cocky MAX wrestles with pal MARCO. Hulking ALBERT shuffles 
           off.  Proud SHAY gabs with her fawning clique.

           Ally passes intense-looking KEISHA at her bike. Shoulders her 
           backpack, looka at the sun. Another day done down the mines.

           INT. MEGA DRUG STORE - AFTERNOON

           Ally enters the large store, starting along the aisles...

           Until she spots a WIRY WOMAN tending shelves. Ally sneaks 
           behind her as she moves along repricing merchandise.

           The woman spins. Sticks a 50% OFF tag on Ally’s forehead.

                                 WOMAN
                        50% Off! Can almost afford you now.
                             (noting her glum features)
                        Oh, no. Again? Not again.

           Ally’s lip trembles. The On-For-School Armor falls 
           away...until she’s on the verge of tears. Because this is her 
           mother, MRS. NICKERSON. Early 30s. Young...but bone-tired.

                                 ALLY
                             (an outpouring)
                        I was being... stubborn and not 
                        doing an assignment the way Mrs. 
                        Hall wanted us to do it and I...I 
                        shouldn’t have been a jerk to her. 
                        Because tomorrow’s her last day. 
                        She’s having her baby and I don’t 
                        want her to think I don’t like her 
                        because I really do!

           Mrs. Nickerson puts an arm around Ally - she has a sleeve of 
           tattoos, one a stars ‘n stripes ribbon that says: ARMY WIFE. 

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Stubborn sure runs in the family.
           A SUPERVISOR glances down from the end of the aisle. Mrs. 
           Nickerson turns back to her work.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        We’ve all got a lot on our plates, 
                        you know that, Ally, I really need 
                        you to make this work.

           Ally GROANS, drops her forehead on her mom’s back.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        It’s gonna be better, guarantee 
                        you, when you make some friends.

                                 ALLY
                        There isn’t anybody!

           Mrs. Nickerson turns back, takes in her frustrated girl.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        I got to finish this up, Ally. How 
                        about you go pick out a pretty 
                        congratulations card for your 
                        teacher? I bet she’ll like that.

           Ally nods. Starts off. Then looks back at the shelves...

                                 ALLY
                        Mom. Put the Goldfish down where 
                        the tortilla chips are. You want 
                        the little kids to see them, right 
                        in their face. They love Goldfish. 
                        And parents’ll buy them because 
                        they’re healthier than candy.

           Mrs. Nickerson considers this, taps her brow. Good thinking.

           INT. MEGA DRUG STORE - GREETING CARD AISLE - DAY

           Ally moves along the rack of bright cards. The LETTERING that 
           denotes each section (Anniversary, Graduation...) is a BLUR.

           But her eyes eat up all the patterns and colors...and settle,  
           on a BEAUTIFUL CARD with a bright, burst of bulging IRISES.   

           She RUNS HER FINGER along the creamy paper. Feels nice. She 
           actually SMILES. Feels better. This will be a lovely gift.

           EXT/INT. NICKERSON CONDO GARAGE - EVENING

           CLOSE ON A “SOLDIER ON!” bumper sticker, as a well-worn Camry 
           pulls up to a down-at-heels CONDO COMPLEX. Ally and her Mom.
           The garage door opens. There’s a lanky teen there, TRAVIS, 
           16. He’s surrounded by.... three outdated VENDING MACHINES.

           Ally gets out, fussing with the card she chose.

                                 TRAVIS
                        We’re on with Dad tonight, right?

           Mrs. Nickerson nods, smiles, roughs his hair. Heads in. 

                                 ALLY
                        I’m first! 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Nuh-uh. Age before beauty.

           She shoulders him into a disassembled vending machine. Parts 
           clatter. Ally retrieves one, looks to see where it goes...

                                 ALLY
                        Where you get directions to fix it?

                                 TRAVIS
                        There’s no directions. That’s why 
                        I’m so good at it.

           He grins. She grins back..bolts for the door. He grabs her.

           INT.  NICKERSON KITCHEN - EVENING

           Mom’s On A Tight Sked: she gets a microwaved lasagna on the 
           table, some wet lettuce and dressing  - and disappears...

           Ally unloads her school bag. Books, books...lots of homework.

           Travis finishes scrubbing up, sets a laptop at the head of 
           the table. Turns it to facing out from the chair there. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        It’s time! Mom!

           Mrs. Nickerson comes in, putting her hair up, now wearing 
           maroon MEDICAL OFFICE SCRUBS.  A Skype ring tone sounds...

           Ally leans in near the computer. The screen FILLS with SGT. 
           NICKERSON, mid 30s, in fatigues, tired eyes lighting up.

                                 ALLY
                        Daddy!

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Ally!
                                 TRAVIS
                             (lifting the lasagna)
                        You’re missing an awesome dinner.

           Sgt. Nickerson lifts a tin with watery powdered egg mush.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        You’re missing an awesome 
                        breakfast!
                             (looking to his wife)
                        Hey Baby! Maroon scrubs. Stylish!

           The DOORBELL RINGS. Ally moves to get it. Travis SLIDES the 
           computer across the table, closer to his mother.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (OC)
                        You’re jealous ‘cause your fatigues 
                        only come in tan.

           Ally reaches the door. Checks the peephole. Opens it... 

           To FARAH, 20s. Also in scrubs. She hands the adorable ABBAS, 
           1, -- and ten bucks - to Ally, who happily accepts both.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON (OC)
                        That color is nicer. ‘Cept for the 
                        fact I need to be camouflaged.

           She follows Ally in, sees Mrs. Nickerson, now wiping tears. 
           Farah signals she’ll wait outside. Ally helps Abbas wave Bye.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON (OC) (CONT'D)
                        Hey! None of that. I’m fine. 
                        There’s nothing going on. All good.

           Mrs. Nickerson nods, gets a smile on, best foot forward...

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Everyone’s good here too. Travis is 
                        studying for his Equivalency - 
                        right, Trav? - and’s full time with 
                        your buddy. Ally likes her school -- 
                        don’t you Al? She was just telling 
                        me she’s making friends.

           Ally and Trav exchange a Not Exactly Reality look...

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        And how about you, honey? 

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Don’t you worry on us. You’ve got 
                        plenty to focus on. I’m good..but I 
                        have to go to work. Loveloveyou.
           Mrs. Nickerson turns the screen to face Ally & Travis, her 
           smile collapsing once she’s off camera...

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Loveloveloveyouback!
                             (a beat, to Trav)
                        How’s Bloom treating you, Trav?

                                 TRAVIS
                        He says I’m the most “intuitive” 
                        mechanic at the garage.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        I’m sure you are!

                                 TRAVIS
                        Just wish I could fix up the guy’s 
                        bad back. He’s having a hard time.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Happens when your hummer rolls. 
                        Good man. Glad it’s working out.

                                 TRAVIS
                        It is. Too bad the other manager... 
                        he’s kind of... a tool.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Oh? I know you’ll work it out, even 
                        if some orders are tough to follow.
                             (looking at Ally)
                        Ally In Wonderland! What about you?

                                 ALLY
                        I, I...
                             (pause)
                        I really really miss you, Dad.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                             (finally cracking a bit)
                        You know I miss you guys. So much. 
                        Every minute of every day.

           Ally’s eyes brim. So much to say that isn’t being said.

           INT. ALLY’S BEDROOM - EVENING 

                                 ALLY
                        Sometimes I wish I could just 
                        scream out everything inside. 

           Ally has a fruit roll spread on the table. She’s carefully 
           CUTTING INTO A GUMMY BEAR.
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        How do you all do it? How do you do 
                        it so fast? 

           She reshapes the gummy bear so that it has outstretched arms, 
           Stubbly little legs and an open, panicked-looking mouth.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        I’m like my brother. Mom and Dad, 
                        they don’t accept it. At the 
                        teacher meeting at our old school, 
                        they told Mom, right in front of 
                        Travis, that she shouldn’t expect 
                        too much, he might just be slow.

           She sticks the gummy bear on the fruit roll -- among others.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Mom looked like she was going to 
                        punch the lady in the stomach. 
                        But she also looked like she’d been 
                        punched in the stomach. And we 
                        moved after that anyway. New start. 
                        That’s what she said. They all say 
                        that. But it’s the same ol’ start, 
                        over and over again.

                                 TRAVIS (OC)
                        Ally, you have my phone!?

           She looks OUT HER WINDOW. Travis is in the driveway, calling.

           She hands the fruit roll-gummy bear tableau... To Abbas. In 
           his porta-playpen, grinning, focused on her every move. 

           She picks the phone up. Starts RECORDING. Close in, finding 
           angles, trying all sorts of stuff...as Abbas gobbles. 

           She stops. Looks to a shelf. There’s a DISPLAY of COLLECTABLE 
           COINS. She takes down a book. 

           ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND & THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS.  
           There’s tape over the Alice, so the title reads differently. 
           She touches and mouths it, her name: ALLY’S ADVENTURES...

           Opens the book. It’s inscribed. FOR MY WONDROUS GIRL! HAPPY 
           BIRTHDAY! LOVE, DAD. Touches the handwriting. Looks to the 
           shelf- the photo of her father there, arms around the family.  

           She leafs through, from illustration to illustration:

           -Alice contemplating the written instructions Drink Me.

           -Alice being lectured by the stern chess-piece Red Queen.
           -Alice at the tea party with March Hare, Mad Hatter and the 
           Doormouse -- clustered like kids at a cafeteria table.   

           Ally leans in to study the WORDS there, with longing... 

                                 TRAVIS (OC) (CONT'D)
                        I need my phone, sis!

           Ally gets up, goes to Abbas, chin covered in fruit roll gore. 
           She cleans him up. Holds the phone up. Shows him:

                                 ALLY
                        Anyway kiddo, your job - wherever 
                        you move to, wherever you are - is: 

           THE PHONE SCREEN - ALLY’S LITTLE FILM

           It’s framed cleverly. The roll-up spread out like a field. 
           Abbas, a drooling giant, looming over it all...

                                 ALLY (OC) (CONT'D)
                        Don’t let ‘em know you’re slow. 
                        It’s brutal out there. They know 
                        you’re slow, they go after you.. 

           The group of terrified gummy bears Ally modified seem to be 
           SCRAMBLING TO GET AWAY FROM HIS SLOBBERING MAW...

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

                                 ALLY (VO)
                        ...and they’ll eat you alive!

           Gummy bears cross-fade into FIFTH GRADERS TUSSLING EACH OTHER 
           as they crowd a bowl of chips on a table...  

           Ally, sitting alone , doodles SKETCHES of what she sees:

           -The Snack Table Mob as they step back, chip bowl DEVOURED.

           -Mrs. Hall, truly looking ready to burst, sits with two 
           colleagues, RAMROD and FUNKY. She holds up a card featuring a 
           CRADLE, gives a wave of thanks to a STUDENT.

           -KEISHA carries a tray of lovely CUPCAKES, hands them out...

           -ALBERT’s a BEARISH boy in a black t-shirt with block letters 
           that say FLINT - eyes tracking the moving cupcakes.

           -Mop-topped, hyper OLIVER punches at a bunch of pink-and-blue 
           BALLOONS. ‘Til Ramrod snatches them away.
           -Self-assured, put-together SHAY sets flowers -- an over-the-
           top arrangement -- on the desk. Mrs. Hall gives her a hug..

           (It’s clear by now: it’s an IN-CLASS MATERNITY-LEAVE PARTY.)

                                 KEISHA (OC)
                        You just drew all that?

           Keisha’s there, handing Ally a cupcake. Ally moves her arm to 
           COVER HER NOTEBOOK and its various sketches...

           Albert hungrily bites his cupcake in half.  Surprised to find 
           - INSIDE- a little baby-shaped cookie. He lifts it out.

                                 ALBERT
                        How do you get dough of two 
                        different consistencies to cook 
                        properly at the same time?

                                 KEISHA
                        I prebake the cookies a little and 
                        pour the cupcake dough around them!

                                 FUNKY COLLEAGUE (OC)
                             (in background)
                        From Dougie Sortino..

           Miss Hall opens another student card --  locates DOUGIE, the 
           kid, who gave it to her. Smiles and waves.

                                 ALLY
                        Wait. You just made all these?

           Ally seems impressed, but it’s not clear- and Kesha tightens:

                                 SHAY
                             (arriving)
                        Would anyone else make anything so 
                        disgusting?

           Shay’s consigliere, JESSICA, is happily mid-bite...but adopts 
           Shay’s look of disdain. Drops her cupcake on the floor.

                                 KEISHA
                        Your mother. She cooked you up.

                                 SHAY
                        Mrs. Hall definitely liked my 
                        flowers more’n your lame cupcakes. 
                        Nobody wants to bite a baby.
                             (to Ally)
                        Do you?
           But Ally’s distracted by Albert. His shirt rides up, exposing 
           a purple BRUISE, even as he retrieves Jessica’s cupcake from  
           the floor, considers the DIRT on it....and CHOMPS IT anyway.

                                 ALLY
                        Gross!

           It’s reflexive but plays into Shay’s dissing. Keisha darkens.

                                 FUNKY COLLEAGUE (OC)
                        From Ally Nickerson.

           Ally’s attention is drawn to Mrs. Hall, as she’s handed her 
           next gift: ALLY’S BEAUTIFUL CARD.

           She watches with anticipation, as Miss Hall reads her card... 

           Funky Colleague leans in to read...frowning. Mrs. Hall’s eyes 
           find Ally. No wave. She just looks SAD.  

           Ramrod Colleague, fuming, starts Ally’s way...

           EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CLASS - DAY

           Ramrod Colleague is MR. MULDOON, 50s. A true...martinet. He 
           shakes the open card in Ally’s face.

                                 MR. MULDOON
                        I am so sorry for your loss!

                                 ALLY
                        My loss?

           Mr. Muldoon holds the card in her face. There’s Ally’s 
           signature. And there, in black script, is the message:   

           Ally tries to focus. The words SQUIGGLE, like snakes...

                                 MR. MULDOON
                        Why in the world would you give a 
                        pregnant woman a Sympathy card?

                                 ALLY
                        I....I....didn’t..

                                 MR. MULDOON
                        Don’t tell me you didn’t mean to. 
                        What are you going to say next - I 
                        can’t read?

           Ally tightens, struggles to gather herself...
                                 ALLY
                        I meant sorry for her loss because 
                        she is losing us here at school. 
                        Because she’s leaving. So it’s her 
                        loss. And mine. And your loss too. 

           Muldoon glares. And Ally manages to hold it. He huffs, 
           uncertain, hands her back the card.

           But we’re certain, by now... watching Ally do all she can to 
           keep her face earnest, keeping her secret: Ally can’t read.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

           Ally watches as Mrs. Hall waddles to her car as Funky 
           Colleague carries a box of her gifts and sets them in. She 
           sighs, turns to look over the schoolyard. 

           Shay and her clique are laughing, chatting, deep in the 
           business of comparing their identical FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS.

           Keisha, working out something in a notebook, is trying to 
           keep Oliver, who flits around trying to read it, at bay.

           Albert’s alone near a tree, Max & Marco mocking him for 
           gathering acorns. They see Ally, smack their foreheads -Duh!

           There’s the END OF RECESS BELL. Ally slumps. Miserable. 

           INT. HOMEROOM/CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Kids settle into their desks. A STOCKY figure - a janitor? - 
           is in the open supply closet at the back of the room... 

                                 MRS.ORO (OC)
                        Good afternoon Room Five! Is 
                        everyone in from recess...

           Ally turns. The Principal, Mrs. Oro, is in the doorway. Shay 
           and her cohort dart into the class, take their seats.

                                 MRS. ORO
                        To welcome your substitute teacher?

           The class waits for someone to step in alongside Mrs. Oro. 

           THUMP! The “janitor” drops a stack of workbooks on the front 
           desk. Smiles nervously. Tongues a dangling tooth into place.
                                 MRS. ORO (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Daniels will be filling in for 
                        a week or two, while we finish 
                        arrangements for Mrs. Hall’s 
                        maternity leave replacement.

           Max elbows Marco. A temporary sub? Meat! Mrs. Oro’s PHONE 
           VIBRATES - an “all yours” nod to the sub - and she’s OFF. Mr. 
           Daniels stands there a beat, processing the quick intro.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Uh so, yes, let’s see. I’m Mr Dan..

                                 OLIVER
                        Is your nose broken?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Not.. anymore. 

                                 OLIVER
                        My uncle broke his ‘cause the 
                        sidewalk smacked him in the face. 
                        That’s what he said. But really - 
                        my mom said-- it was because of 
                        Dipsomania. Do you know what that 
                        means? It means he was blind drunk.

           Mr. Daniels isn’t sure what to do with this. Looks at the 
           INSTRUCTIONS that Mrs. Hall has left. FIRST DAY ACTIVITIES.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Okay, here’s what we’re going to 
                        do. You’re each going to write a 
                        paragraph about something at this 
                        school you’d like to improve. 

           Ally tightens. Closes her eyes. Head in her hand.

                                 MARCO
                        That’s easy. One word. Everything.

                                 SHAY
                        It’s actually a great assignment. 
                        There could be some useful ideas 
                        the student council can then do.

           Jessica nods in dutiful agreement. Shay grins reassuringly 
           (er...ass-kissingly!) at Mr. D, who smiles, appreciative.

                                 ALBERT
                        You don’t plan implementation, do 
                        you? Isn’t this just to assess our 
                        writing levels? 
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Well..it’s.. ummm, yes it’s..

                                 OLIVER
                        Albert said asses. Asses! Asses!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Could you calm down please?

                                 MAX
                        He can’t calm down. He’s too weird.

                                 OLIVER
                        My mom says I don’t even know I’m 
                        not being calm! 

           Ally GRINS. In Class Paragraph is not happening - this Sub is 
           at loose ends...and the class is RESTLESS, NOISY..

           Except, suddenly...there’s a shrill WHISTLE. Like a ref’s. 
           Mr. Daniles brings his fingers down from his mouth.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Okay everybody. Let’s just start 
                        writing. Now.

           The kids start getting their stuff. Ally’s face falls.  

           Mr. Daniels checks the plan left for him...and the WORKBOOKS.

           ALLY holds her pencil to the paper. Stares. Finally...tries a 
           word. A backwards E..followed by an L and a sort of S. 

                                 ALLY
                             (to self)
                        Less homework.

           It’s a bridge too far and...she quickly ERASES it.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You need to get started.

           He’s there, setting her workbook down. Waits. Ally waits too.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Or do you have a question?

           Ally looks up at him as he nods toward her paper. 

                                 ALLY
                        Have you ever been blind drunk?
                        Like Oliver said...
                                 OLIVER
                        My mother said it. About my uncle. 

                                 MR. DANIELS
                             (he’s had enough)
                        What’s your name?

                                 MAX
                        That’s Vera Thicke, Mr. Daniels.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Vera Thicke, start writing.

           The class SNICKERS loudly. And Ally...glares at Mr. Daniels 
           and SCRUNCHES UP her PAPER into a wad.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Front office. Now, Miss Thicke!

           Ally’s up. Already marching to the door.

                                 MARCO
                        That’s gotta be arecord! What you 
                        gonna get for breaking the record, 
                        Vera?

           Mr. Daniels’ face is a wash of emotion. Tough start. Finally 
           he notices Keisha, eyes on him, hand-up, serious.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Yes? What?

                                 KEISHA
                        Just so you know, her name is not 
                        Vera Thicke.

           EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

           As Ally motors down the hall, face screwed tight, hands 
           clenched, so deeply frustrated that she can scarcely hear...

                                 MR. DANIELS (OC)
                        Hey! Could you stop please? 

           She turns.  There’s Mr. Daniels, hurrying up.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m sorry about calling you 
                        something that’s completely not 
                        your name. I wasn’t thinking and...
                             (a little overwhelmed)
                        Uh, so... what is your name?
                                 ALLY
                        Ally.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Ally. We met before, didn’t we? 

           Ally says nothing. Mr. Daniels looks down toward the office.

                                 MR. DANIELSS
                        Yeah, well I forgot that Mrs. Oro 
                        is...busy. So come back to class.

           Ally..still says nothing. Finally.

                                 ALLY
                        I’m not getting punished now?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                             (thinking)
                        Do you know what a penalty box is?

                                 ALLY
                        No.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Come and find out. Your choice. 
                        It’s not awesome. But it’s better 
                        than those Trouble Maker seats.
                        Super uncomfortable. Right?

           Ally looks down the hall to Mrs. Oro’s, then to the class 
           door...where Oliver has just been shoved out. She sighs. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ally REENTERS the classroom. It has naturally gone off the 
           rails, everyone (except for Albert) BUZZING.

           Mr. Daniels claps his hands. There’s minimal response. So he 
           HEFTS A TABLE OVER HIS HEAD, carries it across the room....  

           He has everyone’s attention now. 

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I’m not sure the best way to get 
                        your attention. The whistling, that 
                        was a bit... much. But it can’t be 
                        lifting up furniture either, so...
                             (sets the table down)
                        How about we start again. I’m Mr. 
                        Daniels. This is my first day, we 
                        all know. But I mean, really, my 
                        first day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never had a fifth grade 
                        homeroom. Until recently, I used to 
                        play hockey. 

           He rubs his nose - smiles at Oliver.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        It can get a little rough.

           He moves some chairs in behind the table.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And in hockey if you’re out of 
                        line, you’re taken off the ice and 
                        have to sit for a while. But not in 
                        some other place. Next to the rink. 

           Turns, finds Ally watching from the doorway.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        So you’re still watching the game. 
                        That’s how you understand what 
                        you’re missing.

           He pulls out a chair, beckons to her.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Ally, you’ve got a ten minute 
                        penalty for being kinda rude to me 
                        in my first five minutes here.

           He’s being so direct about it. She sits. Avoids Max’s smirk.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And you, what’s your name?

           Max is surprised to see Daniels looking at him.

                                 SHAY
                        Max Ferraro.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Max Ferraro. Ten for being kinda 
                        mean with the name you made up.

           Max gives a “for real?” look. Mr. Daniels waits. He comes and 
           sits. Then Mr Daniels SITS HIMSELF in the penalty box.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And I get ten minutes for being a 
                        dupe and hurting Ally’s feelings.
                                 OLIVER 
                        If you’re in the penalty box, who’s 
                        gonna teach the class?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Hand please. You are... 

                                 OLIVER
                        Oliver Wendel Holmes Sanchez.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oliver Wendel Holmes Sanchez. 
                             (smiling)
                        Get on up there and teach us 
                        something we don’t know.

           Oliver darts up front, barely able to contain himself:

                                 OLIVER
                        You ever wonder why sometimes you 
                        feel like suddenly out of nowhere 
                        you need to throw up? Hands please?

           Keisha raises her hand. Then another kid. And..another kid. 
           Then Albert with an Oh I Know This! look.  Oliver beams.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        That’s called Cyclic Vomiting 
                        Syndrome. It’s from too much 
                        emotions, panic or anxiety or being 
                        really excited about something. 
                        Like, for instance getting a 
                        hoverboard for your birthday...

           ALLY looks around: no one is focused any more on the 
           confrontation-drama she was just part of. She glances at Mr. 
           Daniels. Something about this classroom has just...changed.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

           Ally exits. The usual Pick-Up/Home-home rituals. Keisha at 
           her bike looking guarded. Shay, Jessica and their clique 
           chatting over by their MOTHERS’ Lexuses.  

           Ally looks at them longingly. And Shay sees her looking. She 
           actually...smiles. Like she’s about to say something...

           A HONKING. A THROATY patched-together GTO has pulled up.  
           Travis leans out, smiles.  Ally just keeps walking.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Seriously?
           He keeps pace with her.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh, wow. I remember this. Can’t be 
                        seen going home in a crappy car, 
                        right?  Man, eleven sucks.

           Ally quickly gets in. Shoots him a look.

           INT. CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ally scrunches low, just enough to peer out the window.

                                 ALLY
                        I’m twelve by the way.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (just grins, he knows)
                        And this car isn’t actually crappy, 
                        It’s a Work In Progress.
                             (pause)
                        Speaking of which, I gotta stop by 
                        the shop to drop off a part. 

           Ally notes a trio of YOUNGER BOYS, skidding their bikes to 
           head down an alley...  And spots Albert further down it.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        So...another day of Fake It Til You 
                        Make It? 

           Ally looks at Travis...clearly he’s been there.

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, but where do you make it to?

                                 TRAVIS
                        You make it to the next grade or 
                        the next school and you hope 
                        something will be different but it 
                        never is and Mom and Dad don’t 
                        really understand or maybe they do 
                        understand, cause it was probably 
                        the same for them and that’s why, 
                        finally, they let you drop out!
                             (raps his steering wheel)
                        And then you’ve made it. Real life 
                        begins!

           He grins. She wants to grin. But slumps down lower.
           EXT. AUTO REPAIR SHOP - DAY

           Ally sits in the car, watching Travis with manager BLOOM, 
           30s, in the work bay. There’s a 1950s COUPE there. Travis 
           hands him a VINTAGE PART. He nods at Travis approvingly.

           But Ally can also see the glassed in front office...another 
           manager, VEITCH, 50s, there, doing paperwork.. watching them.  

           He comes over holding a thick MANUAL.  Waves Travis over to a 
           second bay, pointing out the undercarriage of the car. Travis 
           glances at the manual. Nods...as Veitch lectures.

           Travis nods. Then turns to head back to his car.  He opens 
           the door, grin evaporating.

                                 ALLY
                        Is that Dad’s friend?

                                 TRAVIS
                        The super nice guy who understands 
                        old cars better than anyone who 
                        spends all their time with their 
                        nose buried in a manual - yes. That 
                        one is Dad’s friend.

                                 ALLY
                        Does he know anything about...how 
                        long Dad has to be over there?

           Travis shakes his head. Exhales. Regroups. Looks at her. He 
           holds the manual up...and tosses it in the back. Grins.

                                 TRAVIS
                        If Dad was here, bet I know 
                        something he’d do with us now.

           He locks eyes with Ally. She smiles. Nods. Yes please.

           EXT. STREET- DAY

           Ally and Travis park on a run-down former “downtown” stretch, 
           long-gutted by the surrounding malls. 

           She jumps out, clearly excited. It’s a PAWN SHOP.

           INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

           It’s a wreck of place. Stuff piled everywhere. Ally’s 
           checking out the CASES, blowing grime off to peer in, to the 
           consternation of the BURLY MAN behind the counter. She spots 
           something, signals to Travis.
                                 BURLY
                        You need somethin’?

                                 TRAVIS
                        We’re looking for coins.

           Burly says nothing, just rolls a toothpick in his mouth. 
           Until Travis pulls out a ROLL OF BILLS. Burly reaches down as 
           if to retrieve a gun...and comes up with SPRAY CLEANER.

           Travis takes it. Clears the case. He and Ally study the mess 
           of stuff there...coins mixed with brooches and old watches.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        That half dollar. How much?

           ALLY leans in for a better look:  a walking woman draped in a 
           sheet, with the sun’s rays behind her.

                                 BURLY
                        That’s in mint condition: 80 bucks.

                                 TRAVIS
                        That’s worth 40. Thirty two really, 
                        but you can make eight bucks -
                        that’s a 25 percent mark-up.
                             (blowing some dust back)
                        Or it can sit here for another 20 
                        years. Might be worth more then.

           Ally absorbs Travis’s bartering chops. Then looks at the man: 
           He says nothing. But his toothpick has stopped rolling.

           EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

           Ally and Travis walk out to the car. Travis reaches into his 
           pocket. Hands her... the Walking Liberty Coin.

           She sets it on the hood. Takes out..a phone gets the light 
           glinting off it as she moves in CLOSE.

                                 ALLY
                        Travis. It’s beautiful. It’s..

           ALLY’S FILM OF THE COIN

           The Woman really does look...empowered. Striding towards us, 
           the sun’s rays emanating from her in a super-hero aura. Ally 
           angles it so she actually starts to GLOW.

                                 TRAVIS
                        A Walking Liberty. 1933. Dad’s dad 
                        was born in 1933.

                                 (MORE)
                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        He’s the one started the family 
                        coin collecting. Grandpa and this 
                        kick-ass lady were both minted in 
                        the same year.

           Ally repockets the coin, leans into her brother. Stays there.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 ALLY
                        Are you any good at making friends?

           Trav glances down at her. Sees...her seriousness.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Hard isn’t it, moving all the time?

                                 ALLY
                        That’s...one of the hard things.

                                 TRAVIS
                        It’s okay to take your time to find 
                        ‘em. You know how dad always says 
                        “you’re only as good as your 
                        friends, so choose them wisely...” 

                                 ALLY
                        “You want the ones who have got 
                        your back.”
                             (pause)
                        You got people who got your back?

                                 TRAVIS
                        I got you, Ally. You got my back.
                             (grabbing for phone)
                        And my phone most of the time!

           She spins, dodges...holding the phone up. Filming him.

           INT. ALLY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Ally sits on her bed.  Homework books are spread around. 
           Unopened. She’s looking at Ally In Wonderland.

           A Tenniel drawing of Wonderland: a CHESSBOARD countryside. 
           Looks over to the photo of her father, closes her eyes.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON’S VOICE
                        “It’s a great huge game of chess 
                        that’s being played -all over the 
                        world, if this is the world at all.
           Ally studies the illustration. She’s got this part memorized.

                                 ALLY
                        “How I wish I was one of them! I 
                        wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if only 
                        I might join — “

           CAR SOUNDS outside. She looks to the window. Mrs. Nickerson, 
           in her store togs, exits the Camry.  Settles back against it. 
           Looks to the sky.  Clearly tired after another long day.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        “- though of course I should like 
                        to be a Queen, best.”

           Ally’s finger traces the chessboard illustration, moving from 
           square to square, black-white-black-white...

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           ..BLACK AND WHITE. The checkerboard of the classroom’s 
           LINOLEUM TILES. Classmates moving over it. As Ally enters..

           To find Mr. Daniels finishing putting NAMES on the desks.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Good morning everyone! You’ve got 
                        new seats. Find yours, settle in.

           A universal GROAN, which he ignores.

           Jessica is Greatly Annoyed to see that she’s not next to 
           Shay. Ally is chagrined to find her seat is in the front row. 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Time to set the world on fire!

           Keisha leans in, listening. Max rolls his eyes.

                                 MR. DANIELS   (CONT'D)
                        I want us to think of us as a team. 
                        We have different people with 
                        different strengths. We’re here to 
                        help each other...To win. Together.

                                 MAX  
                        What are we going to win?

                                 MR. DANIELS:  
                        Hand up please. That’s a very good 
                        question.  What do you think?
                                 JESSICA 
                        Sitting wherever we want.

                                 OLIVER
                        Extra recess! Extra recess! Ex..

           Mr. Daniels nods at Oliver...and RUBS HIS OWN NOSE. 
           Somehow... Oliver smiles and actually quiets.

                                 MR. DANIELS 
                        I was hoping for something more 
                        like.. knowledge. Or confidence.

           Mr. Daniels starts handing WORKSHEETS out.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Speaking of knowledge. Here’s a 
                        list of prepositions and pronouns. 
                        I want you to write a story...about 
                        anything you can think of. Have 
                        fun. But it’s also a story where I 
                        want you to use every preposition 
                        and pronoun. At least twice...

           He hands the sheet to Ally, who tenses. Scrambles..

                                 ALLY 
                        If we’re a team, what’s our name? 
                        Teams have names.

           Mr. Daniels...actually...stops. Takes the bait.

                                 MR. DANIELS  
                        You’re right. They do. How about 
                        some ideas? The Room Five...?

                           SHAY
                                                          MARCO
           Champions!
                                              Ninjas!

                          JESSICA
                                                         KEISHA

                                              Room Five Fantasticos.

                                 MR. DANIELS  
                        Room Five Fantasticos! I really 
                        like the sound of that.

                                 ALBERT 
                        That’s because of the alliteration.

                                 SHAY
                        The a little what?
                                 ALBERT  
                        The pleasing quality when the 
                        initial sound of successive words 
                        is the same.

                                 MAX 
                        That’s got nothing to do with 
                        naming a team, you dwee...

                                 ALLY. 
                        Seattle Seahawks. Pittsburg 
                        Pirates.  Philadelphia Flyers...
                        Room Five Fantasticos.

                                 MR. DANIELS 
                        Fantasticos it is! Well done!

           Albert grins at Ally: thanks for the help. Keisha actually 
           looks grateful for the support too. Before Ally can respond..

                                 OLIVER
                        Go! Go! Fantasticos!

           Other kids pick up the chant, most of them sardonically.. 
           with Max and Marco adding DESK THUMPS.

           It’s loud. Mr. Daniels..raises his hands and...CONDUCTS IT! 

                                 ALLY AND CLASS
                        Go! Go! Fantasticos!

           Ally sees IN THE CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW - Mrs. Oro and a GUEST 
           passing. They glance in. Mrs. Oro looks ready to intervene.

           But with a dramatic flourish, Mr. Daniels SIGNALS STOP.  And 
           they do. Like a choir. Or a team.  He nods approvingly.. 

           But he now notices the concerned observers - goes for the 
           sheepish grin. Mrs. Oro... moves on.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        So, Fantasticos - Prepositions! 
                        Pronouns! For an hour in-class 
                        tomorrow, you all get to write and 
                        show me what you got!  Sound good?

           ALLY’S face going from I’m Enjoying This to... frozen. Like a 
           deer in headlights. Sounds terrible.

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           A BUSTLING LUNCHROOM. Ally assesses the Ever Forbidding turf:
           She can’t help but glance at the Shay posse,  fussing over 
           the matching red bracelets that Shay distributes.(Jessica 
           slips a new friendship bracelet on. Happily waggles it.)

           Max and his gang, playing some sort of tabletop game with 
           finger-goalposts and folded-paper football. 

           And Albert...sitting alone in his permanent FLINT shirt. 
           Reading. Though Oliver flits by curious about the book..

           And Keisha, working alone at one end of a long table...where, 
           at the other end, a group of flaky classmates chitter away.

           Keisha glances up at Ally from her notebook scribbling...

                                 OLIVER (OC)
                        Watch your step!

           Ally startles. Oliver has skittered over. He nods to where 
           Mr. Muldoon has come in to assess the cafeteria... 

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Minefield Muldoon!

           ...Even as Muldoon spots the boisterous boys at their table 
           football game. He moves in...snatches the paper football.

           Oliver makes a puffed-cheek “KABOOOOM” sound, skitters on..

           Ally heads to a lonely table by the window. Sits, looks out 
           so she has somewhere to look. Sighs.  Then notices...

           OUT THE WINDOW

           A view of the faculty parking lot. And there, sitting in the 
           open hatch of his beater Subaru, is Mr. Daniels.  

           He’s eating his lunch there. Alone...but engaged in a phone 
           conversation. Talking. Nodding. Animated.

           She looks back over the cafeteria, eyes going to Shay’s 
           table...to find that Shay is watching her.

           And holding up a braided BRACELET. Ally’s surprised, tries to 
           hide it. Shay’s waving her over now. And Ally...approaches.

                                 SHAY
                        So...Max, What a tool, huh?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah. I’d say a hammer.

                                 JESSICA
                        A hammer?
                                 ALLY
                        Well, you know.  Always out to nail 
                        people.

                                 SHAY
                        I got it. And Albert. Freak, right?

                                 ALLY
                        He is a walking Google page who’d 
                        get a better grade than me if he 
                        just blew his nose into the paper.

           Shay... grins. And holds her wrist up, waggles it. 

                                 SHAY
                        You’re funny. You like these?

                                 ALLY
                        They’re nice. Where’d you get ‘em?

                                 JESSICA
                        Shay makes them for us.

                                 ALLY
                        Oh? Yeah. Cool color.

           Shay nods approvingly. Looks to her friends. Back at Ally. 

                                 SHAY
                        How pathetic can someone get?

           Ally tightens. But Shay’s pointing...at Albert.

                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        Albert!  It’s bad enough you wear 
                        the same stupid shirt every day. 
                        Don’t you have money for new shoes?

           Shay hits Ally on the arm and points at his feet: the BACKS 
           OF HIS SNEAKERS HAVE BEEN CUT OUT.

                                 ALBERT
                        Given the fact of how quickly I’m 
                        growing right now, I’d rather spend 
                        it on a chemistry set. 
                             (lifting his foot)
                        These are comfortable this way.

                                 SHAY
                        You look practically homeless.
                             (turning to Ally)
                        What do you think of Albert and his 
                        Homeless Man shoes?
           The group of girls pivots to Ally. All ears. Her moment.

                                 ALLY
                        They’re pretty dopey. Kinda being a 
                        weirdo, Albert. Like usual.

           Shay beams. Ally grins, but has to turn and face Albert now.. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Ally’s right. Go google Weirdo, 
                        Weirdo!

           He’s studying her a crack in his Ignore Them armor starting 
           to show...before he shuffles off. 

           The girls laugh. And Ally...looks torn, guilt rising...  Just 
           as Shay holds a bracelet out to her.

                                 SHAY
                        You want one? They’re friendship 
                        bracelets.

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah? No, I mean.. I know.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thought I was getting the next one.

                                 SHAY
                        You still owe for the last one. I’m 
                        not giving you another 'til you pay 
                        for what’s already on your wrist!
                             (to Ally)
                        So..Ally, you want one?

                                 JESSICA
                        You’re going to give her one?

                                 SHAY
                        No, I’m not going to give her one.  
                             (to Ally)
                        Twenty dollars. For materials.

           Ally processes all this.  Her hand starts rummaging in her 
           pocket. Finds something. Settles there.

                                 ALLY
                        Twenty dollars. For... the string?

                                 JESSICA
                        Omigod. She makes them herself!

           Ally opens her fist. The Walking Liberty is there. Power 
           Woman. Travis’s gift. She studies it a beat, tucks it back. 
           She glances over at Albert, back by himself. Realizes that 
           though they can’t hear, kids are watching this exchange.

                                 ALLY
                             (quietly)
                        Jessica, they’re called friendship 
                        bracelets because friends give them 
                        to each other to show that they are 
                        friends. You’re not supposed to 
                        have to pay for that. 

           Jessica almost replies but then...isn’t sure what to say... 
           But Shay, she strikes fast - and loud, so EVERYONE HEARS:

                                 SHAY
                        Wow - I hope dumb isn’t contagious! 
                        These are friendship bracelets, 
                        Ally. You can’t just come ask to 
                        buy one. They’re only for friends!

           She takes in Ally with a hooded-cobra stare.  It’s on.

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ally looks pretty miserable as, up front, Mr. Daniels 
           finishes up a lesson, tapping a CHART of the SOLAR SYSTEM.

                                 MR. DANIELS 
                        My very excellent mother just 
                        served us nachos.

                                 KEISHA 
                        Wait what? Nachos?

           Something suddenly STINGS the back of Ally’s head. Her hand 
           goes there... a paperclip dangling from a rubber band. 

                                 MR. DANIELS 
                        That’s the easy way to memorize the 
                        planets in order from the sun.  
                        It’s called a mnemonic. Useful 
                        trick. The more useful tricks you 
                        know, the better!. There’s a lot in 
                        life you’re going to forget, but 
                        this’ll stick in your head forever.
                             (tapping the planet chart)
                        My-Mercury Very-Venus Excellent-
                        Earth Mother-Mars Just-Jupiter 
                        Served-Saturn Us-Uranus Nachos-
                        Neptune..

           Ally looks around. Shay gives her a “poor baby” sneer.  Max, 
           the culprit, just sits, grinning, watching Mr. Daniels.
                                 ALBERT  
                        I feel bad for Pluto. Pluto’s a 
                        planet for years then someone just 
                        decides - not anymore? Too small. 
                        Orbit not right. It’s not fair.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Albert! You might just be the most 
                        thoughtful person I know. I feel 
                        you. My very excellent mother just 
                        served us nachos...

           He turns back to the chart...and marker-draws another planet.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        ..Perfectly.
                             (checking planner)
                        So, guys, that’s about it for your 
                        unit on the Solar System.

           Just behind Mr. D, Ally sees Marco aiming a paperclip on a 
           rubberband...at Albert. Shoots. Dings him. Albert ignores it.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Next, we start a unit on Migration. 
                        The process of organisms moving 
                        from place to place and why, 
                        considering how difficult it is, 
                        they do it. Anyone have any ideas?

                                 ALLY
                        Their dad’s in the military?

           Mr. Daniels nods, nice one...and suddenly SPINS, hand out, to 
           CATCH the shot that Marco has just taken. It’s impressive.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        We are a team. Working here 
                        together. Isn’t that right, Marco?

           He waits for Marco to nod. Points him to the penalty box.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Speaking of which...every team 
                        needs its captain. Which brings me 
                        to: the election for Room Five 
                        Fantasticos’ representative to the 
                        Liston School Student Council. 

           Jessica’s hand is already up.  Mr. Daniels nods.

                                 JESSICA
                        I nominate Shay.
           Shay twists to give her an approving look. Already got that 
           “This Is So Mine” grin as she glances around the class..

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You guys have done this before! 
                        Okay, then. Another nomination?

           He looks around. Shay looks around. Nobody makes a move.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Can’t have an election with one 
                        nominee. C’mon folks, step up.

           No takers. No takers. Until a kid’s hand shoots up.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Keya! Talk to me.

                                 KEYA
                        Can I go to the bathroom?

           Mr. Daniels nods. KEYA disappears. Shay raises her hand..

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Go ahead. Free the pee.

                                 SHAY
                        I’d like to nominate someone.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Shay! Good sportsmanship! Who will 
                        you nominate?

                                 SHAY
                        Ally Nickerson.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Great!  Ally, you accept?

           Ally glances at Shay whose looks say: Humiliation Time.

                                 ALLY
                        Uh...no?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You should run. The whole class 
                        would benefit from an election with 
                        two talented candidates.

           He says this to everyone, but his gaze ends on her. 

                                 ALLY
                        Just get it over with.
                                 JESSICA
                             (jumping right in)
                        Okay! How many people vote for...

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oh, no, no no. Not just yet.

                                 JESSICA
                        We vote right after nominations! 
                        Always! In third and fourth grade.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        And in fifth grade we’re going to 
                        learn about elections while we have 
                        one. Shay and Ally, you’ll each 
                        develop your platform. What will 
                        you focus on as our representative? 
                        Talk with your constituents to help 
                        shape your campaign, and the speech 
                        you’ll each be making.

                                 ALLY
                        Speech?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        A good campaign’s about knowing the 
                        issues, figuring out how to 
                        approach them and getting your 
                        ideas across. Any more questions? 

                                 MAX
                        You sure we shouldn’t vote now? How 
                        long you actually going to be here? 
                        Will you even be around in a week?

                                 MRS. DANIELS
                        Well...I am here on a day to day 
                        basis while the district decides on 
                        Mrs. Hall’s replacement. But even 
                        if I’m not here, I’m sure the 
                        person they hire will greatly enjoy 
                        learning about what matters to you 
                        all as you campaign.

           Ally’s head sinks to her desk. What’s she been pulled into?

           EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Ally exits. Glances around at the kids heading off. Squints 
           up at the sun.  Another day done down the mines.
           EXT. CONDOMINIUM - AFTERNOON

           Ally approaches the condo. The garage door is open. Travis is 
           there among his vending machines, all smudged up. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Mom’s not with you?

                                 ALLY
                        She had a last-minute double. I 
                        would have called you but... aren’t 
                        you supposed to be at work?

                                 TRAVIS
                        Did an early shift so I could take 
                        Bloom to a doctor’s appointment. 
                        His back’s so bad he can’t drive. 

           Travis wrestles one of the vintage vending machines front and 
           center. He hands her a quarter, nods for her to try it.

           It RATTLES. THUNKS. THUNKS AGAIN. And an empty classic glass 
           bottle CLUNKS down the bottom of a chute.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Not one of these machines anywhere 
                        I can’t figure out how to get into 
                        and pull apart. This one’s almost 
                        70 years old. Worth a bundle. 

           She nods, but Travis wants a more energetic response, goes to 
           muss her hair, waving his greasy hands like zombie paws..

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        What? You don’t think that’s 
                        exciting? I almost have enough to 
                        buy rolling tool cabinets. And 
                        someday my big neon sign! Nickerson 
                        Restoration. We Fix Everything!

           He gets her in a playful headlock. Moves his oily hand in...

                                 ALLY
                        Stop!  Stop Travis!

                                 TRAVIS
                        Uh-oh. Let it out. 1001 Reasons Why 
                        School Sucks. Reason 412 is...

           He waits. Ally slumps.

                                 ALLY
                        The mean girls.
                                 TRAVIS
                        Mean Girls are the worst. Right up 
                        there with Mean Boys.

                                 ALLY
                        But I was one of them today!

                                 TRAVIS
                        Oh? Hmmm. I know you pretty well. 
                        You’re not mean. You’re just kinda 
                        prickly sometimes. Like a cactus. 

           Ally just sits there. Stewing.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Okay. And reason 413 is...

                                 ALLY
                        The new sub says we have to write 
                        in class tomorrow for an hour!

                                 TRAVIS
                        An hour? Who is the Torture Expert? 

                                 ALLY
                        Mr. Daniels. Brody Daniels.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Brody Daniels? Like Philadelphia 
                        Flyers Brody Daniels?

                                 ALLY
                        Uh...I don’t know. 

                                 TRAVIS
                             (talks to his phone)
                        Siri. Brody Daniels. Play-offs.

           He scrolls a second. Holds the phone up to Ally:

           It’s video of a HOCKEY GAME. A PLAYER dances down the ice, 
           shouldering past STOCKY DEFENSEMAN...

           And ROCKETING the puck. It BOUNCES off the goal’s cross bar. 
           The player PIVOTS. WHAM! the beat Defenseman FLATTENS him...

           And the Player is UP, GLOVES OFF for both, helmet’s flying. 
           The two go at in their awkward padding, punch after punch...

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        How hilarious would it be if it was 
                        actually that guy?

           Ally leans in to study the defenseman. Enlarges the frame...
                                 ALLY
                        It’s.. him.  That is him.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Seriously? The team goon. They 
                        hired him to get you to sit around 
                        quietly and... write?

                                 ALLY
                        Well, he’s just subbing.

                                 TRAVIS
                        A sub! Subs are even more clueless 
                        than goons.  This will be easy.

           He moves to a stack of old-sheet work rags. Shakes one out. 

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        We Fix Everything!

           He drapes it over Ally’s shoulder, sizing it all up.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           As Mr. Daniels hands out sheets of blank paper...until he 
           reaches Ally.  She’s sitting there with her arm in A SLING.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oooo. What happened to you?

                                 ALLY
                        I tripped on my cat on the stairs.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Broken?

                                 ALLY
                             (she has practiced this)
                        A moderate Grade 2 sprain. Some 
                        ligaments may be damaged.

           Mr. Daniels nods. Ally exhales. On her way. Free and cle...

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I’ve got a cat too. A Siamese. What 
                        kind do you have?

                                 ALLY
                        It’s a...kind of a, you know, 
                        orangey. He’s got a lot of fur 
                        that’s...orange.

           Mr. Daniels looks at her. Looks at her sling.
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I’m having a hard time telling what 
                        she’s actually thinking.

                                 ALLY
                        What?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        My Siamese. Your cat like that? No 
                        idea what’s going on in her head. 
                        Cats just don’t want you to know.

           Ally’s unsure - is he razzing her..or believing her?  Mr. 
           Daniels goes to his desk, comes back. Drops a book. The 
           Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        You can read a story. Good ones in 
                        here. Roald Dahl. Possibly a jerk, 
                        but maybe that’s why he’s so good 
                        at writing about bad grown-ups.

           Dangle-tooth smile. Ally tries out a grin. Gulps. Nods. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON A SEA OF LETTERS: They swim against their page, like 
           fish trying to hold position against a current... wiggling...

           Ally Looks up from her book, around at the classroom of kids 
           going hard at their papers with their pencils...

           She returns to the page. The letters WOBBLE so much it hurts 
           to try to focus on them. She closes her eyes, rubs her brow.

           Looks up to see Mr. Daniels, consulting the lesson plan, his 
           notes.  He looks briefly over at her. A bit...UNSCRUTABLE.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Dougie reads the School Announcements, fast and confident.

                                 DOUGIE
                        ...permission slips for the field 
                        trip to the Butterfly House. And 
                        tomorrow morning, there’s a Spirit 
                        Assembly! Parents are invited.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Thank-you Dougie. Nice work on the 
                        announcements.

           Mr. Daniels sets a battered sports-equipment bag on his desk.
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Okay Fantasticos. Ready to set the 
                        world on fire? I have a new 
                        challenge for you. I’m going to 
                        break you up into groups...

           He starts pointing out the kids who will work together - of 
           course, working against the grain of the cliques..

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Your job with each of these will 
                        be: figure out what’s inside.

           He hands out FOUR SHOE BOXES, held closed with rubber bands. 

           Oliver starts THWACKING the elastics on his box. Until Mr. 
           Daniels RUBS HIS OWN NOSE and Oliver nods...and stops.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        You can do anything to the box 
                        except open it. 

           Four groups. Four boxes. Each with a number markered on top.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        You have five minutes with each 
                        box. Write down your guesses and at 
                        the end, we’ll open them up!

           The kids look...intrigued. Shay rattles her group’s box, no 
           intention of handing it over to the others, including Albert.

           Ally looks over her group: 8 kids, including Max, Oliver and  
           Jessica who, Shay-like, commandeers their box..

                                 JESSICA
                        Forget it. It’s impossible.

           Oliver grabs the box back, shakes it wildly.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s heavy. Banging around.
                        A baby kangaroo with pocket rocks!

           Max takes it. Rattles it..

                                 MAX
                        A wooden block. Like your head.

           He tosses it to Ally who catches it with her “good” hand. 
           Instead of shaking it like everyone, she holds it to her ear. 

           Tilts it. Whatever’s inside...slides down toward her, hits.
                                 ALLY
                        Rolling not sliding. Must be round.
                        But you’re right, Oliver. Heavy.

           Max grabs it back. Tries the same thing. Hmmmm...

                                 MAX
                        Probably a baseball.

           Mr. Daniels calls time. Max scribbles BASEBALL on their 
           list...and nods to Ally as the groups trade boxes.  

           MUSIC OVER

           Jessica’s on it, imitating how Ally manipulated the last one.

           Max flips the box around, listening... feeling... he’s 
           definitely got it. Writes it down: A SPONGE!   

           Oliver grabs it, taps on it.  Then puts his ear down to 
           listen. Gives Max the thumbs up: it’s a sponge...

           But also hands the box to Ally, who listens, moves it around. 
           Indicates that there are more than one. And they’re small.

           Max crosses SPONGE off their list and replaces it with 
           MARSHMALLOW. Ally corrects him - he adds THREE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           As the boxes change groups, Ally glances around:

           -Oliver grabs Box Number 3 and starts SNIFFING it madly.

           -Shay’s bossing her group. Albert’s clearly frustrated by her 
           over-control. When he catches Ally’s eye....he looks away.

           -Keisha pretends to peek into her group’s box, says 
           something...everyone laughs.

           -Oliver’s finishes SNIFFING the heck out of theirs...

                                 OLIVER (OC)
                        So. Not a hotdog. C’mon, Ally - we 
                        should just let you do it.

                                 JESSICA
                        What do you mean?

                                 OLIVER
                        She’s definitely the best at this!
           The others DON’T DISAGREE. It catches Ally off guard... She 
           takes the box, holds it carefully across her chest. Tilts it 
           front to back, side to side, lost in concentration.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                             (arriving)
                        How’s it going with this group?

           He looks at their ANSWER list...purses his lips, nods.

                                 ALLY
                        It’s like a stubby wand - it moves 
                        a lot when I tilt it one direction, 
                        but not when I tilt it the other. 
                        But it also doesn’t make sense.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Why is that?

                                 ALLY
                        I can’t get it to hit the sides. 
                        The more I shake side to side the 
                        more it hits the top and bottom. 

           She shakes it, feels the weight shift... brightens.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        You taped it I think! You cheated!

           She says this excitedly, but the loud “You cheated!” gets the 
           attention of the class: Ally getting in trouble.. 

           Mr. Daniels steps back and.. LAUGHS. Shakes his head

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        That’s impressive. I was told no 
                        one would likely figure it out.

           He takes the box, and opens it to show - a MAGIC MARKER with 
           string tied around it and taped to hang in the middle.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Ally Nickerson shoots, scores!

           He holds his hand up, waggles it.  Ally, without thinking, 
           PULLS HER ARM OUT OF THE SLING. Hand up for the HIGH FIVE.

           And then realizes what she’s done. Smiles sheepishly. Mr. 
           Daniels just nods, shakes his head...smiles back.

           EXT. NICKERSON CONDO - EVENING

           Three cars in the drive now. Camry, GTO, old Windstar...
                                 ALLY (PRE-LAP)
                        Ready? Here it goes...

           INT. NICKERSON KITCHEN - EVENING

           A SMART PHONE SCREEN-SHOT: Abbas on a play blanket, 
           surrounded by a mess of toys, smiling up at the camera.

           A jaunty cover of Taking Care of Business starts and, in Time-
           Lapse, he starts high-speed WRIGGLING all around the room, 
           interacting with every toy, again and again...

                                 FARAH (OC)
                             (laughing)
                        Oh my! How did you do that?

           THE DINNER TABLE

           Everyone’s clustered around to watch. Farah’s there 
           too...eating before the evening shift with Mrs. Nickerson. 

                                 ALLY
                        It’s easy. I time lapsed two hours 
                        into one minute.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Abbas, way to get around on your 
                        back. You’d be great in the shop! 

                                 FARAH
                        You say it’s easy, but no, you have 
                        a gift for it. So...creative.
                             (to Mrs. Nickerson)
                        She get that from you, Sarah?

                                 MRS NICKERSON
                        Me? No.. I don’t think so.

                                 FARAH
                        Sure she does. We pass so much on 
                        to our children. Why do you think 
                        Abbas is so good at making a mess? 

           Abbas concurs...by slamming down his bowl of applesauce.

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah, mom. What were you good at? 
                        When you were our age?

           Mrs. Nickerson thinks, shakes her head.
                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Well, I liked biology. My lab 
                        partner did all the write ups, but 
                        I was the one who rocked at 
                        identifying all the body parts.

                                 ALLY
                        That’s why you work in medicine!

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Ally, I answer phones and clean up 
                        after the doctors and nurses...
                             (pause)
                        I was also pretty good getting into 
                        trouble at school. Like you two.

           She checks the time, gets up, starts to clear. Farah too.

                                 TRAVIS
                        My Getting Into Trouble days are 
                        behind me.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Yours too, Ally?  Have you made 
                        some friends yet?

                                 ALLY
                             (changing subject)
                        I did really well today in this 
                        thing that Mr. Daniels had us do.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Mr. Daniels? 

                                 TRAVIS
                        The goon!

                                 ALLY
                        He’s the substitute. For now.
                             (pause)
                        And I got nominated for student 
                        council.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        What? Wow? Ally, that’s great! 

                                 ALLY
                        Not really. No one’s going to vote 
                        for me. I mean, literally no one.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        I’m glad school is going better. It 
                        sounds like there’s a lot going on.
           They’re leaving. Farah nuzzles Abbas...hands him to Ally.

                                 FARAH
                        Abbas is definitely voting for you!

                                 ALLY
                        There is..a lot. Oh! There’s like a 
                        spirit assembly tomorrow. And 
                        parents can come.

           The ladies grab their bags to exit. Mrs. Nickerson gives Ally 
           a kiss on the head. But her looks says: You know I can’t.

           EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

           Ally walks by the chain-link fence by the school parking lot.

                                 MR. DANIELS (OC)
                        Good idea. Thanks. Having a private 
                        signal is way more supportive than 
                        constantly correcting him in front 
                        of everyone.
                             (pause)
                        I rub my nose. Yes, that nose.

           There’s Mr. Daniels in the parking lot, sitting in his open 
           car - engaged on the phone. Ally slows...curious...

                                 MR. DANIELS  (CONT'D)
                        So many different learning styles. 
                        The mystery box project was 
                        perfect. Keep the ideas coming.

           He pivots as he talks..and Ally, suddenly worried about 
           snooping...drops down, out of sight, behind the low wall.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Really, could not do this without 
                        your help.

           Ally sees...a car has pulled up a little ways down the curb. 
           Jessica gets out. ALLY panics - if Jessica sees her squatting 
           there, she’ll look like an idiot. And if she stands..

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        I’d love it if they’d hire me to be 
                        the replacement teacher for the 
                        rest of the year. But, man, I got a 
                        lot to learn...

           She starts scooting, ridiculously, beneath the low wall...
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                             (with a laugh)
                        Right! Fake it 'til you make it.

           She’s clear. Pops up. Walks around to the school yard.  

           There are some parents milling. Shay’s with her MOM at a 
           COSTANZA FLORISTS van, unloading FLOWERS. Jessica rushes up 
           to help...Shay clearly chastising her for being late.   

           Keisha with her PARENTS, guiding them through the unfamiliar 
           landscape. They have a First Generation Immigrants look of - 
           very UnKeisha-like - reserve.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING

           Ally gets in line as Mr. Muldoon organizes the kids. Shay, 
           following behind, has a basket full of lovely ribbon-wrapped 
           bouquets, officiously handing one to each girl...

           Keisha can’t help it, she buries her nose in her bouquet, 
           takes in the smell. Goes in again, waggling her face...

           And a BUD BREAKS OFF, bounces against...Mr. Muldoon’s shoe. 
           He looks around. Behind him, Oliver mouths his warning:

                                 OLIVER
                        The Minefield.

           Oliver does his EXPLOSION routine, hands waggling for effect. 
           But safely back in position before Muldoon turns to see...

           Shay. Pointing at Keisha, the headless flower in her bouquet.

                                 MR. MULDOON
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 KEISHA
                        I just...

                                 MR. MULDOON
                        If that’s how you’re going to treat 
                        a gift from a classmate’s family -- 
                        with a complete lack of respect and 
                        gratitude - then you’ll be the only 
                        girl without flowers.

           He snatches the bouquet from Keisha’s hands. Shay smirks.

                                 KEISHA
                        Mr. Muldoon, I didn’t...

           Mr. Muldoon holds up his hand. Moves on.  
           Ally looks at Keisha. She’s actually QUITE UPSET. Humiliated. 

           Ally knows the feeling. She grips her own bouquet. Tightly... 
           TWISTS IT, until half of it breaks free from its ribbon...

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           The kids file out, all the girls with bouquets. Ally and 
           Keisha take position, side by side. As Shay glares daggers...  

           And Mr. Muldoon starts conducting...just noticing the HALF-
           BOUQUETS that Ally and Keisha hold, petals fluttering. 

           Too late for Muldoon to do anything... but let them sing. 

                                 KIDS SINGING
                        My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land 
                        of liberty...

           Keisha smiles out at her parents, watching proudly.

           EXT. RECESS PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Kids playing wall-ball. Max & Marco show some younger kids 
           their best UFC moves. Over by an oak tree, Oliver hurls 
           acorns at the sky. Muldoon, across the way...takes notice. 

           Albert, squatting, is carefully gathering the same acorns. 
           Until he’s HIT by one. He spins, looking for the attacker... 

           Max and Marco grin innocently till he looks away..then smirk 
           over at Shay and her gang, who nods approvingly.

           Ally just watches it all...alone. Until Keisha PLOPS down.

                                 KEISHA
                        They suck. Like vampires. And 
                        they’re gonna suck forever. Every 
                        time they talk to you, just say: 
                        Begone, flaming jerkball vampires - 
                        you’re going to suck forever!

                                 ALLY
                        I’ll try that next time.

           Ally looks to Albert, back to his acorn study as, beyond him, 
           the others wait for Mr. Muldoon - who has collared Oliver - 
           to move on so they can attack again... 
                                 KEISHA
                        How does Albert do it? I get mad 
                        and mouthy. You get rude and crazy. 
                        But he just, I dunno..

                                 ALLY
                        Soldiers on.

           The girls exchange a look. Look back towards the tree.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ALBERT carefully scrapes the side of an acorn, studying it. 
           AS TWO PAIRS OF FEET come up and stop in his field of view. 

           He looks up to see Ally there. With Keisha.

                                 KEISHA
                        Hey Albert. What are you doing?

           Thunk! An acorn lands. Max and Marco just keep lobbing them.

                                 ALBERT
                        This green stuff on the side looks 
                        like moss, but I am concerned that 
                        it is a fungus. If this is the 
                        case, this tree may be in danger. 

           Ally’s not sure how to build from that. Keisha nudges her.

                                 ALLY
                        Albert. I’m sorry about..teasing 
                        you about your sneakers before.

                                 ALBERT
                        That didn’t bother me. No need to 
                        apologize.

                                 KEISHA
                        It didn’t bother you at all to have 
                        a bunch of jerks make fun of you?

           Thunk!  Another acorn drops in - bounces off of Albert’s 
           chest. He’s...implacable.

                                 ALBERT
                        The kids that band together and 
                        humiliate other kids don’t tend to 
                        be the actual innovators as adults.

                                 (MORE)

                                 ALBERT (CONT'D)
                        They remain focused on group-think 
                        and social power, while kids like 
                        me tend to rethink how the world 
                        can work and become our true 
                        leaders in science, technology, 
                        business and the arts. 

                                 ALLY
                        Keisha just said that too! Kind of. 
                        Her version is “They’re gonna suck 
                        forever.”

                                 ALBERT
                        That is....shorter.

           Keisha turns and shouts back towards Max and Marco.

                                 KEISHA
                        Hear that! You guys suck and will 
                        never be innovators!

           She scoops up acorns to throw...but Albert reaches out, 
           intervenes. There’s a yellow BRUISE on the underside of his 
           arm...glimpsed for a moment before he lowers it. 

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        Why not? You could cream those 
                        guys!

                                 ALBERT
                        That would be....useless.

                                 KEISHA
                        Are you kidding me? You’re huge. If 
                        I were you, I’d pulverized them.

           She demonstrates a couple of quick Pulverizing moves...though 
           they look pretty ridiculous. Albert watches blankly.

                                 ALLY
                             (laughing)
                        Albert. Do you want to sit with 
                        Keisha and me at lunch?

                                 ALBERT
                        Why?

                                 ALLY
                        Well...you sit alone. And we sit 
                        alone - so I thought that we could 
                        all sit alone together.

           Thunk! An acorn bounces between them. Albert grabs it up 
           before Keisha can.
                                 ALBERT
                        That isn’t a logical.
                             (standing)
                        But I suppose so. I guess I’ve got 
                        to eat somewhere.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           SLURRRRRRRRRRRRP! Ally and Keisha watch as Albert drains his 
           milk carton, shaking it so the last drops fall on his tongue.

                                 ALBERT
                        Who decided a half pint of milk was 
                        enough? I could really use two.

           The three of them sit together over by the window. (An 
           arrangement that might recall The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party...)

                                 KEISHA
                        Can’t you just ask your mom for 
                        extra money in the morning?

           Something about this question pains Albert. But he skirts it, 
           shakes the carton for another drop. Gives up.

                                 ALBERT
                        I just wish whomever decided on 
                        school milk portions did some 
                        research on how much kids actually 
                        like to consume!

           Ally smiles, looks past Albert, out the window.

           Where she sees Mr. Daniels -eating his lunch at his car. On 
           the phone, his planner open, scribbling things down.

                                 ALLY
                        Mr. Daniel’s private time...

           Albert looks, sees. Rubs his palms on his jeans.

                                 ALBERT
                        Do you like him? Mr. Daniels?

                                 ALLY
                        He’s okay.

                                 KEISHA
                        Oh c’mon. He’s better than okay.

                                 ALLY
                        He doesn’t have much experience.

                        I heard him asking for help. That’s 
                        what he’s doing out there.

                                 KEISHA
                        What’s wrong with asking for help? 
                        My family wouldn’t have made it 
                        over here without help. I’ll never 
                        have my own baking company without 
                        a lot of help.
                             (glancing at Muldoon)
                        Most of these teachers are like - 
                        on the brink. Mrs. Hall was nice 
                        but super distracted by being 
                        pregnant. Daniels - it’s like he’s 
                        used to a whole lot going on around 
                        him. He sees... everything.

                                 ALBERT
                        I’m not sure about him. I do not 
                        think he is a trusting person.

                                 KEISHA
                        What? Why?

                                 ALBERT
                        He inquired about my bruises. I 
                        think he hypothesized that they 
                        came from my home environment. I 
                        told him no, but then I had to 
                        speak to the school psychologist.

           Ally and Keisha glance at each other.  

                                 ALLY
                        I’ve been kinda wondering about 
                        your bruises, Albert. To be honest.

                                 KEISHA
                        Yeah, Albert. Me too.

                                 ALBERT
                        If you’ve been wondering about 
                        something than why didn’t you ask 
                        about it before?

                                 ALLY
                        I...didn’t really know you. I guess 
                        I thought you wanted it...private.

                                 ALBERT
                        Everyone’s got stuff they like to 
                        keep private too. Don’t you?

           Ally looks a little panicked at this...is he on to her?
                                 KEISHA
                        Yeah! Nobody gets to look at her 
                        drawings. Even though she’s an 
                        amazing artist.

           Ally nods, but Albert’s look says - there’s more than that.

                                 JESSICA (OC)
                        Excuse me everybody!

           They turn to see Jessica standing, Shay and crew around her.

                                 JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        Hey! I just wanted you all to 
                        remember to Vote Shay, because...
                             (lifts a poster board 
                              sign)
                        Shay’s The Way.

                                 SHAY’S CREW
                        Shay’s The Way. Shay’s The Way.

           They spread out among the tables...enlisting Max and Marco 
           and others...until most of the room is chanting.  

           Oliver jumps up on a table, chanting and conducting 
           gleefully... Until, suddenly he signals STOP.

                                 OLIVER
                        Shay’s The Craze would rhyme 
                        better. Or Shay’s A Phase.

                                 KEISHA
                        Yes! If she’s just a phase then we 
                        can all grow out of it. Shay’s a 
                        phase! Shay’s a phase!

           Shay GLOWERS and her girls get the chant going again.

                                 ALLY
                        You’re...fearless.

                                 KEISHA
                        Gotta keep knocking her off balance 
                        with your campaign.

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t have a campaign.

                                 KEISHA
                        Oh really? Well, you’ve got a 
                        couple of campaign advisers. 
                        Albert, you’re a man of great 
                        words. She needs a slogan. 
           Albert look a little surprised at the assumption.

                                 ALBERT
                        Ummmmm....

                                 KEISHA
                        And you gotta start thinking about 
                        your speech. Just copy the experts!

                                 ALBERT
                        What are you going to do?

                                 KEISHA
                        Me? I’m gonna do what I always do. 
                        Cupcakes. Lots ‘n lots of cupcakes.

           Ally just looks at them. Exhales. Smiles.

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mr. Daniels moves up and down the rows as kids finish up a 
           MATH QUIZ. Ally’s cranking through this with ease. The BELL.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Quizzes on my desk! Please remember 
                        the worksheets due tomorrow.. 

           The kids waste no time packing up, filing out.  Ally’s just 
           about to go, when Mr. Daniels looks up from his desk.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Oh. Ally. Can I talk to you a sec?

                                 ALLY
                        Uh...okay. Sure.

           Mr. Daniels slides a piece of paper in front of her.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Now that your arm is better, I was 
                        hoping you could just scribble a 
                        little something here about 
                        yourself. Anything, really - and we 
                        can count the assignment complete.

                                 ALLY
                        Now?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Now would be great.

           Ally DARKENS.  But puts her pencil to paper. A line..which 
           becomes a square...As she quickly drafts a CUBE.
           She starts scribbling it in...  Darker. And Darker. 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Whoa. Hang on.

                                 ALLY
                        You said scribble - anything.

                                 MR DANIELS
                        About yourself.

                                 ALLY
                        This is about myself.

           Mr. Daniels purses his lips. Nods. 

                                 MR DANIELS.
                        Is it a picture of something?

                                 ALLY
                        It’s a picture of a dark room.

           Mr. Daniels ignores her sardonic tone. Just looks at it.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        A dark room, so...if the assignment 
                        is to tell me something about 
                        yourself, why did you draw a 
                        picture of a dark room?

                                 ALLY
                        I thought you were a hockey player.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I played hockey before this. Yes...

                                 ALLY
                        Cause now you sound like you want 
                        to be some kind of psychologist.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        No. But I do think it helps me be a 
                        better teacher if I understand how 
                        you’re thinking...

                                 ALLY
                        I’m thinking it’s a room full of 
                        hockey pucks. All the pucks from 
                        all the goals you didn’t score 
                        because you were fighting.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Ally! Watch yourse...
                             (pause, breath)

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        You’re good at distracting folks 
                        from the issue at hand, aren’t you?  

           He gets up. Shakes his head. Clicks his tooth into place.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        The goals I didn’t score because I 
                        was fighting. You’re onto 
                        something. Maybe something you 
                        should consider: the goals you 
                        don’t score. Because you are 
                        fighting. 

           Ally says nothing. Just waits. Waits. And Mr. Daniels, still 
           a bit irritated, packs up. Leaves.

           INT. ALLY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Ally on her bed. Books and homework spread out. It’s 
           unbearable.  She pulls out Travis’s phone. Stands it. Sets 
           the timer. Moves the homework over her legs. Snap!  Shifts 
           the papers a little further up. Snap!

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ally has “Ally” In Wonderland open alongside her notebook. 
           She’s copying some Tenniel illustrations: 

           -Alice befriending the hulking Tweedle Dum and Tweedle 
           Dee...who now look quite a lot like Albert.  

           -Alice befriending the Cheshire Cat, who grins down assuredly 
           from the tree, with features very much like Keisha’s.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ally’s got the coin collection out, drawing an enlargement of 
           the Walking Liberty figure, glancing at a mirror, trying to 
           put own face there. Not happy with it. Erases everything.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ally stares at her workbook. Glaring at the instructions. 
           Trying...trying to write something there. It’s painful.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ally perusing laptop YouTube. BEST SPEECHES OF ALL TIME. One 
           thumbnail portrait looks sorta like Abbas. She clicks on it.

                                 WINSTON CHURCHILL
                        We have before us an ordeal of the 
                        most grievous kind. 
           She flops back on the bed. Picks up the phone. Holds it 
           above. Plays the little stop motion video she made earlier:

                                 WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)
                        We have before us many long months 
                        of struggle and of suffering. You 
                        ask, what is our policy?

           ON THE PHONE SCREEN:  Ally’s books and papers, swirl around 
           her on the bed, rise up...and BURY HER.

           EXT. STREET - MORNING

           As Ally, with that ever-overloaded schoolbag, walks along. 
           Past a bodega, a couple vending machines out front. Notices 
           Mr. Muldoon is at one, back to her. Tiptoes quickly past.

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Ally enters the classroom, still mostly empty. No Mr. Daniels 
           yet. But Albert and Keisha are there. Keisha hands her a bag.  

                                 ALLY
                        What’s this for?

           Keisha scrunches her shoulders in mock no idea. Ally opens 
           it.  There’s a cupcake. Something written in ICING on top.

           Ally fishes the cupcake out. Oliver immediately starts 
           hovering around, mimicking the Nemo seagulls...

                                 OLIVER
                        Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

           Ally runs her finger along the icing word, trying to...

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.

           That’s what it says. She breaks it open, tosses Oliver half. 
           Then sees...there’s a dough word inside: ALLY.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        Ally. Ally. Ally. Ally.

           Ally grins at Keisha, shakes her head...wow.

                                 KEISHA
                        You need to come over so we can 
                        make a whole bunch to pass around.
                             (turning)
                        Albert. You’re on.
           Albert nods, and ceremoniously unrolls a POSTER. Block 
           letters that read ALLY IS YOUR ALLY! GIVE HER YOUR VOTE! 

           Ally studies it, nodding...but, of course, unable to...

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        “Ally is your Ally”? Hmmmmm.

                                 ALBERT
                        Ally is your ally!
                             (pause)
                        It’s a homonym. A word with the 
                        same spelling but different sounds 
                        and meanings. Your name also spells 
                        ally. Like in a war. An ally is... 

           The Shay crowd, alas, comes in with flyers. See the poster.

                                 SHAY WING GIRL
                        “Ally is your Ally?” Omigod!
                             (mocking)
                        And “Shay Is Your Shay!”

                                 SHAY
                        Shouldn’t her slogan be: 
                        The world gets dumber every time 
                        Ally Nickerson speaks?

                                 KEISHA
                        Shouldn’t you all be playing with 
                        colored string somewhere?

           They move on, papering the walls with Vote Shay! She’s 
           SenSHAYsional!  Albert reconsiders his poster.

                                 ALBERT
                        Not everybody’s going to get it.

           But Ally’s just... steadily infused with...appreciation.

                                 ALLY
                        Ally. Someone who’s on your side. 
                        Who’s got your back. Like you, 
                        Albert. And you, Keisha.
                             (big smile)
                        I get it.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Ally’s POV out the window: of Mr. Daniels. Eating at his car, 
           on another energetic phone call. Full of movement, nods, note-
           taking, and...a PROTRACTED SLURRRRRRP.
                                 KEISHA (OC)
                        So this shirt you wear every day..

           She turns back to the lunch table. Albert’s just finished 
           with his mini-carton - and sets it down. 

                                 ALBERT
                        I do not wear the same shirt every 
                        day. I have five identical ones.

                                 KEISHA
                        Uh,okay. Anyway, I Googled “Flint.”  
                        It’s a place in Michigan. And a 
                        kind of rock. And something people 
                        use to light campfires. In other 
                        words, your shirt makes no sense. 
                        Please explain. I’ll pay you.

           She slides her unopened milk carton over. But Albert fidgets. 

                                 ALLY
                        Albert. You bought the same shirt 
                        five times. Now I want to know too.

           She slides her milk over to him too.  He looks at the milks. 
           At the girls.  They’re genuinely attentive. Finally...

                                 ALBERT
                        Flint is an immortal genius from 
                        the original run of Star Trek. 
                        Season three, episode nineteen. 
                        It’s titled “Requiem for__”

           A BURST of laughter. Across the way, Shay and her entourage 
           have now welcomed Max and Marco into their lunchtime fold.

                                 ALLY
                        So.. Flint is a smart guy?

                                 ALBERT
                        He goes to his own planet and puts 
                        up invisible barriers so others 
                        won’t sense life-forms there. He 
                        creates robots to stay with him.

                                 KEISHA
                        Sounds super weird. Why doesn’t he 
                        just live on Earth, with people?

                                 ALBERT
                        He once lived on Earth. But he 
                        left. He says it’s to “retreat from 
                        the unpleasantness of Earth and the 
                        company of people.”
           A glance at Shay’s table. She’s watching them. Like a hawk.

                                 ALBERT (CONT'D)
                             (soft, but intense)
                        I can see why someone would want to 
                        avoid other people. A great number 
                        of them are not very kind.

                                 ALLY
                        Albert, wow. That’s.. I’m sorry 
                        for, like prying into your..

                                 KEISHA
                        Yeah, same. Sorry if...

                                 ALBERT
                        I was not implying that it is you 
                        who are not kind to me. I consider 
                        you two...more than allies. You’re 
                        my...friends.

           Ally and Keisha look at each other. Then at Albert. Smile.

                                 VOICE
                        Hey! You three.

           They turn... Mr. Daniels is there. Smiling.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Glad to see some campaign materials 
                        in the classroom! 
                             (to Albert and Keisha)
                        Can I borrow Ally for lunch recess?

           They all look at each other. Look at Ally. She shrugs. 

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

           It’s empty now. Ally sits at a reading table, just staring at 
           it.  Mr. Daniels looks around at the books. 

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Ally, I didn’t mean to put you on 
                        the spot yesterday. But I do feel 
                        like I did learn something from it.
                             (he sits across from her)
                        I get the feeling you don’t like 
                        writing. Or reading.

           There it is, the thing Ally does not want poked at. Mr. 
           Daniels waits, no judgement. She inhales. Nods.
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        So, what do you like then?

                                 ALLY
                        Buffalo wings.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                             (laughing)
                        What do you like about school?

                                 ALLY
                        Leaving.

           Mr. Daniels grins, but just waits.  Waits more.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        I like math. I like to draw.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You are good at equations. Do you 
                        draw other things than black boxes?

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah. Like..all kinds of stuff.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You’re good with a pencil.

                                 ALLY
                        Yeah. I guess. Yeah.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        So then, do you find the writing 
                        more difficult than drawing?

                                 ALLY
                        Writing is easy. It’s just..boring.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oh! Well.. maybe we can do some 
                        things to make it less boring for 
                        you. Get you excited about it.

                                 ALLY
                        Nobody’s excited about writing.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I don’t know. It’s a great way to 
                        explore. And be creative. Don’t you 
                        have a favorite book?

                                 ALLY
                        Not really. No.
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        C’mon. There’s one. Mine - and I 
                        gotta admit, I’ve always been a big 
                        fan of so-called kids books - is... 
                        Where The Wild Things Are. “Let the 
                        wild rumpus begin!” Sounds like the 
                        start of a hockey game.

                                 ALLY
                        Ally in Wonderland. I mean, Alice. 
                        In Wonderland.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Great! Why do you like it so much?

                                 ALLY
                        My dad reads it to me. I mean, I’d 
                        read it with my dad. And I like it 
                        because... it’s about living in a 
                        world where nothing makes sense. 
                        That makes perfect sense to me.

           Mr. Daniels thinks on it. Grins. And snaps his dangling 
           retainer tooth back into place.

                                 MR. DANIELS 
                        Ally. That’s...a cool answer. Wow, 
                        I mean..a smart answer. Really. You 
                        have a lot going on in there.

           He waits. Hopes there might be more from her.

                                 ALLY
                        Can I go now?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You can.
                             (pause)
                        Lewis Carrol. He wasn’t a writer at 
                        first. He was a Mathematician. 
                        That’s probably why when he did get 
                        around to writing something, he had 
                        so many wild and original things 
                        cooking around in his head. 

           Ally isn’t sure what to say...but you can see it in her 
           expression: He’s hit on something here.

           INT. NICKERSON KITCHEN - EVENING

           Mrs. Nickerson lays out dinner...moving at speed. Clearly 
           stressed. Ally fetches the laptop. Brings it to the table...
                                 ALLY
                        We have a Dad call, right?

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Sweetie, he can’t get on tonight. 
                        Unpredictable Operational 
                        Activities.

           Ally closes the laptop, hides her disappointment.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        Don’t know where Travis is anyway. 
                             (dropping into a seat)
                        Speaking of unpredictable, the 
                        store keeps changing my shifts. 
                        They don’t factor in that you’re 
                        juggling two jobs, but they won’t 
                        pay you enough to just have one.

           Ally isn’t sure what to say....Mrs. Nickerson realizes she 
           has broken the unspoken rule of Everything’s Fine.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, honey. Farah’s off this 
                        week. She’s my go-to for...venting.

                                 ALLY
                        It’s okay. I’m... honored.

           There’s the GRUMBLE of the GTO in the drive. 

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        There’s Trav.
                             (relaxing a little)
                        So...your school left a message.

                                 ALLY
                        They...did?

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Mr. Daniels? He said something 
                        about you coming in early some 
                        mornings and about him talking to 
                        people about getting extra support 
                        for you. Do you really need..?

           The door bangs open. Travis. He’s AGITATED.

                                 TRAV
                        Bloom had to take medical leave. 
                        Veitch is in charge of the whole 
                        shop now. And I got let go. 
                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Oh, Trav...really?

                                 TRAVIS
                        What he said: Gonna have to let you 
                        go. Go where’s the question?! 

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Well maybe you can finish your 
                        equivalency...

                                 TRAVIS
                        I can’t finish, Mom! You know that!
                             (intense)
                        Bloom said it. I’m intuitive. 
                        Intuitive’s great for a mechanic.

           Ally studies her mother’s face as she serves - fiercely 
           trying to normalize an anxiety she does not want to show.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        It’ll be alright. Sit down and...

                                 TRAVIS
                        How am I going to make any money? I 
                        need to make money. I have my car. 
                        I gotta buy parts for the machines 
                        and I’m helping you! Make ends 
                        meet! I’m helping you!

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Shhh. We’ll figure it out.
                        We’ll figure everything out.

           Travis is getting teary....but bangs off towards his room...

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        Trav...

           She starts after Trav, turns and sets Ally’s dinner down... 

                                 MRS. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        You’re all set here, right Ally? 
                        You got everything you need, right?

           Ally looks at her. Works reassurance into her features. Nods.

           EXT. STREET NEAR SCHOOL - MORNING

           Ally walks along the sidewalk, past the half-filled faculty 
           parking lot. Sees Mr. Daniels car is there.  Continues on..
           Into the schoolyard. It’s empty...a few teacher’s arriving. 
           It’s EARLY.

           INT. CLASSROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Ally enters. Mr. Daniels is taking down a FOOD PYRAMID poster 
           that hangs by the “penalty box.”  Sees Ally. Smiles warmly.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You guys know the food pyramid. 
                        Think I can take this down and you 
                        won’t all start eating buckets of 
                        sugar?

           Ally nods. He rolls out a poster and starts tacking it up:

           A photo of a HOCKEY PLAYER, horizontal, about five feet above 
           the ice in front of the net, as if he’s flying, not skating. 

                                 ALLY
                        Who’s that?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Bobby Orr. Number 4. Boston Bruins. 

                                 ALLY
                        Looks like he’s wiping out.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        That’s what I love about it. He 
                        looks like he’s wiping out. But, 
                        really, he’s scoring the goal that 
                        won the team the NHL championship.

           He plops down at his desk. Gathers some materials.

                                 ALLY
                        Mr. Daniels, why did you stop 
                        playing hockey?

           Mr. Daniels clicks his retainer tooth. Grins.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Wanted to keep my winning smile.

           Ally doesn’t say anything. Just watches him.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And...I met someone who liked the 
                        idea of me with a winning smile. 
                        Someone who helped me see that 
                        skating around in circles wasn’t 
                        gonna get me where I need to go.
           He smiles again at her. Pulls his chair around so he’s 
           alongside. Holds up a book: Where The Wild Things Are.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mr. Daniels works with Ally...as she leans in over the book.

                                 ALLY
                        Wolf. One sound. Wolf.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        There are four sounds. W..
                             (he raps on the desk)
                        ..o..(rap)..l..(rap)...f.
                             (rap)
                        Try it. 

           Ally repeats, rapping the desk with each sound.

                                 ALLY
                        W...o....l...fff.
                             (pause)
                        So I’m supposed to drum my way 
                        through the whole book?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        We’re just exploring ways for your 
                        brain to register how words can be 
                        broken up. You’re doing great.

           He looks up, past Ally, sees Shay in the hall. Waves to her. 
           She moves on. Ally leans in on the page. Stops at HALL NOISE. 

                                 ALLY
                        I can’t concentrate now. The other 
                        kids are coming. It’s impossible.

           Mr. Daniels smiles, takes a piece of paper and a marker and 
           writes a word on it. Holds it up to Ally.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Remember - break it into chunks.

                                 ALLY
                        Im..(rap) po..(rap)  Important?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        No, but a good try. It says 
                        impossible.  Like you just said.
                        So fold it. Right past the IM. 

           He guides her to fold the paper. And then fold it back.
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Rip that first chunk off. Go ahead.

           Ally tears the strip of paper with IM on it away.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Now throw that little piece with 
                        the IM on it in the trash. C’mon.

           Ally tosses it...hits the can.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Gone. Forever.  So.. What you got 
                        there?  What’s that say?

           Ally looks it over. Already knows, but sounds it out. 

                                 ALLY
                        Pos (rap) Si (rap) Ble (rap).

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You got it. Not impossible anymore.

           Ally looks at the word carefully. Mouths it: “Poss.I.Ble.”  
           She wants to look sure. She doesn’t look so sure.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        As you know, I’m new at this. So 
                        tomorrow I’m going to meet with the 
                        district to see if they’ve got some 
                        experts around to join our team. 

           Mr. Daniels slides the book over. Grins. Take it.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Let The Wild Rumpus Begin!

           EXT. ALLY’S CONDO - NIGHT

           No Camry and No GTO in the drive. A light in Ally’s room.

           INT. ALLY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           There’s a faint tapping. ABBAS is asleep in a port-a-cot. 
           Dribble-Snoring. But over on Ally’s bed...

           Homework spread around. Math worksheets. The laptop screen 
           with something on Whale Migration.  Ally on her belly... 
           Focused on Where The Wild Things are. Tapping it out.

           She stops. Closes it. Looks at all there is to do. Turns to 
           the computer. Thinks.
                                 ALLY
                             (loud whisper)
                        Hey Cortana. Speeches. No old guy 
                        who looks like Abbas stuff.

                                 CORTANA
                        I am having trouble hearing you. 
                        Can you ask again, more loudly?

           Ally grins, leans in closer.

           EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Ally comes down the hall looking...hopeful. Even as she 
           slides by Shay and crew - ‘cause Keisha’s there, waiting.

                                 KEISHA
                        Easy week! Field trip tomorrow! And 
                        I asked my mom -this afternoon’s 
                        perfect so- shake n’ bake!

           Keisha happily wiggle-bumps her as they enter Room 5...past 
           the handmade sign there: HOME OF THE FANTASTICOS.  

           Shay, behind, scowls at their energy.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kids are milling about, chatting.

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        No dilly-dallying. No talking. Take 
                        your seats immediately...

           There’s a grim, sad sack MAN, short-sleeves and tie, 40s - a 
           CAREER SUBSTITUTE. He waves Mr. Daniels’ TEACHING PLAN.

                                 SUBSTITUTE (CONT'D)
                             (reading from planner)
                        For the first hour, writing 
                        assignment. “Tell me about a person 
                        you know who is brave.”

           Ally tries to hide her ALARM.

                                 MAX
                        Who are you?

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        I did not see a hand!
                                 MAX
                             (shrugging his hand up)
                        Who are you?

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        I’m Mr. Murk. Replacing Mr. 
                        Daniels.

                                 OLIVER
                        What do you mean by replacing? 

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        This isn’t question time! You have 
                        your assignment. Start working!

           Oliver retreats. Ally gulps, risks raising her hand...

                                 ALLY
                        What if we have to go to the nurse? 
                        I’m feeling kind of sick, because I 
                        think I ate something...

           The Substitute waves her off, not even listening.

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        Write. Now.
                             (checking instructions)
                        Oh...and where is Ally Nickerson?

           Ally’s hand’s back up. The teacher sees.

                                 TEACHER
                        Look at that. You don’t have to 
                        fake a trip to the nurse now. 
                             (reading the notes aloud)
                        Special circumstances...yadda, 
                        yadda. Ally Nickerson does not have 
                        to write. Let her know she can use 
                        her other skills. Draw a picture of 
                        her brave person, etc...”

                                 SHAY
                        That figures. She can work on her 
                        coloring. And there will be Play-
                        Doh and nap time and picture books! 

           She makes an Enthusiastic Pre-School Teacher face at 
           Ally...and RAPS out each syllable with her knuckle.

                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        And, Ally, you can practice writing 
                        your name! Al.Ly.Nick.Er.Son.
           The LAUGHTER is instant - it WASHES over Ally. She tenses. 
           Gulps. Reddens. Even the Substitute smirks..before snapping:

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        Enough! Write. All of you. I don’t 
                        want to hear a sound except...

           RIPPPP! Ally pulls a page out of her notebook and hurls the 
           notebook down. It slides across the floor... over by Shay.

           She storms up, drops the page on the Sub’s desk.

                                 ALLY
                        I’m done with this!

           She’s deeply upset. Almost gulping for air...

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        This is blank.

                                 ALLY 
                        It’s not blank. I drew a ghost. In 
                        a blizzard.

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        That is not the assignment!

                                 ALLY
                        A brave ghost. That blizzard is 
                        miserable and frozen. Like you. And 
                        your dead cold career!

                                 SUBSTITUTE
                        Out! Right now. Out and down the 
                        hall and...Out. Out. Out! 

           Ally, worked up, keeps GULPING. She tries to reign it in 
           in..but the spasms INTENSIFY. 

                                 OLIVER
                        This is what I was telling you guys 
                        about! That’s what it looks like...

           The Sub barely has time to react as she looks up, moves to 
           cover her mouth, but...

                                 OLVIER
                        Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome!

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ally sits on the cot there. She has a PE T-shirt on. Holds a 
           bucket in her lap. The NURSE opens the door. 
           Keisha’s there. Albert

            behind her.

                                 KEISHA
                        That was awesome! I mean, what a 
                        jerk! Are you still sick? You’re 
                        not really sick are you?

           Ally tips the bucket her way. It’s empty. Keisha beams.

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        Great! Cause I already bought all 
                        the supplies! 

           Keisha beams. Albert grins at Ally. Holds up her BOOKBAG. 

           INT. KEISHA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           A small, pleasant kitchen. (Keisha’s FATHER can be seen out 
           the window, tending to a meticulous lawn.)

           Keisha’s REVVED UP to have Ally and Albert in her kingdom. 
           She hands Ally an apron -- not really registering how SUBDUED 
           she is - and tosses Albert a ROLLING PIN. 

                                 ALBERT
                        So, when do we eat?

                                 KEISHA
                        Albert! We’re cooking for the 
                        campaign! 

           Albert’s face falls.  Keisha gestures to the OVEN behind 
           them...the light’s on: there’s SOMETHING BIG in there. 

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        There will be eating. But first we 
                        need to work on the cupcakes. 
                        People vote with their stomachs.

                                 ALBERT
                        Actually, people vote with...

                                 KEISHA
                        Not now Albert. Okay, Miss Future 
                        Leader. You get to practice being 
                        in charge.

                                 ALLY
                        Of what?
                                 ALBERT
                        Can I at least have some of that 
                        milk?

           Keisha hands Albert a glass..and nudges the carton his way, 
           even as she slides A COOKBOOK over to Ally.

                                 KEISHA
                        The recipe! I think we need to 
                        change it a little..so the cookie 
                        dough cooks at the same rate as the 
                        cake.

           Ally tenuously opens the book to the table of contents. 

           Albert’s gulping straight from the carton. Keisha grabs the 
           milk away...and gets her mixing bowl ready.

           THE COOKBOOK

           The letters the usual BLUR. But with drawings in the margins. 

                                 KEISHA (OC) (CONT'D)
                        Okay, what’s the first thing?

           Ally stares at the book. Keisha pokes her. Ally startles.

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        I asked, what’s the first thing?

           Ally looks at the cookbook. Her features..TIGHTEN. Closes it.

                                 ALLY
                        I can’t do this.

                                 KEISHA
                        Do what?

                                 ALLY
                        This whole thing. It’s a waste of 
                        time.

                                 KEISHA
                        What whole thing?

                                 ALLY
                        Nobody wants words in cupcakes. 
                        They want whipped cream. They want 
                        chocolate chips. They don’t want 
                        something they have to, to read!

           Keisha’s gob-smacked. She starts steaming.  Albert finishes 
           another pull off the milk carton. Sets it down. Sighs.
                                 ALBERT
                        Anger can be a substitute emotion.

           The girls glare at him, both loaded. Behind them all, the 
           room’s getting a bit SMOKIER...

                                 ALBERT (CONT'D)
                        It feels better to be angry than to 
                        be in pain. And being angry 
                        distracts you from identifying your 
                        vulnerability.  It’s a shift from 
                        self-focus to other-focus.

                                 ALLY
                        Where are you coming up with that?

                                 ALBERT
                        A therapist I worked with.

                                 ALLY
                        Your family can’t afford milk and 
                        you have a therapist?

                                 ALBERT
                             (to Keisha)
                        She’s doing it to me now. Part of 
                        the distraction.

                                 ALLY
                        You’re the one who distracts 
                        everyone with all your pointless 
                        facts to make sure that you never 
                        have to tell anyone how you get 
                        those bruises!

           This lands. Albert looks hurt. And actually flares. A little.

                                 ALBERT
                        My bruises are my bruises.  I do 
                        not make them everyone’s business 
                        by turning the whole class upside 
                        down every time someone almost 
                        notices them, the way you do, every 
                        time someone almost notices the 
                        fact that you can’t read.

           Ally SLAPS the carton out of his hand. It spills everywhere.

           Just as, behind them, out of the already hazy stove area, a 
           big BLACK CLOUD OF SMOKE ROILS FORTH...

                                 KEISHA
                        Oh!  Oh no!  
           She grabs the oven door. Pulls her hand back in pain. Grabs 
           an oven mitt, yanks it open. The CAKE there is in FLAMES.  

           Albert grabs the fallen carton of milk and SPLASHES the rest 
           of it over the flames... There’s a huge HISSSSSSS.

           CLOSE ON THE CAKE PAN

           The CAKE has charred & milk-melted into a tarry goop. 
           Blackened cookie letters poke up through it at angles. 

           You can just make out the ruin of the word: FRIENDS.

           INT. NICKERSON CONDO - EVENING

           Ally schlumps herself up the drive...to the open garage door. 

           Travis is trying to open an old vending machine. Going 
           angrily at the rusty lock with a ring of old keys.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Another day down the mines?

           Something CLICKS but it still won’t release. Only then, does 
           he look over at Ally. Sees she’s tear-streaked.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        You okay, sis?

                                 ALLY
                        They all know. They all laughed at 
                        me. He said in front of everyone I 
                        shouldn’t bother writing!

                                 TRAVIS
                        Who said? The goon?

           He jiggles another key, gets it in the lock. Stuck.

                                 ALLY
                        No, the substitute! That’s what Mr. 
                        Daniels told the substitute to say. 
                        Ally can’t do it! I thought Mr. 
                        Daniels was on my side!

                                 TRAVIS
                        Even if he is, as soon as he isn’t 
                        around, you’re screwed. Mr. Bloom 
                        gave me a shot because he was Dad’s 
                        friend and even though I was doing 
                        amazing - without having to read 
                        anything! - the next guy in charge 
                        fires me.
           Travis takes a crowbar, finds the door seam. Jams it in.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        I’m telling you now, Ally. Forget 
                        ‘em all. It’s not worth it!

           He jiggles the key. STOMPS on the crowbar. The machine pops 
           open, a cobwebby MESS inside.

           INT. ALLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ally flops onto her bed. Curls up. Glances over at her shelf. 
           The coin collection. The Alice Book. The things that usually 
           give her solace...   And turns OFF the light.

           EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

           Ally’s walk to school. Definitely not early today. Kids 
           outside everywhere. And she remembers: Field Trip.

           Muldoon and Principal Oro watch as kids file onto a bus. 

           Ally searches- no sign of Albert or Keisha. Sees Mr. Daniels 
           there, checking kids in. He smiles. She just moves past.

           INT. BUS - MORNING 

           Ally steps in. Max and Marco commandeer the back. Shay’s 
           clique giddily wave phones, making faces at.. 

           Keisha and Albert, sitting together. Ally glances at them, 
           apologetic. But they still look FRESHLY UPSET.

           She flops down by Oliver, up front. He’s busy pestering the 
           driver about pulling the door lever when it’s time...

           EXT. MUSEUM - DAY

           Fifth graders pile off the bus alongside a NATURAL HISTORY 
           MUSEUM.  There’s a large greenhouse structure off to one 
           side...with a separate entrance.  The BUTTERFLY HOUSE.

           INT. BUTTERFLY HOUSE - DAY

           There are a LOT OF MONARCH BUTTERFLIES in the air.

           The kids have been broken into small groups, an ELDERLY 
           DOCENT monitoring each.  Mr. Daniels moves from group to 
           group, guiding them thru their WORKSHEETS...
           Ally stands with unfamiliar classmates by some milkweed 
           plants. The Docent points to a CHRYSALIS that is HATCHING...

           And Ally can’t help it, as she looks.. It’s AMAZING. She 
           turns,  reflexively looks for Albert and Keisha, wanting to 
           share the experience. Sees them across the aisle, smiles...

                                 ALLY
                        You guys have to see this.

           Keisha comes over...but full-on Take No Prisoners glare:

                                 KEISHA
                        We saw these. That good enough!?

           She holds up her phone. ON THE SCREEN: There’s a posted image 
           - Ally’s long-ago DOODLE OF KEISHA WITH A BAKING TRAY.

           But the baking tray is filled with little PILE-O-POOP EMOJIS 
           instead of cupcakes. Someone has done some editing...

                                 ALLY
                        Wait. What? 

           Keisha scrolls to another drawing. It’s Albert, comically 
           HUGE in his shirt, which now (a la editing) says: FLOG ME.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        That’s not...How did you get those?

           It sounds incriminating...but before she can explain...

                                 KEISHA
                        You’re worse than Shay. She’s 
                        openly a mean jerk. She doesn’t 
                        hide anything.

           Keisha leaves. Ally looks around, sees other kids watching. 
           They got the images. They’ve been waiting for the face-off.   

           There’s Albert. Watching her too. Mr. Implacable. But 
           something in his gaze now is just...incredibly sad. 

           And there’s Shay, waggling her friendship bracelet..shooting 
           her a mocking What? No Friends pout.

           Ally bolts for the nearest DOOR, one with a sign: NOT AN 
           EXIT. In big bold letters.

                                 DOCENT
                        That’s not an exit! Can’t you read?

           Ally SHOULDERS THROUGH..the air-whoosh carrying BUTTERFLIES 
           with it. The docent yanks the door closed. But Ally’s GONE.
           EXT. BUTTERFLY HOUSE - DAY

           Ally motors across the lawn away from the butterfly house. 

           Even as THREE BUTTERFLIES flutter on by her. She stops. 
           Watches them flit upward, taste the wind...  Disappear.

           And it cracks her. She just Folds Up. Arms along her head. 
           Blocking out the world. Trying to control herself... 

           Breathes. Breathes. Tears. Tears. Lots of them.

                                 QUIET VOICE
                        Ally.

           She doesn’t respond.  But finally looks up. Mr. Daniels is 
           squatting...a respectful distance but...eye to eye.

                                 ALLY
                        Just leave me alone.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Well, I’m not going to do that.

                                 ALLY
                        You told that sub to tell me to 
                        draw and not bother with writing -
                        right in front of everybody!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        I’m  so sorry, Ally. That was not 
                        how he was supposed to handle that.
                             (pause)
                        Subs can be really clueless, you 
                        know?  Especially on the first day.

           Ally says nothing. Head in knees. 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Can you tell me what just happened? 
                        Was it because of yesterday?

                                 ALLY
                        It’s because of every day. Every 
                        day that I do stupid things 
                        because...I’m stupid!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Oh, Ally. You actually believe 
                        that, don’t you?

                                 ALLY
                        Why wouldn’t I?
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Because you are certainly not 
                        stupid. You have a quick wit, and 
                        great sense of humor! When I asked 
                        why things migrate and you said 
                        because their dad’s in the army...

                                 ALLY
                        That was just an unfortunate stroke 
                        of luck. My dad is in the army.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        An unfortunate stroke of luck?
                        How many kids your age say things 
                        like unfortunate stroke of luck?

                                 ALLY
                        Say! Say!  But how come I can’t 
                        read!?  How come I can’t write!? 

           Mr. Daniels sits on the ground next to her.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Aw Ally. This thing that makes 
                        school frustrating... I think you 
                        have something called dyslexia. 

                                 ALLY
                        Dyslexia?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        It means that, yeah it’s hard for 
                        you to read and write, but not 
                        because you’re dumb - your brain 
                        just figures things out differently 
                        from other people.

           Ally keeps her face in her knees.

                                 ALLY
                        Differently means Really Slow...

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Differently means someone who can 
                        think “outside the box.” I mean you 
                        literally think outside the box. 
                        Remember?  You’re great at solving 
                        problems, you see things in a way 
                        that other people can’t!

           Ally manages to nod. Yes. She remembers.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And differently means brave, Ally.
                                 ALLY
                        I am so not brave.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You come to school, knowing it will 
                        be hard. Knowing other kids might 
                        razz you. Day after day you come 
                        and try again. That’s brave. 

                                 ALLY
                        Fake it ‘til you make it.

           Mr. Daniels cocks his head - that’s his expression for 
           himself after all.  He smiles. Nods.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        You’re going to make it, kiddo. I 
                        met with the district people. They 
                        said they can test you, and arrange 
                        for a reading consultant to come 
                        help at our school. They’re busy. 
                        It’ll take a while. But in the 
                        meantime, I’ve been doing some 
                        research and there’s some more 
                        stuff we can do. You and me. We can 
                        learn about it together. 

           Ally wipes the tears from her face with the back of her hand.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        You are smart, Ally. And you’re 
                        going to learn to read. And write.

                                 ALLY
                        I wish you were right.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Don’t be so hard on yourself. You 
                        know, a wise man once said, 
                        “Everyone is smart in different 
                        ways. But if you judge a fish on 
                        its ability to climb a tree, it 
                        will spend its whole life thinking 
                        that it’s stupid.”

           Mr. Daniels stands, extends his hand..and she takes it.

                                 ALLY
                        Did a wise man really say that?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Actually, that was my wise fiancée. 
                        She’s a teacher too. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        She’s been giving me help since my 
                        first day in Room Five. You guys 
                        were brutal. Remember? I was a 
                        wreck! I mean, we’re talkin’ tears.

           He smiles. Tooth dangling. Ally can’t help it...she smiles 
           too, and wipes what’s left of her tears away.

           EXT. NICKERSON CONDO - NIGHT

           Camry in the drive. GTO out. Neighborhood quiet. It’s late.

           INT. NICKERSON CONDO - NIGHT

           ON A BALL OF FLAME It’s a drawing. Beautifully penned on the 
           cover of her notebook....as Ally adds some touches...

           All while watching YouTube.  Headphones on. Watching a speech 
           clip. It’s MICHELLE OBAMA.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You should never view your 
                        challenges as a disadvantage. 
                        Instead it’s important for you to 
                        understand that your experience 
                        facing and overcoming adversity is 
                        actually one of your biggest 
                        advantages.  And I know that 
                        because I’ve seen it myself, and 
                        not just as a student working my 
                        way through school...

           She stops the clip. Painstakingly writes on an INDEX CARD. 
           Tries out an Enthusiastic Speaker expression..

                                 ALLY
                        I’d be good for Student Council 
                        because I...I’ve seen it myself...

           She looks at card. The scrawl there. Crunches it up.

           EXT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ally enters.  TV’s on. Mom’s head poking up from the couch.

                                 ALLY
                        Mom, can I practice with you...?

           Mrs. Nickerson, in her scrubs, is SOUND ASLEEP. Ally studies 
           her --her mom’s features actually at rest -- emotion welling. 
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        It’d be easy if I got to make a 
                        speech about you, Mom. 
                             (quietly)
                        How hard you work, how you give 
                        everything you got for Travis and 
                        me, day after day after day even 
                        when you’re never sure it can ever 
                        be enough but you don’t show that 
                        to us you just show us how much you 
                        love us and how much you want us to 
                        be happy. 

           She sits softly alongside her mom. Listens to her breathe.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Daniels says I’m brave, Mom. 
                        But you’re the really brave one. So 
                        if I am brave, it’s only because I 
                        get that from you.

           And then...the THROATY RUMBLE of a familiar car in the drive. 

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Travis is reaching into the back of his car as Ally, per her 
           way, sneaks up behind him...

           Travis turns, surprised. The BUCKET he’s lifting out TIPS 
           NOISILY onto the drive. COINS. Lots and lots of them.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Ally! You need something?

                                 ALLY
                        I...have to make a speech tomorrow. 
                        And I...Where’d you get all this?

           Travis kneels, starts scooping coins back into the bucket.

                                 TRAVIS
                        You just... go to the bank and 
                        exchange your money for coins. I 
                        wanted to go through them and see 
                        if there’s anything special.

           She kneels to help him scoop coins. Sees, on the car seat, 
           Travis’ big ring of vending machine keys...and his CROWBAR.
           EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING 

           Ally approaches campus. Past the faculty parking lot. It’s 
           early, only a few teachers about.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           As she reaches Room Five. Looks unsure. Stares at the sign.

                                 MR. DANIELS (OC)
                        Home of The Fantasticos.

           There’s Mr. Daniels inside. Smiling.  Waiting for her.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Daniels sits on the edge of his desk.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        So, the way your magical mind is 
                        wired it’s likely you have trouble 
                        learning words with just your eyes.

           Ally nods. And Mr. Daniels lifts into view..a big sheet of 
           shiny SHEET METAL and a can of SHAVING CREAM. Bizarre.

                                 ALLY
                        What else am I supposed to use?

                                 MR DANIELS
                        There’s lot of ways for information 
                        to reach the brain. Think of the 
                        five senses. Taste. Smell. Hear.

                                 ALLY
                        Touch.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Right! We’re going to use more of 
                        your senses to practice letters and 
                        sounds. Like what we were doing 
                        with reading, drumming out the 
                        syllables. Same thing with writing. 

           Mr. Daniel lays the sheet metal on Ally’s desk. Then hands 
           her the shaving cream. 

                                 ALLY
                        Uh...okay...
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Just fill this sheet with foam and 
                        we’ll get started.

           Ally sprays some shaving cream onto the metal sheet.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Rub it all around. Cover it.

           She does. Now there’s a big sheet of gooey foam on her desk.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        So, what’s your favorite letter?

           Ally looks at the strange set-up. Back at Mr. Daniels. Dips 
           her finger into the shaving cream. Squoogles out a big...A.

           They get to it. Student and teacher. Engaged. In a MONTAGE: 

           - Ally working on more foam letters. Z. Z. Z. She tips 
           forward, as if she’s falling asleep. Mr. Daniels laughs.

           -Mr. Daniels writes SET THE WORLD ON FIRE on the whiteboard. 
           Ally moves along the words..rapping/sounding them out.

           -Mr. Daniels lays a TINTED SHEET of plastic over a worksheet. 
           Ally leans in. The letters pop thru the color, clarify...      

           -Ally does more foam writing...a word this time: TREE. 

           And there’s THE FIRST MORNING BELL. 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Ally. Great work. How’s tomorrow?

           He gathers the teaching aids. Hands her the tinted plastic 
           sheet. Ally nods. Yes. Mr. Daniels gives the thumbs up.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Okay. One more. Big one. All yours.

           Mr. Daniels writes something across the whole front board. 
           Ally goes up...raps her way across, sounding it out.

                                 ALLY
                        Wel.Come.To.The.Stu.Dent.Co.Con.Kyl

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Council.

                                 ALLY
                        Coun.Cil....Con.ven.tion.
           Mr. Daniels goes for a high five. Ally returns it... just as 
           the first wave of kids come in, Mr. Daniels welcoming them.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Are you all as excited about the 
                        speeches this afternoon as I am?

           Keisha and Albert come in and Ally tries for eye contact. 
           Fails. And then it’s Shay and her crew, revved up, chanting.

                                 SHAY’S CREW
                        Shay’s the way! Shay’s the way!

           Ally locks her smile in, but her eyes betray her: Oh God!

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - AFTERNOON

           Everyone’s in. Mr. Daniels, claps, getting things underway..

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Alright, we’re back on the Campaign 
                        Trail. Shay, heads or tails?

                                 SHAY
                        Heads.

           Mr. Daniels flips. Heads it is. Shay shoots an insistent  
           look at Jessica, heads to the front of the room. 

                                 JESSICA & ACOLYTES
                        Shay’s the way. Shay’s The Way.

                                 SHAY
                        Shay’s The Way. I was so honored 
                        when my friends came up with that.

           She holds her arm up, wiggles her bracelet. The girls wiggle 
           theirs back. Shay pulls out a stack of index cards.

                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        And today, I’d like to outline the 
                        several things I’ll do, as your 
                        Student Council Representative, to 
                        pave the way forward for us all.

           Ally looks down at her few cards. Her anxiety is palpable.

                                 SHAY (OC) (CONT'D)
                        I will advocate for extra recesses.

           Max starts supportive DESK THUMPING, which others pick up..
                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        And longer lunch times. With better 
                        lunches. Freshly popped pop corn. 
                        Maybe even a milkshake machine...

           Even OLIVER joins the thumping. Ally glances at Albert and 
           Keisha. Are they about to thump desks? Albert looks tempted.

                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        I promise bigger hallway lockers. 
                        With mirrors. And phone chargers.  

           Ally stares at her cards, fingers sweating up the edges. The 
           supportive noise for Shay builds all around her...

                                 SHAY (OC) (CONT'D)
                        Because my first act as your 
                        Student Council Representative will 
                        be to secure the right to using 
                        your phone during the school day!

           The THUMPING AROUND ALLY grows, an insistent drum beat. Shay 
           produces a bouquet of daisies..starts handing them out.

                                 SHAY (CONT'D)
                        And, of course, there will be a 
                        “friendship flower” for everyone, 
                        every day, to remind you that..

           She shoots Jessica a stern look: Your cue! Now!

                                 JESSICA AND FRIENDS
                        Shay’s the way! Shay’s the way! 

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Thank you Candidate Costanza! Well 
                        organized. And engaging promises.
                             (pause)
                        Which brings us to... 

           Ally’s got her head bent over her cards. Focusing. She looks 
           up. Meets his gaze. Shakes her head a tiny bit: No. I can’t.

           But he’s looking at something else now. She follows his gaze:

           The Bobby Orr Poster. Up in the air. Looks like a wipe out. 
           But it’s actually...a winning score. He sees that she sees...

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        ...Candidate Nickerson?

           And Ally...heads for the front. Sighs. Sets her cards down. 
                                 ALLY
                        The world gets dumber every time 
                        Ally Nickerson speaks.
                             (pause)
                        Somebody said that once. Or twice.  

           Things are a little uncomfortable. A few eyes shift to Shay.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        So, here I am speaking. Which 
                        means, according to that person, 
                        you guys are getting dumber by the 
                        second. By the time I’m done, 
                        you’ll all be grunting and trying 
                        to eat each others’ fleas.

           Somme laughter...and, yes, a couple of grunts.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been to a lot of schools and 
                        one thing has always been the same. 
                        Why do we spend so much time making 
                        each other’s days harder?  School’s 
                        like spending the day trying to 
                        pull a tire through a keyhole. 

           More chuckles as kids picture it.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Which is why I have felt lucky 
                        here. In Room Five. Where I’ve met 
                        some people who taught me things.
                             (glancing at Keisha)
                        Like don’t be afraid to shout down 
                        the jerkballs that are trying to 
                        mess up your confidence.
                             (glancing to Albert)
                        Or there’s too much interesting 
                        stuff in the world to waste time 
                        paying much attention to those 
                        jerkballs in the first place.
                             (pause)
                        Both good strategies. Even though, 
                        like everything, I mess them up. 

           A deep breath.  And another one... Here it is:

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        ‘Cause things are messed up for me. 
                        My head’s full of ideas. But 
                        writing’s... I’d rather eat hair. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know why but the things in 
                        my brain get lost on the way down 
                        my arm. And reading for me is like 
                        aaaaarrrrghhhhhhh!

           She looks out at everyone, eye contact, naturally. 

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        You ever feel that? Just so... 
                        frustrated. Anyway, I’m sorry if 
                        that sometimes makes me be the one 
                        acting like a jerkball. 
                             (nod at Keisha)
                        As far as student council goes, 
                        ummm..maybe I could start a chess 
                        club? Knowing how to play chess 
                        would be good. It’s like, 
                        practicing how to move forward, 
                        right?  I know I couldn’t get any 
                        of what Shay talked about done...
                             (a glance at Albert)
                        But I would try to be your ally. 
                        And I promise if I was your 
                        representative to do my best to 
                        help you not feel aaarghh. Whatever 
                        that means for you, here at school.

           Everyone’s quiet. The opposite of Shay’s “rally.”  Ally tries 
           a smile. Wipes her brow. Returns to her desk. Spent. 

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Thank-you, Ally. 
                             (to class)
                        Now that the candidates have shared 
                        their platforms, you need to engage 
                        with each other, sharing your 
                        thoughts on what you heard, so that 
                        in two days, you are ready to vote!

           The BELL sounds. Ally just absorbs it all: Mr. Daniels moves 
           to thank Shay...as her cluster pops up to compliment her. 
           Though Jessica holds back a beat, eyes on Ally. Not unkindly.  

           Ally realizes...where are Albert and Keisha? She looks for 
           them. Sees they’re already heading out the door.

           Ally breathes, tries to muster the courage to follow them.  
           But, even as she stands, Mr. Daniels is there.

           He looks emotional, not sure how to convey his pride in her. 
           Finally, spots her notebook, the BALL OF FLAME drawing.
                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        I like this. Way more than that 
                        black cube. You got something going 
                        here, Ally. It’s good. You could 
                        really make something out of it.

           He smiles warmly.  She..nods. Wipes her eyes. Heads off.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - END OF DAY

           Ally comes out onto the school yard. Kids move off in all 
           directions - a few milling about. She sees who she’s looking 
           for. Keisha and Albert just outside of the school yard.

           Keisha’s on her bike, heading off. Albert goes the other way.

                                 ALLY
                        Keisha!

           Not clear she hears; she’s disappearing. Ally turns, starts 
           after Albert.  He notices, picks up speed. And Ally runs.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Ally runs, her bookbag banging, finally reaches Albert. But 
           he just keeps walking.

                                 ALLY
                        Albert! Can I walk with you?

                                 ALBERT
                        There’s no need to do that. In 
                        fact, it’s better if you do not.

                                 ALLY
                        I want to be friends again!

                                 ALBERT
                        Yes. I understood the subtext of 
                        your speech.

                                 ALLY
                        Then why is it better if I don’t 
                        hang out with you now?!

                                 VOICE (OC)
                        Hey Punching Bag! Wait up!

           Ally turns to see FIVE YOUNGER BOYS, 3rd graders from school, 
           approaching. Albert picks up speed...
                                 ALBERT
                        Just keep walking.

           The boys SPRINT UP, and encircle them. They’re much smaller 
           than Albert, but they’re cocky as hornets.

                                 BOY 1
                        Wow. This your girl-friend?

                                 ALLY
                        What is up with you guys?

           Boy 3 simply CHARGES through Ally, leaping up to do his 
           version of an MMA kick, catching Albert IN THE BACK. 

           Albert stumbles, but doesn’t react.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Hey! Cut it out! Get lost kid! 

                                 BOY 2
                        You get lost, girlygirlfriend!

           He darts in and throws punches against Albert’s chest.  
           Again, Albert doesn’t react much -- but he is wincing.

                                 ALLY
                        Stop it!  Stop it!!

           Ally GRABS the kid from behind, and whips him around so that 
           he stumbles back. Pissed, he glowers...CHARGES HER...

           And COLLIDES WITH KEISHA, as she glides in, drops her bike.

           She whips him around fast and he tumbles back onto his bum.

                                 KEISHA
                        You heard her, cut it out! 

           But the other four boy buzz in, kicking and jabbing...

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        Albert - these punky little kids 
                        are the ones who’ve been bruising 
                        you? Please just smoosh them!

                                 ALBERT
                        I don’t think it’s within my nature 
                        to hit someone. And it seems to me 
                        that as I’m larger than they are, 
                        if I were to defend myself, I would 
                        receive the blame for the fight. 

           WHOOOMP! Another little f@#ker flies in with a kick.
           And something in Ally just LETS GO. She PLOWS INTO THEM, 
           using her shoulder to flatten the first. She grabs the second 
           by his HAIR..and twists his arm behind his back.

           The kid BURSTS INTO TEARS, shouting...

                                 KID 3
                        Max! Max!!!

           Ally’s confused. But Keisha sees that one of the other kids 
           has run toward the adjoining half-rotted FENCE.

           Keisha beats him there, YANKS DOWN the loose fence to expose 
           MAX AND MARCO. Phone-RECORDING IT ALL through the fence gaps.

                                 MAX
                             (surprised, covering)
                        Hey. Leave my brother alone.

           Ally reads the whole scene.

                                 ALLY
                        You get your brother and his little 
                        pals to pick on Albert because you 
                        know he’ll never hurt them - just 
                        so you can watch!? 

           Keisha gets right up in Max’s face. Poking his chest.

                                 KEISHA
                        That’s messed up. You guys have 
                        always been lame, but now you’re 
                        full-on psychopathic losers!

           Max reacts, pushes Keisha back. She stumbles over the fence 
           chunk, goes down...kinda HARD. Max steps in over her..

                                 MAX
                        Stay out of it Keisha!  It wasn’t a 
                        problem until you two made it o...

           WHAM!!  Max doesn’t finish. He is KNOCKED ON HIS ASS. 

                                 ALBERT
                        You don’t touch my friends. Do you 
                        understand that?

           Albert! He squats, LIFTS MAX, THROWS HIM INTO THE FENCE. And 
           turns, now, to Marco.

                                 MARCO
                        I didn’t touch...

           Albert SHOVES him....he goes down fast and hard.
                                 ALBERT
                        Do. You. Understand. That?

           He steps in. Marco nods, scrambles up and sprints away.

           Ally helps Keisha up. They look to the squad of little punks 
           disappearing down the lane. Then to Max, curled up, groaning. 

           Then to Albert. They’re...beyond impressed.

                                 KEISHA
                        Albert. Looks like we just got you 
                        off that private planet of yours.

                                 ALLY
                        Your shirt’s gonna have to stand 
                        for something else now.

            They smile. He exhales. Manages a smile too.

                                 ALBERT
                        I could really use...a milk.

           INT. ALLY’S KITCHEN - EVENING

           Ally works on her reading. Mouthing syllables as she softly 
           raps. Until a splootch of pureed pumpkin hits the page.

           Abbas is happily eating across the way. She watches his 
           little mitts drawing lines in the mush on his tray. Reaches 
           over...WRITES SOMETHING in it.

           Travis comes in, pulling on a jacket. Goes to the fridge. 
           Pulls out the milk. Chugs it from the carton.

                                 ALLY
                        What is it with boys and chugging 
                        out of cartons?

           Travis finishes chugging, wipes his mouth.

                                 TRAVIS
                        We love the way it irritates girls.

           He grins - first one Ally’s seen in a bit - and turns to go.

                                 ALLY
                        Where you going now?

                                 TRAVIS
                        Out and around.

           Ally hesitates....calls after.
                                 ALLY
                        To break into vending machines?

                                 TRAVIS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ALLY
                        When you get change from banks it 
                        comes in coin rolls, not buckets. 

           Travis darkens, starts to leave. Ally breathes deep: Brave.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Just so you know, Travis, you’re 
                        the one who’s always had my back. 
                        You guide me. You make it easier 
                        for me that Dad isn’t here. And I 
                        don’t think you ever lied to me. 
                        Not even once.

           Travis...sits. Sighs. Doesn’t meet her gaze. His ends up on 
           Abbas’s tray. The word there: MESS

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        He has me write on weird surfaces. 
                        Shaving cream. Or blue or pink 
                        sand. So I can feel it.

                                 TRAVIS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ALLY
                        Mr. Daniels. He’s teaching me. He’s 
                        doing lists of words like light and 
                        might and fight that have the same 
                        sounds. He puts the letters that 
                        repeat in red and the initial 
                        consonant in black.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Initial consonant. Listen to you!

                                 ALLY
                        He makes the words into pictures. 
                        It helps me remember them.

           She pulls her pad over. Scribbles on it. Holds it up to him. 
           It’s FISH...but there’s a FISH SHAPE around it.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        What’s that say?

                                 TRAVIS
                        Ally, bug off.
           She holds it closer to him, waggles it, won’t back off.

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        F..ish. 

           She scribbles another, with roots below and branches above...

                                 TRAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Tree.
                             (sarcastic)
                        Great. Now draw something so I can 
                        read things like Unemployment 
                        Benefits Application.

                                 ALLY
                        I don’t know what to draw for that.
                        And I don’t know what to draw for 
                        Vandalism either. Or Theft.

           Travis flushes, shakes his head. Back on his feet.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        But I got your back too, remember?
                        Trav. I could try to help you.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Ally! It’s too late for me! You 
                        don’t understand. You’re still a 
                        kid. No matter what you think, you 
                        don’t know anything about anything!

           Ally’s stung by his anger...but..absorbs it..

                                 ALLY
                        A substitute emotion.

                                 TRAVIS
                        What?

                                 ALLY
                        Albert says anger’s a substitute 
                        emotion. You do it to distract 
                        people and yourself from the thing 
                        you don’t know how to deal with.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Albert says? Who’s Albert?!

                                 ALLY
                        He’s my friend. Next to you, he’s 
                        the brightest guy I know.
           Travis shakes his head. But Ally holds him in her gaze. He 
           turns to see Abbas is looking at him too - holding his little 
           hand up in an offering. It’s covered in pumpkin goo...

           Travis takes some on his fingertip. Studies it. Touches 
           Ally’s nose with it. Shakes his head... and leaves.

           EXT. STREET NEAR SCHOOL -  EARLY MORNING

           Ally walks along with a stick, making a line in the dirt, 
           talking to herself, practicing....

                                 ALLY
                        Do you know anyone who...Can you 
                        recommend a, a... Yaahh! Mr. D! 
                        Could you talk to my brother?

           As she passes along the low wall by the faculty parking lot.

                                 MR. DANIELS (OC)
                        She said I knew I was there on 
                        temporary basis and it’s not 
                        procedure to hire full-time 
                        replacements out of the substitute 
                        pool.

           She stops, unseen, surprised to hear how...UPSET HE SOUNDS.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        I know. Yeah, I can sub elsewhere 
                        while I get the certificate. It’s 
                        just... I really like this gang. My 
                        Fantasticos. We’re getting 
                        somewhere together. 

           Ally ducks down. Scoots along. Listening, of course.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        She decides this week -someone from 
                        “the district-mandated channels.”
                             (sigh, defeated)
                        It doesn’t seem to matter! This 
                        principal is so overextended, she’s 
                        just...inflexible. There isn’t 
                        anything else I can do!

           He pivots toward where Ally was. No sign of her.

           INT. MRS. ORO’S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

           CLOSE ON:  That Front Office Lady. And her scowl.
                                 FRONT OFFICE LADY
                        Haven’t seen you in a while.

           Ally’s up against her desk. She gestures to the Troublemakers 
           Seats - and the couple of scraped-up morose kids there.

                                 ALLY
                        I didn’t get sent here. I just 
                        wanted to...talk to Mrs. Oro.

           Front Office studies Ally even more suspiciously now. She 
           makes a deal of looking over her scheduling screen. 

                                 FRONT OFFICE LADY
                        Busy lady. Next Tuesday. 7:30 AM.

                                 ALLY
                        Next week is too late!

           She closes the book firmly. Back to work. Ally....Breathes 
           deep. Turns. Looks across at the Trouble Maker Seats. 

           EXT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Lunch is underway. Muldoon on patrol (though Max and Marco 
           are clearly subdued.) Ally, Keisha and Albert at the table.

                                 ALLY
                        They’re going to fire him!

                                 KEISHA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ALLY
                        They won’t keep him because they’re 
                        required to have someone with the 
                        right amount of experience. 

                                 ALBERT
                        Experience is a good measure for..

                                 ALLY
                        Albert! You think there’s anyone 
                        who can come in now and do a better 
                        job with us than Mr. Daniels?

                                 ALBERT
                        I do...not.

                                 ALLY
                        We’ve got to talk to the principal! 
                        But the principal doesn’t have time 
                        to talk.
                                 KEISHA
                        Maybe you can when she comes to 
                        congratulate you after...

           Keisha opens her large pack, lifts out A BOX. Opens it: 
           stacked CUPCAKES. They all say, in icing on top: VOTE.

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                        You get elected.

           Oliver skitters over, his sugar sensor ticking. 

           Ally smiles at the beautiful cupcakes. Holds one up. Bobs it 
           in her hand. Likes its heft. 

                                 ALL
                        Keisha. You know I love your 
                        cupcakes. And I know I’m supposed 
                        to hand ‘em out to win. But I need 
                        to use this...for Mrs. Oro. 

                                 KEISHA
                        What’s a cupcake got to do with 
                        her?

           She follows Ally’s gaze to where Shay and her bracelet girls 
           harass a new offbeat-clothing-choice Unfortunate. Looks back 
           at Ally, bobbing the cupcake in her hand. Like a snowball.

                                 KEISHA (CONT'D)
                             (getting it)
                        At least take a bite. 

           Ally does so. Nods. Licks her lips...and HURLS THE CUPCAKE.

           It EXPLODES goo-ily against Shay’s chest. She’s stunned, 
           looks down at the little cookie word stuck there: ALLY.

           Looks up. Just in time to see that Keisha has launched one at 
           her.  And Albert. And, giddily, Oliver too.  Incoming!

           INT. MRS. ORO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mrs. Oro looks beyond put-out. She glares across at Ally...

                                 MRS. ORO
                        The Policy on instigating a Food 
                        Fight is clear. The disciplinary 
                        response may include expulsion.

           And KEISHA next to her and ALBERT. And OLIVER, who can’t keep 
           his hands off her etch-a-sketch...which she snatches away.
                                 MR. ORO
                        Do you realize how disruptive, 
                        disrespectful and dangerous...

           Albert puts his hand up. Keisha too. (Oliver now fidgets with 
           her NAMEPLATE: Dolores Oro) And Mrs. Oro snaps...

                                 MRS. ORO
                        Young man, this had better be 
                        extremely relevant!

                                 ALBERT
                        Technically, we did not instigate a 
                        food fight. We threw cupcakes-- but 
                        no one threw food back. There was 
                        no actual fight. It was a food 
                        attack.

           Mrs. Oro’s taken aback by this explanation. Turns to Ally, 
           whose attention seems to have drifted off behind her.

                                 MRS. ORO
                        What do you have to say? Your 
                        presence is disappointing - and as 
                        I warned you before, most 
                        definitely means... 

                                 ALLY
                        Sometimes the bravest thing you can 
                        do is ask for help.

                                 MRS. ORO
                        Excuse me?

           Ally points to the poster behind her: the HANDS CONNECTING...

                                 ALLY
                        That’s what your poster says. The 
                        last time I was here I couldn’t 
                        read it. And it’s still not easy. 
                        I’ve been sounding it out the whole 
                        time my friends have been talking.

                                 MRS. ORO
                        I don’t understand your point.

                                 ALLY
                        Mr. Daniels has been teaching me to 
                        have confidence in myself. Mr. 
                        Daniels has been teaching me to 
                        read. Mr. Daniels figured out 
                        something that I didn’t really want 
                        anyone to figure out.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Something no one ever really 
                        figured out. Including you, Mrs. 
                        Oro.

                                 MRS. ORO
                        Mr. Daniels?

                                 ALLY
                        He’s the best teacher I’ve ever had 
                        in all the schools I’ve been in and 
                        it’s not just me, everyone in the 
                        class will tell you, so instead of 
                        bringing in someone we don’t know 
                        and who doesn’t know us again you 
                        should take a minute to talk to the 
                        kids Mr. Daniels teaches and you’ll 
                        realize he’s awesome not just as a 
                        kind, good guy...

                                 OLIVER
                             (spinning the name plate)
                        And funny. He’s funny. Mostly.

                                 ALLY
                        ...but as a professional teacher 
                        who is great at his work and is 
                        always learning how to do his job 
                        better and better!  You just can 
                        not fire a guy like that!

           Mrs. Oro opens her mouth to speak. Stops. Takes Ally in. 
           Looks back at the poster behind her. Turns back to Ally.

           No one says anything for a long moment. The air is...charged. 
           Oliver holds the nameplate out to Mrs. Oro.

                                 OLIVER
                        Dolores means pain doesn’t it? Is 
                        it weird to have the name Pain?

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           Under the supervision of a JANITOR. Ally, Keisha, Albert and 
           Oliver are doing serious Clean The Cafeteria duty.

           Shay and entourage pass the entrance in a practiced 
           exhibition of Group Smirk. 

           The quartet glance at each other, get back to scrubbing.
           EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Ally, Keisha, and Albert exit. Subdued.  The other kids have 
           left. Keisha pops on her bike. Ally and Albert start home.

           INT. NICKERSON KITCHEN - DAY

           Mrs. Nickerson and Ally are at the kitchen table...

                                 SGT. NICKERSON (OC)
                        ...never even seen a goat before 
                        and there he is, collecting the 
                        strays we come across when we’re 
                        out on..when we’re.. Well, there 
                        must be six or seven around the 
                        camp now. He calls ‘em The Kids.

           Sgt. Nickerson’s face fills the laptop across from them. He 
           looks, well...spiritually exhausted. Sighs..smiles.

                                   SGT. NICKERSON
                        Anyway everything’s fine. I mean, 
                        we are on it. On it. How about you, 
                        babe? How ‘bout my kids?

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Nothing for you to worry about 
                        here. We’re all...chugging along.

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        You know I like the good news. 
                        Trav? You there? What’s the report?

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        He’s...out now. But...Ally’s here!

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Ally-bug! What you got for me?

           Ally reaches over to the side and holds something up to the 
           screen...  ALLY’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND. Sgt. Nickerson 
           leans as close to the screen as he can..

                                 SGT. NICKERSON (CONT'D)
                        Oh honey, I wish I was there to 
                        read it to you.  But I can’t see 
                        clearly enough from here.

           Ally leans close to the screen too. Takes a breath. Brave.

                                 ALLY
                        Dad?
                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                        Ally?

                                 ALLY
                        Do you know... how I can’t really 
                        read and Travis can’t read and we 
                        all really don’t talk about it much 
                        and Travis and I do everything we 
                        can to keep it hidden and we’re all 
                        working so hard and not really sure 
                        what to do and no one’s really ever 
                        showed us what to do?

           Sgt. Nickerson looks a little taken aback. Sits back. Sighs.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Ally....

                                 SGT. NICKERSON
                             (leaning in close again)
                        Yes, Ally. I do know that.

           Ally meets her father’s gaze. Smiles a tenuous smile.

           Opens the book. Studies the page, takes a breath. Reads..

                                 ALLY
                        “I could... tell you my adventures 
                        —beginning from this morning,” said 
                        Alice a little... timidly;” 

           BEHIND HER - In the doorway. Travis has come in. He’s leaning 
           against the door jam.  Watching. Listening.   

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        “but it’s no use going back to 
                        yesterday, because I was a 
                        different person then..

           Travis’s eyes find his mother’s. They’re glistening. Just 
           holds he gaze, ‘til his glisten too.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        “Explain all that!” said the Mock 
                        Turtle. “No, no!” said the Gryphon 
                        in an im..pat..ient tone. 
                        “Ex..plan..ations take such a 
                        dread..ful time.”

           Ally looks around at her mom and brother. Then back at her 
           dad. Even on the screen his eyes glisten too. He’s BEAMING.
           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - MORNING

           Ally approaches the campus. Another day down the mines. But 
           her features now aren’t filled with resignation. There’s a 
           lot more brewing there, as she looks over the yard..

           Mrs. Oro is showing an unfamiliar PROFESSIONAL-LOOKING WOMAN 
           around the grounds.

           Shay and her crew line the entrance, chanting “Shay’s The 
           Way”... and handing out single flowers as students enter.

           But there’s Albert, over by his tree. He starts towards her.

           As Keisha, on her bike, skids in. Smiles. Climbs off. And the 
           three head in together.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Daniels gestures to a WORLD MAP of MIGRATION ROUTES...

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        So, Fantasticos, that’s it for our 
                        unit on Migration. 

           He glances at the Penalty Box. Ally. Albert. Keisha. Oliver. 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        And the thing is, migration is part 
                        of all of our lives.  As humans, we 
                        are on the move. We make changes in 
                        response to our environment.
                        We emigrate, we push into new 
                        territory, we move on..

           Ally glances at her pals - Where’s he going with this?

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                             (almost soulful)
                        I guess my point is.. As you guys 
                        move forward, remember to bring 
                        your best game to it. Your talents -
                        --remember to use them to set the 
                        world on fire!

           The friends TENSE. He’s about to announce he’s leaving? 

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        So, where does that bring us?  We 
                        can’t let today get by without...
                             (claps his hands)
                        Our election!
           He writes CANDIDATE 1 and CANDIDATE 2 on the whiteboard. 
           Looks around his desk for something. Can’t find it.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Oh! Hang on. I left something in 
                        the teacher’s lounge. Be right 
                        back.

           And he darts out. Shay immediately addresses the penalty box.

                                 SHAY
                             (loudly, for all to hear)
                        Pre.pare.to.get.bur.ied..
                        Al-ly Nick-er-son.

                                 KEISHA
                        Why are you saying it like that?

                                 SHAY
                        It’s good to sound it out. Just to 
                        be sure she understands.

           Keisha looks ready to pounce. But Ally stays her. Let it go.

                                 SHAY’S CREW
                             (starting their chant)
                        Shay’s...

           Oliver leaps up on the table, crows loudly...

                                                         OLIVER
                        SHAY’S CREW (CONT'D)
           The way!
                                              A phase!

                        SHAY’S CREW (CONT'D)
           Shay’s the way! Shay’s the 
           Way!
                                                         ALBERT
                                              Ally’s Your Ally! Ally’s your 
                                              ally!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                             (coming back in)
                        Alright! Electoral spirit!

           He has a box and moves along, handing everyone something... 
           Starting with the penalty box.  

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        First, I want to thank our 
                        candidates for running. You’ve both 
                        done us a great service!   

           Ally looks at what she has just received: a nice NOTEBOOK - 
           the cover bearing an embossed motto: FANTASTICOS FOREVER!
                                 MR.DANIELS
                        And remember, no matter who wins, 
                        we are all Fantasticos. Forever!
                             (waving a notebook)
                        A little team present. From me to 
                        you. And I’d like you to use the 
                        first page to write down your vote. 
                        Shay Costanza or Ally Nickerson. 
                        Tear it out. Fold it up. Pass it 
                        in. And our poll workers...
                             (gestures to Max & Marco)
                        ...will count and mark them here.

           He indicates the two columns on the board.

                                 KEYA
                        But there’s no names there!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        The names will be added after the 
                        votes are all marked. In the words 
                        of Dougie, head of your Board of 
                        Elections, it’ll make it “totally 
                        suspenseful.” 

           Ally looks around nervously.  The kids are busy scrawling.  
           She looks at her own page. Isn’t sure what to do with it. 

           And Ally writes. Carefully printing.

           Marco collects the votes. Max begins the count. Checking each 
           paper, making a mark in one column or the other.  

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        While the votes are being 
                        tabulated, I want to announce we’re 
                        having a special visitor today.  

           This news fills Ally and friends with concern....  

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        She’s excited about coming, though 
                        because of your energetic, full-of-
                        questions Fantastico reputation, 
                        she’s a bit nervous meeting you for 
                        the first time.

           Behind him, Max continues to mark votes on the board...

                                 OLIVER
                             (can’t keep it in)
                        What if we don’t want her to meet 
                        us for the first time?
                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Well, Oliver. I know that you will 
                        still give her a warm welcome.

           The column on the left is getting more votes... even as Max, 
           suppressing a smile, marks yet another. 

           Finally, Max tallies them. He signals to Mr. Daniels. He goes 
           to board, blocking it as he writes names along the top.

           He turns - there’s Shay’s name. On a column with 15 votes.  

           Ally studies the board, stunned. Column two says ALLY: 22.  

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Shay. You ran a well-organized 
                        campaign with some inventive ideas 
                        that might well inspire change.

           Shay slumps angrily in her seat. Ally looks around. Kids, 
           even ones she scarcely knows, are glancing at her, smiling.

                                 MR. DANIELS (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Ally.

           Someone starts clapping. Fast. Oliver. But it’s backed by 
           Albert and, as she stands up to dance...Keisha. Until the 
           better part of the class is clapping. And drumming desks.

                                 KEISHA AND ALBERT AND OLIVER
                        Al-ly! Al-ly! Al-ly!

           They’re  celebrating her in classic team-chant style. 
           Syllable by syllable calling her name. 

           Shay just sits there, staring daggers at her campaign 
           team...except for Jessica. Because Jessica’s now smiling at 
           Ally - and, along with the rest of the class, CHANTING.

                                 CLASS
                        Al-ly! Al-ly! Al-ly!

           Keisha shouts to Shay, all smiles... Can’t help herself:

                                 KEISHA
                        It’s good to sound it out! Just to 
                        be sure we all understand!

           Ally looks to Mr. Daniels, who smiles really brightly at her, 
           so clearly proud. And she starts the smile back when...

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. It cuts through the chant.  
           Mr. Daniels moves to get it. Ushers in a STRIKING WOMAN, 
           early 30s, skirt and blouse, the one with Mrs. Oro earlier...

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Fantasticos. Madame President 
                        Nickerson. It’s my honor to 
                        introduce you to Miss Julie Gutie..

                                 ALLY
                        No!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALLY
                        We don’t want to meet her!
                             (to woman)
                        No offense to you, I’m sure you’re 
                        great but..I’ve just been elected. 
                        That means I get to speak for 
                        everyone here. We really want Mr. 
                        Daniels to stay. We aren’t the Room 
                        Five Fantasticos without him!
                             (she turns to the class)
                        Am I right? Tell her I’m right.

                                 KEISHA
                        She’s right!

                                 OLIVER
                        She’s right, right, right....

                                 JESSICA
                        She’s right! Wait, what’s 
                        happening? 

                                 ALBERT
                        That lady is our new teacher.

           Everybody goes QUIET. The WOMAN looks surprised, and... a bit 
           emotional. She turns to Mr. Daniels, shakes her head...

           And BEAMS. Gives him a SQUEEZE. And a really loving smile.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Miss Gutierrez is my girlfriend.

                                 ALBERT
                        Your girlfriend is the new teacher?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        There is no new teacher. My 
                        girlfriend Miss Gutierrez came 
                        cause she’s heard a lot about you.
                                 MISS GUTIERREZ
                        Yes. A lot!

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        And I wanted her here when I told 
                        you that they have just, in their 
                        infinite wisdom, decided to hire me 
                        to work with you for the rest of 
                        the year. So...I’m the new teacher.
                                 (to Ally)
                        That make sense? Not quite clear on 
                        what the confusion’s about.

                                 ALLY
                        It was about.. I. We thought there 
                        was... Yes! That makes sense! That 
                        absolutely completely makes sense!

           Oliver, bless him, RUNS RIGHT UP TO MR. DANIELS and gives him 
           a crazy big HUG, before HUGGING MISS GUTIERREZ TOO.

                                 ALBERT
                        Mr. Daniels! Mr. Daniels! Mr. D...

           Albert’s starting a chant? It’s a solo effort at first but...

                                 MAX
                        Mr. Daniels! Mr. Daniels! Mr. D...

           Max joining Albert? With DESK THUMPS. The class kicks in.

                                 CLASS
                        Mr. Daniels! Mr. Daniels!

           Mr. Daniels looks to his gal. She’s mighty impressed... And 
           he looks out over the kids, finds Ally. Smiles.

                                                              ABCUT TO:

           INT. MEGA-DRUG STORE - DAY

           Mrs. Nickerson moves down an aisle with a price marker. Hears 
           footsteps...no sneak-up this time. Ally’s sprinting to her.

                                 ALLY
                        They voted me class president. The 
                        kids in my class!  Not the teacher, 
                        just the kids. I’m president!

           Mrs. Nickerson just takes in her literally bouncing girl.
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        And Mr. Daniels is staying! And 
                        Albert and Keisha and I made sure 
                        that happened. And Oliver too. All 
                        my friends. We did it together!

           Ally stops. Her Mom’s price-marker has dropped to the floor. 

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Mom?

           And Mrs. Nickerson ENFOLDS her in a hug. Leans back.

                                 MRS. NICKERSON
                        Oh Ally, I’m so proud of you!

           More hug. Ally MELTS into it, eyes closed. Opens her eyes:  

           Two LITTLE KIDS are watching the hug. Until they notice the 
           GOLDFISH at eye level, grab bags...and hurry after their dad.

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON

           Dismissal time. Ally and SEVERAL OTHER KIDS, including 
           Jessica, sit at playground tables playing CHESS. Ally 
           considers the board. Makes her move...

                                 ALLY
                        Checkmate.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        How did I not see that?

           Yes, she’s playing Mr. Daniels. There’s a sign next to him 
           that says AFTER SCHOOL CHESS CLUB - ALL WELCOME! He smiles, 
           tooth dangling...and clicks it back in place.

                                 ALLY
                        You didn’t let me win, right?

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Ally. Hockey defenseman here. I’m 
                        not capable of letting someone win.
                        I think you’re just...

           He pulls out a sheet of paper, writes down a word. Slides it 
           over to her...  She silently mouths it... RAPS along.

                                 ALLY
                        Invisible? No..wait...

           Ally sounds it out again. Rapping. She looks at him. 
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Invincible.

           There’s a familiar THROATY RUMBLE. Ally sees the GTO pulling 
           up to park. Travis climbs out. He’s carrying a bag.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        There’s Travis. That’s Travis.

           He spots Ally, comes on to the yard, past The Minefield (who 
           sees he’s legit..and gives him the nod.) He hands Ally the 
           shopping bag; she looks into it...grins.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Travis, this is... The Goon.

           Mr. Daniels starts to think that through...as Travis puts his 
           hand out, a little nervously.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Mr. Daniels. Hi. Travis Nickerson. 
                        I’ve heard..a lot about you.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Hi Travis. I’ve heard a lot about 
                        you too. So, you’re working towards 
                        your general equivalency degree? 

           Travis looks to Ally, her gaze so...reassuring. He smiles.

                                 TRAVIS
                        I...am, yes.

                                 MR. DANIELS
                        Great. Pull up a bench. Let’s 
                        figure out how to start.

           Travis sits. And, Ally stands, takes in the school yard:

           Muldoon closes in on Oliver; Max & Marco wrestle each other.

           Shay, huddled with her Jessica-free entourage, hawks her 
           friendship bracelets, still at it. Ever at it.

           Back to Travis and Mr. Daniels, deep in conversation.

           And, then Keisha by Albert...only she’s the one gathering 
           acorns.  Ally grabs her bag, walks across to them. 

                                 KEISHA
                        According to Albert, these were 
                        used as the basis for breadmaking 
                        for all sorts of tribes..
                                 ALBERT
                        The Chumash, the Iroquois, the 
                        Passamaquoddy, the Yurok, the...

                                 KEISHA
                        All sorts of tribes, Albert.
                             (re the bag)
                        What you got? You been baking?

                                 ALLY
                        I’ve been thinking. We should all 
                        wear something that shows we’re 
                        friends.

                                 KEISHA
                        Please tell me you’re not into 
                        bracelets now...

           Ally pulls out a STACK of BLACK T-SHIRTS. Hands Albert the 
           first. He shakes it out: FLINT.

                                 ALBERT
                        I love it! How did you know?

                                 ALLY
                        Flint is the perfect shirt for you, 
                        Albert. Not because of the hermit 
                        guy on the planet thing but because 
                        you take the strikes against you 
                        and turn them into something else, 
                        something useful.

           Ally hands Keisha a shirt. She unfolds it. It says STEEL.

                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        You’re Steel, Keisha, because 
                        you’re strong. Full of purpose.

           Keisha holds it up. It’s actually nicely fitted. Grins: Cool.

           Ally shakes out the last shirt. It says FLAMMABLE MATERIAL.

                                 KEISHA
                        Flammable Material?

                                 ALLY
                        Well...I do flare up pretty easy. 
                        But when I catch the sparks that 
                        you two make, I kinda feel like...

           She flips the shirt over. There, descended from her notebook 
           sketch, is a beautiful graphic of a BLOSSOM OF FLAME..
                                 ALLY (CONT'D)
                        Together we can set the world on 
                        fire!

           Keisha and Albert, flip their shirts: - there it is: Ally’s 
           awesome graphic. They all pull their shirts on...and stand 
           there in a half circle, studying each other. Flame Blossoms.

                                 SHAY
                        Nice loser shirts! 

           Ally looks across to where Shay and crew sit, leering.

                                 ALLY
                        Not everyone is going to get it.

           Albert takes in his friends, adjusts his shirt, SMILES BIG.

                                 ALBERT
                        I get it.

                                 KEISHA
                        I get it too.

           Ally throws an arm around Keisha and another - as much as 
           it’ll reach - around Albert.

           A little wall of fire now, the three of them together: 
           They’re already starting to GLOW.
