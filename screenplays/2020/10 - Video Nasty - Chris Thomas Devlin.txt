          PLEASE REWIND
           EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Our heavy breath fills our MASK as we stare at THE HOUSE 
           across the street.

           It’s a cookie-cutter AMERICAN CRAFTSMAN that looks like every 
           other house on the block.

           But there is something special about this house - a reason 
           this is the one we’re standing outside.

           This is where THE GIRL (15) lives.

           The girl watching TV in the living room - the one we can see 
           through the window. 

           We move across the street and peer through the glass.

           She’s bathed in the glow of the TV sipping FRUIT PUNCH that 
           stains her lip, and utterly oblivious to our presence until - 

           A CAT YOWLS and runs from the bushes.

           Her head whips around. 

           We duck below the window as she comes to look outside.

           But she doesn’t see us. 

           So she goes back. We stand up just in time to catch her turn 
           off the TV. A shiver runs down her spine...

           She walks out of the living room and we follow her onto -

           THE STOOP

           We look inside the frosted window by the FRONT DOOR and see 
           The Girl’s silhouette travel up the stairs.

           Once she’s out of sight, we look down at our YELLOW GLOVE - 
           at the blood-soaked HOUSE KEY held within our palm.

           We unlock the door and step into -

           THE FOYER

           We quietly close the door behind us - no reason to make the 
           neighbors suspicious - and listen.

           We hear her upstairs. She’s singing to herself a sweet, 
           gentle melody.
           We ascend the stairs slowly, the sound of her voice acting as 
           our siren song, until we reach -

           THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           At the end of the hall, we see the LIGHT glowing through the 
           crack in her BEDROOM DOOR. 

           Her song grows louder with every step we take.

           We look down at the KNIFE in our hand, our gloved thumb 
           rubbing the fat end of the blade in anticipation, until we 
           reach -

           HER BEDROOM

           We push open the door and see her sitting at her VANITY, 
           brushing her hair in front of the MIRROR.

           Her song hides the groan of the floorboards as we get closer, 
           and closer, and closer...

           We gaze upon our BLADE as we raise it high into the air.

           But when we look back down, we see it -

           Her MIRROR.

           We see OURSELVES peering out from behind our RUBBER MASK.

           Then we come to a horrifying realization.

           The Girl has NO REFLECTION.

           At that moment, she WHIPS AROUND.

           She opens her gaping maw to reveal her vicious VAMPIRE FANGS.

           She POUNCES. We FALL backwards onto the floor.

           She bites into our THROAT.

           We see our BLOOD SPRAY across the room.

           It’s the last thing we see before we die...

                                         THE END

           INT. THE OLD BEDROOM - DAY

           SHAWN WRIGHT (14) sits on the floor in front of his LAPTOP in 
           a bedroom that’s decorated like the floor of a Horror 
           convention.

           Between the POSTERS for Carpenter and Hooper flicks, NECA 
           action figures, Stephen King BOOKS - it’s a horror fan’s 
           dream.

           Or it used to be, anyway. Now, half of his stuff has been 
           packed into MOVING BOXES.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Shawn!

           The door swings open and his sister LENA (15) steps inside. 
           She’s the same girl from the video, minus the fangs.

                                 LENA
                        You haven’t finished packing?

                                 SHAWN
                        I was feeling nostalgic. 

           She walks inside and checks the screen.

                                 LENA
                        Ah, Girls Suck - our masterpiece.

                                 SHAWN
                        I always preferred Mr. Buzzkill.

                                 LENA
                        That’s because you kill me in that 
                        one.

           She slams the clamshell closed.

                                 SHAWN
                        Hey--

                                 LENA
                        Mom’s going to kill you when she 
                        finds out you’re not done.
                                 SHAWN
                        At least if I’m dead, I won’t have 
                        to move to Pennsylvania.

           She pretends to hack him with a RUBBER CLEAVER.

                                 LENA
                        Holdenfield won’t be that bad.

           She starts throwing more stuff into boxes - knife gloves, 
           hockey masks, a Good Guy doll.

                                 LENA
                        Did you know a bunch of kids there 
                        went missing in the 80s? No one 
                        knows what happened to them. Just 
                        vanished.

                                 SHAWN
                        Is that supposed to sell me?

                                 LENA
                        Of course. We love that spooky 
                        shit.

           Shawn goes to the window and looks outside at the bustling 
           CITY LIFE happening outside their BROWNSTONE.

                                 SHAWN
                        I just don’t understand why things 
                        have to change.

           Lena takes a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH off Shawn’s shelf.

                                 LENA
                        Yes you do.

           She gazes at the image of the two of them as KIDS meeting 
           ROBERT ENGLUND. Standing next to them is their smiling DAD. 
           She places it gently in a box.

                                 LENA
                        Because Mom can’t afford this place  
                        by herself.

           She unplugs the dusty VCR. When Shawn hears the sound of a 
           TRASH BAG, he whips around.

                                 SHAWN
                        What are you doing?
                                 LENA
                        ...Throwing it out?

                                 SHAWN
                        No you’re not.

           He darts over and rips it from her grip.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn. It’s ancient.

                                 SHAWN
                        Yeah. That means it’s better. A lot 
                        of movies only exist on VHS.

                                 LENA
                        You can’t take everything with you.

                                 SHAWN
                        Why not? Why does everything have 
                        to be different now?

           She sees this is about more than a tape player.

                                 LENA
                        I know. I’m scared, too.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’ve seen every horror movie ever 
                        made. I’m not scared.

                                 LENA
                        Nothing important is going to 
                        change. You’ll still have Mom. 
                        You’ll still have me. We’ll still 
                        make popcorn and watch gory movies.

                                 SHAWN
                        ...Promise?

                                 LENA
                        Promise.

           She takes the VCR from his hand.

                                 LENA
                        I won’t leave you behind.

           She tosses the VCR into the box and we SMASH to -

           INT. THE BUS - DAY

           Shawn sits alone on the bus listening to the Halloween 
           soundtrack on a WALKMAN.

           He looks out the window at the SUBURBS.

           He’s still not used to this.

                                    THREE MONTHS LATER

           He twists around in his seat and looks past the rows of ROWDY 
           KIDS to see Lena sitting in the BACK.

           She’s with another girl - IZZY (16). 

           Izzy is cool. Much cooler than Shawn.

           Lena doesn’t notice him staring at her. Or she’s ignoring 
           him. He can never tell anymore.

           The truth is she just hasn’t noticed. She has other things on 
           her mind.

           Namely Izzy, who is resting her head on Lena’s shoulder.

           They’re sharing a pair of AIRPODS.

                                 IZZY
                        This is my favorite part.

           Lena tries to listen but she keeps getting distracted by the 
           smell of Izzy’s hair.

           When the song ends, Izzy sits up and peels off the 
           headphones.

                                 IZZY
                        What did you think?

           Lena stares into her eager eyes.

                                 LENA
                        Beautiful.
                             (but about the song)
                                 LENA (CONT'D)
                                 LENA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t really know much about 
                        music but...it’s like it’s happy 
                        and sad and familiar yet totally 
                        new all at the same time. How does 
                        she do that?

                                 IZZY
                        She’s bouncing between the fourth 
                        and the minor sixth so you’re not 
                        sure where you are emotionally but 
                        then she builds you up with the pre-
                        chorus and hits you with the drop 
                        and then the chorus and you get the 
                        lift - the catharsis you’ve been 
                        craving. She’s a genius.

                                 LENA
                        Amazing.

                                 IZZY
                        She’s going to play at The Factory. 
                        It’s, like, the only venue in town 
                        but it’s cool. Her show’s at the 
                        end of the month - we should go 
                        together.

                                 LENA
                        Really?

                                 IZZY
                        Of course. This town can be kind of 
                        lame but it has its charms if you 
                        have the right person to show you 
                        around.

                                 LENA
                        Yeah, that’d be awesome.

           She blushes. She can’t help it.

           Shawn can see there’s no way she’s going to notice him.

           But as he’s about to turn around, a DOUCHEBAG stands up and 
           blocks his sight.

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                        Don’t look at me.

           Shit

           Shawn turns back around and sinks into his seat, trying to 
           appear as inconspicuous as possible. It doesn’t work.
           The Douchebag jumps into the seat BEHIND Shawn and looms over 
           him. Shawn can feel his Flaming Hot Cheeto breath on the back 
           of his neck.

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                        I said don’t look at me.

           Shawn tries to disassociate by turning up his music.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m not. 

           He glances up to see all the kids waiting to see what will 
           happen next. A bunch are filming with their CELL PHONES.

           The Douchebag grabs the wire of Shawn’s HEADPHONES and rips 
           the walkman from his hands.

                                 SHAWN
                        Hey!

           He hits a button and a CASSETTE pops out.

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                        What the fuck is this?

           Before Shawn can respond, The Douchebag grabs Shawn’s 
           BACKPACK.

                                 DOUCHEBAG
                        What other weird-ass shit do you 
                        have in here?

                                 SHAWN
                        Stop!

           He tries to grab it back but it’s too late - The Douchebag is 
           already digging around inside.

           Shawn is forced to watch helplessly as The Douchebag pulls 
           out a bottle of FAKE BLOOD.

           Without missing a beat, he squeezes the tube and SPRAYS Shawn 
           in the face to an eruption of laughter.

           The commotion up front finally alerts Lena.  She bolts to her 
           feet.

                                 LENA
                        Hey--

           The bus comes to a stop.
           Shawn finally wrenches his bag away from The Douchebag and 
           rushes to the exit.

           EXT. THE SUBURBS - DAY

           Shawn bounds down the steps and races home. A moment later, 
           Lena follows him out.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn, wait--

           But he’s already out of earshot. She sighs. 

           She follows Shawn and the two walk home a full block apart, 
           past rows of modest houses.

           They pass an ABANDONED HOUSE littered with generations of 
           MISSING PERSON SIGNS.

           A strong GUST of wind blows some of the flyers loose. One 
           hits Shawn in the face, sticking to the blood.

           He rips it off and inspects it.

                               MISSING SINCE JUNE 30TH 1986

           He tries and fails to get it off his fingers all the way 
           home.

           INT. THE KITCHEN - EVENING

           Lena listens to music from her airpods and grins as she texts 
           on her phone.

           Shawn - his face still stained with traces of blood - stares 
           at her as he moves the food around on his plate. Finally -

                                 SHAWN
                        What’s so funny?

           But she doesn’t hear him. 

                                 SHAWN
                        Lena.

           She takes a pod out.

                                 SHAWN
                        What’s funny?
                                 LENA
                        Nothing.

           But obviously that’s bullshit because she gets another text 
           and immediately cracks up.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Fuck!

           They both look to their harried MOM storming into the room 
           holding her PHONE.

                                 SHAWN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MOM
                        The company’s sending me to 
                        Virginia for a mandatory team 
                        building retreat.

                                 LENA
                        That sucks.

                                 MOM
                        Yeah. It does. Anyway. That woman 
                        from down the street is going to 
                        stay here while I’m gone.

                           SHAWN
                                                          LENA
           Miss Kerrigan?
                                              Fuck no.

                                 MOM
                        Hey.

                                 LENA
                        A baby sitter? I’m sixteen.

                                 SHAWN
                        So was Allison Quigley.

           Lena shoots him daggers.

                                 LENA
                        You’re not helping.

                                 SHAWN
                        Just saying...

                                 MOM
                        He’s right. Bradley Clarke, Joanne 
                        Merchant--
                                 LENA
                        So because a few kids went missing - 
                        in the 80s - I need off-brand 
                        Shelly Winters to surveil my every 
                        move?

                                 MOM
                        Not risking it, kiddo.

                                 LENA
                        I’ll stay at Izzy’s.

                                 MOM
                        What about your brother?

                                 LENA
                        He can stay at a friend’s house.

                                 SHAWN
                        Whose?

           Silence.

                                 MOM
                        You’re getting a baby sitter.

           INT. THE HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lena stands in the dark outside a door covered in Fright Rag 
           STICKERS. She knocks.

                                 SHAWN (O.C.)
                        ...What?

                                 LENA
                        Can I come in?

           After a pregnant silence -

                                 SHAWN
                        It’s open.

           She opens the door to -

           SHAWN’S NEW ROOM

           It’s practically empty. He still can’t bring himself to 
           unpack.

           Shawn is on his bed watching a MOVIE on his old TV. 
                                 LENA
                        Hey.

           She steps inside.

                                 LENA
                        Dream Warriors again?

                                 SHAWN
                        It’s my favorite.

                                 LENA
                        You’ve seen it a hundred times.

           Oh, it’s this part.

                           SHAWN
                                                          LENA
           “Welcome to prime time, 
           bitch.”
                                              “Welcome to prime time, 
                                              bitch.”

                                 SHAWN
                        Exactly. No matter how many times I 
                        watch it, it never changes. 

           She chooses her next words carefully.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry. About today. The bus...
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t realize what was 
                        happening.

           He shrugs.

                                 SHAWN
                        You were talking to that girl. I 
                        get it.

           She sits on the edge of his bed.

                                 LENA
                        Sucks about the baby sitter.

                                 SHAWN
                        Doesn’t affect my weekend either 
                        way.

           All right. Time for an olive branch.

                                 LENA
                        Maybe since we’re stuck together, 
                        we can watch a movie or something. 
           Shawn hits pause. That’s intriguing.

                                 SHAWN
                        Really? You promise?

                                 LENA
                        I’ll make popcorn the way you like 
                        it. Olive oil and Old Bay.

           He sits up.

                                 SHAWN
                        Camp-Slasher marathon. 
                        Sleepaway Camp, The Burning, Madman-

                                 LENA
                        Just one.

                                 SHAWN
                        Deal.

           She glances at the movie.

                                 LENA
                        Preferably one we haven’t seen 
                        before.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’ll find it.

           She gets up and goes to the door.

                                 LENA
                        We cool?

           He hits play on his movie. She’ll take it.

           She closes the door behind her. He grins. 

           INT. THE CLASSROOM - DAY

           The TEACHER casually locks the door and turns out the lights.

                                 TEACHER
                        You know the drill, guys. 
                        Under your desks. No talking.

           Shawn and the other students all crawl under their desks.

           Shawn surveys his peers. Every one of them is on their phone - 
           texting, tik-toking, instagramming, snapping. 
           He rolls his eyes as he pulls a dog-eared Clive Barker BOOK 
           from his bag and starts to read.

           But he gradually becomes aware of the giggling happening 
           around him. He sinks. He knows that sound well. 

           He looks up to see some kids looking in his direction. Then 
           he feels a BUZZING in his pocket. He pulls out his phone.

           It’s a text - a PICTURE of Shawn taken a moment ago under the 
           words “FOUND THE SCHOOL SHOOTER”

           His ears go hot and he shoves the phone back in his pocket, 
           swallowing the lump in his throat.

           INT. THE SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Shawn keeps his head in his locker, a brief respite from the 
           day.

           Eventually he takes out his backpack and closes his locker. 
           It’s the only one with insults carved into its surface.

           EXT. THE SCHOOL - DAY

           Shawn trudges to the row of idling BUSSES, one of the last to 
           arrive.

           He goes to his BUS and looks at the KIDS in the window. 
           The ones who hate him.

           And he sees Lena in the back, too distracted by Izzy to 
           protect him.

           He feels another BUZZ in his pocket. He looks at his phone. 
           More abuse. 

           So with a hearty “Fuck this,” he hurls his phone at the 
           ground and turns around and walks away. 

           The bus pulls away without Lena ever realizing her brother 
           isn’t on it.

           EXT. THE OLD GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Shawn takes a shortcut home through the untamed grass of a 
           forgotten CEMETERY.

           After navigating through the tombstones, he emerges onto a 
           neglected road when he notices something up ahead. 
           An empty parking lot. And a STRIP MALL.

           EXT. THE STRIP MALL

           Shawn looks up at the SIGN that looms over the parking lot 
           and reads the names of the stores located here.

           Only one catches his attention:

                                       VIDEO CASTLE

           A grin spreads across his face and he speeds past a ROW of 
           STORES before arriving at the last one on the left, VIDEO 
           CASTLE.

           But when he gets there, his shoulders sink - it’s obviously 
           CLOSED.

           He peers inside its dark windows when he hears a CAW. He 
           looks up to see a CROW perched upon the sign.

           It caws again, almost as if it’s warning him. 

           He looks back at the store and furrows his brow. 

           The lights are ON. A sign on the door says OPEN.

           He hadn’t noticed that before, but Shawn knows a plot 
           development when he sees one.

           So he goes through its doors.

           INT. VIDEO CASTLE - DAY

           Shawn is immediately confronted by the smell of stale carpet 
           and decaying plastic. 

           There’s no one in here. Maybe it is closed.

                                 SHAWN
                        Hello?

           He clocks the sun-faded POSTERS, the expired snacks, and the 
           SHELVES of DVDs.

           He checks the SIGNS that hang from the ceiling - ACTION, 
           DRAMA, COMEDY, and -

                                 SHAWN
                        Horror.
           He navigates the rows of shelves until he reaches the HORROR 
           SECTION. He surveys the inventory.

           Abominable Dr. Phibes, Alice Sweet Alice, American Werewolf 
           in London, Amityville Horror, April Fools Day, Army of 
           Darkness, Audition, Audrey Rose--

                                 BARBARA (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           Shawn jumps out of his skin. He turns to see, standing at the 
           end of the aisle -

           BARBARA (60s). Ghost white hair and a face like a Renaissance  
           painting. Shawn swallows.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m sorry, I wasn’t sure if...
                        Are you open?

                                 BARBARA
                        Difficult to say. No one comes in 
                        anymore, but I insist on keeping 
                        the lights on. Creature of habit.

           She strolls closer.

                                 BARBARA
                        Back in the 80s, there were so many 
                        people in here on a Friday night, 
                        one could barely move.

           Shawn shakes his head.

                                 SHAWN
                        Things were better then. The 
                        movies. The people...

                                 BARBARA
                        But things change, don’t they?

                                 SHAWN
                        Yeah. I was born in the wrong era.

                                 BARBARA
                        Is that so?

           She towers over him. He clears his throat.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m looking for a scary movie.
                                 BARBARA
                        You’ve come to the right place.

           Shawn looks over the selection.

                                 SHAWN
                        Is this all you have?

                                 BARBARA
                        This is the pinnacle of what the 
                        genre has to offer.

                                 SHAWN
                        You have the obvious ones, sure, 
                        but I’m trying to impress someone. 
                        I need something she’s never seen.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m afraid what you see is what we 
                        have.

           Shawn sinks.

                                 SHAWN
                        All right, well...thanks anyway.

           Barbara watches him move towards the doors.

                                 BARBARA
                        I do have some more obscure titles 
                        not on display.

           Shawn turns back around.

                                 BARBARA
                        Unfortunately, they can only be 
                        played on an older device.

           Shawn perks up.

                                 SHAWN
                        ...Like a VCR?

           INT. THE BACK OFFICE - DAY

           Shawn hovers in the doorway as Barbara unlocks a DOOR in the 
           FLOOR.

                                 BARBARA
                        Years ago, there were films deemed 
                        too horrific for public 
                        consumption.
           She opens the door and reaches deep inside.

                                 BARBARA
                        Cinema so filled to the brim with 
                        murder, mayhem, and mutilation that 
                        their mere existence was considered 
                        a crime against humanity.

           She comes back with a stack of VIDEO TAPES.

                                 BARBARA
                        They were called Video Nasties.

           INT. VIDEO CASTLE, FRONT COUNTER - DAY

           Shawn stands before the register appraising the stack of 
           tapes. His eyes run down the titles:

           Slaughter Fodder, The Heinous, Piccolo Olocausto, God Can’t 
           Save You, etc.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’ve never heard of any of these.

                                 BARBARA
                        Collector’s items. Traded on the 
                        black market, known only to true 
                        aficionados of the morbid and the 
                        macabre. Some of these are the only 
                        bootlegs left in existence.

           He takes one off the top of the stack.

                                 SHAWN
                        How They Bleed.

           He flips it over and reads the back.

                                 SHAWN
                        “One night in a sleepy suburb, a 
                        group of unsuspecting teenagers are 
                        terrorized by an unstoppable 
                        killer.”
                             (beat)
                        A slasher?

                                 BARBARA
                        Indeed.
                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t know. We’ve seen Faces of 
                        Death, Cannibal Ferox, and Mr. 
                        Hands - I doubt a maniac with a 
                        mask and a machete is going to get 
                        our hearts pounding.

                                 BARBARA
                        I promise you’ve never seen 
                        anything like this before. 

           She goes to take it back.

                                 BARBARA
                        But if you’re too frightened--

                                 SHAWN
                        I didn’t say that.

           He scrutinizes the cover - a blood-drenched SICKLE.

                                 SHAWN
                        She defintely has not seen this...

           He pulls a wad of dollars from his pocket.

                                 SHAWN
                        Do I need to open an account?

           She opens the register.

                                 BARBARA
                        I trust you’ll return.

           EXT. VIDEO CASTLE - DAY

           Shawn grips the tape tight in his hand as he leaves Video 
           Castle behind him.

           From INSIDE the store, watching him from the window, Barbara 
           is laughing like a mad woman.

           INT. THE FOYER - DAY

           Shawn opens the front door and is immediately greeted by his 
           Mom’s barely concealed rage.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Hello Kerrigan. Yeah, it’s me 
                        again. Please answer your fucking 
                        phone.
           THE KITCHEN

           Shawn walks into the kitchen to see his Mom on the phone, 
           pacing back and forth by her luggage, and -

           Lena sitting on the counter top, eating an apple and grinning 
           from ear to ear.

                                 SHAWN
                        What’s happening?

                                 LENA
                        Kerrigan isn’t coming.

                                 SHAWN
                        Really?

                                 MOM
                        She texted me. Two hours before my 
                        plane leaves, she texts me.
                        “Can’t make it - cat is sick.”
                             (beat)
                        Hope it goes Cujo on her fucking 
                        ass...

           HONK

                                 MOM
                        Great. My car is here.

           She takes a breath. Settles down.

                                 MOM
                        Okay...change of plan. 
                        No baby sitter.

           The kids try not to celebrate too obviously.

                                 MOM
                        Lena - you are in charge. That 
                        means you do not leave this house. 
                        You do not have anyone over. 
                        You don’t consume anything that 
                        requires Federal identification. 
                        You text me a picture of yourselves 
                        together on the hour every hour, 
                        and you do not answer the door to 
                        strangers. Got it?

                                 LENA
                        Yes mother dearest.

           HONK HONK HOOOOOONNNNKKKK
                                 MOM
                        ALL RIGHT!

           Mom grabs her bag.

                                 MOM
                        Don’t make me regret this.

           She quickly hugs them both and rushes out the door. And then 
           there were two.

                                 LENA
                        YES!!!

           Lena hops off the counter and dances to herself. Shawn grins 
           and proudly holds out the tape.

                                 SHAWN
                        Look what I got--

           She pulls out her phone and marches down the hall and up the 
           stairs.

           Shawn sinks. He looks down at the tape, at the bloody sickle, 
           and nods. 

           This is going to work. He’s going to win his sister back.

                                 IZZY (PRE-LAP)
                        This is a phenomenal development.

           INT. LENA’S ROOM - DAY

           Lena wanders her room speaking to Izzy on Facetime.

                                 LENA
                        Game changer.

                                 IZZY (FACETIME)
                        And perfect timing. Word around the 
                        campfire is that Nate Evan’s older 
                        brother gave him an unused keg from 
                        his frat. He’s having people over 
                        at nine. Want to be my date?

                                 LENA
                        Oh my God, yes--

           But then she stops in her tracks. 
                                 LENA
                        Wait. Actually...
                             (sigh)
                        I don’t think I can leave Shawn.

                                 IZZY (FACETIME)
                        Oh. Oh yeah...
                             (beat)
                        Well...maybe I could come over?

           Yes

                                 LENA
                        I don’t want you to miss the party 
                        because of me.

                                 IZZY (FACETIME)
                        I mean, could I even have fun if 
                        you weren’t there? Who are we 
                        kidding?

           Lena blushes.

                                 LENA
                        Well yeah...if we’re being 
                        honest...

                                 IZZY (FACETIME)
                        Just us girls?

           Lena bites her lip.

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM - EVENING

           Shawn searches through one of the moving boxes he still 
           hasn’t unpacked until he finds the VCR.

           With the tape player tucked under one arm and the movie held 
           in the other, he bounds out of the room and down the stairs.

           INT. THE KITCHEN - EVENING

           Shawn follows the smell of butter into the kitchen.

           He sees Lena adding olive oil and Old Bay to a bowl of 
           POPCORN - just the way he likes it. Perfect. 

                                 SHAWN
                        Ready for the movie?
                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        What are we watching?

           Shawn spins around to see, to his abject horror, IZZY holding 
           a half-empty bottle of Merlot. He backs away.

                                 SHAWN
                        What is she doing here?

                                 LENA
                        She’s sleeping over.

           Lena walks by with the popcorn and Shawn watches as the two 
           of them go into -

           THE LIVING ROOM

           They sit down on the couch and start eating popcorn and 
           pouring wine. Shawn follows.

                                 SHAWN
                        Mom said no one else was allowed.

           Lena and Izzy exchange “Is he serious?” looks.

                                 LENA
                        ...Are you going to tell her?

                                 IZZY
                        Yeah Shawn, you know what they say 
                        about stitches and who’s liable to 
                        get ‘em.

           They’re already ganging up against him.

                                 SHAWN
                        You said we were going to watch a 
                        scary movie.

                                 IZZY
                        Oh...

                                 LENA
                        Yeah, sorry - Izzy doesn’t like 
                        horror movies.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m a wuss.

                                 LENA
                        Let’s pick something else.
           He grinds his teeth.

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t want to pick something 
                        else. I want to watch the movie you 
                        promised to watch with me.

                                 LENA
                        That was when we had a baby sitter. 
                        Things are different now.

           “Things are different now” - he snaps.

           Shawn KICKS the table, sending popcorn and wine spilling 
           across the floor.
                           IZZY
                                                          LENA
           Whoa dude!
                                              What the fuck, Shawn?!

           The girls jump up from the couch. The wine is all over the 
           carpet.

                                 LENA
                        What the Hell is wrong with you?

                                 SHAWN
                        You’ve changed and I hate the new 
                        you.

           Cool, so that’s how it is now.

                                 LENA
                        Yeah, I have changed. But you’re 
                        still the entitled little shit 
                        you’ve always been. Grow the fuck 
                        up. Stay the fuck away from me. Go 
                        watch your stupid ass movie and 
                        leave us alone.

           Shawn takes a survey of the chaos he’s created, then he turns 
           on his heel and storms away.

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM - EVENING

           Shawn punches his pillows until he’s exhausted all his 
           energy.

           He focuses his attention instead on the VIDEO TAPE in the 
           VCR.

           When he’s finally calmed down enough, he crawls across the 
           floor -
           And PRESSES the TAPE inside the VCR. 

           The screen goes BLACK. TRACKING LINES briefly fill the image 
           before dispersing. And then... 

                                        VIDEO TAPE

           INT. THE MORGUE

           A WOMAN lies DEAD within an open casket. Her skin is waxen, 
           her eyes are shut -

           And her hands are placed over her PREGNANT BELLY.

           The lid is closed and NAILED SHUT.

           INT. PAUPER’S GRAVEYARD - MORNING

           The cheap pine coffin lies six feet under the earth in a 
           freshly dug HOLE.

                                 GRAVE DIGGER (O.C.)
                        Who was she?

           Standing above the hole is a boney, gnarled GRAVE DIGGER and 
           an ashen-white PRIEST.

                                 PRIEST
                        No one knows. A vagabond. A drunk. 
                        A prostitute. Another pitiful soul 
                        buried in an unnamed grave. Such a 
                        tragedy.

           The Priest walks off.

                                 PRIEST (O.C.)
                        She was with child.

           The Grave Digger shakes his head, then picks up his shovel 
           and throws a pile of DIRT atop the coffin.

                                                                      LATER

           A layer of soil covers the surface of the coffin, and the 
           Grave Digger keeps adding more.

           But as he digs his shovel into the pile of dirt, he HEARS 
           something - a CRYING BABY.

           He surveys the foggy graveyard in search of the source of the 
           wailing, but he sees nothing and no one.
           That’s when he realizes it’s coming from INSIDE the coffin.

           When his mind finally processes this, he JUMPS into the grave 
           and frantically brushes aside the dirt.

           He uses his shovel to pry open the lid and cast it aside, 
           revealing the woman’s corpse. And between her legs -

           A NEWBORN

                                 GRAVE DIGGER
                        My God...

           He cuts the umbilical cord with the edge of his shovel then 
           picks up the baby and cradles it to his chest.

                                 GRAVE DIGGER
                        This is a miracle.

           No. A plague.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (PRE-LAP)
                        He’s been with us for 21 years.

           INT. ASYLUM HALLWAY - DAY

           An ADMINISTRATOR and a NURSE walk side-by-side, their 
           footsteps echoing in the cavernous hall.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        In all that time, he’s never spoken 
                        a word to anyone. We used to think 
                        him an idiot, but in his way, he 
                        displays a remarkable intelligence. 
                        Or rather...cunning.

                                 NURSE
                        But if he isn’t able to 
                        communicate, and he’s never lived 
                        on his own, why is the hospital 
                        releasing him?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        “The Two Bees” - budgets and 
                        bureaucracy.

                                 NURSE
                        But is he...dangerous?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        No. No, we have no reason to 
                        believe he would ever hurt a soul.
           But he doesn’t sound entirely convinced himself as they reach 
           a closed DOOR. 

           He fumbles with his keys and unlocks the door to -

           THE ROOM

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        There he is.

           They stand in the doorway and see - sitting on a thin cot by 
           the window a hulking behemoth. 

           THE KILLER

           He sits on the edge of his bed, his head hidden below his 
           massive shoulders. 

           Neither the Nurse nor Administrator see the RAT in his grip, 
           blood oozing from its mouth as he crushes its bones.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        In only a matter of hours, our dear 
                        boy will be set free into the 
                        world. He’ll be amongst people. 
                        He’ll learn how they speak, how 
                        they dress, how they love, and...

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Shawn’s eyes glow in the light of the TV, hypnotized by 
           droning SYNTHS.

           This is what he needed. This is medicine. This is heroin.

                                 LENA (PRE-LAP)
                        He’s such a shit.

           INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           While Izzy collects popcorn off the floor, Lena distributes 
           baking powder on the wine stain.

                                 LENA
                        The audacity. The unmitigated gall.
                                 IZZY
                        He just wanted to hang out with his 
                        sister...

           Lena pours club soda over the baking powder.

                                 LENA
                        He’s an immature little ass who 
                        would rather live in the past than 
                        deal with reality.

                                 IZZY
                        He sure likes his scary movies.

           She goes to the DVD collection.

                                 IZZY
                        I guess I never understood why 
                        anyone would want to be scared

                                 LENA
                        Really? You don’t think it’s fun?

                                 IZZY
                        When I was a kid, my cousin gave me 
                        her old Furby. Do you remember 
                        those? The toys with the giant eyes 
                        that would randomly speak in 
                        tongues. I still have PTSD from all 
                        the times it woke me up in the 
                        middle of the night and have 
                        constant nightmares that it’s 
                        watching me sleep.
                             (beat)
                        Not once did I find that experience 
                        fun.

           She pulls the Halloween box set off the shelf.

                                 IZZY
                        Is this Jason?

                                 LENA
                        No. Halloween is Michael Meyers. He 
                        kills baby sitters. Jason is Friday 
                        the 13th and he mostly sticks to 
                        camp counselors.

                                 IZZY
                        And what about Freddy?
                                 LENA
                        Haunts the nightmares of the 
                        children of Elm Street.
                             (beat)
                        Those were always our favorite, 
                        especially the third one - Dream 
                        Warriors. That’s when the kids 
                        learn they can manipulate the dream 
                        world to fight back. 
                        Change into whatever they want to 
                        be.

           Izzy watches amazed as Lena pats at the carpet with a paper 
           towel, lifting the stain and leaving it clean underneath.

                                 IZZY
                        Wow. You’re good at that.

                                 LENA
                        I’ve had a lot of practice getting 
                        bloodstains out of fabric.

                                 IZZY
                        Um...

                                 LENA
                        Fake blood.
                             (beat)
                        Back in the city, Shawn and I would 
                        make these dumb little movies that 
                        involved a lot of red dye and corn 
                        syrup. Proper cleanup became a 
                        survival method. 

           Izzy stands straight up.

                                 LENA
                        What?

                                 IZZY
                        You have to show me.

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Shawn has moved even closer to the TV as blood and gore spray 
           across the screen.

           He watches an OLD MAN take a SICKLE to the JUGULAR. 

           Then a hard CUT TO BLACK followed by New Wave music...
           INT. TEEN GIRL’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Steam fills the bathroom as a TEEN GIRL (16) dances to the 
           RADIO behind the frosted glass of her SHOWER.

           But suddenly the music cuts off.

                                 RADIO
                        Excuse the interruption. Police are 
                        reporting a double homicide at the 
                        Jenkins farm. The victims appear to 
                        have been murdered by what the 
                        authorities are describing as some 
                        sort of hooked blade--

           She reaches her arm out and turns OFF the radio. She then 
           grabs a TOWEL and emerges a moment later.

           She wipes the steam off the mirror revealing her FACE.

                                          PAUSE

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM

           Shawn narrows his eyes.

           He scrutinizes the girl’s expression as the tape gently 
           tremors. He inches closer, then grabs the tape’s BOX.

                                 SHAWN
                        Where have I seen you before...

           He reads the back of the box, but he sees no names of actors. 
           He bites his lip and continues to stare. Shrugs.

           He hits PLAY and watches her brush her wet hair, still trying 
           to place her face when -

           BOOM

           Both Shawn and The Teen Girl JUMP at the sound of THUNDER 
           outside their respective windows.

           Shawn clutches his chest - she does the same. He looks to the 
           window and sees the first drops of RAIN pelt the window.

           Meanwhile, The Teen Girl doesn’t see THE KILLER standing in 
           her yard holding a SICKLE.
           INT. LENA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lena and Izzy sit on the edge of Lena’s bed, her LAPTOP 
           between them.

           Izzy is watching Lena run screaming from what is clearly 
           Shawn in a WELDING MASK with two BUZZ SAWS for hands.

           Meanwhile, Lena is watching Izzy with growing anxiety.

                                 LENA
                        I know, it’s gross and stupid--

                                 IZZY
                        You are so effing cool.

           Lena breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 LENA
                        Really? You like it?

                                 IZZY
                        Are you kidding me? That was 
                        amazing!

           She blushes.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re such a good actress. And 
                        that was Shawn as Mr. Buzzkill, 
                        right?

                                 LENA
                        Yeah. I mean, we had to shoot it 
                        Lord of the Rings style so that 
                        he’d look taller.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m in awe of you. Literal awe. I 
                        had no idea you were so spooky. I 
                        just...I...

           The two stare deep into each other’s eyes.

           Then Lena KISSES her. It was only a matter of time.

           But after a moment, she pulls away.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 IZZY
                        Wow.
                                 LENA
                        I’m really sorry. That was so not 
                        cool. You didn’t consent to that. I 
                        just like you so much but I 
                        shouldn’t have...

           Lena takes Izzy by the chin.

                                 IZZY

                        It’s only the social event of the 
                        season.

           CLICK

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Dad! Get off the line.

           Silence

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Daddy?

                                 BRAD (PHONE)
                        What’s going--

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Shh.

           She listens and hears on the phone, ever so faintly...

           HEAVY BREATHING

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Brad, I’m going to call you back.

           She hangs up and looks out into her HALLWAY.

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Dad...?

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM

           Shawn watches The Teen Girl peer out into her hallway as the 
           music gets more ominous. He smiles. The good shit is coming.

           Outside - LIGHTNING FLASHES.

           INT. LENA’S ROOM

           Lena and Izzy awkwardly kiss atop Lena’s bed, neither sure 
           what to do with their hands, when -

           BOOOOOM
           They both jump. Izzy giggles, but Lena frowns at the RAIN 
           battering her window.

                                 LENA
                        Was it supposed to storm tonight?

                                 IZZY
                        Who cares?

           She pulls Lena’s face back to hers.

           INT. THE TEEN GIRL’S KITCHEN

           The Teen Girl - wearing the PINK DRESS - steps into her 
           KITCHEN.

           The first thing she sees is the PHONE hanging off the hook, 
           dangling back and forth. She looks to the LIVING ROOM. 

           Her DAD sits in his LAY-Z BOY in front of the football on TV.

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Daddy. The phone is off the hook.

           No response. The volume is loud. Maybe he didn’t hear her.

           So she hangs up the phone and marches into the -

           LIVING ROOM

           She reaches for the back of the chair.

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        You know if you sit too close to 
                        the TV, you’re going to give 
                        yourself a splitting headache.

           She SPINS the chair to find her Dad EVISCERATED - cut in half 
           groin to scalp.

           She SCREAMS as the last threads of sinew holding him together 
           TEAR and he SPLITS like a banana peel, his insides spilling 
           onto the floor.

           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM

           Shawn grabs his face with ecstatic disgust, marveling at the 
           ingenuity and skill that went into the makeup.
                                 SHAWN
                        Holy shit!

           INT. THE TEEN GIRL’S LIVING ROOM

           The Teen Girl’s face goes white as she backs away from her 
           dead father, her feet sloshing on the blood-soaked carpet.

           She turns and runs back into the -

           KITCHEN

           But as soon as she steps onto the sleek linoleum, she SLIPS 
           and falls to the ground.

           She scrambles and crawls to the wall where she grabs the 
           PHONE and dials.

                                 THE TEEN GIRL
                        Hello? Police? My name is Allison 
                        Quigley and my Dad has been--

           But the blade of a SICKLE cuts the phone cord. She looks up 
           and SCREAMS when -

                                 SHAWN (O.C.)
                        Wait.

           INT. THE BASEMENT

           Shawn leans forward, his brow furrowed as he watches her 
           narrowly escape the killer. He focuses on her SCREAMING FACE.

                                 SHAWN
                        No way.

           He jumps to his feet and runs to the TRASH CAN in the corner.

                                 SHAWN
                        No fucking way.

           He digs around inside until he pulls out the sticky, crumpled  
           MISSING PERSONS FLYER.

           His eyes go wide as he absorbs the sight of ALLISON QUIGLEY.

           And as The Teen Girl in the movie manages to escape her house 
           and run outside, he holds up the flyer and compares the 
           images.
                              IT’S. THE. SAME. FUCKING. GIRL.

           He grabs the remote as the camera gets a CLOSE UP of her 
           terrified face. As she opens her mouth to SCREAM -

           He hits PAUSE...

                           ...Only to hear a SCREAM coming from OUTSIDE.

           His heart drops into his stomach. He looks to the window. 
           There’s no way.

           INT. LENA’S ROOM

           Lena releases her lips from Izzy’s.

                                 LENA
                        Did you hear that?

                                 IZZY
                        No.

           Lena gets up off the bed.

                                 IZZY
                        No, come back--

                                 LENA
                        I heard someone screaming.

           She looks out the window but can’t see anything past the 
           rain.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s probably your brother’s movie.

                                 LENA
                        No. It was outside. A girl...

           She listens for more screaming, but all she hears is the rain 
           on the window. Until -

           BANG BANG BANG 

           The girls exchange frightened looks.

           BANG BANG BANG - the FRONT DOOR
           INT. SHAWN’S NEW BEDROOM

           Shawn holds his breath, only the hum of the TV and the patter 
           of rain on the window, waiting for -

           BANG BANG BANG

                                 ALLISON (O.S.)
                        Someone! Please! Help!

           INT. THE FOYER

           Lena and Izzy hold each other as they quietly creep down the 
           stairs, their eyes fixed on the door.

           They reach the bottom and Lena slowly, cautiously peers out 
           the WINDOW when -

                                 SHAWN (O.C.)
                        Don’t open it!

           They yelp and turn to see Shawn cowering at the top of the 
           stairs.

                                 LENA
                        There’s no one there...

           Just then - a GIRL bangs on a WINDOW in the KITCHEN.

                                 ALLISON
                        Help me!

           The girls scream. Shawn’s heart drops into his stomach.

           The Girl is in the dark, obscured by the rain, but she’s 
           wearing a PINK DRESS...

                                 LENA
                        It’s a girl!

           She runs into the kitchen and sees the girl in the dark - 
           soaked from the rain.

                                 SHAWN
                        Lena, stop--

           But she’s already gesturing to the back door.

                                 LENA
                        She needs help! 
           While Izzy runs after Lena, Shawn slowly descends the stairs, 
           his knees shaking, his fingers tightly gripping the banister.

           INT. THE LIVING ROOM

           Lena and Izzy rush to the BACK DOOR and unlock it, letting 
           inside the teen girl.

           Shawn turns the corner into the KITCHEN. 

           His legs almost buckle beneath him when he sees her.

           It’s ALLISON - Allison from the god damn fucking movie.

           To avoid fainting, he keeps repeating -

                                 SHAWN
                        It’s only a movie, it’s only a 
                        movie, it’s only a movie...

           Allison collapses into Lena’s arms, gasping for air between 
           heaving sobs.

                                 ALLISON
                        He...he killed him...he...he’s 
                        coming for me.

           Lena and Izzy exchange panicked looks. Lena immediately LOCKS 
           the door.

                                 IZZY
                        I’m calling 911.

           Izzy dials her phone while Lena clutches Allison and tries to 
           keep it together.

                                 LENA
                        Who is coming for you?

                                 ALLISON
                        The...the...the killer...

                                 IZZY
                        My call isn’t going through...
                             (checks her phone)
                        I don’t have any service!

           Lena checks her phone.

                                 LENA
                        Neither do I.
                                 IZZY
                        Do you have a land line?

                                 LENA
                        Is that a serious question?

                                 IZZY
                        What do we do?

           Allison breaks away from Izzy’s grip.

                                 ALLISON
                        We have to hide!

           She runs into -

           THE KITCHEN

           Shawn backs into the corner as Allison runs past him. They 
           make eye contact. It’s her. It’s really her in his house.

                                 ALLISON
                        We’re all going to die.

           She runs down the stairs into the BASEMENT. Shawn keeps 
           swallowing, trying to speak.

                                 SHAWN
                        Lena...

           But he can barely hear himself. He clears his throat.

                                 SHAWN
                             (louder)
                        Lena--

           BOOOOOOM - they all jump.

                                 LENA
                        Fuck!

           Lena and Izzy rush for the stairs leaving Shawn paralyzed in 
           the corner. 

           Alone in the kitchen, he watches the bloody handprints get 
           washed away in the rain, his entire world shifting beneath 
           his feet.

           He thinks, then runs UPSTAIRS.
           INT. THE BASEMENT

           Shawn carries the VCR down into the basement.

           He finds Lena and Izzy by Allison, clutching her knees and 
           rocking back and forth on the couch.

                                 LENA
                        You’re safe with us. We won’t let 
                        anyone hurt you.

           Shawn inches towards the TV.

                                 ALLISON
                        No...you didn’t see him...he’s 
                        coming for me. He’s coming for all 
                        of us.

           He plugs in the VCR.

                                 IZZY
                        What’s your name?

           Before she can answer -

                                 SHAWN (O.C.)
                        Allison.

           They turn to Shawn turning on the TV.

                                 SHAWN
                        Her name is Allison Quigley.

           He knows how crazy this is going to sound but -

                                 SHAWN
                        She’s the girl who went missing in 
                        the 80s.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn. This isn’t the time--

                                 ALLISON
                        Everyone calls me Ali.

           Lena and Izzy stare. Wait...wut?

                                 LENA
                        How did you--

                                 SHAWN
                        Look...
           He pushes the TAPE back into the VCR.

           Then - on the screen - A HOUSE. 

           But not just any house.

           THEIR HOUSE

           Shawn’s face falls. He wasn’t expecting that. Both Lena and 
           Izzy stand and approach the television.

                                 LENA
                        What is this?

           Shawn doesn’t have an answer.

                                 IZZY
                        That’s your house...

           Lightning flashes both on the screen and outside the window.

                                 IZZY
                        Is this live? How are you doing 
                        this?

                                 LENA
                        It’s a VHS...
                             (beat)
                        Wait...

           She grabs the remote and turns up the volume.

                                 LENA
                        Do you hear that?

           Yes. They hear HEAVY BREATHING. And it dawns on them...

                                 LENA
                        That’s a POV shot...

           On cue, the POV moves across the street onto the FRONT YARD.

           The blood drains from all their faces. They all look to each 
           other for answers that no one has.

           Allison buries her face in her knees and whimpers.

                                 ALLISON
                        He’s coming...

           Despite everything about this being utterly at odds with 
           their conception of the rational rules of the universe, no 
           one can deny it.
           He is coming.

           The POV moves onto the FRONT PORCH where Allison’s bloody 
           HAND PRINTS are still on the door.

                                 SHAWN
                        He’s outside...

           Izzy can’t handle this.

                                 LENA
                        Who is “he?” The movie? Are you 
                        saying the fucking movie is 
                        outside?

           They watch a dirty HAND try the door.

                                 SHAWN
                        Is it locked?

                                 LENA
                        I don’t remember...

           The hand pulls on the door but it is locked. The POV looks 
           through the window’s frosted glass.

                                 SHAWN
                        At least we know where he is...

           And because this is a horror movie, and all of the elements 
           are conspiring against them - LIGHTNING FLASHES outside, 
           THUNDER BELLOWS, and -

           THE POWER GOES OUT plunging them all into DARKNESS.

           The lights, the TV, their hope for survival - all GONE.

           All they can hear is their own hushed, panicked breathing.

           Lena turns on the FLASHLIGHT on her phone.

                                 ALLISON
                        He’s going to kill us, he’s going 
                        to kill us--

                                 LENA
                        Shh.

           But then - CRASH - the sound of BREAKING GLASS, then the 
           GROAN of floorboards above their heads.
                                 LENA
                        He’s inside the house.

                                 SHAWN
                        We have to get out of here.

                                 IZZY
                        Is there another way out?

                           SHAWN
                                                          LENA
           No--
                                              Yes! The--

                                 SHAWN
                             (remembers)
                        Cellar door!

           They turn their lights to the STAIRCASE in BACK. Allison 
           jumps to her feet and sprints for it. The others follow, but 
           as Shawn brings up the rear -

           LIGHTNING FLASHES and illuminates the window -

           And he sees SOMEONE walking by. 

                                 SHAWN
                        Wait!

           But it’s too late

                                            Allison runs up the stairs

                            UNLATCHES the LOCK

                PUSHES OPEN the doors

                                              And sees HIM

                                   THE KILLER

                    She sees his MASK

                                         Warped and distorted

             Obscured by tracking lines

                             Too terrifying for magnetic tape to process

             Before she can scream

                             He swings his SICKLE

                                                 And DECAPITATES her
           Her HEAD bounces down the steps

                                  It rolls to Lena’s feet

              And after a moment

                                      It looks up at her with wide eyes

                                 ALLISON’S HEAD
                        Don’t let him kill you.
                        If he kills you he has you forever.
                        Trapped on the tape for eternity. 
                        Dying over and over again.
                        And it always hurts, Lena.
                        It always hurts.

           She saw it. She heard it. But she can’t believe it.

           She looks up to see The Killer coming down the stairs, 
           stepping over Allison’s crumpled, headless body.

           Instinct kicks in. She turns and grabs Izzy by the hand and 
           RUNS, pulling Izzy behind her. 

           Shawn starts to follow but STOPS.

           He looks from the girls running upstairs, to the VCR, to The 
           Killer stalking towards him.

           He dives for VCR. He hits eject - no power. He reaches inside 
           and tries to pry the tape out - can’t do it.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Shawn!

           Fuck it - he yanks the power cord out of the wall and the aux 
           cables from the TV and takes the whole VCR.

           The tape player under his arm, he scrambles up the STAIRCASE 
           where Lena and Izzy are waiting at the top.

                                 IZZY
                        Hurry!

           With The Killer perilously close, he runs through the door 
           and falls into -

           THE KITCHEN

           Lena looks back to see The Killer right behind him.

           He SWINGS his sickle as she SLAMS the door closed.
           The blade PIERCES through the wood as she LOCKS the door. The 
           three watch in horror as he pulls back the sickle and then -

           SLAMS into the door over and over again.

           They back away as splinters fly through the air.

                                 LENA
                        Come on.

           Lena runs down the hall to the front door. Izzy follows.

                                 LENA
                        Now!

           Shawn starts for the door then realizes - The Killer has 
           stopped trying to break through.

                                 SHAWN
                        Shit.

           But he runs after them anyway.

           EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The three scramble out the front door and run across the lawn 
           but when they get to -

           THE STREET

                                 IZZY
                        Wait...

           They stop and survey their surroundings.

                                 IZZY
                        Where are we?

           They’re in their neighborhood, but it’s different. 

           The HOUSES are smaller. The CARS in the driveways are all 
           from the 70s and 80s. Palm trees line the street.

           But there’s no time to process this because--

                                 LENA
                        Guys!

           They look to see The Killer emerge from the cellar and stalk 
           across the lawn.
                                 LENA
                        Run!

           They sprint up the road, racing as fast as their legs will 
           take them.

           Shawn looks back at The Killer walking slowly behind them. 

           He turns back and keeps running, but when he looks behind 
           again -

           The Killer is still walking and still just as close.

           But then - a Godsend. HEADLIGHTS up ahead.

                                 IZZY
                        A car!

           The three frantically wave and yell at the approaching 1983 
           CHEVY MALIBU.

           But despite their cries, it SPEEDS towards them.

                                 LENA
                        STOP!

           Finally, the car hits the BRAKES and SCREECHES to a stop 
           right in front of them.

           The three circle the car and jump inside -

           THE CHEVY MALIBU

           BRAD (17) in his Letterman jacket watches helplessly as Shawn 
           jumps into the passenger seat and Lena and Izzy dive into the 
           back.

                                 BRAD
                        Hey, what the fuck you guys--

                                 SHAWN
                        Drive!

                                 BRAD
                        This isn’t a fucking taxi service--

           He sees The Killer.

                                 BRAD
                        Who’s that butthead?
           And then he sees his bloody sickle glowing in the headlights, 
           and he’s getting closer and closer.

                                 BRAD
                        Oh. Oh shit--

           Shawn hops over the center console and slams his foot on the 
           gas, shooting the car forward and HITTING The Killer.

           He ROLLS over the hood, CRACKS the windshield and tumbles 
           across the roof before the BLADE stabs through the ceiling 
           and -

           SLASHES Lena’s arm.

           She cries out in pain and looks back at The Killer’s 
           distorted face in the back window, still holding onto his 
           weapon.

           He winds up, PUNCHES through the glass, and GRABS -

                                 LENA
                        Izzy!

           The Killer’s filthy, meaty fingers grip Izzy’s shirt and he 
           WRENCHES her backward but -

           Lena grabs her and pulls her back. Shawn watches frozen as 
           Lena and Izzy try to pry his fingers away.

           While Brad’s distracted by their struggle in the rearview, he 
           drives through an intersection and -

           A STATION WAGON smashes into the TRUNK.

           The Malibu SPINS as The Killer is HURLED through the air.

           The car comes to a stop in the middle of the road.

           Once they’ve recovered, Lena holds Izzy tight.

                                 LENA
                        Are you okay? Are you okay?

           But Izzy focuses on Lena’s torn sleeve and bleeding arm.

                                 IZZY
                        Are you?

           Shawn and Brad focus on the Station Wagon through the 
           shattered windshield.

           After a moment, the DRIVER gets out. He looks at his totaled 
           car.
                                 DRIVER
                        What the Hell?!

           He turns to them.

                                 DRIVER
                        There was a god damn stop sign, 
                        asshole--

           The SICKLE slices through his waist. 

                                 BRAD
                        Oh my God!

           His torso topples onto the asphalt revealing The Killer 
           behind the geyser of blood erupting from the pelvis.

           Brad throws the car into reverse, accelerating backwards 
           before whipping the car around and careening forward.

           The kids look back through the broken window at the shower of 
           sparks caused by Brad’s dragging bumper and -

           The Killer standing in the distance, watching them go.

           They’re safe. For now.

           Brad keeps the pedal pressed to the floor, blowing through 
           intersections, getting as far from The Killer as possible.

                                 BRA
                        My Malibu! My beautiful fucking 
                        Malibu! You fuckers! It’s fucking 
                        fucked! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

           He turns to Shawn.

                                 BRAD
                        This is your fault. This is all 
                        your fucking fault.

           Shawn’s about to respond, but then he gets a good look at 
           Brad’s face and realizes -

                                 SHAWN
                        Oh shit. You’re Brad.

                                 BRAD
                        Yeah? So what?

                                 SHAWN
                        Bradley Clarke. You disappeared in 
           For a brief moment, Brad’s anger falters and a look of 
           recognition flashes across his face.

           But then he SLAMS on the breaks and sends everyone flying 
           forward.

                                 BRAD
                        Get out.

                                 IZZY
                        Excuse me?

           He doesn’t wait for them before climbing out of the car and 
           marching to the passenger side.

           He swings the door open, grabs Shawn by the shirt, and DRAGS 
           him out onto -

           THE STREET

           Shawn hits the asphalt.

                                 LENA
                        Hey!

           Lena and Izzy leap from the car.

                                 IZZY
                        You can’t leave us here!

           Brad makes his way to the driver’s seat.

                                 LENA
                        The killer--

                                 BRAD
                        Is not my god damn problem.

           He slams the door closed and peels out, dragging the bumper 
           behind him until it finally falls off.

           The three of them stand alone in the middle of the dark 
           street with no idea what to do next.

                                 LENA
                        Fuck!

           Shawn picks himself up as Lena paces back and forth.

                                 LENA
                        What the fuck, Shawn? What the 
                        fuck? What is happening?
                                 IZZY
                        And where are we? This is not your 
                        neighborhood. This is 
                        like...Pasadena.

           Shawn looks around at the neighborhood he doesn’t recognize, 
           trying to make sense of the senseless.

                                 SHAWN
                        We’re in the movie.

                                 LENA
                        What?

                                 SHAWN
                        The tape I rented from the video 
                        store. We’re in it. I don’t know 
                        how but we’re in the movie.

                                 LENA
                        No. Shut up. That isn’t possible.

                                 IZZY
                        It talked to you.

           She looks to Izzy - she can’t be buying this, right?

                                 IZZY
                        That poor girl’s head...it...it 
                        talked to you.
                             (beat)
                        That isn’t possible, but I saw it 
                        happen.

           Lena can’t deny that. But she’s going to try anyway.

                                 SHAWN
                        ...What did it say?

           She shakes her head, refuses to answer. Why should she? It 
           didn’t happen.

                        Lena.

           Lena swallows. Fine.

           Izzy looks to Shawn.

                        The girl. You said she’s one of the 
                        kids who disappeared in the 80s.

                        And that was really Bradley Clarke?

           He nods.

                                 SHAWN
                        They must have rented the same 
                        movie I did.

                        lot of red flags I’m only now 
                        recognizing in retrospect.

                                 LENA
                        So this is your fault.

                        happening, we can’t waste time 
                        fighting with each other. We need 
                        to get out of here without dying or 
                        we’ll be trapped here just like

                        know how we got in?

           It’s a good question, one neither has an answer for. But 
           after searching his brain, Shawn has a revelation.

           Lena and Izzy exchange looks. They don’t.

                                 LENA
                        Fine. Where is it?

           He opens his mouth, but then remembers his hands are empty 
           and his shoulders sink.

                                 SHAWN

                        Stop!

           And because it’s Izzy saying it, Lena listens. Izzy scans 
           their surroundings.

                                 IZZY
                        We need to go.

                        Go where?

                                 IZZY
                        Anywhere. Need I remind you there’s 
                        a killer out there in the dark.

           All three of them survey the dark neighborhood with no idea 
           which way to go first.

                                 SHAWN
                        At least it stopped raining.
           At that moment, the POWER comes back on, illuminating the 
           street lamps and house lights.

           As they blink their eyes, a strange sound gradually rises in 
           the distance.

                                 IZZY
                        What is that?

           It’s the faint sound of teenagers CHEERING followed by a 
           sudden blast of NEW WAVE MUSIC.

           Shawn’s eyes go wide.

                                 SHAWN
                        Joanne’s party.

                        It’s the social event of the

                                 LENA
                        We’re in a horror movie and you 
                        want to go to a high school party? 
                        Are you trying to get murdered?

                                 SHAWN
                        We’re going...

           Shawn marches to the Malibu’s fallen bumper and holds up the 
           warped LICENSE PLATE - RAD-BRAD

                                 SHAWN
                        Because that’s where Brad’s going.

           EXT. JOANNE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Shawn, Lena, and Izzy follow the sound of music and revelry 
           all the way up the long, arduous hill until they see -

           JOANNE’S HOUSE - a large Victorian that sits perched atop a 
           hill surrounded by woods.

           The party has already spilled outside, with drunken TEENAGERS 
           gallivanting across the yard.

           They pass car after car, but no sign of the Malibu.
                                 LENA
                        Does anyone see the car?

                                 IZZY
                        No, but I see someone who would 
                        know where it is.

           She points to the front door. They see Brad hooting and 
           hollering with the rest of the FOOTBALL TEAM before 
           disappearing inside.

                                 LENA
                        Okay. Here’s the plan. We find 
                        Brad, force him to take us to his 
                        car, and leave with the tape before 
                        the inevitable massacre.

           The three of them hurry up to the house, but then Shawn stops 
           moving. When Lena notices -

                                 LENA
                        What are you doing?

                                 SHAWN
                        I just realized...
                        This is the first party I’ve ever 
                        been to.

           Neither Lena or Izzy know what to do with that.

                                 LENA
                        Let’s go.

           After a moment, he joins them, all the while unaware that - 
           FROM THE WOODS - they’re being watched.

           INT. JOANNE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The house is PACKED with TEENS in various stages of 
           inebriation.

           Shawn, Lena, and Izzy navigate a sea of JOCKS, NERDS, PREPS, 
           FREAKS - the entire Breakfast Club - all engaged in Reagan-
           era debauchery.

                                 LENA
                        Jesus, we really are in an 80s

                                 SHAWN
                        Yeah, I’ve been hearing a lot of 
                        “hard effs” being tossed around...
           It’s a struggle just to move. 

                                 IZZY
                        You guys are the experts - are 
                        there any “horror movie rules” I 
                        should be aware of?

                                 SHAWN
                        Defintely don’t have sex with 
                        anyone here.

           Izzy passes a throng of HORNDOGS ogling a Hustler magazine.

                                 IZZY
                        Not going to be an issue.

           Suddenly a SPAZ shoves a CAMCORDER in Lena’s face.

                                 LENA
                        Hey!

                                 SPAZ
                        I’m making a documentary on the 
                        hottest babes in school and 
                        journalistic integrity means I 
                        gotta get an interview with you.

           She SMACKS it away.

                                 LENA
                        Get out of my face.

                                 SPAZ
                        Whoa, whoa - watch the merchandise. 
                        This is a brand new, top of the 
                        line Panasonic camcorder.

           They push past him and scan the chaotic living room, they 
           hear OUTSIDE -

                                 THE CROWD (O.S.)
                        JO-ANNE! JO-ANNE! JO-ANNE!

           INT. JOANNE’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           The Three of them manage to push and shove their way to the 
           POOL.

           A CROWD has formed to watch JOANNE (17) stretching on the 
           DIVING BOARD.
           Joanne runs, jumps, and does a perfect DIVE into the water. 
           The Crowd goes wild with cheers and applause.

           Shawn can’t help but clap, too. The GUY next to him even 
           gives him a high-five.

                                 IZZY
                        There he is!

           They see Brad chugging beer by the side of the pool. They 
           fight their way over as Joanne is climbing up the ladder.

           She shoves her hand in their face. None of them know why.

                                 JOANNE
                        ...Towel?

                                 IZZY
                        Uh...

           She rolls her eyes and pushes them aside, taking a TOWEL from 
           a Freshman DISCIPLE all too eager to serve the Queen Bee.

                                 DISCIPLE
                        Thank you, Joanne. You’re so 
                        perfect--

           But Joanne has already moved on, drying off as she moves 
           through her party, her guests parting out of her way like the 
           Red Sea.

           Lena struggles to keep her eyes on Brad when suddenly, Izzy 
           grabs her wrist.

                                 LENA
                        What--

                                 IZZY
                        That’s Joanne Merchant.

           When Shawn realizes what she means -

                                 SHAWN
                        Oh shit. You’re right.

                                 IZZY
                        She went missing in 89. My Mom had 
                        her as a student. I can’t believe 
                        it. She’s here.

           But Lena is focused on the mission.
                                 LENA
                        But where’s Brad?

           She’s lost him.

           Meanwhile, Joanne takes someone’s drink - glugs it - then 
           throws the crushed cup back at them before cupping her hands 
           and yelling to everyone outside -

                                 JOANNE
                        Everyone - the band is starting. I 
                        want to see all those sexy bodies 
                        moving on the dance floor!

           There’s a roar of cheers followed by a mass exodus from the 
           backyard into the living room.

                                 LENA
                        Goddamn it.

           They join the mass migration inside. Meanwhile, in -

           THE WOODS

           Spaz is hiding in the WOODS behind the house filming the 
           BIKINI GIRLS still in the pool. 

           He chuckles to himself as he ZOOMS in.

                                 SPAZ
                        Russ Meyer, eat your heart out.

           THUNK

           He looks down to see a SICKLE jutting from his STERNUM.

                                 SPAZ
                        Ow...

           The CAMCORDER slips from his grip and falls into the dirt as 
           he’s slowly raised high into the air... 

           Then dropped to the ground with a wet thud. Blood splashes 
           across the lens.

           INT. JOANNE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           THE BAND is wailing on their synths and keytars for a room 
           absolutely packed with kids dancing to the music.
           Shawn, Lena, and Izzy have to fight their way into the middle 
           of the DANCE FLOOR. 

           They get pushed and shoved from all sides, and there’s no 
           sign of -

                                 LENA
                             (shouting)
                        Brad?!

           But her voice can’t compete with the band.

                                 LENA
                        Okay. Screw it. Let’s just find the 
                        car and break the window.

                                 SHAWN
                        But we just got here.

           Both turn to Shawn - what?

                                 SHAWN
                        I know, I know, but...

           He gazes at the party that looks just like the ones in the 
           movies he’s watched all his life.

                                 SHAWN
                        Isn’t this amazing? It’s the 80s. 
                        We’re at a party. We’re in a movie.

                                 LENA
                        A slasher movie. We could be 
                        decapitated.

                                 SHAWN
                        Better than getting shot by an AR-
                        15 in math class. Look at this 
                        place - no on is one their phones 
                        and there’s still time to do 
                        something about climate change. 
                        It’s awesome!

           Lena opens her mouth to respond when - over the sound of the 
           music - they hear a SCREAM.

           Not everyone heard it - some are still dancing while others 
           look around, silently asking each other if they heard it too.

           Then there’s another. One by one, the members of the band 
           stop playing. For a moment, all that can be heard is a 
           confused murmur. Then -
                                 DANCER
                        The pool...

           People look into the backyard and see that the once brilliant 
           aquamarine pool is now a deep, dark RED.

                                 SHAWN
                        Okay. We can leave now.

           A PREP is thrown against the big GLASS DOORS. BLOOD SPRAYS 
           from out his throat and all across the glass.

           There are screams and wails but people are too shocked by the 
           sight to move.

           But his body falls and his blood drips down the glass and 
           they see - standing behind him - The Killer.

                                                     All Hell breaks loose.

           Shawn, Lena, and Izzy are TRAPPED by bodies and can only 
           watch helplessly as two WRESTLERS try to hold the door 
           closed.

           But The Killer SWINGS his sickle - BREAKING the glass and 
           CHOPPING their arms off.

           It’s pandemonium as a STAMPEDE moves away from the door. 
           Partiers are pushed and shoved and crushed and trampled.

           The Killer moves through the room like a lawn mower - slicing 
           and dicing everything in his path, which just makes people 
           more desperate to get away, which makes them push harder, 
           which means more people slip on the slick floor.

           Shawn, Lena, and Izzy are swept up in the wave, with no 
           control of where they’re going. They start to separate.

                           IZZY
                                                          SHAWN
           Lena!
                                              Lena!

           Lena sees Izzy pulled to the LEFT and Shawn shoved to the 
           RIGHT, both of them reaching out their arms for her.

           But The Killer is closer to Izzy, and he’s only getting 
           closer. So she has to make a choice.

           Shawn watches as Lena TAKES IZZY’S HAND and pulls her back 
           towards herself as he drifts further away until they’re at 
           opposite ends of the room.
           He sees Lena and Izzy disappear into the KITCHEN while he is 
           pulled into -

           THE LIBRARY

           As soon as he steps foot inside, he trips on a SEVERED LEG 
           and falls to his knees atop the rug.

           He tries to stand but he’s kicked and pushed and stepped on 
           by fleeing teens.

           Finally, the last one runs by and he can scramble back onto 
           his feet. He turns just in time to see -

           The Killer marching towards him, sickle held high.

           Thinking fast, Shawn grabs hold of a BOOK SHELF and pulls it 
           down. It TOPPLES into the wall, BLOCKING the door.

           The Killer watches Shawn run away. Temporary setback.

           INT. JOANNE’S KITCHEN

           Gripping each other’s hands tight, Lena and Izzy are pulled 
           along the raging river of bodies.

                                 LENA
                        We need to find Shawn!

           With her free hand, Izzy grabs hold of the ISLAND and the two 
           brace themselves against the onslaught.

           When everyone else has passed through, they both takes KNIVES 
           from the RACK.

           INT. JOANNE’S DINING ROOM

           Shawn runs past the long, oak dining table, checking over his 
           shoulder as he runs into -

           THE FOYER

           He sprints for the FRONT DOOR but there is a GRIDLOCK of 
           teens all trying to escape at the same time.

           With no choice but to join the congestion, he runs up -

           Just as The Killer arrives from the other side.
           Shawn stops short and falls backwards as The Killer makes 
           gruesome work of the poor souls bottlenecked at the door.

           He jumps to his feet and changes trajectory, running instead 
           up the STAIRCASE.

           As The Killer pulls his blade from the last body, he looks up 
           and catches sight of Shawn fleeing just as he makes it to -

           THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Shawn runs across the hall, looking from room to room for a 
           place to hide, when his eyes catch a DRAWSTRING swaying back 
           and forth above his head.

           He jumps and grabs it, pulling down a LADDER and as fast as 
           he can, he climbs up into -

           THE ATTIC

           He pulls up the ladder and shuts the door, then slowly backs 
           away, trying to remain as quiet as possible.

           But as soon as he allows himself to exhale, a HAND wraps 
           around his mouth.

                                 JOANNE (O.S.)
                        Shhhh.

           He turns to see Joanne hiding in the shadows.

                                 JOANNE
                        You shouldn’t be here.

           She leans in close and whispers in his ear.

                                 JOANNE
                        This is where I die.

           A chill runs down his spine.

           EXT. JOANNE’S HOUSE 

           Teens run for their lives across the yard, racing to their 
           cars.

           Brad manages to push himself through the front door and run 
           for his Malibu, scrambling to get the KEYS from his pocket. 
           THE MALIBU

           Brad jumps behind the wheel and starts the engine. But after 
           he throws it into REVERSE -

           He FREEZES. And he doesn’t know why. He trembles.

                                 BRAD
                        Fuck...

           He grits his teeth. Sweat drips down his brow.

                                 BRAD
                        Please...I don’t want to...

           But he can’t help it.

           As if compelled by something outside of himself, he puts the 
           car in DRIVE and speeds up the DRIVEWAY back to the house.

           INT. THE DINING ROOM

           Lena peers around the corner of the LIBRARY looking like 
           Laurie Strode with her knife at the ready.

           Izzy looks, too, but they see neither Shawn nor The Killer.

           They creep along the wall, checking under the table before 
           getting to -

           THE FOYER

           They freeze when they see the pile of DEAD BODIES. Lena holds 
           her breath as they cautiously approach the mound.

           She scans the faces for a sign of Shawn. Thankfully, there 
           isn’t one. Izzy looks out the open door.

                                 IZZY
                        Maybe he got out.

           But then Lena sees the massive bloody BOOT PRINTS going up 
           the stairs, and instinct tells her that’s not true.

           INT. THE ATTIC

           Shawn sets his jaw.
                                 SHAWN
                        ...What do you mean “where you 
                        die?”

                                 JOANNE
                        This is where the killer stabs his 
                        sickle through my skull. Just like 
                        he always does. Over and over. 
                        That’s my role.

                                 SHAWN
                        No. It doesn’t have to be like 
                        that. This isn’t real. We can take 
                        you back with us to the real world.

           After a moment - Joanne grins.

                                 JOANNE
                        Why would I want that?

                                 SHAWN
                        Uh...

                                 JOANNE
                        You know the only thing I remember 
                        about the “real world?”
                             (beat)
                        How lonely I was. 

           That hits close to home.

                                 JOANNE
                        But here? I’m the most popular girl 
                        in school. I’ll always be 
                        seventeen, I’ll always have 
                        friends, and I’ll always host the 
                        greatest party of all time.
                             (beat)
                        No matter how many times I die, I 
                        always wake up happy.

           Shawn freezes as he hears heavy FOOTSTEPS stalking across the 
           hallway beneath them. 

           When they’re right below their feet - they stop. Silence.

                                 JOANNE
                        Don’t fight it. It’s really not so 
                        bad.

           On cue - the sickle BURSTS through the bottom of her foot.
           Shawn backs away as Joanne FALLS to the floor. The sickle 
           retracts from her foot and ERUPTS out her back. 

                                 JOANNE
                        See you at school tomorrow.

           The blade finally EXPLODES through her head, and he sees her 
           lips curl into a smile before her eyes roll back.

           Shawn holds his hands over his mouth and listens to the sound 
           of footsteps moving across the hall. 

           Then he sees it - across the room - a WINDOW.

           The attic door SWINGS open and the ladder falls.

           Shawn makes a run for it.

           As he passes the door, The Killer’s arm shoots up from the 
           hole and GRABS his ankle.

           He hits the ground hard. He looks back at The Killer halfway 
           up the ladder. He tries to kick his leg free but it’s no use.

           He’s doomed. So he takes a deep breath and prepares for 
           death. The first of many.

           But as The Killer raises his sickle and starts to pull Shawn 
           backwards -

           THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Lena STABS him in the back.

           The Killer looks down at this unexpected development. Lena’s 
           just as surprised as he is, but she doesn’t waste the 
           opportunity.

           She STABS him again. Then again and again and again. 

           So does Izzy. She goes fucking apeshit on his legs as they’re 
           showered in his BLACK BLOOD.

           He SLIPS.

           THE ATTIC

           Shawn feels The Killer’s grip loosen. He looks back just in 
           time to see him disappear beneath the hole.

           He picks himself up and runs to the window.
           THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           The Killer hangs UPSIDE DOWN, his leg stuck through the rung 
           of the ladder, his SICKLE on the floor.

           The girls look to each other, neither knowing what to do.

           So they just start stabbing him, plunging their knives in and 
           out of his torso.

           His arms flail, trying to grab one of the girls but it’s no 
           use. After taking more stabs than Caesar - 

           The Killer goes limp. The girls stand back.

                                 IZZY
                        Is he dead?

                                 LENA
                        They never are.

           Izzy notes his sickle by their feet. She holds her breath, 
           then picks it up.

                                 IZZY
                        Well in that case...

                                 LENA
                        No--

           Too late. Izzy CHOPS The Killer’s head OFF. Oily black blood 
           spurts from the hole in his neck.

                                 LENA
                        ...Well damn.

           THE ATTIC

           Shawn looks out the open window. After a moment’s hesitation -

           He JUMPS.

           THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Lena sees Shawn PLUMMET past the WINDOW at the end of the 
           hall.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn!
           EXT. JOANNE’S BACK YARD - NIGHT

           Shawn sails through the air and plunges into the blood-red 
           POOL.

           He sinks to the bottom where he sees a FOOTBALL PLAYER’S 
           waterlogged CORPSE staring back at him with dead, soulless 
           eyes.

           He kicks himself up off the bottom of the pool, but just as 
           he’s about to reach the surface - he STOPS.

           Panic flashes across his face. He looks down to see The 
           Football Player holding onto his leg.

           BLACK BLOOD oozes from his nose, swirling in the water around 
           him.

                                 FOOTBALL PLAYER
                        Where you going, man?

           Shawn kicks his leg.

                                 FOOTBALL PLAYER
                        Don’t fight it. Join us. It’s 
                        better in here. The water’s fine.

           Shawn’s lungs burn and scream for air.

           He sees a deep GASH in his forearm. So he reaches down, 
           shoves his fingers into the flesh, and PULLS.

           The arm SEPARATES and Shawn swims back to the surface.

           As he splashes and gasps for air, Lena and Izzy race through 
           the shattered back door.

                                 LENA
                        Oh thank God.

           Shawn hurriedly swims to the ladder where Lena tries to help 
           him climb out.

                                 LENA
                        We bought some time. Izzy killed 
                        him. Maybe. You know how these 
                        things go--

           But he swats her arm away.

                                 SHAWN
                        Fuck off.
           Lena and Izzy watch confused as Shawn storms away, the arm 
           still gripping his ankle.

                                 LENA
                        Where are you going?

                                 SHAWN
                        Away from you.

           Lena and Izzy look to each other. Neither knows what’s going 
           on, but they follow him anyway.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn. This is insane. We have to 
                        stick together--

           She grabs his arm but he wrenches it away and whips around.

                                 SHAWN
                        You chose her.

           Izzy stops in her tracks.

                                 LENA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SHAWN
                        He could have killed me. I’m your 
                        brother. You might never have seen 
                        me again but you chose her anyway.

                                 LENA
                        It wasn’t like that--

                                 SHAWN
                        You left me behind.

           That hits her like a freight train.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn...

           But he’s already turned around and rushing away, kicking 
           Savini’s arm off as he goes. 

                                 LENA
                        Shawn, stop.

           She chases him into THE WOODS.

           Izzy starts to follow but then STOPS when something catches 
           her leg.
           She looks back at an INTESTINE jutting from a DEAD NERD’s 
           eviscerated gut and wrapping around her ankle.

                                 IZZY
                        Gah.

           She tries to pull away but it coils higher and tighter.

           THE WOODS

           Shawn navigates through the trees when he hears -

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Shawn! Where the fuck are you?

           He hides behind a tree and peers around to see Lena looking 
           for him.

           He quietly darts the other direction, putting distance 
           between them when he TRIPS.

           He looks back at Spaz’s TORSO and next to that - the 
           CAMCORDER. He picks it up as an idea percolates. 

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS

           Lena desperately searches for Shawn but he’s nowhere to be 
           found. She tries calling again.

                                 LENA
                        Shawn!

           She listens for his response. She doesn’t hear it. But she 
           hears something else instead. A familiar sounding ENGINE. 

           When she places it -

                                 LENA
                        Brad!

           THE BACK YARD

           Meanwhile, Izzy is still trying to escape the clutches of the 
           Nerd’s large intestine. 

           She tries to kick away with her free leg, but then his SMALL 
           INTESTINE bursts out and grabs the other.

           It PULLS her back towards the body.
                                 IZZY
                        I fucking hate horror movies!

           THE FRONT YARD

           Lena emerges from the woods into the front yard where she 
           sees - idling in the driveway - THE MALIBU.

           She runs to the car and swings open the door and she looks 
           inside and YES - there it is. The VCR.

           She reaches in and grabs it. But as she holds it triumphantly 
           above her head -

           The sleeve of a LETTERMEN JACKET wraps around her face.

           Her eyes go wide as BRAD pulls her backwards and she DROPS 
           the VCR onto the asphalt. It SMASHES into pieces.

                                 BRAD
                        I’m sorry.

           She struggles as he drags her to the TRUNK. He pops it open 
           and she manages to wrestle his arm away from her mouth long 
           enough to SCREAM.

           THE WOODS 

           Shawn heard it.

                                 SHAWN
                        Lena?

           THE BACK YARD

           Izzy heard it to.

                                 IZZY
                        Lena!

           That’s it - enough fucking around. She grabs hold of the 
           small intestine and RIPS it off of her.

           She tries the same with the large intestine but it’s too 
           strong. So she pulls it to her mouth and BITES it off.

           She gags as she jumps to her feet and runs to -
           THE FRONT YARD

           She arrives just in time to see Brad lock the crumpled TRUNK 
           of his car as Lena yells and bangs from inside.

                                 IZZY
                        Hey!

           He looks up at Izzy racing toward him. He jumps in the 
           driver’s seat, starts the engine, and SPEEDS AWAY.

                                 IZZY
                        No!!

           She’s forced to watch helplessly as it disappears over the 
           road’s horizon.

                                 IZZY
                        Oh God oh God what do I do what do 
                        I do?

           She paces in a panic when her foot crunches a piece of 
           plastic. She looks down at the remains of the VCR and -

           The TAPE. 

           She picks it up. Has no idea what to do with it now.

           But then she sees RED and BLUE lights flashing across the 
           trees. She turns to see a POLICE CAR driving towards her.

                                 IZZY
                        Oh thank God.

           She races towards it as the window rolls down and two 
           OFFICERS - TOMMY and JARVIS - look out at her.

                                 OFFICER TOMMY
                        What’s going on out there, miss?

           INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Killer’s headless body hangs limp from the ladder. His 
           head lies on the floor.

           It twitches. Just once. Then again. And again.

           Until suddenly it starts spasming. His body, too. They 
           convulse violently until both the body and the head -

           DISSOLVE into pools of BLACK BLOOD that melt into the floor.
           INT. THE TRUNK - NIGHT

           In the DARK, Lena kicks at the trunk’s door until her ankle 
           twists.

                                 LENA
                        Fuck!

           She grabs her ankle and winces. Realizing what she’s doing 
           isn’t working, she changes tactics.

           She twists around and tries to speak through the crack in the 
           seats.

                                 LENA
                        Brad. I don’t know what you’re 
                        doing or why but you need to let me 
                        out.

           INT. THE CHEVY MALIBU

           Brad drives, staring ahead with pained eyes.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        I know who you are. You’re Bradley 
                        Clarke from Holdenfield, 
                        Pennsylvania. You went missing in 
                        1987. People looked for you. People 
                        miss you.
                             (beat)
                        Whatever you’re doing, you can make 
                        the choice to stop.

                                 BRAD
                        No. I can’t.

           He turns on the RADIO and blasts generic Van Halen to hide 
           her pleas.

           He wipes BLACK BLOOD from his nostrils.

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

           Izzy is in the back of the cop car frantically looking out 
           the windows as Jarvis drives and Tommy shines a LIGHT at the 
           surrounding woods.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        Now what did you say he was 
                        driving?
                                 IZZY
                        I don’t know anything about cars. 
                        It’s red and it was in an accident. 
                        There’s no bumper. Isn’t that 
                        enough?

           Jarvis gets on the radio.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        We got a 207, suspect is driving a 
                        red car, missing a bumper, the 
                        victim is in the trunk.

           Izzy looks down at the VHS held tightly in her hand.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        So this...psycho killer? He’s dead, 
                        you say?

                                 IZZY
                        His head is on the floor, but from 
                        what I understand that doesn’t 
                        necessarily mean he’s dead because 
                        these movies are fucking stupid.

           She realizes they’re slowing down. She looks around - they’re 
           in the middle of the road.

                                 IZZY
                        What are we doing?

           Jarvis turns off the engine. Both officers look straight 
           ahead.

                                 OFFICER TOMMY
                        You’re not from around here, are 
                        you?

           Izzy sinks into her seat. Fuck.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        We locals, well...we got a way of 
                        doing things.

                                 OFFICER TOMMY
                        A culture of tradition.

           She tries the door but of course it’s locked.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        And out-of-towners? It’s been our 
                        experience that they don’t show 
                        much deference to the done thing.
                                 OFFICER TOMMY
                        Fortunately, when things go off the 
                        beaten path...

           Officer Tommy twists around in his seat. 

           BLACK BLOOD oozes from out his eyes and nose and cascades 
           down his grinning lips.

                                 OFFICER TOMMY
                        We got a way of course correcting.

           Izzy pushes back as far into her seat as she can.

           Officer Tommy convulses in his seat, his rictus grin 
           contorting into an expression of torture. He howls in pain.

           Next to him, Jarvis can’t stop LAUGHING.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        Here he comes...

           Izzy can do nothing but watch helplessly as Officer Tommy 
           grabs at his face and hair and disappears beneath the seat...

           Only to return as THE KILLER.

           Jarvis looks back at her.

                                 OFFICER JARVIS
                        He’s mad, now.

           The Killer looks from Izzy to Jarvis. First thing’s first.

           The Killer grabs hold of Officer Jarvis’s head and SMASHES it 
           through the car window.

           Izzy watches as The Killer opens the passenger door and 
           lumbers past the windshield.

           He pulls Jarvis’ body through the shattered glass and onto 
           the road, then lifts his boot and STOMPS, splattering blood 
           across her window.

           Now it’s her turn.

           Izzy scrambles to the other side as The Killer comes up to 
           her door, but there’s nowhere to go and nowhere to hide.

           The Killer RIPS the door off the hinges and looks inside.

           With nothing to lose, she flips him off.
                                 IZZY
                        Fuck you, assface.

           He reaches inside when -

                    BLAM            BLAM             BLAM

           Three BULLETS burst through The Killer’s head and chest.

           His body collapses onto the seat, revealing SHAWN behind him, 
           CAMCORDER in one hand, Jarvis’ GUN in the other.

           They share a brief holy shit did that just happen look, then -

                                 IZZY
                        Get in.

           Shawn nods and jumps in the driver’s seat. His hands still 
           shaking, he starts the engine. But then -

                                 SHAWN
                        ...I don’t know how to drive.

           God damn it. Izzy looks through the partition.

                                 IZZY
                        See the handle? Move it from P to 
                        D.

           He tries.

                                 SHAWN
                        I can’t.

                                 IZZY
                        Foot on the brake.

           Okay, that works.

                                 SHAWN
                        Now what?

           She’s about to respond when The Killer lifts his head.

                                 IZZY
                        Shit!

                                 SHAWN
                        Huh?

           He looks back to see Izzy KICKING The Killer in the head.
                                 SHAWN
                        Oh.

                                 IZZY
                        Hit the gas!

           He steps on the pedal and the car zooms forward.

           Lena kicks at The Killer again and again as his legs drag 
           across the road until he finally FALLS out of the car.

           She looks back to see The Killer’s body rolling across the 
           asphalt, but takes little comfort in this. 

           It’s only a matter of time before they see him again.

           EXT. THE ROAD

           The Killer rolls down the street until he finally comes to a 
           stop.

           He picks himself up, cracks his neck, and walks into the 
           WOODS.

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

           When Izzy catches her breath -

                                 IZZY
                        I have the tape.

                                 SHAWN
                        What?

           She shows him the VHS.

                                 IZZY
                        What do we do? Break it? Shoot it 
                        with the gun?

           Shawn considers this. Shakes his head.

                                 SHAWN
                        No. Not without Lena.
                             (beat)
                        Where is she?

                                 IZZY
                        Brad took her. She’s in the trunk 
                        of his car.
           Shit

                                 IZZY
                        The video - it’s treating us like a 
                        virus. Seems like everything’s 
                        trying to kill us now that we’re 
                        changing the story.

                                 SHAWN
                        And we have no idea where they 
                        went?

                                 IZZY
                        No.

           She sees his lip tremble in the rearview. He swallows the 
           lump in his throat.

                                 SHAWN
                        This is all my fault.

           He can’t fight any longer. He beats his fist against the 
           wheel.

                                 SHAWN
                        This is all my stupid fucking 
                        fault!

                                 IZZY
                        We’ll find her.

                                 SHAWN
                        How? They could be anywhere! She 
                        could be dead by now!

           He’s right. They have no way of knowing. Except...

           Izzy looks at the tape in her hand. Her eyes go wide.

                                 IZZY
                        Spaceballs!

                                 SHAWN
                        ...Excuse me?

                                 IZZY
                        Spaceballs?

           Nothing.

                                 IZZY
                        Dark Helmet? Pizza the Hut?
                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t know what those words mean.

           She rolls her eyes.

                                 IZZY
                        This is why you should expand your 
                        horizons.
                             (beat)
                        We need to get to a TV.

           EXT. TOWN - NIGHT

           The cop car drives through TOWN as Izzy looks out the window.

                                 IZZY
                        There!

           Shawn pulls over and the two of them get out of the car.

           Tape in hand, they rush across the sidewalk to a DEPARTMENT 
           STORE.

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

           Shawn and Izzy march through the store, passing the various 
           departments - KITCHEN, YARD, PETS, BATHROOM.

                                 SHAWN
                        Electronics, electronics, 
                        electronics...

           While Shawn looks for the electronics section, Izzy is keenly 
           aware of the stares their getting from the other customers.

                                 IZZY
                        Keep in mind everyone in here could 
                        potentially try to murder us.

           They pass HOME REPAIR and she grabs a CLAW HAMMER off a shelf 
           just in case.

                                 SHAWN
                        I don’t care. All that matters is 
                        that we find Lena.

                                 IZZY
                        You really love her.

                                 SHAWN
                        She’s my sister.
                                 IZZY
                        I have a brother. Trust me - we’re 
                        not that close.

           He considers this.

                                 SHAWN
                        I never had a lot of friends...any 
                        friends. Everyone always thought 
                        the stuff I liked was weird and I 
                        was a creep. I was alone, and other 
                        kids can sense loneliness like 
                        sharks to chum. 
                        But Lena protected me. Took an 
                        interest in my life. I mean, I 
                        don’t know if she even likes horror 
                        movies all that much, but she at 
                        least pretended for my sake.
                             (beat)
                        But not anymore. She’s outgrown me. 

                                 IZZY
                        That’s not true.

                                 SHAWN
                        It is. And I don’t blame her.
                             (beat)
                        We’re here.

           They arrive at the -

           ELECTRONICS DEPARTMENT

           They run to a a display of TELEVISION SETS all playing the 
           same WORKOUT VIDEO.

                                 SHAWN
                        Do you really think this will work?

                                 IZZY
                        It did in--

                                 SHAWN
                        Spaceballs - got it. 

           Shawn locates the VCR that’s the source of the video. He hits 
           EJECT. All the screens turn BLUE.

           Shawn throws away the workout tape and inserts How They Bleed 
           into the deck.
           After a moment, every TV is suddenly filled with Lena’s 
           wailing FACE the sound of her scream multiplied by every set.

                                 IZZY
                        That’s her!

                                 SHAWN
                        She’s alive...

           They watch as she kicks and screams in the TRUNK.

                                 SHAWN
                        But where is she?

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        What the heck, kid?

           Shawn keeps his eyes on the screens while Izzy turns to the 
           pimple-faced EMPLOYEE marching their way.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        You can’t do that.

           He reaches to hit eject but Izzy blocks his way.

                                 IZZY
                        We’ll just be a second.

           Shawn watches as the shot CHANGES.

           Brad is behind the behind the wheel, driving through a thick 
           FOG when POP - something bursts under the car’s hood. 

           The engine sputters and smoke billows out from the sides. The 
           car comes to a stop as the engine dies.

           The shot changes again, revealing that they’re outside a 
           GRAVE YARD.

                                 SHAWN
                        They’re at a cemetery!

           Izzy looks up at the screens.

                                 IZZY
                        Yes!

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        I said...

           She looks back at the Employee. Black blood spills from his 
           mouth onto his uniform.
                                 EMPLOYEE
                        You can’t do that...

           He GRABS her by the THROAT and SHOVES her into the display.

           Shawn looks up to see her being throttled. He hits EJECT.

           Izzy’s eyes bulge, but after a second - she remembers the 
           HAMMER.

           She winds up and PLUNGES the CLAW into the top of his skull. 
           She then rips it back out and he collapses.

           Shawn grabs the tape.

                                 SHAWN
                        Run!

           They run through -

           THE STORE

           They pump their legs as they race for the exit. They see 
           CUSTOMERS turn their heads and start walking towards them.

                                 IZZY
                        Shawn...

           Suddenly, a MOM abandons her SHOPPING CART and LUNGES for 
           them.

           Izzy SMACKS her in the face with the hammer, dropping her 
           immediately.

           Shawn grabs the shopping cart and together they careen down 
           the aisle with it.

           Various PEOPLE try to stop them but they MOW THEM DOWN.

           Finally, they reach the exit. They leave the cart and run 
           outside.

           INT. THE MALIBU - NIGHT

           Brad sits behind the wheel of the unmoving car looking out at 
           the GRAVE YARD shrouded in FOG.

           As if on autopilot, he gets a FLASHLIGHT from out of the 
           glove box. Then, with a resigned sigh, he gets out of the 
           car.
           INT. THE TRUNK

           Lena realizes they’re not moving.

                                 LENA
                        ...Brad?

           EXT. THE OLD ROAD

           Brad wipes the geyser of black blood pouring from his nose 
           onto his sleeve.

                                 BRAD
                        I’m sorry.

           He turns on the flashlight and shines it across the fog.

                                 BRAD
                        I don’t want to hurt you, but I 
                        can’t help it. The tape won’t let 
                        me...

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Brad, stop it.

           He walks to the back of the car.

                                 BRAD
                        It’s not so bad. The more you die, 
                        the more you forget what came 
                        before. You give up. Play your 
                        role. Follow the script.

           He stops outside the trunk. 

                                 BRAD
                        This is where it always ends for 
                        me.

           INT. THE TRUNK

           Lena hears the KEYS in the lock, then the trunk OPENS.

           She looks up at Brad standing above her, blood running down 
           his chin.

                                 BRAD
                        And where it begins for you.

           Her eyes go wide as she sees a behemoth of SILHOUETTE behind 
           him in the fog.
                                 LENA
                        Behind you!

           She climbs out of the car onto -

           THE OLD ROAD

           But her legs give out from under her. As she scrambles back 
           to her feet, Brad grabs her wrist.

                                 BRAD
                        No. Don’t run.

                                 LENA
                        Get the fuck off me!

                                 BRAD
                        It will be better this way. Maybe 
                        now we’ll die together. Forever.

           She sees THE KILLER emerge from the fog.

                                 LENA
                        Let go of me you stupid fucking 
                        jock asshole!

           Then she sees - in the trunk - the CAMCORDER. She grips the 
           handle and WHACKS it across his face. 

           Brad stumbles backwards, letting Lena go, and she takes off 
           into the fog.

           Just as Brad recovers, the SICKLE bursts through his gut and 
           The Killer HURLS him through the air.

           The Killer wipes the blood off on his pant leg and sees Lena 
           run through the IRON GATES into -

           THE GRAVEYARD

           Breathing hard, Lena limps on her twisted ankle across the 
           moist dirt of the CEMETERY, past crucifixes and tombs.

           She hides behind an OBELISK, pressing her back against the 
           stone and catching her breath. 

           She peers around the corner but can’t see through the fog.
           INT. THE POLICE CAR

           Shawn pulls up next to the Malibu.

                                 SHAWN
                        They’re here!

           They rush out of the car.

           INT. THE GRAVEYARD

           Lena is about to dart away again when she hears -

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        Lena!

           She gasps and looks back - is about to call out when -

           She sees The Killer’s hulking frame illuminated by the 
           HEADLIGHTS. He’s coming right towards her. 

           She can’t help it - a SCREAM escapes her lips.

           EXT. THE OLD ROAD

           Izzy hears Lena’s scream from within the cemetery. She 
           doesn’t hesitate - she runs in after her.

           Shawn checks the chamber of his gun - THREE BULLETS. 

           He follows Izzy inside.

           EXT. THE GRAVEYARD

           Lena limps through the cemetery, desperately searching all 
           around for Shawn and Izzy when - 

           She TRIPS over a GRAVE MARKER and hits the ground hard. 

           But she’s lucky, because she was INCHES away from falling 
           into an OPEN GRAVE. She breathes a quick sigh of relief.

           Then she sees - next to the grave - a mound of DIRT covered 
           by a TARP. And next to that - a SHOVEL.

           She gets up and grabs it.

           ELSEWHERE

           Izzy runs past a GNARLED TREE when she hears FOOTSTEPS.
           She whips around, her eyes darting in all directions as she 
           backs up into -

           Shawn, doing the same thing. They knock into each other, 
           SHRIEK, and spin around.

           The gun FIRES and FLIES out of Shawn’s hand. Once he’s 
           recovered from the shock -

                                 SHAWN
                        The gun...

           Shawn crouches down, searching the dirt under the fog for the 
           revolver. But just as he finds it -

           The Killer’s BOOT presses it into the mud. Shawn looks up -

           As the sickle SWINGS past his throat.

           He falls backwards, scrambling away as The Killer lumbers 
           towards him ready to strike again when -

           Lena SMACKS the SHOVEL into The Killer’s face.

           While he’s stunned, she STABS him in the chest with the 
           shovel’s blade and pushes him backward into the tree trunk.

           But he recovers. He RIPS the shovel from her hands and throws 
           it away.

           Lena dodges his sickle and runs back to Shawn and Izzy.

                                 SHAWN
                        You saved me.

                                 LENA
                        Of course. You’re my brother.

           She grabs Shawn’s hand and PULLS him to his feet.

                                 LENA
                        Now come on!

           The three of them run through the fog until they hit the 
           gate’s IRON BARS - a dead end.

                                 LENA
                        Oh no...

           She looks all around.

                                 SHAWN
                        What?
                                 LENA
                        I think we went the wrong way...

           Then Izzy screams as The Killer lurches from the mist and 
           marches right towards them.

           Their backs against the gate, Lena takes Shawn and Izzy’s 
           hands, squeezes them tight, preparing for death.

           But then The Killer takes a STEP

                        Onto the dirt-covered TARP

                                           And falls into the OPEN GRAVE

           Izzy and Shawn open their eyes to see Lena rush to the STATUE 
           of the VIRGIN MARY looming over the hole.

                                 LENA
                        Help me!

           They see Lena shove against the statue and realize this was 
           all part of her plan. So they run to join her.

           As The Killer reaches up and finds purchase on the edge of 
           grave, The Three push the statue with all their collective 
           might.

           And just as The Killer starts to pull himself out -

           The statue TOPPLES over and CRUSHES him.

           The three look down at The Killer at the bottom of the grave, 
           struggling under the weight of the concrete, unable to 
           escape.

                                 SHAWN
                        You could have told us you had a 
                        plan before I pissed myself.

           Izzy turns to Lena.

                                 IZZY
                        You’re alive.

                                 LENA
                        I am--

           Izzy grabs her face and KISSES her hard.

                                 SHAWN
                        Whoa! What the fuck is this...
           But as the two suck face, The Killer stops struggling. Shawn 
           notices. He looks down into the grave as The Killer goes 
           limp.

                                 SHAWN
                        Hey...

           He watches as The Killer’s body pulsates and then DISSOLVES.

           Shawn tugs at Lena’s sleeve until she tears herself away.

                                 LENA
                        What?

           But then she sees The Killer’s blood seep into the soil.

                                 LENA
                        Shit.

                                 IZZY
                        It’s not going to stop, is it?

                                 LENA
                        Not until we figure out how to get 
                        home.

           But Izzy remembers -

                                 IZZY
                        We have the tape!

           EXT. THE OLD ROAD

           The three of them haul ass out the gates and back to the cop 
           car.

           Shawn swings open the door and emerges with the VHS.

                                 LENA
                        Yes!

                                 IZZY
                        Now what?

           Shawn considers his answer, but before he speaks, he sees 
           something in the distance.

                                 LENA
                        We need to be smart about this. We 
                        only have one shot.

           As Shawn thinks, he hears the CAW of a crow in the distance.
           He squints, looking through the fog at a GLOWING LIGHT - a 
           SIGN.

                                 IZZY
                        Do we rewind it to the beginning? 
                        Smash it into a hundred pieces.

                                 SHAWN
                        No...

           Shawn walks to the glowing light like a moth to flame.

                                 SHAWN
                        We return it.

           They watch him vanish into the fog.

           Izzy looks to Lena and shrugs. She follows him.

           Lena starts to, but something catches her eye. She reaches 
           into the car and grabs the CAMCORDER.

           She bites her lip as a thought occurs to her. She takes it 
           with her as she follows them.

           EXT. THE STRIP MALL - NIGHT

           The SIGN glows brightly in the foggy night as it looms over 
           the packed PARKING LOT.

           Shawn walks past the CARS and the STORES straight to the last 
           one on the left.

                                       VIDEO CASTLE

           INT. VIDEO CASTLE - NIGHT

           Shawn enters the video store, and just like he was told, it 
           is indeed popping off on a Friday night.

           PATRONS of all ages, shapes, and sizes peruse the shelves 
           looking for the night’s entertainment.

           CHILDREN run through the ANIMATION aisle while OLDER COUPLES 
           wander through FOREIGN. DADS are in ACTION, MOMS are in 
           DRAMA, TEENS are in COMEDY and HORROR alike.

           Then he sees it - THE BACK OFFICE.

           He pushes past customers on his way to the DOOR. He checks to 
           make sure the coast is clear...
           Then goes inside -

           THE BACK OFFICE

           Shawn flips the light switch, illuminating the room with 
           flickering florescent light.

           His eyes find what he’s looking for - THE DOOR in the FLOOR.

           He rushes towards it and crouches down and opens it...

                                 SHAWN
                        What the...

           He’s peering into a dark, seemingly BOTTOMLESS PIT

                                 BARBARA (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           Shawn jumps out of his skin. He looks to see, standing in the 
           doorway -

           BARBARA. She looks...exactly the same. Ghost white hair and a 
           face like a Renaissance painting. Even the same age as when 
           he first met her.

                                 BARBARA
                        You appear to be lost. This is my 
                        office. Off limits to customers.

           Shawn searches her face. Isn’t sure how to play this.

                                 SHAWN
                        Sorry, I was just...I needed to...

                                 BARBARA
                        What’s the matter, Shawn? You’re 
                        not enjoying the movie?

           His blood goes cold.

           INT. VIDEO CASTLE

           Lena and Izzy enter the store.

                                 LENA
                        Where’s Shawn?
           INT. THE BACK OFFICE

           Barbara strolls closer.

                                 BARBARA
                        What about your sister? Was she 
                        impressed by the flick? Was she 
                        spooked?

           He backs away.

                                 SHAWN
                        Who are you?

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m someone just like you, Shawn. A 
                        connoisseur of the way things were. 
                        A preservationist.

           Shawn backs into the wall as Barbara kneels to the floor.

                                 BARBARA
                        Admittedly I’ve been forced to 
                        evolve methods over the years.

           She reaches inside the hole and returns with an OLD BOOK.

                                 BARBARA
                        For centuries, fairy tales were my 
                        purview. 

           She opens the book and flips through its pages, revealing to 
           Shawn ILLUSTRATIONS of CHILDREN in peril - cooked by witches, 
           ravaged by wolves, crushed by giants.

           One of the CHILDREN turns to Shawn and opens her mouth to 
           scream, but Barbara slams the book shut.

                                 BARBARA
                        But of course I had to adapt. 
                        Change with the times. Convert my 
                        gingerbread house into a humble 
                        video store.

           She stands.

                                 BARBARA
                        For years I collected the souls of 
                        the wayward youth who stumbled 
                        inside, but little by little they 
                        stopped coming. Video stores became 
                        a relic. All anyone wanted was...
                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                             (shudders)
                        Streaming.

           She grins.

                                 BARBARA
                        But not you, Shawn. In you I found 
                        a special someone who appreciated 
                        the past as much as I do. Someone 
                        who longed for a return to a time 
                        when things were better.

           She caresses his face.

           INT. VIDEO CASTLE

           Lena and Izzy navigate the aisles searching for Shawn.

           All the while, their fellow customers are keeping a watchful 
           eye on their every move...

           INT. THE BACK OFFICE

           Barbara takes a step forward. Shawn takes a step back.

                                 BARBARA
                        This is my gift to you, a fellow 
                        nostalgic. To be forever 
                        immortalized on video tape. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been watching you, Shawn. It’s 
                        been a wonderful show. And I see 
                        there’s nothing you want more than 
                        for your sister - the one and only 
                        companion you’ve ever known - to 
                        return to your side in comfortable 
                        familiarity.

           She takes another step. This time, he stays put.

                                 BARBARA
                        Out there? In the world to which 
                        you wish to return? She’ll outgrow 
                        you. Forget you. Leave you behind. 
                        But here? In the movie? You’ll 
                        always have her. You’ll never know 
                        loneliness again. I promise.

           ...He’s listening.
                                 BARBARA
                        I’ll make Izzy a nerd. A dork. A 
                        freak. So low in the social 
                        hierarchy that Lena won’t even 
                        register her existence. She’ll 
                        never get between the two of you 
                        again.

           It’s tempting.

                                 BARBARA
                        And yes - you’ll be murdered. A 
                        lot. But that’s small price to pay 
                        for never really dying, wouldn’t 
                        you say?

           She takes one last step so that she’s looming over him.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’ll make sure it’s quick 
                        and...relatively painless.

           She reaches past Shawn and takes from her desk a razor-sharp 
           LETTER OPENER.

                                 BARBARA
                        Nothing will ever change, Shawn.

           She holds it to his jugular. He gulps.

                                 BARBARA
                        Now hold still.

           Shawn looks past her shoulder.

                                 SHAWN
                        Yeah. Do it.

           But before she can plunge the blade into his throat, a TAPE 
           flies through the air and SMACKS her in the back of the head.

           Barbara spins around to see Lena and Izzy standing in the 
           doorway.

                                 SHAWN
                        Run!

           Shawn shoves past her and the three sprint back into -

           VIDEO CASTLE

           The run for the exit, but before they can escape -
           A line of PATRONS blocks him from leaving. They stop in their 
           tracks.

                                 SHAWN
                        Um...excuse us--

           BLACK BLOOD oozes from all their eyes and noses.

                                 IZZY
                        Does it ever fucking end...

           Barbara emerges from her office holding the VHS.

                                 BARBARA
                        Shawn?

           They look back.

                                 BARBARA
                        You had your chance.
                             (beat)
                        Now your deaths will be brutal, 
                        extended, and excruciating.

           And with that, every person in the store oozes black from 
           their orifices and lumbers towards them like ZOMBIES.

           Everywhere they turn - Zombies. They’re forced to move to the 
           one aisle that isn’t occupied - HORROR.

                                 SHAWN
                        I’m so fucking sick of zombies.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry, Shawn.

                                 SHAWN
                        For what?

                                 LENA
                        This is all my fault. I should have 
                        been there for you. I’m your 
                        sister. I should have watched 
                        whatever movie you wanted. There’s 
                        nothing wrong with watching 
                        something you’ve seen a hundred 
                        times before.

                                 SHAWN
                        No. This is my fault. All because I 
                        was afraid of losing you, afraid of  
                        things being different. I should 
                        have just learned to change...
           And then a thought occurs to him.

                                 SHAWN
                        Wait.
                             (beat)
                        I can change.

           Izzy throws a TAPE at one of the zombie’s heads.

                                 IZZY
                        Great. You’re self-realized. 

                                 SHAWN
                        No, I mean we can change into 
                        whatever we want to be. This is all 
                        just movie stuff. Zombies aren’t 
                        real. Undead slashers and talking 
                        heads aren’t real. This is not 
                        reality.

                                 LENA
                        What are you--

           Shawn shoves the VHS of Nightmare on Elm Street in Lena’s 
           face.

                                 SHAWN
                        This is dream world. We’re not 
                        bound to the rules. Which means...

           Her eyes go wide - he understands.

                                 LENA
                        We can be Dream Warriors.

           Shawn nods. And just as a ZOMBIE DAD reaches out to grab her, 
           Shawn gestures to the MIRROR on the ceiling. They look up.

           Lena has NO REFLECTION.

           Zombie Dad grabs her neck but she whips around and opens her 
           gaping maw to reveal her vicious VAMPIRE FANGS.

           She BITES into his throat and RIPS out his jugular and SPRAYS 
           black blood across the room.

           Izzy wipes the blood from her eyes and hears a ROAR. She 
           turns around to see -

           Shawn wearing an IRON WELDING MASK, his hands replaced by 
           massive BUZZSAWS.
           The siblings exchange holy-shit-we’re-actually-doing-this-
           looks move down opposite ends of the aisle.

           Lena pounces from one zombie to another, biting throats and 
           slashing with her talons.

           Shawn mows through the horde with his spinning blades, 
           churning through zombie flesh.

           All the while Izzy stands frozen in the center getting 
           showered in blood.

           After Lena rips off a ZOMBIE DUDE’S head -

                                 LENA
                        Izzy! Turn into something!

                                 IZZY
                        I don’t know about horror stuff!

           Shawn looks back as he saws through ZOMBIE PUNK’S guts.

                                 SHAWN
                        It doesn’t matter! You can be 
                        anything! Whatever scares you!

           But the pressure is too much. Izzy shuts her eyes and holds 
           her ears and tries to concentrate.

                                 IZZY
                        Think, think, think...

           But it doesn’t matter - this is a massacre. 

           Lena and Shawn obliterate the Zombie horde, sending blood and 
           bone and flesh flying through the air with glee.

           And all the while, Barbara stands at the sidelines, her 
           amusement turning to anger.

                                 BARBARA
                        All right, you’ve had your fun.

           BLACK BLOOD oozes from the carpet beneath her feet and 
           travels up her body.

           It overtakes her. Her clothes change to black COVERALLS. She 
           GROWS into a hulking behemoth.

           She becomes a massive, rebooted, extreme Jason-X-version of 
           THE KILLER.
           A distorted MASK covers her face and an enormous SICKLE forms 
           in her hand.

           But the siblings don’t notice that yet.

           Lena tears the heart out of a ZOMBIE PREP and Shawn cuts a 
           ZOMBIE YUPPY down the center. And then there were none.

           Coated in black blood, they turn to look at each other.

                           SHAWN
           Welcome to prime time, bitch--
                                                          LENA
                                              Welcome to prime time, bitch--

           Suddenly - an entire SHELF careens into them, sending them 
           flying across the room before pinning them underneath.

           Barbara leaps across the room and lands on the shelf, 
           crushing them beneath her, only their heads sticking out.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m sorry children, but there are 
                        no final girls in this movie. I’m 
                        the only returning star of this 
                        franchise.

           She raises the sickle high in the air.

                                 BARBARA
                        But don’t worry. 
                        At the end of the tape we rewind 
                        and do it all over again.

           But just before she can decapitate them -

           Izzy POUNCES from the Horror Section. 

           But this isn’t your standard Izzy.

           This Izzy is covered in thick, matted FUR with enormous, wolf-
           like EARS and a vicious, razor-sharp BEAK.

           Before Barbara knows what hit her, Izzy sinks her TALONS into 
           Barbara's arm and RIPS it OFF.

           Barbara lets out a tortured HOWL.

           Shawn and Lena push the shelf off as Izzy and Barbara grapple 
           like Kaiju monsters. Shawn is about to join the fight when -

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Shawn!
           He turns to see Lena holding the CAMCORDER.

                                 LENA
                        The tape!

           He sees the VHS on the ground. He avoids the wild swings of 
           claws and blades and GRABS it.

           He TOSSES it to Lena who catches it out of the air.

                                 SHAWN
                        What are you--

                                 LENA
                        I don’t want to rewind the tape!

           She inserts it into the camcorder and smacks it closed.

                                 LENA
                        I want to rewrite the ending!

           She hits RECORD.

                                 LENA
                        Action!

           From the camera’s LENS, Lena records Shawn jumping in to help 
           Izzy take on Barbara.

           They bite and rip and saw and shred until all that’s left of 
           her -

           Is her HEAD. She looks up at Izzy’s snarling face.

                                 BARBARA
                        Wait--

           Izzy PULVERIZES her skull under her monstrous foot.

           And in the quiet that follows, they hear a -

           CLICK

           The camera STOPS recording. Lena checks the VHS.

                                 LENA
                        That’s the end of the tape...

           Shawn nods.

                                 SHAWN
                        It’s over.
           Lena appraises Izzy, Barbara’s blood staining her fur black.

                                 LENA
                        Furby?

           She shrugs.

                                 LENA
                        What do we do now?

           Shawn lifts his mask up and looks out at the HEAVY FOG 
           outside the store.

                                 SHAWN
                        We go home.

           EXT. THE STRIP MALL - NIGHT

           The thick fog swirls as the three open the door and walk 
           outside.

           It begins to dissipate. As it fades, it reveals the three of 
           them have turned back to normal.

           When it has lifted completely, they turn around.

           The store is EMPTY. Decaying. A relic of the past.

                                 IZZY
                        Did it work?

                                 LENA
                        I don’t know...

           But then - a BUZZ.

           Lena reaches into her pocket and pulls out her vibrating 
           CELLPHONE.

                                 LENA
                        It’s Mom!
                             (beat)
                        I have thirty-seven missed calls...

           She answers.

                                 LENA
                        Hello--

           She immediately holds the phone away from her ear because of 
           her Mom’s screaming at her.
                                 LENA
                        I know, I know, I’m sorry. It was a 
                        weird night.

           But as Lena tries to calm her mother down, Shawn and Izzy 
           hear something moving inside the Video Store.

           They see the silhouettes of ZOMBIES lumbering inside.

                                 SHAWN
                        Oh shit.

           They back up into Lena. She sees them, too.

                                 LENA
                        God damn it.

           They’re about to run when the door bursts open...

           And out steps Allison, Joanne, and Brad, each wearing the non-
           stereotypical outfit they wore the night they entered the 
           VHS.

           Everyone just looks at each other, no one knowing what to 
           say.

           Finally, Allison raises her arm to point at Lena’s cellphone.

                                 ALLISON
                        What the fuck is that?

                                     ONE MONTH LATER

                                 SHAWN (PRE-LAP)
                        That was so cool!

           EXT. THE FACTORY - NIGHT

           A mass exodus of CONCERTGOERS spill out from the venue and 
           onto the street.

           Shawn bounds out excitedly, adrenaline pumping through his 
           veins, as Lena and Izzy follow behind.

                                 LENA
                        Glad you enjoyed it.
                                 SHAWN
                        I loved it. The way she was playing 
                        those old instruments, but they 
                        were, like, all different and 
                        modified, and the way they sounded 
                        coming out of the speakers, it was 
                        like...who has ever made sounds 
                        like that before?

                                 IZZY
                        I told you.

                                 SHAWN
                        And you were right! Old and new 
                        coming together to make something 
                        incredible. Holy shit, that was 
                        amazing.

           Lena and Izzy laugh as Shawn bounces around on -

           THE SIDEWALK

           He can’t contain his enthusiasm.

                                 SHAWN
                        Do they do shows like that here all 
                        the time?

                                 IZZY
                        They sure do. Lots of different 
                        artists. Lots of new stuff to 
                        discover.

                                 SHAWN
                        I want to go to them all. Can we go 
                        to them all? Let’s go to them all.

                                 LENA
                        We’ll go to a lot.

                                 SHAWN
                        You want to start a band? We should 
                        definitely start a band.

           Lena and Izzy exchange looks - they may have unleashed a 
           monster. As they pass an ELECTRONICS REPAIR SHOP -

                                 SHAWN
                        I’ll come up with the name. How 
                        about Hypnocil? Or Mrs. Voorhees. 
                        Or...
           He trails off when he sees the TELEVISION behind the window. 
           He furrows his brow.

                                 LENA
                        What’s wrong?

           Lena and Izzy join him by his side and watch the screen. It’s 
           an old movie playing on VHS.

           A GIRL is screaming and running for her life through a 
           CORNFIELD.

           In the distance, they hear the roar of a CHAINSAW.

                                 LENA
                        Do you hear that?

           They lean forward.

                                 SHAWN
                        Is that getting closer...?

           We wonder if it is as we SMASH TO -

                                       THE END
