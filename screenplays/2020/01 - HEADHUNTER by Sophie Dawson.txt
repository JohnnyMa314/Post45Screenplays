                        M4WM.  I’m thirty-three years old.  
                        Wealthy, bored.  I’ve acquired one 
                        of those “vague” New York jobs that 
                        affords me a hedonistic, sex-driven 
                        lifestyle.  With in-sane free time.

                        I adhere to a strict macrobiotic 
                        diet, grinding up specific protein 
                        shakes myself.  I attend on-trend 
                        fitness classes.  I practice 
                        transcendental meditation when it 
                        is convenient for me to do so.

           CLOSE-UP on a thick, white protein shake.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        That is all I am willing to divulge 
                        at this time.  Perhaps, upon 
                        meeting and determining your 
                        suitability, I may reveal more.

                        A little bit about you.  Male or

                        pleasing to the eye.  Must also

                        about that.  I insist your shampoo

                        Most importantly -- and this is non-
                        negotiable -- you should have a 
                        social media following that spans 
                        at least three platforms and 
                        exceeds 100,000 followers each.

           INT. UBERLUX CAR - DAY

           Meet ALAN PIERCE (33).  Permanent bad mood, Upper West Side 
           looks.  He leans into the creamy interior of a Lexus QS.  

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My name is Alan Pierce.  I am a 
                        cannibal.  My usual day begins in 
                        an UberLUX.  This way, I am 
                        guaranteed a more luxurious 
                        vehicle.  I’ll then take 10 seconds 
                        to determine my driver’s “flavor”.
                             (beat)
                        Salty.  A twist of Alaska Fireweed.

           Alan pops stylish AirPods in his ears.  Sets his phone 
           playlist to “Tropical Island Ambiance”.  Shuts eyes.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The next ten minutes of my commute 
                        is dedicated to achieving “zen”.  
                        This is done by imagining I’m in 
                        the fertile coastal plains of the 
                        Visayas archipelago.

                                 UBERLUX DRIVER
                             (LOUDLY)
                        Want gum?

           UBERLUX DRIVER (45) shoves a hand in his back pocket.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t eat gum that’s been pre-
                        warmed by gluteal muscles.

           Driver shrugs.  Alan returns to ZEN.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The purest of white sands, the 
                        crystal clear waters, the warm sun 
                        kissing the jagged rock paths --

                                 UBERLUX DRIVER
                             (LOUDLY)
                        Did you know it rains diamonds on 
                        the planet Neptune?

           Alan rips out his AirPods.

                                 ALAN
                        Did you know it rains one star

                        “DAVE”, if it keeps talking to me?
           Driver turns forward.  Silent.  Alan looks out the window.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        No matter how exciting I try to 
                        make things, the monotony of my 
                        days is starting to get to me.  I 
                        need a change -- soon.

           INT. SOULCYCLE CLASS - DAY

           Heavy electronic music pulsates from speakers in a DARK ROOM.  
           Strobe lights, sweat, and bike-whooshing cuts steamy air.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Physical fitness is of the utmost 
                        importance so I usually catch a 
                        morning SoulCycle, barre, boot 
                        camp, CrossFit, or hot power yoga 
                        class.  Great for body and soul.

           Alan whips his head back, revealing a glistening, chiseled 
           body dripping in sweat.  Surrounded by equally SEXY RIDERS.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        If I demand my food is in shape, I 
                        must be in shape.  It’s only fair, 
                        and I’m all about fairness.

           A flirty SOULCYCLE RIDER (20’s) perks up next to him.

                                 SOULCYCLE RIDER
                        Hey, handsome!
                             (waves glittery bottle)
                        Wanna sip of collagen?  It’s like, 
                        sooooo good for you.

                                 ALAN
                        I chew my collagen straight.  
                        Thanks.  

                                 SOULCYCLE RIDER
                        Oh.  Is that a new “thing”?

                                 ALAN
                        Are you as irritated by this 
                        playlist as I am?

                                 SOULCYCLE RIDER
                             (shouts over music)
                        WHAT?

                        Nothing.
           INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

           An amorphous mass of overly-styled, frenzied, somewhat bitter 
           NEW YORKERS (engrossed in phones) queue up like meth addicts.

                        After fitness and work emails, we

                        It’s like the world’s gone fucking 
                        insane.  I don’t relate to anything

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A sprawling, stoic conference room.  An absurdly long, 
           threatening table.  Very modern -- no base, it just hovers.

                        I was fired from Google.  I wear

                        Sharp gait.  Nice clothes.  Ralph 
                        Lauren scent.  Tight skin.  He 
                        would be a deeee-light to eat if he 
                        was into that kind of thing.
                             (out loud)
                        Please.  Come in.

           Alan stands to greet him.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I love my job because it’s always 
                        fun to see a person who has just 
                        begun their “New York life”.  That 
                        innocence.  That excitement.  A 
                        rare freshness before it’s expired.

           -- an authoritative handshake.

                                 ALAN
                        Welcome to New York!  You’ll be 
                        destroyed and back to Ohio in less 
                        than three years.  Let’s take a 
                        look at that resume, shall we?

           INT. CRYOGENIC CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Alan stands in a full body, vertical CRYOGENIC CHAMBER.  
           Enveloped in a thick swath of white vapors.  Bright blue 
           lights reflect off fashionable moisture-chamber goggles.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        At the end of a long day of doing 
                        very little, I like to sit naked in 
                        negative 300 degrees Fahrenheit.  
                        Great for body and soul.

           A timer goes off.
                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        If I sit in here long enough, I 
                        imagine I’d turn into that freeze-
                        dried ice cream that NASA space 
                        people eat.  Flavor?  Neapolitan.

           Alan climbs out.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        When I start thinking about how 
                        tasty I’d be as space ice cream, I 
                        know it’s time to leave.

           INT. L'ATELIER DE CHOW CHOW - NIGHT

           Alan sits across from a WOMAN (hiding behind a menu) at an 
           extremely nouvelle, hipster restaurant.  We cannot get in.  
           His eyes dart around each PATRON.  Guessing hair products.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        L’oreal.  Fekkai.  Kerastase.  
                        Probably something cheap like 
                        Garnier.  Oh.  I sense an extremely 
                        pricey brand.  But I cannot 
                        identify it.  Hmmm...

           EMILY OSWALD (26) closes her menu.  Revealed is a stunning 
           woman around twenty-six years old (but says twenty-two).

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        What is that brand?  It’s really 
                        bothering me.  It could potentially 
                        negatively affect my dining 
                        experience.

                                 EMILY
                        Close your menu.  I want to order.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Oribe!  Oribe conditioner.  At $161 
                        per bottle, I could possibly orgasm 
                        right now.  But who is wearing it?

           He looks back at the menu.  She grabs it and closes it for 
           him.  Motions for a waiter.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know what I want.

                                 EMILY
                        We’re ordering off the hidden menu.  
                        I read all about it in New York 
                        Magazine.  We say a secret word!
           Alan grimaces.  Stares blankly at Emily.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It’s really important to date 
                        people you wouldn’t otherwise eat.  
                        Emily is a “micro-influencer” with 
                        20,000 followers tops on only two 
                        platforms.  She’s inedible.

           He grabs for the menu.  She keeps it out-of-reach.

                                 ALAN
                        What if I’m allergic to this so-
                        called “secret menu”?  Is it 
                        macrobiotic friendly? 

                                 EMILY
                        We have to talk. 

           Alan closes his eyes and deeply inhales.

                                 ALAN
                        Smell that?  
                             (leans in, low)
                        Someone is wearing Hugo Boss.

                                 EMILY
                        Alan, I’m serious.

           A probable off-Broadway WAITER (25) with only a small whiff 
           of pretension stops by.  Badge on his vest reads: “TOM”.

                                 WAITER
                        Welcome to L'Atelier de Chow Chow.  
                        May I get you started with drinks?

                                 EMILY
                             (giggle)
                        “Taradiddle”.

           He winks, taking their menus.  Quickly leaves.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        So many people using Pureology 
                        conditioner.  I must get it.

                                 EMILY
                        Listen.  Monogamy is out.  I read 
                        polyamory is the latest fad!  So, 
                        we’re now in an open relationship.
                                 ALAN
                        Absolutely not.  That’s such a --
                             (low, disgust)
                        -- millenial thing.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m going to be auditioning a third 
                        partner for us.  It’s going to be 
                        amazing for our sex life!

                                 ALAN
                        Please, Emily.  I want some 
                        semblance of a normal relationship.  
                        I want to feel semi-traditional.
                             (alarmed)
                        Where are you getting this shit?

                                 EMILY
                        Gwyneth Paltrow says --

                                 ALAN
                        I don't give a flying fuck what 
                        Gwyneth Paltrow says.  I don't even 
                        give a sitting fuck.

           Plopped in front of Alan is a 3-foot-long shovel with food 
           piled on the base.  His face: a mix of repulsion, confusion.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (finger up)
                        Excuse me.  Why is my food being 
                        served on a shovel?

                                 WAITER
                        It's a throw-back to Tokugawa 
                        feudalism, in which traditional 
                        cultivators eschewed capitalistic 
                        entrepreneurship in the Meiji 
                        period. 

                                 ALAN
                        It’s food being served on a shovel.

                                 EMILY
                             (very low)
                        Alan!  My personal shopper had to 
                        call in a favor to get us in here!

           Alan pushes the food away.  Eyes the waiter.

                                 ALAN
                        Put-it-on-a-plate.
                                 EMILY
                        Stop embarrassing me.
                             (to waiter)
                        We’re so sorry --

                                 ALAN
                        You’re talking about trolling 
                        Craigslist for sex partners so our 
                        evenings turn into Vegas brothel 
                        gang-bangs, yet I’m the one 
                        embarrassing you??

           Emily flits her eyelashes at the waiter.

                                 EMILY
                        It looks delicious.  We’re honored 
                        to try it.  Send our regards to the 
                        Chef.  It’s going on my Instagram.
                             (to Alan, very, very low)
                        I’m not getting them off 
                        Craigslist!!

           Alan and the waiter exchange tart, dirty glances.

           INT. KITCHEN CLOSET - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Alan and the waiter have steamy sex in a back stockroom.  
           Silk napkins, tablecloths, and shovels get knocked over.  
           Alan exudes a TOM CRUISE-like menacing, faux-enthusiasm.

                                 ALAN
                        Are you as excited as I am that 
                        Whole Foods avocados are $1.99, 
                        Tom?

                                 WAITER
                        Shut up and FUCK ME!

                                 ALAN
                        How many followers did you say you 
                        had on Facebook, again?

           The waiter is about to climax.  

                                 WAITER
                        137,000.  Oh, Je-Je-Jesus --

                                 ALAN
                        Really impressive.  How come you’re 
                        still a waiter?
                                 WAITER
                             (panting/ecstasy)
                        Do you have any idea how hard it is 
                        to get on Broadway?

           Alan swiftly stabs him in the stomach.  Twists the knife.

                                 ALAN
                        No.  I don’t.

           The waiter’s mouth opens with surprise.  The life drains out 
           of him.  Alan carves up, throwing him against the wall.  He 
           takes out his phone.  The waiter’s Facebook page pops up.

                        I love your social influence.  

           The waiter continues to gag, blood dripping out of his mouth.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        And since you’ll be long dead 
                        before my girlfriend fiscally tips 
                        you, here’s a verbal tip --

                        The majority of people you meet on 
                        Tinder are insane.

           -- but he’s lifeless.  Alan spots a shovel on the ground.  He 
           picks it up.  Thrusts it in the waiter’s (dead) face.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Repeat after me: shovels are not 
                        plates!

           Alan smushes the waiter’s lips up-and-down, pretending that 
           he’s answering back.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (mimic)
                        “Shovels are not plates”.

                        Good boy.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alan tosses apartment keys on a stunning marble counter.  
           Sighs loudly into his hands.  Swings open a big pantry door.
           INSIDE PANTRY.  Hundreds of small and medium-sized plastic 
           containers of white powder.  Some bright white, some dull.

           On each tub is a name.  Becky.  Kendall.  Jessica.  Matt.  
           Sam.  Priscilla.  Heatherton.  Jackson.  Bella.  Taylor.

           He sets a new one on the shelf.  “Tom”.

                                 ALAN
                             (mumbles)
                        I really need a shot of Becky 
                        tonight.

           He takes out a tub marked “Becky”.  Scoops two generous 
           helpings of powder into a blender.  Adds water, ice.  Blends.  

           Notices he’s low.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        “Becky” is an ideal.  High energy, 
                        strong fitness, jubilance.  I met 
                        her at aqua cycling after following 
                        her Instagram page for two weeks.

           INT. ALAN’S WORKSPACE - NIGHT

           Alan sips on his protein shake.  Scrolls through dozens of 
           Instagram model’s pages.  Artistic, beautiful, healthy, and 
           travel-obsessed photos.  All perfectly filtered.  

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Instagram is a gourmet meat market.  
                        Models and yacht girls show so much 
                        skin -- you can inspect every 
                        square inch of the raw product 
                        before acquiring.  It’s helpful.

                        Finally, climate.  Warm climates 
                        lead to softer skin -- much easier 
                        to fry.  Cold climates are better

                        tomorrow.  My night is destroyed.

           Light’s off.

           INT. ALAN’S OFFICE (CORNER) - NEXT MORNING

           Alan anxiously cuts up a 1/2 lemon and cucumber at his desk.  
           Drops a few wedges in a tall, skinny glass of ice water.  

                                 ALAN

           He sinks back in his chair.  Closes eyes.  Takes a sip.

                        I’m in Venezuela.  I'm being

                        but refuse her advances because I’m 
                        still unsure of my sexuality.

                        Alan... CEO... NOW!!

           INT. CEO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Posh office.  Barely any furniture.  The few pieces it has 
           are expensive and very much on-trend.  (Pony chairs, etc.)

           Alan sits on an “active chair”, trying to keep his balance.  
           He furiously swipes right on attractive people on Tinder.

                                 ALAN

                        Would eat.  Would not eat.

           Suddenly a MESSAGE pops up on his phone.
           [RE: CANNIBAL AD]

                                 CEO (O.S.)
                        Alan?

           Alan looks up.  An exceptionally dashing CEO (45) -- almost 
           too perfect to be real -- clasps his hands together.

                                 CEO (CONT'D)
                        It’s serious.  Your last recruit 
                        killed everyone at that company and 
                        it's going to be an extraordinary 
                        feat to scrub it from the media. 

           Alan’s eyes dart down to his phone.  Opens the message.

           [HELLO.  I AM REPLYING TO YOUR AD.  I’M QUITE INTRIGUED AT 
           THE THOUGHT OF BEING EATEN BY SOMEONE LIKE YOU.  YOU’RE 
           PICKY.  I LIKE THAT.  I AM, TOO.]

                                 CEO (CONT'D)
                        Where did you get this hire?  How 
                        did he pass the tests?  Why wasn't 
                        he properly vetted?

           The CEO stirs a warm cup of Mongolian horse milk.  

                                 ALAN
                        He was a friend of a friend of a 
                        friend of a friend that someone 
                        knew and recommended from LinkedIn.

           -- he looks back down at the message.  

           [I HAVE MANY HUMAN RECIPE BOOKS TO SHARE.  IT’S IMPORTANT YOU 
           LOCATE MY BEST CUTS FOR CONSUMPTION.  MY MUSCLE QUALITY IS 
           DIVINE.  YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER MEAL OR MORE SUMPTUOUS 
           FLESH THAN MINE.]

           Alan starts salivating.

                                 CEO
                        Stop using LinkedIn.  It’s the 
                        Myspace of job recruiting.  Jesus, 
                        Alan.  You’re really pathetic 
                        sometimes.

                                 ALAN
                        How can I earn your trust back?

                                 CEO
                        Figure it out.  You know I’m a fan 
                        of Betteridge Tahitian pearls.
                                 ALAN
                        I know.

           The CEO takes another long, disgusting sip of his Mongolian 
           horse milk.  Alan peaks down at his phone.

           [MY THIGH MEAT SHOULD BE BAKED SLOW.  I WANT YOU TO CHOP OFF 
           MY BUTTOCKS AND SMOKE IT FOR 2 HOURS IN HICKORY AND MAPLE 
           WOOD.  TRUST ME WHEN I SAY -- IT WILL MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.]

                                 CEO
                        As punishment, I’m revoking your 
                        overly-generous “success fee”.  
                        Taking away your various and 
                        assorted beauty, clothing, fitness, 
                        and company perks.  Also, I’m 
                        downgrading your company status.

           His chest tightens.  Alan can’t breathe.

                                 ALAN
                        Please... not my status.

                                 CEO

                        I don’t have any fuckboys.

                                 CEO
                        Know why I'm not firing you?

           The blackmail.
                                              The blackmail.

           Alan bows his head in shame.  The CEO drones (unintelligibly) 
           on in the background.  Alan catches the rest of the message.

           [I DON’T HAVE ANY SOCIAL MEDIA FOR REASONS I CANNOT DISCLOSE. 
           HOPE THAT ISN’T A DEAL BREAKER.  IS THAT OK, ALAN?]

           He bristles.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        “Alan”?  I never disclosed my name 
                        in the ad or on the website.

           Alarmed, Alan deletes his CANNIBAL ACCOUNT.  Looks anxiously 
           side to side.  Sweat slowly drips down the back of his neck.

                                 CEO
                        -- do you understand?

           Alan is among VARIOUS COWORKERS wearing the best designers: 
           Brooks Brothers, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Brunello, ETC.

           He sits upright, delicately dabbing sweat from his forehead.  
           His silk kerchief is nearly soaked.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)

           he has ever seen.  PERFECT HEAD (25) is a walking Instagram 
           lifestyle brand.  Effortless, beautiful, stylish, flawless.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        I’m a social influencer.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        -- to post.  Yeah.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The ultimate goal!

           All the coworkers nod to each other.  CEO appears.

                                 CEO
                        She’ll be handling our most 
                        important accounts.  Our hottest 
                        start-ups.  We stole her from 
                        Silicon Valley.

           Alan fights his orgasmic, euphoric daze.  His lustful awe.  
           Tries to keep salivation at a bare minimum.  Grips the table.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I must have her head for my 
                        collection.  Oh God, her taste.  
                        White pearl albino caviar... with 
                        Kobe beef wrapped in gold leaf...

           INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN - DAY

           Alan walks in to warm greetings and bows from SALES STAFF.  
           The store is relaxing, spacious, grandiose.  Old-school 
           glamour.  Luxurious.  The music is classical, relaxing.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        When I’m about to suffer a nervous 
                        breakdown I typically take a trip 
                        to my favorite retail spot -- 
                        Bergdorf Goodman.

                        The last vestige of class in a city 
                        of dwindling influence and tawdry 
                        culture.

           Sparkling, glossy marble floors.  Only the most extravagant 
           brands.  Prada, Jimmy Choo, Gucci, Lanvin, Dolce & Gabbana.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The Italian leather, alone, is 
                        enough to quell agitation.  I feel 
                        like I’m back in old New York where 
                        people dressed-up, had manners, and 
                        status was equally distributed 
                        amongst those who earned it.

           Alan stops and browses a rack of business suits.  A handsome, 
           just-the-right-amount-of-friendly SALES PERSON appears.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Good afternoon, Mr. Pierce.  May I 
                        assist you with anything?

                                 ALAN
                        I have an image problem.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Have you lost status?

           Alan’s miffed by the question.

                                 ALAN
                        What?  No.  I’m just low on my 
                        protein powder.  And I’m being 
                        stalked by someone I don’t know.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        I have just the suit.

           The sales person leaves.  Alan sits on a velvety couch, 
           easily at a cost of $20,000.  He closes his eyes, feeling it.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Loss of status at work means lesser 
                        events, lesser social capital, 
                        lesser friends, lesser access to 
                        premium heads!  I must fix this.

           He catches himself clawing his fingers into the couch.  
           Quickly stops.  Smooths out the marks.

           The sales person returns with a lavish Kiton textured solid 
           two-piece suit in high blue.  Price tag: $8,495.
                                 SALES PERSON
                        It’s in your size.

                                 ALAN
                        I’ll take it.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Shall I ring you out?

                                 ALAN
                        One minute.

           INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN - WOMEN’S SECTION - DAY

           Alan browses polychromatic racks of brilliant Hermé’s silk 
           scarves and kerchiefs.  He carefully picks up each one, 
           feeling the quality.  Appreciating the artistic design. 

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Are you looking for one in 
                        particular?

                                 ALAN
                        I think I found it.  May you gift 
                        wrap it?  It’s for someone special.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Of course.

           INT. SOULCYCLE CLASS - NIGHT

           THE POST-WORK RUSH.  Career-obsessed riders (fully made-up) 
           furiously spin to the highly addictive, upbeat pop music.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’m back in SoulCycle, trying to 
                        forget everything.  I’m really 
                        feeling the music.  The pulse 
                        radiates through me, and it’s, you 
                        know, jazzing me.  Although the 
                        lyrics are unintelligible, I still 
                        feel they could apply to my life.

           He listens to the lyrics a bit more, straining to hear.  
           Expression drops.  He turns to a SOULCYCLE RIDER next to him.

                                 ALAN
                        Oh, God.  Is this Miley Cyrus?

                                 SOULCYCLE RIDER
                        It’s the Miley Cyrus spin class.
                                 ALAN
                        This doesn’t relate to me at all!

           He keeps spinning as fast as he can.  Sweat pours down his 
           muscles, dripping onto the slick floor.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The girl in front of me has a 
                        virtually perfect backside -- but 
                        her bobbing head prevents me from 
                        viewing the instructor.  It’s 
                        really pissing me off as I need to 
                        see the instructor's visual cues.

                                 INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                        OK, guys!  Faster!  Let’s do this!!

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I can’t stop thinking about how low 
                        I am.  Specifically in fitness 
                        protein powder.  What will I eat 
                        when I get home?  How will I 
                        sustain myself?  I’m desperate.

           The rider in front of him, JESSICA (22), energetic, buoyant, 
           and clad head-to-toe in Lululemon, loudly snaps her gum.

                                 JESSICA
                             (shouting over music, to a 
                              girl next to her)
                        It’s called SugarBear and the 
                        Kardashian’s totally shill them.  
                        Every time I post myself with a 
                        bottle, I get ten thousand dollars!

                                 GIRL NEXT TO HER
                        You’re sooo lit, girl.  I have to 
                        add you.  What’s your IG handle?

           Alan grabs his phone.  Fingers waiting.

                                 GIRL IN FRONT
                        Bubbles8.  B as in BUBBLES, and 8 
                        as in EIGHT!  Like, the number.

           -- her page pops up.  INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS: 350K.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Time to refill.

           Suddenly, the GIRL NEXT TO HER’s leg falls off.  She keeps 
           spinning like nothing has happened.  Alan’s disgusted.
           EXT. SOULCYCLE CLASS, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Alan lingers by the doorway.  Seductively stretching -- 
           pretending to be somewhat aloof.  Flashes juuust the right 
           amount of muscle.  A dominant expression on his face.

           Of course, he catches Jessica’s eye. 

                                 ALAN
                        I noticed you in class.

                                 JESSICA
                        I’m noticing you right now.

                                 ALAN
                        I’m a model scout for Nike.  We’re 
                        looking for semi-sporty social 
                        influencers, such as yourself, for 
                        an online campaign.

           Jessica takes the card.  Giddy.  Alan closes in on her, 
           smelling her closely.  Slightly intoxicated.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        How youthful!  Victoria's Secret 
                        hair major shine shampoo.  A hint 
                        of L'occitane facial oil in lemon.

           Gets a little aggressive.

                                 ALAN
                        Of course, there are so many 
                        Instagram models who would kill to 
                        be in your situation right now.  
                        What makes you... different?

                                 JESSICA
                        Find a back room.  I’ll blow you to 
                        Mars and back.  You can film it.

                                 ALAN
                             (caught-off-guard)
                        That’s, ah -- that’s something.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hold on.

           She pinches her nipples.  Pouts for a post-workout selfie.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Has everyone always been a feral 
                        sex pig, or has the invent of the 
                        smart phone created this new breed?  
                        I may reflect on this, later.
           INT. STEAM ROOM - NIGHT

           Clothes fly as they strip.  It’s a bamboo steam room.  Alan 
           takes time to pour water on the hot rocks.  MORE STEAM.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Full disclosure: I‘m asexual.  Sex 
                        is neither here nor there for me.  
                        Naked bodies are mere anatomy.  The 
                        only impact it’s had on my life is 
                        making it quite hard to “fit in”.

           Jessica poses against the wall.  Arms stretched above her 
           head, back arched as much as humanly possible.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        But it’s really important to kill 
                        your meat, male or female, in the 
                        throes of an exceptional orgasm.  
                        That’s how you get the best taste.  
                        Consensual killing is preferable, 
                        but if you can’t get that -- which, 
                        let’s face it, you can’t -- then 
                        you manipulate the situation.

           Jessica bites her lower lip.

                                 ALAN
                        Is that body glitter?

                                 JESSICA
                        Cute, right?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  Glitter gets twisted up in the 
                        intestines something fierce.

           She intertwines her fingers around his neck.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Are you gluten-free?  Are your 
                        skincare products organic?

                                 JESSICA
                        I don’t know.  I don’t really think 
                        about it.  You’re really handsome.

           Alan checks himself out in the frosted glass as he thrusts in 
           an apathetic-yet-methodical way.  Re-parts his hair.

                                 ALAN
                        Gluten is included in such products 
                        as pasta, bread, crackers.  What’s 
                        your sugar intake like?
                                 JESSICA
                             (moaning)
                        Why do you care about my diet?  
                        Gonna cook me dinner after this?

                                 ALAN
                        No.

           She kneels to start a blow job.  He stops her.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        This is all about you, darling.  
                        Not me.  Just relax.  Get up.

           Alan digs his fingers into her hips.  Pumps quickly.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I have to remember to schedule my 
                        bi-annual dental cleaning on 
                        Thursday.  Preferably with Flavia, 
                        my favorite hygienist.

           Jessica grips the walls.  Panting. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh, my Godddd --
                             (breathless)
                        Where’s my phone?  Can you film us?  
                        I want to watch it later.

                                 ALAN
                        No.

                                 JESSICA
                        I WANT TO WATCH IT LATER!

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My God...

           Screams gets louder.  He muffles her.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        This is it!  Almost there...

           She shudders in euphoric ecstasy...  

           An ORGASMIC SCREAM... a TIGHTER GRIP... NAILS CLAW SKIN...

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        CLOSER, CLOSER.  ALMOST THERE.

           He plunges a knife deep into her back.  She collapses.
           INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

           Alan slumps Jessica’s body, bleeding, over a radiator.  The 
           stall has its own mirror and sink.  He carefully opens up a 
           travel kit of sharp culinary knives.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Pro tip: No guts, no gory.  
                        Avoiding the intestines is a must.  
                        That really caused a scene at Tao.

           He works quickly, precisely.  Chops up Jessica.  

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I cannot control her diet or 
                        disease she may carry.  But her 
                        social influence makes up for any 
                        spoilage.  Everything cooks out!

           He makes two swift “marker” indentations.  A tad below the 
           groin on each leg.  One above the kneecap.  He cleanly slices 
           off the right leg.  It promptly drops to the ground.  

           -- but it’s a hard thud.  Not the usual “soft thud” of flesh, 
           bones, and skin.  Bounces up and down.  Rattles a bit.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        In all my hunting, I’ve never heard 
                        a leg make that sound before.  Was 
                        she lying about her influence?

           He’s perplexed.  Picks up her phone to confirm.

                                 ALAN
                        Hmm.  

           He shrugs.  Chops into her carotid arteries.  Swiftly 
           draining her blood into the private stall sink.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (mutters)
                        Armpits to shoulder.  Break the 
                        joint of the elbow.  Quarter the 
                        carcass.  Blah, blah, blah.

           He seals her parts in different Hefty bags.  Labeling them.  
           Hands.  Upper Thigh.  Buttocks.  Shoving them in his Louis 
           Vuitton shoulder bag.  Blood still fills the sink.
                                 JANITOR (O.S.)
                        Anyone in there?

           Alan, alarmed, looks up.  Covered in blood -- holding an arm.  
           He wipes sweat off his forehead.

                                 ALAN
                             (shouts)
                        Yes there is someone fucking in 
                        here.  Can I get some PRI-VA-CY???

           -- he returns to butchering.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (hums Miley Cyrus)
                        “It’s a party in the USA...” 
                             (catches himself)
                        DAMN THAT MILEY CYRUS SPIN CLASS!

           INT. ALAN’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP on Alan.  He’s carefully preserving the head of 
           Jessica, styling her hair and touching up her make-up.

           Applies a waxy, glossy finish to her head.  It’s PLASTIFIED.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I use almost every part of the 
                        body, but the most important 
                        appendage is the head.  It’s 
                        displayed in my trophy room.

           WE PAN OUT.  It’s a huge studio filled with pretty heads 
           preserved and mounted on the walls.  Over 200, at least.  

           All ethnicities.  All genders.  Alan walks over to a blank 
           space and hangs Jessica.  Backs up.  Admires his work.

                                 NEARBY HEADS (O.S.)
                             (echo)
                        Hello, Alan.

                                 ALAN
                        Why hello, my sweethearts!  How was 
                        your day?

                                 NEARBY HEADS (O.S.)
                             (echo)
                        Wonderful, Alan!

           Each head has a vibrant expression.  Fully “real” -- but have 
           the “look” of Barbie dolls.  They longingly stare at Alan.  
           Alan unpacks Jessica’s parts.  Works on a long, cool slab of 
           marble.  Separating (and furiously scrubbing) her bones.

                                 ALAN
                        I read today that in five years, 
                        anyone will be able to deliberately 
                        engineer a pandemic.  Isn’t that a 
                        frightful thought?

           One of many mounted heads, HALEY HEAD (21), turns to him.

                                 HALEY HEAD
                        Just ghastly!

           Alan zips up a careful selection of Jessica’s bones into 
           another large plastic Hefty bag.  Takes out a sharpie.

                                 ALAN
                             (to Jessica’s Head)
                        Cupcake -- what did you say your 
                        name was, again?

                                 JESSICA HEAD
                        Jessica.

                                 ALAN
                        Jessica, Jessica.  So many 
                        Jessica’s.

           Alan writes “JESSICA/FITNESS MIX” on the bag.  Shoves it 
           inside his Louis Vuitton shoulder bag.

           INT. ALAN’S STUDIO, DINING TABLE - NIGHT

           Alan sits.  White cloth napkin tucked into his shirt.  He 
           grips silver utensils at a well-set table.  In front of him 
           is a delicious looking meal of HUMAN MEAT.  Cilantro garnish.

                                 ALAN 
                        I would Instagram this, but that’s 
                        too meta, even for me.

           Across from him, perched on the table, is Alan’s favorite 
           head.  TRISHA HEAD (28).  She’s soft, delicate.  Wearing 
           pearls and smiling.  A plate of Jessica sits in front of her.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        You’re funny, Alan.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Trisha is my current prize.  She 
                        had 1.2 million Instagram 
                        followers.

                                 ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She was actually in love with me, 
                        too, despite being engaged to a 
                        young hedge fund manager at Goldman 
                        Sachs.  Her real love for me made 
                        her taste that much sweeter.

           Alan reaches behind him.

                                 ALAN
                        I was thinking about you today.  I 
                        got you something.

           He slides over the present from Bergdorf’s.  The wrapping is 
           luxurious -- gold leaf paper, black satin ribbons.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        Oh?

                                 ALAN
                        It’s a Hermés Rocaille silk scarf 
                        with hand rolled edges.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                             (excited)
                        From Bergdorf’s?

                                 ALAN
                        Yes.

                                 NEARBY HEADS (O.S.)
                             (echo)
                        She’s so lucky!  She’s the 
                        favorite!

           He lifts it out of the box.  Ties it around her neck.  He 
           holds up a mirror to her face.  She gasps with pleasure.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        I love it.  It’s my color.

                                 ALAN
                        Are you enjoying Jessica’s lung?  
                        It’s an excellent source of iron.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        She’s cooked to perfection.

                                 ALAN
                        I tried a new recipe.  Left a 
                        little more of it raw.

           Alan cleans up the dishes.  Tidies up the studio, his tools.  
           Swings his Louis Vuitton shoulder bag around his chest.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Good night, everyone.

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        I love you, Alan!

                                 ALAN
                        I know, Trisha.  I love you, too.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Emily stands in front of a very high-tech refrigerator.  
           Kitchen is exceptionally modern.  She squints at the fridge’s 
           touch-screen door.  Goes over next week’s Whole Foods order.

                                 EMILY
                             (to fridge)
                        I’d like to try asparagus water.  
                        Please add that to the list.

           Alan sets his bag of bones on the counter.  Takes out a very 
           powerful grinder.  Starts attaching steel grinding plates.  

           Clears his throat.

                                 ALAN
                        Someone’s leg fell off in spin 
                        class today. 

                                 EMILY
                             (distracted)
                        Honey, it’s very hard to keep all 
                        your limbs in New York.

                                 ALAN
                        I know, but, she wasn’t --

           He dumps his bag of bones into the grinder.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        -- even sorry about it.  She didn’t 
                        care.  It’s the arr-o-gance that 
                        really gets me.  You know?

                                 EMILY
                        How was work?

                                 ALAN
                             (mumbles)
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

           Alan turns it on.  It starts loudly grinding.  Crunching up 
           the bones into a fine white powder.  Emily shrugs.
                                 EMILY
                        Alan.  Did you lose status?

                                 ALAN
                             (shouts over noise)
                        WHAT?

           She points to the grinder.

                                 EMILY
                        IS THAT A NEW SUPERFOOD?

           Alan shuts it off.

                                 ALAN
                        -- yes.

           He taps the powder into a small plastic container.  Writes 
           “Jessica” in permanent marker.  The doorbell rings.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Who is that?

                                 EMILY
                        The threesome partner interviews 
                        are tonight!

                                 ALAN
                        The what?

                                 EMILY
                        It’s a group interview.  

                                 ALAN
                        Why is this happening at my 
                        apartment?

                                 EMILY
                        You have the most impressive set-
                        up.  I can't have them in Queens.  
                        Besides --
                             (wink, sing-song)
                        I was able to convince that 
                        Instagram girl to come.  The one 
                        you sent me the liiink to!

                                 ALAN
                        Really?

           Emily motions towards his bone power.

                                 EMILY
                        Make some shots of that for our 
                        guests.  Throw some tumeric in it!

           Alan’s expression is flat.

           INT. ALAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Three “hopefuls” sit on a fur-trimmed couch:  

           1 - TIFFANY (24).  Attractive.  Little over-weight.  
           Obsessively glued to her phone.                                           
           2 - AVA (25).  Plain.  Blond model-esque.  Bored.                      
           3 - DAMIEN (28).  Dressed like a GQ Magazine ad.  It’s unreal 
           how perfect his physique, clothing, and posture are.

           Emily puts pink reading glasses on.  Takes notes on a gold-
           striped Kate Spade clip board.  Very matter-of-fact.    

           They each take a protein shake shot.

                                 ALAN
                        Well.  
                             (beat)
                        What do you think?

           Everyone shrugs.  

                                 DAMIEN
                             (loud sigh)
                        I’ve had better at Beverly Hills 
                        Juice.  When I’m in LA.  Which is a 
                        lot.

           Alan grimaces.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It’s strange because neither of 
                        those girls looks like the 
                        Instagram model’s page I forwarded 
                        to Emily...

           He takes out his phone.  Starts searching.

                                 EMILY
                        So, this is Alan.  This is me.  
                        We’re exploring a polyamorous 
                        relationship.  We’re looking for a 
                        third member to complete us in the 
                        bedroom!  Maybe spend some time 
                        outside the bedroom.  Right, Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        Actually, I never wan--
           Emily offers beautifully decorated, tiny pastries.

                                 EMILY
                        Let’s talk positions.  Girls, are 
                        you familiar with double cowgirl, 
                        double dip, and the doggy train?

                                 TIFFANY
                        I usually like being the middle of 
                        a doggy deluxe.  If it’s with two 
                        guys, I’m a pro at the Eiffel Tower 
                        -- this dessert tastes so good.  
                        Where did you get it?  
                             (badly pronounced)
                        Le Mille Feuille?

           Alan cringes at the butchered French.

                                 EMILY
                        It’s a whiskey-pecan babka.  The 
                        bakery is hidden inside an old 
                        Tribeca office building.

                                 TIFFANY
                        That’s like, so chic.

           Emily turns to Damien.

                                 DAMIEN
                        I like double penetration, if 
                        you’re up for it.  Double oral.  
                        Also --
                             (eyes Alan)
                        The spit roast.  If your girlfriend 
                        doesn’t mind. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’d be open to the spit roast.  I 
                        want to go outside my comfort zone, 
                        you know?  I really want to live!

           Ignoring them, Alan stares at Ava.

                                 ALAN
                        I normally eat models.

                                 AVA
                        What?

                                 ALAN
                        I normally date models.
                                 AVA
                             (flippant)
                        I am a model.

                                 ALAN
                        For what?  Reddit memes?

           Emily cheerily offers a fig tart.

                                 EMILY
                             (beam)
                        It’s from Balthazar.

           Alan looks down at his phone.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Alan, will you please focus?

           Emily turns a page on her clipboard.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Ava, darling, would you be willing 
                        to attend a yoga class or two with 
                        me each week?  Maybe pottery?

                                 ALAN
                        I thought I asked for --

           He holds up his phone.  Shows Tiffany’s Instagram page to 
           Tiffany.  He points aggressively.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        -- this one.

                                 TIFFANY
                        That’s me!

                                 ALAN
                        How many filters are on these 
                        things?  Who are you fooling?

                                 TIFFANY
                        I --

                                 ALAN
                        No.  Either look like your photos, 
                        or don’t take them.  It’s very 
                        confusing to people who are, you 
                        know, looking for things.

                                 TIFFANY
                        What sort of things?

           Alan stares at Damien.
                                 ALAN
                        Where’s your social media? 

                                 DAMIEN
                        I don’t have any.  I’m my own 
                        living, breathing, walking brand.

                                 ALAN
                        I’m leaving.  
                             (to Emily)
                        I’ve assessed your candidates and 
                        this entire situation fails.

           Alan storms out.  Slams the door.  Brief, awkward pause.  He 
           comes back in, realizing his mistake.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        This is my apartment.  Get out.  

           INT. PERFECT HEAD’S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Alan sits across from Perfect Head in her office.  She’s 
           deeply engrossed in her phone.  Outfit: revealing, edgy.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        A perfect face has the best 
                        symmetry possible.  Uses the Greek 
                        beauty ratio Phi.  There are 12 key 
                        points on the face -- you always 
                        aim to hit someone who has 85% 
                        symmetry.  Or higher.  

           -- her ruby nails click loudly on the desk.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        One minute.  Just have to update.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The suppleness of that skin.  That 
                        hair.  I can barely concentrate.  I 
                        just want one bite.  Her protein 
                        would be amazing.  I truly believe 
                        I could be a wholly different 
                        person if I could just taste her...

           She finishes typing.  Sets her phone down on the table.  
           Crosses her arms and waits.  Stares directly at Alan.

           SUDDENLY it vibrates an explosion of “likes”/“comments” for 5 
           SOLID MINUTES.  Buzzes so hard, it moves across the table.  

           Alan gawks.
                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        The CEO said you have some leads to 
                        give me?

           Alan slides over a crisp stationary notecard.

                                 ALAN
                        These are -- were -- my top three 
                        accounts.  Very hard to recruit for 
                        Transient corp, many don’t want to 
                        work for the CEO.  He’s a villain.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Listen, Derek.  That your name?

                                 ALAN
                        Alan.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Alan.  I’m a villain.  I fuck my 
                        candidates.  Blackmail vice 
                        presidents.  Strap people down, 
                        make them beg for the job like 
                        dogs.  I hire kids of billionaires.  
                        Take bribes.  I’ve literally 
                        chopped the dick off the CEO of 
                        Transient corp.

           She whips the notecard up.  Snaps a photo.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’m speechless.  And I can almost 
                        swear one of her rings are made 
                        from a certain type of pink coral 
                        exclusive to the Maldives.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                             (looks at accounts)
                        I can recruit these companies with 
                        my eyes closed.  During laser hair 
                        removal.  It’s not even fun for me.

                                 ALAN
                        Do you use La Mer?  On your face?

           She’s surprised by the question.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        I use baby fetuses on my face.  I 
                        love that smooth, post-fetus glow.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                             (ecstasy)
                        Baby fetuses...
           She tap-tap-taps her diamond Cartier watch.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Let’s grab a late lunch.  BG 
                        restaurant, OK?  You can give me 
                        the dirt on our coworkers.

           INT. BG RESTAURANT - DAY

           Oh-so-popular eating spot.  Nestled on the 7th floor of 
           Bergdorf Goodman.  Stunning views of Central Park.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’m on edge.  All that’s left is 
                        her dietary regiment.  It can make 
                        or break my perfect meal.

           A WAITER stops by their table.  He curiously looks like the 
           waiter Alan stabbed earlier.  His badge reads “TOM”.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        I’ll have the Gotham salad.
                             (shuts menu)
                        I just love Bergdorf’s.  Don’t you?

           -- he relaxes at her order.  But bristles at “TOM”.

                                 WAITER
                        Mr. Pierce, good to see you back.  
                        Gotham salad, as well?

                                 ALAN
                             (terse)
                        Please.

           Perfect Head clicks away on her phone.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Excuse me for being on my phone at 
                        lunch.  With millions of followers, 
                        I have to keep up.

                                 ALAN
                        I understand.

           Alan scans the dining room.  Spots Damien sitting alone at a 
           table for two in a prime spot.  Near a large window.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        That guy looks... familiar.  Why?
                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Have you heard of devil’s breath?  
                        It’s this sweet little drug from 
                        Columbia.  I have, you know, people 
                        who get it for me, and let’s just 
                        say --

           Two $28 Gotham salad’s are gently placed before them.

                                 PERFECT HEAD (CONT'D)
                        -- it’s how I move people from 
                        Apple to Tesla.  You really have to 
                        take extreme measures to get ahead, 
                        Alan.  Know what I’m saying?

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’m absolutely bemused and 
                        delighted by what I’m hearing.

           He glances over again.  Damien stares directly at him, his 
           own Gotham salad untouched.  Alan shifts uncomfortably.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Oh, God.  Is that the guy from last 
                        night?  No, it can’t be.  Can it?  
                        Is his... a Gotham Salad, as well?

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        -- and I mean, I had no choice but 
                        to fuck him AND the brother AND the 
                        son.  But I closed the account!  
                        Like I always say: open your legs, 
                        close the account.  Men do it, too.  
                        So what, I’ll stoop to their level!

           The waiter refills their Chardonnay.  Alan grabs the waiter’s 
           wrist quickly and aggressively.  Tightens his grip, releases.

                                 ALAN
                        Just get us the check, Tom, we 
                        don’t need your services anymore.

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                             (oblivious)
                        What’s with the CEO?  He’s 
                        definitely murdered someone, right?  
                        I’m getting total kill-vibes.  

                                 ALAN
                        Aren’t you going to photograph your 
                        salad?  For Instagram?

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Foodgramming is out.
                                 ALAN
                        I thought it might be.  I didn’t 
                        want to be presumptuous, though.

           Alan eats.  Really feels the heat from Damien’s stare.  He 
           glances over again -- Damien is still looking at him, 
           unwavering in his gaze.  Alan dabs his mouth.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Will you excuse me?

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                        Of course, dear.

           INT. DAMIEN’S TABLE - DAY

           Alan adjusts his silk pocket square.  Walks over to Damien.  
           Puts two fingers on the table, leaning in.

                                 ALAN
                             (low)
                        No need to stare at me.  I know I’m 
                        attractive.  I don’t want a male in 
                        our affairs because I‘m worried my 
                        girlfriend will run off with you.  
                        We’ve decided on one of the girls.

           Damien slowly stirs an expresso.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        So.  If you’ll kindly take the 
                        rejection, that would be great.

           Alan brusquely heads for the bathroom.

                                 DAMIEN (O.S.)
                             (semi-loud)
                        That’s not why I’m here, Alan.

           INT. BG RESTAURANT, BATHROOM - DAY

           -- Damien hot on his trail.  He shoves Alan up against the 
           gilded sink, shoulders backed up against the mirror.  The 
           bathroom ATTENDANT looks away, quiet.

                                 DAMIEN
                        I answered your ad.  You deleted 
                        your account.

                                 ALAN
                        What?
                                 DAMIEN
                        I answered your --
                             (eyes attendant, lowers 
                              voice)
                        -- the cannibal ad.  You deleted 
                        your account.

           Alan accidentally knocks over a porcelain soap dish.  A 
           beautiful, hand-carved soap from Monaco drops on the floor.

                                 ALAN
                        How did you find me?

                                 DAMIEN
                        I know everywhere you go.  I know 
                        every place you eat.  I know 
                        everything you do.  I’m so turned 
                        on by you.  Why did you delete your 
                        account?  I just want to be eaten 
                        by you.  Eat me.
                             (intensely)
                        Fucking eat me, Alan!

                                 ALAN
                        You’re not my type.

           He tries to uncomfortably move aside.  But Damien won’t let 
           him move an inch.  He stands firm.

                                 DAMIEN
                        What?  Handsome isn’t your type?  
                        I’m 6’3” tall, 189 pounds, 0% body 
                        fat.  My diet is flawless.  My skin 
                        products, flawless.  My clothes --

           He whips out his arm.  Grabs his suit cuff.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        -- are tailored.  They come from 
                        here, Alan.  Bergdorf Goodman.  I’m 
                        as obsessed with Bergdorf Goodman 
                        as you are.  What more do you want?  
                        I meet every criteria of your ad, 
                        except --

                                                         DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                           ALAN
           No social media.
                                              No social media.

           Alan flashes a fake, tight smile at the attendant.  He talks 
           to Damien through gritted teeth.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        And I was pretty specific in my 
                        “ad” that that was a deal breaker.
                                 DAMIEN
                        I am your best meal.  Do you need 
                        to see my medical records?  My 
                        little black book of conquests?  Do 
                        you want a piece of my skin?

                                 ALAN
                        You have no followers.  No social 
                        capital.  You look good, but you’ll 
                        taste awful.

           Damien takes out a Victorinox swiss army knife.

                                 DAMIEN
                        Have a sample of me.  Right now.

           He starts to carve...

                                 ALAN
                        No.  You’re empty calories.  You’re 
                        bad meat.  Get it?  You’re bad 
                        meat.  I won’t eat you.  Stop.

                                 DAMIEN
                             (desperate)
                        My python shoes have their own 
                        passport.

           Alan considers this.  He then shoves Damien down to the 
           floor, digging a loafer into his back.  Showing dominance.  

           He turns to the sink and washes his hands.  Damien glares at 
           him from below.  The attendant offers Alan a towel.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Towel, Sir?

                                 ALAN
                        Please.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        After-meal chocolate, Sir?

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t -- OK, well, what brand?  
                        To’ak?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        No.  It’s a Knipschildt truffle.

                                 ALAN
                             (loud sigh)
                        Fine!
           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Alan bursts into his kitchen.  Shoes skid across the floor.  
           He makes a beeline for his pantry, ripping it open.  

                                 ALAN
                        Where is it... where is it...

           Protein shake containers are jostled.  Knocked over.  He 
           searches through them with an almost haphazard paranoia.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Where is Viola?  I need ZEN!!  
                        Viola was a fantastic yoga 
                        instructor on the S.S. Antoinette 
                        cruise to Switzerland.

           Slams the pantry shut.  Paces the kitchen.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I need ZEN!!!!!  Unacceptable.  
                        Damien has rattled me to my core.  
                        Where is my powder going?  Am I 
                        really eating that much?
                             (screams)
                        EMILY?

           Alan re-opens up the pantry.  Keeps searching.  Digs in the 
           back, finally locating a small vial marked “VIOLA”.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Order restored.  Phew.

           -- EMPTY.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        WHAT!  My current cortisol levels 
                        are nearly killing me, I --
                             (verge-of-insanity, 
                              gripping counter)
                        I NEED A SHOT OF ZEN!

           Beyond irritated, he makes himself a glass of ice water with 
           lemon and cucumber.  Takes a sip.  Shuts his eyes, tightly.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (rather aggressive)
                        I’m in Mount Kailash, Tibet.  I’m 
                        tapping into the energy of buddha 
                        Cakrasamvara to achieve supreme 
                        bliss as I gaze out into the 
                        endless river peaks.

           Alan shakes his head.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Nothing.  DAMN!  

           INT. ALAN’S WORKSPACE - DAY

           Alan stares at a computer screen.  It reflects off his eyes.  
           He opens up a list of bookmarks on his web browser: 

           ZEN MODELS - LA                                                     
           ZEN MODELS - NYC                                                    
           ZEN MODELS - MILAN, etc.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It’s important to always have a 
                        stash of models in case of 
                        emergencies, such as this.  

           Clicks ZEN MODELS - LA.  Scrolls through attractive men and 
           women in yoga-esque poses.  FOLLOWERS all in 200K-400K range.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I then locate their current 
                        whereabouts on the Snapchat map.  A 
                        dangerous feature, but really 
                        helpful for people like me.  I’m 
                        feeling hot -- I wonder if anyone 
                        from LA is in NYC for the evening.

           The Snapchat map opens on Alan’s phone.  Various model’s 
           locations pop up around the city.  Some within close range.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        They hang out at a mix of exclusive 
                        spots I’ve already secured access 
                        to via my stellar status.  
                        Thankfully word hasn’t gotten out 
                        about my demotion at work.  Yet.

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

           Alan is dressed in his best Emporio Armani suit.  Tightens 
           starched cuffs in front of a mirror.  Opens up an impressive 
           drawer of over sixty polished, sharpened knives.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Your hunting knife must have a 
                        razor sharp edge and be made of the 
                        highest quality steel.  It should 
                        be able to flawlessly cut flesh, 
                        sever muscle, and go through bone.

           He takes out a phenomenal-looking knife.
                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My Sukenari zdp189 Damascus Sujhiki 
                        Japanese chef knife will do.

           It’s placed inside a secret pocket within his sport coat.  
           Next, a watch drawer is opened.  About 30 are on display.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        A striking watch in the mid-six-
                        figures elevates status tenfold.

           He straps on his Cartier Rotonde de Cartier Astrotourbillon.  
           Also known as: “I’m on the list”.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        In four hours, the hunt begins.

           INT. TOP OF THE STANDARD BAR - NIGHT

           The place to be seen (after 10pm).  Well-heeled, extravagant 
           penthouse lounge.  Strict dress code.  Alan leans against a 
           bar, scanning the “in” crowd for his Instagram model TARGET.

           A BARTENDER pops up.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What’ll it be?

                        What the fuck is your problem?

           Alan slides over a $100 bill.

                        Coming up!

           In a sea of influence, he finally spots LA Instagram model 
           MINKA (26).  Gorgeous, obvious fitness model.  She’s with a 
           group of equally-attractive friends.  All with minty Mojitos.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Stunning head.  Stunning clothing.  
                        Stunning choice of drink.  I feel 
                        calmer just by smelling her, by 
                        being in such close proximity.  
                        Just one sip of her protein shake!

                        I’ll be able to sort my life out a 
                        little bit better after that.

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Do I look enough like my photos 
                        now?

           Alan turns around.  It’s Tiffany -- from the failed threesome 
           meet-up.  She’s 100% looking down, typing into her phone.  
           Still looks nothing like her Instagram photos.

                                 ALAN 
                        You’d be more recognizable if you 
                        walked around holding a large 
                        filter box.  How did you get in?

                                 BARTENDER
                             (to Alan)
                        Here’s your minty Mojito.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Thanks!

           She grabs it, downing it in one gulp.  No eye contact.  She 
           snaps duck-face selfies with a “GOOD VIBES ONLY” phone cover.

                                 ALAN
                        That drink cost $112.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well?  You gonna buy me mozzarella 
                        sticks, or what?  I’m vegan.

                                 ALAN
                        No.

                                 TIFFANY
                        We gonna have a ménage à 
                        cinco later, or what?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  My girlfriend and I have 
                        decided to go with another 
                        candidate.  How did you get in??

                                 TIFFANY
                        Fucked the bouncer.

                                 ALAN
                        But how??

           -- Tiffany keeps typing away.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Can you make eye contact with me 
                        for one minute?  Why are you so 
                        obsessed with your phone?

                                 TIFFANY
                             (distracted)
                        What?

           She looks up.  Alan’s seat is empty.

           INT. TOP OF THE STANDARD BAR, DIFFERENT AREA - NIGHT

           Alan moves through the liquored-up, VIP crowd.  Stalks out 
           Minka.  She’s across the room.  Toned arms and drool worthy 
           legs paired with a sequin mini-skirt.  She’s laughing.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’ll appear from behind.  Slowly 
                        introduce myself.  I look so good 
                        tonight she’ll barely be able to 
                        contain herself.  And then --

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Give me your phone number.  So we 
                        can text.

           -- she’s back.  Alan grips her by both shoulders.

                                 ALAN
                        Get lost or I will kill you.  This 
                        is not a threat.  It’s reality.

                                 TIFFANY 
                        Sounds hot!

           Minka is six feet away.  He edges past lithe bodies, 
           percolating smoke, and a couple making out on the floor.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        God.  Get a room!
                             (laser focus on Minka)
                        Closer.  Closer...  my prey...

           FLASH of a camera.  Tiffany smiles.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m gonna tag us at this bar.

                                 ALAN
                             (white-hot rage)
                        No, no, I can’t be photographed 
                        here -- delete that!
           Alan angrily grabs for her “GOOD VIBES ONLY”-covered phone, 
           but she waves it tauntingly.  Just-out-of-reach.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Let me guess.  Don’t want your 
                        giiiirlfriend to know you’re here?  
                        Tsk, tsk!

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My mission is over.  It’s been 
                        completely destroyed.  I can’t be 
                        traced here.  Minka is too high-
                        profile.  I’ll be caught.

           He adjusts his personality.

                                 ALAN
                        You know, Tiffany, there’s a new 
                        filter going around the highest of 
                        social circles.  Very elite.  I 
                        think you’d really like it.  Would 
                        you like to see it?

                                 TIFFANY
                             (excitedly)
                        DUH!

           Alan reaches inside his jacket.

           INT. TOP OF THE STANDARD BAR, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Tiffany’s dead body is slammed against a beautiful mosaic 
           tile wall.  Blood drips out of her bruised mouth.

                                 ALAN
                        It’s called the DEATH FILTER!  
                        YEAH?  WHAT DO YOU THINK?
                             (beat)
                        Also, “ménage à cinco” isn’t a 
                        thing.  It’s just: ORGY!

           -- her body slides down, but he yanks it back up.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Want to engage me?  Do not spend 
                        the entirety of our conversation on 
                        your phone.  OK?  It’s a pet peeve 
                        that leads to irrational angst and 
                        irritability.  Ultimately ending in 
                        a side effect of D-E-A-T-H.

           Alan grabs her phone and takes a “selfie” of her.  He posts 
           the obviously dead-faced image on her Instagram app.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        NO FILTER!!!!!!  LOOK HOW MUCH FUN 
                        WE’RE HAVING!!  GOOD VIBES ONLY!!!
                             (looks around)
                        There’s no room to work in here.  
                        But I can’t like, leave her here.

           He starts to dismember Tiffany in the tight stall.  It’s very 
           uncomfortable as it’s a really small space.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        You’d really kill me if you knew I 
                        posted a photo without a filter, 
                        huh?  Aren’t I just the worst??

           Her phone starts buzzing and vibrating.  Curious, Alan peaks 
           it, grabbing it with a bloody hand.  The selfie post is 
           getting an insane amount of likes and comments.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Really?  She strikes me as someone 
                        who would have to buy likes.
                             (reading comment out loud, 
                              mumbling)
                        “Luvvvv.  Is that a Kylie Jenner 
                        lip kit, gurl???”

           Blood smears on the screen as Alan posts a reply:                     

           I don’t fucking know what that is. 

           POST.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (verge-of-breakdown)
                        Emotions can be controlled.  
                        Emotions can be controlled.  
                        Emotions CAN be controlled!

           He’s about to excise Tiffany’s collar bone.  Stops quickly to 
           chop off a floppy arm that keeps getting in his way.

           The arm falls to the ground.  Makes another very hollow 
           “CRACK” sound.  Half of it slides into the next stall.

           Alan is panicked.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Another limb.  Another strange 
                        sound.  Tiffany’s low number of 
                        followers do not compare with the 
                        high count of Jessica’s -- the kill 
                        from SoulCycle.

                        Why are their limbs seemingly the 
                        same quality, then?

           The arm SLOWLY DISAPPEARS into the next stall.  Pulled over 
           by someone obviously in there.  It’s picked up.

           Alan can’t breathe.  Clears his throat.

                                 ALAN
                             (verge-of-
                              hyperventilation)
                        That’s mine.

           Alan shoves the rest of her half-butchered body into his 
           Louis Vuitton bag.  Part of her foot juts out.  He exits.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Jesus.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  OK.  
                        You can do this.  You took that 
                        online class on “confrontation”.

           A deep inhale.  He knocks on the stall next to his.

                                 ALAN
                        Excuse me.  I believe you have 
                        something of mine.

           Silence.  Tiffany’s phone buzzes with more likes, more 
           comments.  Curiosity overwhelms Alan.  He glances down at it.

           [COMMENT]: Srsly, is that Kylie Jenner’s lip kit????  What 
           color?  Dirty Peach or Candy k????  Hit me up, T!

           He bangs the stall roughly.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Open the door.  You do not want to 
                        fuck with me right now.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        Her arm -- and the rest of her body 
                        -- are mine, Alan.  I bought them 
                        fair and square.  Give me her 
                        torso, legs, and head.  Now.

           Alan backs up.  A stranger opens the door.  Only Alan sees 
           him, not us.

                                 ALAN
                             (confused)
                        You can’t buy her.  You have to 
                        hunt them.  Fair and square.
                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        You know that’s not true.

           Alan runs out.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Get back here, Alan Pierce!  I‘ll 
                        find you!  This is not your

           INT. ALAN’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           -- BACK in his studio.  He triple-locks an antiquated door.  
           Leans against it, breathing heavily.  Eyes wide.  Darting.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Who was that man?  What did he 
                        want?  I didn’t recognize him from 
                        the city’s cannibal “network”. 

                                 TRISHA HEAD (O.S.)
                        Alan, is everything OK?

                                 ALAN
                             (alarmed)
                        Yes!  It’s fine!  Don’t worry!

                                 TRISHA HEAD (O.S.)
                        I’m always worried about you.

           Alan kneels in front of Trisha Head.  She has a beautiful 
           lavender silk head scarf on.  Pearl earrings, full make-up.

                                 ALAN
                        Why, darling?

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        You’re on edge.  You look ashen.  
                        You need protein.

                                 ALAN
                        There’s no one after you, is there?  
                        You’d tell me if there was.  Right?

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        Who would be after me?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m going to tighten security 
                        around here.

           Alan dumps his shoulder bag.  Tiffany’s parts fall on the 
           marble butcher slab.  Alan wrinkles his nose at the smell.
           He fires up a nearby stove.  Carefully cuts around her upper 
           arm.  Plops the 5-inch slab in a pan to seer.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Trisha.  Am I your only official 
                        owner?  Not boyfriend.  Owner.

                                 TRISHA HEAD (O.S.)
                        Yes, Alan.

           He rifles through Tiffany’s other parts.  Flesh falls easily 
           off the bone.  Meat doesn’t look clean.  Very unhealthy.

                                 ALAN
                        You’re sure of that?

                                 TRISHA HEAD (O.S.)
                        Yes!  What is that awful smell?  
                        Who are you cooking?

                                 ALAN 
                        Not for your consumption, dear.  
                        It’s only because of a morbid 
                        curiosity that I have deigned to 
                        cook this “mistake”.

           He takes a small bite from the pan.  Carefully chews it.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        As predicted, she is terrible.  
                        Lied about her looks.  Lied about 
                        her diet.  She not only is not 
                        vegan, but she ate pork today.  
                        Disgusting!  Not to mention her 
                        gross, off-putting personality.

           -- throws everything out.  Marks the bags “FOR GOODWILL”.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        No.  Some things are even too bad 
                        for Goodwill.

           INT. ALAN’S APARTMENT, ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Gold mirrored.  Marble floored elevator.  It’s just Alan 
           ascending.  Disheveled, blood-splattered.  Deafening silence.  

           He hatefully stares at his reflection.

                                 ALAN
                        That was bad, Alan.  BAD, BAD, BAD!  
                        No un-planned kills.  No non-vetted 
                        butchering.  Very, very bad.

                        Wasteful!  Terrible for the 
                        environment.  You’re a disgrace.

           INT. ALAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Alan walks in, setting down his keys.  Hangs up his Louis 
           Vuitton shoulder bag.  Stares at himself in a hallway mirror.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Keep calm, carry on.  Keep calm, 
                        carry on.  Keep calm, carry on.
                             (angry)
                        Bad, bad Alan.  

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Darling!  It’s threesome night!  
                        You’re late.  We’re in the bedroom.

                                 ALAN
                        That was -- tonight?  I though it 
                        was next week.  I just want to 
                        relax.  I’m not really...

           Checks his reflection.  Disgusting.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps just you two can...

           Furiously wipes blood off his face.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Maybe I can just watch with a 
                        detached bemusement?

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emily is sprawled out on lush satin sheets.  Wears a $900 
           garter belt with striking La Perla lingerie.  She flips 
           through Glamour magazine.  Next to her...

           Damien, grinning.  Wearing luxury boxers fitted with two 18-
           karat gold buttons.  Alan points to him.

                                 ALAN
                        GET OFF MY BED!

                                 EMILY
                        Alan!

                                 ALAN
                        A word, Emily.
           EXT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alan slams the door.  Totally irate.  He drops his voice to a 
           whispered hiss.  Emily has thrown on a silk robe.

                                 EMILY
                        Honey, you know slamming doors 
                        disturbs the next-door neighbor’s 
                        bonsai tree.  I told Mr. Williford 
                        we’d be mindful of that.

                                 ALAN
                        We agreed to not do this 
                        “threesome” until next week.  We 
                        also agreed to go with Ava.

                                 EMILY
                        Ava bailed.  She’s joining a 
                        celebrity couple uptown.  We’re not 
                        famous enough.  I’ve been 
                        devastated about it all day.  

           Alan’s surprised at her “devastated” comment.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        I even tried Tiffany, but she never 
                        answered her phone!

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        And she won’t.

                                 EMILY
                        Besides.  It’s my turn to get 
                        pleasured.  I indulge in all of 
                        your strange fetishes.
                             (soft, pink-painted 
                              fingers walk up his 
                              chest)
                        It’s time you indulge in mine.  

                                 ALAN
                        Not with him.

                                 EMILY
                        Alan.  Are you uncomfortable with 
                        him being a man?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  I just don’t like his 
                        personality.  Get it?  It’s his 
                        personality that is a major turn-
                        off.  How can I be aroused by such 
                        a flaccid personality?
                                 EMILY
                        You don’t even know his 
                        personality.  Will you just get in 
                        there?

                                 ALAN
                        Do you love me?

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t do that.  Take off your 
                        clothes and get in there.

                                 ALAN
                             (low, mumble)
                        His boxer buttons are made of gold.

                                 EMILY
                        We’ll get you some tomorrow.

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alan’s almost undressed.  Tries to cover up the non-gold 
           buttons on his boxers.  Sits on the edge of the bed.  Damien 
           leans in, hot breath in Alan’s ear. 

                                 DAMIEN
                             (low)
                        You honestly thought you could 
                        escape me?  I'm inside your little 
                        world, now.  I won't stop until I’m 
                        inside your little mouth.  

           Smiles to Emily.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        Honey, get on the bed.  All fours.  
                        Alan, get on your knees near the 
                        head board.  Emily, start sucking 
                        his cock.

           Damien positions himself behind Emily.  Starts fucking* her, 
           quite gently at first.  He tightly grips her waist.

           *CAN SUBSTITUTE WITH: copulating, banging, shagging, making 
           love, screwing, rolling in the hay, “having a go at it”, 
           getting laid, schtup-ing, etc, etc, etc.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        Make eye contact with me while I 
                        fuck your girlfriend, Alan.

           With the blow job loosening him up a little, Alan 
           begrudgingly looks at Damien.
                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                             (mouths)
                        My lower loin tastes like a 
                        porterhouse steak.

           He pulls out.  Roughly flips Emily over.  Grabs Alan’s hair 
           and pushes his face down between her legs.

           Damien slides off the bed.  Quickly positions himself behind 
           a bent over Alan.  Starts semi-roughly “having a go” at him.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        I always get what I want.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        This is one of the worst situations 
                        I’ve ever been in, in my entire 
                        life.  The humiliation isn’t even a 
                        turn on, like it’s purported to be 
                        in the online pornos.
                             (out loud)
                        Ouch, watch it!

           -- but Damien doesn’t let up.  For ten minutes straight.

                                 DAMIEN
                        I’m in control here.  Not you.

           Damien discards Alan.  Focuses intently on Emily.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        You’re so tasty, darling.

           He winks at Alan.  Emily climaxes long and loud, her screams 
           echoing through the building’s complex.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It’s too much to bear, watching him 
                        pleasure her probably much better 
                        than I do.  How does he do it? 

           Alan’s phone rings.  He clears his throat.

                                 ALAN
                        It’s Mr. Williford.  Most likely 
                        complaining that his bonsai tree is 
                        suffering undue stress and extreme 
                        anxiety due to the noise.

                                 EMILY
                             (out-of-it, ecstasy)
                        Yes!  Waffles would be wonderful!!
           INT. ALAN’S WORKSPACE - NIGHT

           Alan is so angry he refuses to speak to Emily.  In a mink 
           robe, quickly drinking a protein shake -- he gulps it down so 
           fast he clutches his stomach in pain.  She mixes tea.

                                 EMILY 
                        He was such a great fellow!  Very 
                        good in bed.  
                             (giggle)
                        Made me feel totally naughty, so 
                        domineering.  And he paid the same 
                        amount of attention to both of us!

           Alan Instagram stalks.  Closes in on another weak target.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Illana.  Barre instructor.  Either 
                        her or William, a wellness coach 
                        specializing in Kundalini upward 
                        meditation.  I need a hit, a shot.  
                        My life is spinning out of control.

                                 EMILY
                        You’re looking very pale, lately.  
                        Are you getting enough iron?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  I am not.

           Did you see Brett’s boner today at work? lol.

           He clicks her e-mail’s photo icon.  Follows the links to her 
           various social media accounts.  Jealous of her “celebrity”.  
           He takes out his phone, adding her on Snapchat.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My life would be complete if I 
                        could only taste a bite of that 
                        flesh.  My sickness might be cured.  
                        I might feel better.  I’d be 
                        confident, do better at work.

                        Alan, have you seen my crystals?
           INT. ALAN’S WORK, HALLWAYS - NEXT DAY

           Alan wears a Brioni tonal-stripe wool two-piece suit.  But 
           not even his good presentation (and prescription retinol) is 
           enough to hide the under-eye bags from yesterday’s events.

                                 RANDOM COWORKER (O.S.)
                        You look like crap, Alan.

                                 ALAN
                        Up yours, Rhys.

           INT. ALAN’S OFFICE (CORNER) - DAY

           Coloring books all over his desk.  Alan starts fervently 
           shading with pastel pencils.  Not exactly in the lines.

           He pauses.  Makes his lemon and cucumber water.  Inhales.

                                 ALAN 
                             (eyes closed, to self)
                        I’m deep in the forest of Waipio 
                        Valley in Hawaii, trekking to the 
                        illegal irrigation water slide with 
                        various co-eds in bikinis and 
                        speedos.  I’m tan, but not too tan.

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m trying to have a spa moment, 
                        Olivia.  Can you respect that?

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        I’m leaving.

           Alan looks up.  Absolutely devastated.

                                 ALAN
                        What?  Why?

           FLOOR VIEW.  Manolo Blahnik heels click together.  We see the 
           bottom seams of sports leggings.  Thin, toned calves.

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        I’m working for Perfect Head.  You 
                        have no leads.  There’s nothing for 
                        me to do.  You’ve been so 
                        preoccupied lately and you won’t 
                        let me help with anything.
                                 ALAN
                        Is it because of her... status?

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        That’s part of it.  But she lets me 
                        wear athleisure.  It’s like, really 
                        important to me.

                             (verge-of-tears)
                        But it’s not work attire.

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        Kate Hudson says --

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t care about Kate Hudson.

           He buries his head in his hands.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (mumbles)
                        I’m having such a bad week.

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        No, you’re having a character 
                        building week!

                                 ALAN
                        LEAVE, OLIVIA.

           INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN’S - DRESS SECTION - DAY

           Alan’s fingers feel the sensuous fabric of cocktail dresses.  
           He admires an exquisite pearl necklace on a mannequin.  

           Lingers on the hats.  A SALES PERSON appears.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Mr. Pierce, good to see you again.  
                        Can I help you with anything?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m looking for a beautiful hat.  
                        For someone special.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        You do spoil those you love.

           The sales person returns with an over-the-top Gucci Velvet 
           Dragon-Embroidered Baseball Cap.  Gauche.  Maybe last season.
                                 ALAN
                        No.  This is for a lady.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        We have some beautiful Mischa 
                        Lampert hats on sale.

                                 ALAN
                        Nothing on sale, please.

           Alan studies the Philip Treacy section.  Stops at an elegant 
           $1,360 velour contour hat with satin band in forest emerald.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Look at that exaggerated pinched 
                        crown.  That asymmetric, curved 
                        brim.  The self knot detail.

           He gingerly picks it up.

                                 ALAN
                        May I have it wrapped?

           INT. ALAN’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           Alan takes out his best china, best flatware, and best 
           centerpiece.  He sets a third place setting at the master 
           table with Trisha Head.  He also pulls up a third chair.

           Using a ruler -- the plates and utensils are arranged with 
           precision.  Alan keeps re-doing it until it’s just right.

                                 NEARBY HEADS (O.S.)
                             (echo)
                        Is a new head coming?

           He sets the large hat gift box by the third place setting.

                             (echo)
                        They get to sit at the head table!

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        Is someone new dining with us?  At 
                        my table?

                                 ALAN
                        How was your day, Trisha?  Do 
                        anything soul-enriching?
                                 TRISHA HEAD
                        I am the top head!  I insist on 
                        knowing who that place setting is 
                        for.  Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        I read that by 2030, there will be 
                        virtual animals with actual digital 
                        minds.  Isn’t that so interesting?

           Alan opens up Snapchat.  Zooms in on Perfect Head’s 
           whereabouts.  She’s in an exclusive part of town marked 
           “RESTRICTED”.  But he knows where it is.

                                 TRISHA HEAD 
                        Will you answer me? 

                                 NEARBY HEADS (O.S.)
                             (echo)
                        Alan is replacing Trisha!

                                 TRISHA HEAD
                             (snaps)
                        He’s not.  Who’s coming to dinner?  
                        Why isn’t that gift for me?

                                 ALAN
                        I’ll be back late tonight, 
                        darlings.  You can stay up and 
                        wait, or go to bed.  Goodnight.

           He leaves.  Trisha Head -- despite being preserved in a 
           stiff, waxy substance -- stretches her mouth into a frown.

                                 TRISHA HEAD

           EXT. HOT QUESO - NIGHT

           A DOORMAN stands guard outside a private apartment complex’s 
           back door.  Steel with loads of graffiti.  Dumpster nearby.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Google sent some articles to my 
                        phone about nihilism, cannibalism, 
                        and python shoes -- things I did 
                        not search for.  The scary thing is 
                        I wanted to click it.  I didn’t.  I 
                        don’t want to encourage them by 
                        proving their algorithm right... 
                        but they already know it’s right.

           Alan stares at the doorman.
                                 ALAN
                        Did you know I’m depriving myself 
                        of material I want to read just to 
                        prove to Google that I can?

                                 DOORMAN
                        You on the list?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  But my watch is.

           Alan flashes his $116,000 Rolex.  

           INT. HOT QUESO - NIGHT

           A SEX BUTLER offers Alan a flute of Dom Perignom as he walks 
           into the gothic space.  Thick velvet drapes, dark neon 
           lights, endless fur-covered sitting spots.  Glowing drinks.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        “Hot Queso” is the HOTTEST pop-up 
                        sex party.  Happens thrice a month 
                        in a revolving door of multi-
                        million dollar pads.

           It’s a railroad apartment converted into (basically) a slutty 
           sex dungeon.  He removes most, not all, of his clothing.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I see an aggregation of naked 
                        strangers participate in what I’m 
                        assuming -- at least in this room -- 
                        is an eight-some of some kind.  New 
                        Yorkers are so obsessed with these 
                        “secret” sex parties.  I feel left 
                        out by detached association.

           Alan grabs a tasteful black satin eye mask from an on-point 
           melting mercury table.  Candy bowls of pills for the taking.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I would really hate to be seen here 
                        by someone I knew.  Even if it 
                        bumped up my status a little.

           He squeezes past the writhing, orgasm-having crowd.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                             (deep inhale)
                        My, my.  What a wealthy crowd.

                        cellular cream platinum rare...
           Alan steadies himself against a wall.  He’s so overwhelmed by 
           the luxurious lotions, he has to catch his balance.  Breathe.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Focus, Alan.  Focus.  Oh, but I 
                        can’t!  Boadicea the Victorious

                        She’s here.  I can smell the baby 
                        fetus cream.  No brand.  She must 
                        buy it off the dark web...

           Hiding a knife, he skulks room-to-room.  Still sniffing the 
           air passionately.  Taking mental notes.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)

           He steps behind a fake column.  In a musky room, Perfect 
           Head, sparkling in an ethereal swarovski mask (and dress), 
           laughs with naked patrons next to a luxurious bear skin rug.

                        so hungry for her, I’m shaking.

           INT. HOT QUESO, ORGY ROOM - NIGHT

           Alan brazenly walks up to Perfect Head, cutting off whoever 
           she’s speaking to.  Takes her hand.  Kisses it gently.

                                 ALAN

                        Is that a Desmond Merrion supreme

                                 ALAN
                        It is.

                                 ALAN
                        -- um, sure.

           INT. HOT QUESO, BEAR SKIN RUG - NIGHT

           Throes of sex.  ONLOOKERS eagerly stare.  Masked Perfect Head 
           is moaning on the floor -- Alan is on top of her.

                                 ONLOOKER (O.S.)
                        I heard that one day, we’ll be able 
                        to charge phones with our brains.  
                        Isn’t that so interesting?

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I hate sex.  Even worse, I can’t 
                        kill anyone with a fucking 
                        audience.  I can’t make any off-
                        putting movements or suggestions, 
                        either, for fear of startling 
                        Perfect Head and having her meat go 
                        sour.  Just waiting for the orgasm.

           Masked Perfect Head grips a handful of the bear skin rug, 
           yanking roughly.  Screams louder and louder.  Alan sweats.
                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Oh my God.  Will they see when I 
                        slip the knife out?  Why are so 
                        many people watching?!

                                 ALAN
                             (clears throat)
                        I hear Madonna is in the next room.

           No one moves.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Why did I say Madonna?  I’m so 
                        stupid.

           Takes a deep breath, bodies pressed tightly together.  He 
           slips the knife out of a sock -- right into masked Perfect 
           Head’s chest.  Her mouth makes a surprised expression.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Oh no -- I missed!  The nervous 
                        adrenaline will ruin the meat!

           He quickly slices up to her heart.  She slumps lifeless in 
           his arms.  He stops thrusting.  Wipes sweat off his forehead 
           (with a silk kerchief snatched from an onlooker).

                                 ONLOOKER (O.S.)
                        Woah.  You like, banged the life 
                        outta her.  Can you do me next?

                                 ALAN
                        No.

           He wraps her up in the blood-soaked rug.

           INT. HOT QUESO, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Alan bites the neck of (dead) masked Perfect Head.  Almost 
           ripping the skin.  Pulls her close, burying his head into her 
           hair.  Deep inhale.  Whispers into her ear, ecstatic.

                                 ALAN
                        Oh God, oh God, oh God!  I hope I 
                        can wait ‘til I’m home.  Eleven-
                        point-five million followers.  If 
                        your meat is well preserved, I may 
                        very well die of ecstasy tonight!

           His phone buzzes.  It’s a new email.
           To: Alan Pierce

           Got into Club 44!!!  14-year waiting list, but I’m in!  Check 
           my Insta for photos.  Will let you know how the Golden Osetra 
           Caviar is at work tomorrow.  XX Perfect Head

           Alan almost drops his phone.  Trembles with fear.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        What?  No...  can’t be...

           He removes the mask -- it’s an imposter.  Exact same scents 
           Perfect Head uses, but face looks nothing like her.  Decoy?

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (breathless)
                        A set-up.

           He throws her down.  A sparkly rumple on filthy tile.  Alan 
           sits on the toilet, head in his hands.  Sobs quietly.

                                 GUY IN NEXT STALL (O.S.)
                        Can you please cry somewhere else?  
                        It’s really killing the vibe.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I can’t take this girl home to eat.  
                        I know nothing about her.  No idea 
                        how many followers she has.  No 
                        phone on her, which is a severe red 
                        flag I should have noticed earlier.  
                        STUPID, ALAN!  STUPID!!

           He exits the stall.  Calmly. 

                                 GUY IN NEXT STALL (O.S.)
                        Thanks, man.

           -- looks in the mirror.

                                 ALAN
                             (to self)
                        Why are you so stupid, Alan?

           -- gets closer.  Each word enunciated.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Why-are-you-so-stu-pid-Al-an??

           INT. HOT QUESO, SIDE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Alan sits.  Stone-faced.  He’s in a beautiful blue and gold 
           velvet chair.  He roughly pets it as he tries to calm down.
                                 ALAN
                        Is that R. Kelly?  I’m leaving.

           He gets up.  Steps over a naked couple under his feet.  As he 
           walks to the door -- he feels a strong hand on his shoulder.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve had enough fake orgasms for 
                        the night.  I’m not interested.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        I don’t want sex.

           Alan turns around.  Same voice from the “stranger” before --
           we still don’t see them.  Alan’s face: petrified.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Got something for me, Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        No.

           He quickens his pace.  Runs out.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        I bought them fair and square!  I’m 
                        going to take legal action against 
                        you, if you don’t stop!  ALAN?    
                        ALAN PIERCE!

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Alan’s in bed wearing reading glasses.  Propped up with 
           several ornate pillows, concentrating on his coloring book.  
           He’s having tremendous difficulty staying within the lines.

           Emily’s next to him.  Scrolling through her phone.

                                 EMILY
                        The strangest things are trending 
                        on Twitter this morning.

                                 ALAN
                        That’s nice.

                                 EMILY
                        Silly, why are you home?

                                 ALAN
                        I called out sick.

                                 EMILY
                        Are you sick?
                                 ALAN
                             (thoughtful)
                        Yes.

           INT. ALAN’S WORKSPACE - DAY

           Alan sits in his Derek Rose bengal-stripe silk satin pajamas.  
           Scrolls through more Instagram pages.  Lacks enthusiasm.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I feel my days might be numbered.  
                        Connected, but not.  Never enough 
                        models, follows, or DM’s.  Never 
                        enough likes.  I’m about to have a 
                        meltdown.  Unsure how to stop it.

           He grips his protein shake -- very watery.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I can barely stomach the protein 
                        powders I have left.  They’re all 
                        wrong for me.  Most have spoiled.  
                        But without them, I’m nothing.

                                 ALAN
                        Emily?

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Yes?

                                 ALAN
                        I may very well go insane.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Take an ambien, dear.

           Alan carefully crushes up a cream-colored pill.  Sprinkles it 
           into his protein shake.  Chokes the rest of it down.

           Emily leans in the doorway.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Did you see the latest issue of GQ 
                        magazine?  

           She places it in front of him.  It’s Damien.  He’s modeling 
           in a sleek, 8-page fashion spread.  Very high-end outfits.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        He’s wearing all the latest styles.  
                        Are these even out yet?
                                 EMILY
                        Aren’t we lucky!  He’s a model, 
                        Alan.  He likes us!  This is so 
                        big.  I‘m telling the girls.

           Alan tightly coils the magazine.  Throws it across the room.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Geez.  If you’re so jealous, we can 
                        just get you the same suits.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t want his suits.  They’re 
                        too tight.  The trousers are too 
                        narrow.  I’m a man, not a boy.

                                 EMILY
                        Are you depressed, again?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m going to Bergdorf’s.

           INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN, MEN’S SUITS - DAY

           Alan holds up a magazine page flaunting Damien’s best suit to 
           a SALES PERSON.  He aggressively points to the outfit.

                                 ALAN
                        This one.

                                 SALES PERSON
                        Ah, yes.  Very popular. 
                             (frowns)
                        Unfortunately -- we’re all out.  
                        Sold the last one in your size 
                        about ten minutes ago. 

                                 ALAN
                        Really?  To who?

                                 SALES PERSON
                        We keep customer confidentiality.

           -- leans in, mischievous.  

                                 SALES PERSON (CONT'D)
                        But he looked an awful lot --
                             (wink, whisper)
                        -- like the guy in the ad.

           Alan’s expression sinks.
                                 SALES PERSON (CONT'D)
                        We have a new Brunello Cucinelli we 
                        haven’t put out yet.  Just came in.  
                        Flannel wool-silk-cashmere double-
                        breasted two-piece suit, charcoal.

                                 ALAN
                        I have enough Brunello.

           The sales person grabs Alan’s arm.

                                 SALES PERSON
                             (carefully)
                        You can never have enough Brunello.

                                 ALAN
                        I‘ll see it.

           INT. SOULCYCLE CLASS - DAY

           Alan grunts, back in SoulCycle.  Music loudly blasts.  Eyes 
           tightly shut closed, head bowed.  Sweat pours down his neck.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        After spending five figures on 
                        clothing, cardio is the perfect 
                        endorphin boost.  My perception of 
                        pain is drastically reduced.  I’m 
                        feeling much, much better now.

                                 PERFECT HEAD (O.S.)
                        You little sneak!  “SICK”, eh?

           Alan turns around.  Perfect Head is in a tight fitting, 
           revealing athletic ensemble.  Working up a light sweat.

                                 PERFECT HEAD (CONT'D)
                        I’m so tell-lllling!  What’s in it 
                        for me if I stay quiet?
                             (leans on handle bars, 
                              cleavage bared)
                        Hmmmm?

                                 ALAN
                             (ignores cleavage)
                        I’ll, um.

           We finally see the STRANGER (50’s) -- disheveled, quite out 
           of place --  as he bikes next to her.  Alan jerks forward.

                                 STRANGER
                        Hey Perfect Head, aren’t you gonna 
                        introduce me to your friend?
           Alan pedals faster.

                                 STRANGER (CONT'D)
                             (low)
                        Think you can “ride” away from me?  
                        Hilarious.  Where’s everyone I paid 
                        for, huh?  Where are my girls, 
                        Alan?

                                 PERFECT HEAD
                             (unaware)
                        This is my boyfriend!

                                 STRANGER
                        -- and don’t forget it.  I paid for 
                        her, too.  Paid fair and square.

           Alan bikes harder.  His feet almost slip off the pedals.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The amount of stress I’m under is 
                        unparalleled.  I don’t have the 
                        time off work to escape to Tuscany!  
                        I‘m about to die, my heart’s 
                        bursting through my chest.  My self 
                        control is gone.  If I don’t eat 
                        her, I will literally die.  It’s 
                        now or never.

                                 INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                        Alright, guys!  KEEP GOING!!

           Alan stops peddling.  Calmly dismounts his bike.

                                 ALAN
                             (to Perfect Head)
                        You have a perfect head.  Did you 
                        know that?  It’s actually perfectly 
                        symmetrical.  Like Amber Heard.

           The comment registers.  Perfect Head smiles.  Alan quickly 
           takes a knife out of his Lululemon tank top.  He lunges at 
           her.  Stabs her quickly in the heart before she can react.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Heads like this should be mounted.  
                        Get it?  You belong on my wall.

           She slumps over.  The music is so loud, it’s so dark, and 
           multi-colored lights are flashing so much -- no one notices.
           EXT. SOULCYCLE CLASS, HALLWAYS - DAY

           Perfect Head, dripping blood, is hoisted over his shoulders.  
           He runs through SoulCycle.  Stranger tails behinds him.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        ARE YOU KIDDING!  GET BACK HERE!  
                        ALAN!  SHE’S MINE!  ALAN!!!

           A TOWEL BOY grins at Alan.  Glances the bloodshed.

                        I just love that model of model.  
                        Where did you get her?

           INT. UBERLUX CAR - DAY

           Alan opens the door of an exceptional Rolls Royce that’s not 
           even out yet.  Shoves in a limp, bloody Perfect Head. 

                                 ALAN
                        NO QUESTIONS!  I’ll tip $500.  Rate 
                        you 5 stars.  I’ll wire whatever

                        about me or if I want to hear

                        facts about space, either!

           The driver is silent.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

                        NO TALKING!!!!!!!

           Alan grips Perfect Head’s body tightly.  Smelling it.  
           Totally intoxicated.  He sinks his teeth into her upper arm.

           The flesh is indulgent, soft.  Lightly perfumed.

                                 UBERLUX DRIVER

                        that chick in here, are you?

                        What?

                                 UBERLUX DRIVER
                        C’mon, man.  It’s a Rolls Royce.  
                        Have some respect.

                        You’re right.  I apologize.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Alan works quickly.  Severs neck arteries, bleeding her out 
           into the sink.  Thick blood swirls down the copper drain.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I can’t even properly take her to 
                        the studio.  I need to make her 
                        into a drink right this second.  

           Rough, rushed hacks of the extremities.  He does a 
           phenomenally clean cut of her neck with an X-ACTO knife.  
           Rinses the sink, dumps ice.  Sets her severed head on top.
                                 ALAN
                             (mumbling)
                        Ribs, rump, breast, round, 
                        shoulder.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

           Shaking -- Alan drops lean shoulder chunks and rib bones into 
           his grinder.  Adds 1 1/3 cups Whole Foods “asparagus water”.  

           Presses “On”.  LOUD GRINDING.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Euphoria is coming...  the high 
                        I’ve been chasing...  come to me...

           -- OFF.  He pours the thick, odd colored liquid into a pink-
           diamond encrusted champagne glass.  Gulps it down as fast as 
           he can.  Pulp dribbles down his face.  

           INSTANTLY GAGS.

           Vomit spews all over the floor.  Jittery and panicky, Alan 
           wipes his mouth.  Confused.  Tries to reassure himself.

                                 ALAN
                        It’s fine.  It’s OK.  I just have 
                        to rinse the bones a bit more.  
                        Pull out any stringy tendons, ASAP.  

           He takes a hacksaw to her femur.  Saws it into small, 
           manageable parts.  Furiously scrubs them in the sink.

           Emily walks in.  Alan freezes.  

           Dismembered body parts litter the counter.  Blood, hair, and 
           human pulp splattered everywhere.  Head juts out of the sink.

                        DON’T.  REALLY.  CARE.
           He continues furiously scrubbing the bones.  Dries them 
           quickly with a hair dryer.  Rinses out his blender.

           REPEAT.  Grinds them up.  Makes protein powder.

           Adds ice cubes.  Asparagus water.  LOUD GRINDING.

           Part of her spleen bakes in the oven.  It’s melting.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Usually the spleen doesn’t smell 
                        like this.  What’s this texture?

           He pokes it.  It explodes into a sickening blob.

           Turns to the grinder.  Pours it into a wine glass.  Sips.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Jesus fucking CHRIST!

           He coughs, gagging.  Spits it out, violently.  Throws the 
           glass against the wall with full-force.  It shatters.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        No!  That was Moser crystal!

           He tries again.  And again.  And again.  Scrubbing the bones, 
           grinding them.  Drinking.  Gagging.  Repeat.  And repeat.

                        generous tip.  It’s so rainy and 
                        cold outside.  What a dreadful job, 
                        delivering things in the rain.  
                        Don’t you think?  Alan?

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Alan’s eyes open -- he wakes up gasping for air.  Clutching 
           his stomach in agony.  Emily sleeps soundly next to him.  

           He painstakingly crawls his way through his apartment.  
           Almost knocking over one of Jim Carrey’s eccentric paintings.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Alan lifts Perfect Head’s head out of the ice.  Brushing her 
           dirty, knotty hair into a low, dirty, knotty ponytail.

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emily still sleeps soundly next to him.  Alan hugs the 
           bloodied, frozen, mangled head tightly to his chest.

                        Do you like my apartment’s decor?

           Perfect Head lays sideways.  Eyes and mouth open.

                        tomorrow.  Will you say something? 

           He pulls covers tightly over the base of her neck.

                             (mumbles)
                        I love you, too, dear.

           NEXT MORNING. 

           A blood-curdling yell.

                                 ALAN (O.S.)
                        WHERE IS IT!

           Emily’s eyes flutter open.  She quickly hops out of bed, 
           rifling through dozens of multi-colored silk robes.

                                 EMILY
                        What is it, darling?  You mustn’t 
                        yell so loud -- you’ll disturb our 
                        upstairs neighbor’s antique silver!

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Alan stands in front of his open pantry.

           EVERY PROTEIN POWDER CONTAINER IS EMPTY.

                                 ALAN
                        All of the powder!  It’s gone, 
                        Emily.  Where is it?  Where did it 
                        go?  Who took it?  All my work!

           He angrily grabs her shoulders.  Practically shakes her.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Was this you?  Did you take it?  I 
                        swear to God, if you took it --
           Emily eases him off.

                                 EMILY
                        Of course I didn’t.  I would never 
                        touch your powders.  But your 
                        doctor was a trite bit concerned --

                                 ALAN
                        Who did this, though?

                                 EMILY
                        What were you doing in the kitchen 
                        all night?  I heard the blender.

           Alan pushes her towards the door.

                                 ALAN
                        Out!  Just get out!  LEAVE!

                                 EMILY
                        But I’m in my pajamas!

                                 ALAN
                        Well.  You should have thought of 
                        that before you woke up.

                                 EMILY
                        Alan!

           DOOR SLAMS.

                                 ALAN
                             (verge-of-melt-down)
                        What do I do?  I can’t survive 
                        without my boost, my energy.  My 
                        sustenance.  My lifeline!

           He cradles an empty container marked “XAVIER”.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Xavier!  How do I live without him?  
                        We met at the Teatro dell'Opera di 
                        Roma -- I ate him after his 
                        Libretto!  His stunning libretto!

           Grabs an empty container marked “GENEVIEVE”.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Genevieve?  My darling...

           Alan quickly shaves, gets dressed.  Before leaving, he shoves 
           Perfect Head’s head into his Louis Vuitton shoulder bag.
           EXT. ALAN’S STUDIO - DAY

           Alan rustles the keys.  Tries to unlock the door.  It won’t 
           open.  After a few cuss-filled, failed attempts --

           INT. ALAN’S STUDIO - DAY

           Dead silence.  His mouth (and bag) drop to the floor.

           ALL OF ALAN’S HEADS ARE MISSING.  

           Every wall mount is empty.

                                 ALAN
                        Where is everyone?  Girls, boys?
                             (head out window, 
                              screaming)
                        WHERE ARE MY HEADS!!

           The dining table is still set.  But Trisha Head is gone.  
           Perfect Head’s present is opened... the hat is missing.

           Alan throws down the box.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        She took the hat.  She didn’t even 
                        leave a note telling me if she 
                        liked the exaggerated pinched 
                        crown.  What is wrong with her??
                             (wince)
                        Is there no such thing as MANNERS, 
                        anymore?  Jesus Christ!

           INT. ALAN’S OFFICE (CORNER) - DAY

           Alan sits at his desk.  Tap-tap-tapping his fingers.  Perfect 
           Head’s hair juts out of a desk drawer she’s been stuffed in. 

           Surrounded by 6-8 coloring books.  Nothing shaded in the 
           lines.  He’s got the colored pencils in a death grip as he 
           jabs at scattered pages.  Grabs his stomach in pain.

                                 ALAN 
                             (monotonous, dazed)
                        I’m in the Arashiyama bamboo grove 
                        in Kyoto, a bit north of the Tenryu-
                        ji temple.  I am ruthlessly beating 
                        any tourist I see with bamboo.

                                 OLIVIA (O.S.)
                        Alan?
           Alan looks up. 

           It’s the head of the young girl from SoulCycle, JESSICA (22), 
           that Alan killed for fitness powder.  Alan notices.  Shock.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                        Did you want to meet the new hire?

                                 ALAN
                        Jessica?  What new hire?  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Who is Jessica?  I’m Olivia.  The 
                        new hire to replace Perfect Head.  
                        Didn’t you get the memo? 
                             (giggles)
                        She was already stolen away to 
                        recruit for NASA!  That woman was 
                        really wild, wasn’t she?

           Alan is dumbstruck.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                        Wasn’t she, Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        Wasn’t she what?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Wasn’t she wild?

           Alan feels the knotty, clumped hair of Perfect Head jutting 
           out of his drawer.  Checking she’s there.  She is.

                                 ALAN 
                        They hired someone new?

           INT. NEW HIRE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Olivia (with Jessica’s head) waits outside.  Motions Alan 
           inside the new hire’s office.  Their chair is turned away.

                                 ALAN
                             (clears throat)
                        My name is Alan Pierce.  I am a 
                        recruiter here.  I don’t have any 
                        leads to give out.  I have zero 
                        accounts.  I don’t know how I’m 
                        still working at this company.

           -- chair turns around.  It’s Trisha Head on a female body 
           (COURTNEY, 32).  Low-cut Prada suit.  Alan almost falls over.  
           She’s wearing the exact forest emerald Philip Treacy hat Alan 
           bought and wrapped for Perfect Head.  It looks ravishing.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        T-Trisha?

                                 COURTNEY
                        Hello, Alan.  I’m from our west 
                        coast branch.  Seems things have 
                        been quite loose around the office.  
                        I’m here to tighten the ship.  My 
                        name is Courtney Petterson.

                                 ALAN
                             (softly)
                        It’s me...

                                 COURTNEY 
                        What?

                                 ALAN
                        It’s me, Trisha.  It’s me -- Alan.

                                 COURTNEY
                        Yes, you introduced yourself.  My 
                        name is Courtney Petterson.

           He moves in.  Uncomfortably close.

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t get it.  It’s me.

                                 COURTNEY
                        I don’t know who you are.

                                 ALAN
                        You don’t remember me?

                                 COURTNEY
                        No.

                                 ALAN
                        You left your boyfriend for me?  
                        The stock broker?  The hat you’re 
                        wearing.  I bought it!

           Flustered, she adjusts her hat. 

                                 COURTNEY
                        Aaron and I are very much together.  
                        I’ve never seen you before in my 
                        life.  Please act more professional 
                        before I report you to our human 
                        resources division.
           Alan moves in... even closer.

                                 ALAN
                        I’ve eaten you, Trisha.  Gutted 
                        you.  I scrubbed your bones.  Put 
                        them in a grinder.  Then I drank 
                        it.  I dined -- with your head -- 
                        every night for two years.  We ate 
                        other people I killed.  

                                 COURTNEY
                        Get out.

           She ushers him out.  Slams the door. 

           EXT. COURTNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Alan idles outside her office.  Palm to the wall.

                                 ALAN
                        But Trisha... it’s me...  did you 
                        like the hat, at least?  The 
                        pinched crown?  It looked so, so 
                        marvelous... oh...

           He clutches his stomach.  Collapses onto the floor.

           INT. CEO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Alan inches open the door with his foot.  Practically crawls 
           in.  Stark, quiet.  The CEO is COMPLETELY HEADLESS.

                                 ALAN
                        Who is this new hire?  Where did 
                        you find her?  My studio?  Have you 
                        been stealing my heads?

           Alan carefully gets up -- sees the CEO.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Where’s YOUR head?

                                 CEO
                        You have a lack of focus...

                                 ALAN
                             (hiss)
                        Why were you in my studio?
                                 CEO 
                        Your performance has been lacking.  
                        Very odd behavior.  Do you want to 
                        talk about it?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  I’m fine.  I just -- I just 
                        wanted to know where you found 
                        Trisha.  I’m launching an 
                        investigation as certain things 
                        have been stolen from me.

                                 CEO
                        You’re probably late for SoulCycle, 
                        right?  Why don’t you go to 
                        SoulCycle, Alan.

                                 ALAN
                             (unsure)
                        Yeah.  I suppose.

           INT. SOULCYCLE CLASS - NIGHT

           Sweaty, sexy SUPER HYPED RIDERS.  Designer work-out gear.  
           Everyone’s head looks curiously similar to the ones mounted 
           on Alan’s studio walls.  Everyone is heavily “made-up”.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’m on deaths door due to that 
                        poisonous protein powder.  I must 
                        exercise to keep up appearances.  
                        Great for body and soul.  Despite 
                        the mass murder that took place, no 
                        one seems to remember me!

           Alan slowly notices THE HEADS.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        My God.  These riders.  Almost all 
                        of them -- I have eaten or 
                        slaughtered in some capacity.

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                             (brightly)
                        Hi, Alan!

           Alan almost faints.  Tiffany’s head is on a rider next to 
           him.  She snaps photos of herself, filtering and posting 
           away.  Both hands grip her phone (instead of the handles).  

           He sinks lower.  Pedals feverishly.
           INT. ALAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Emily pours over several oversized books on a low, modern 
           glass table.  They’re filled with colorful fabric swatches.

                                 EMILY
                        Home early?  Maybe you can help me 
                        decide between wall papers.  A 
                        neutral textured, or a farrow and 
                        ball lotus.  What do you think?

           She holds up the fabric squares.

                                 ALAN
                        What do I think?  I think you 
                        should leave.  Immediately.  I can 
                        no longer control myself.  I’ll 
                        kill you.  I’ll eat you.  I’ve 
                        lowered my standards considerably.  
                        Now, everyone is in danger.

                                 EMILY
                        Aw!  Is this foreplay?  I’ll eat 
                        you too, darling.  I’m all yours.

           She playfully teases down her shirt.  Winks.  Going to him -- 
           she strokes his chest.  Looks up at him, lovingly.

                                 ALAN
                        I’m not kidding, Emily.  I will 
                        turn you into a protein shake.

                                 EMILY
                             (playful, sexy)
                        How will you blend me?  On a low 
                        setting?  Or will you liquefy?

                                 ALAN
                        Why don’t you understand?  Why do 
                        you never understand?  Don’t you 
                        know how I’ll skin you?  Grind up 
                        your bones?  Drink you?

           He grabs her by the shoulders, roughly.  Almost shaking her.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (verge-of-tears)
                        Don’t you know that’s what I’ll do?

                                 EMILY
                        I have a big surprise for you.  
                        It’s “threesome Thursday”, so I 
                        brought Damien back!

                        He’s waiting for us in the bedroom.  
                        We were waiting for you to get 
                        home.

                                 ALAN
                        You WHAT?

           He tightly grasps a meat mallet from Williams Sonoma.  It was 
           randomly sitting on a side table.  He follows Emily into --

           INT. ALAN’S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           A hallway.  Meat mallet visible in his hand.

                                 ALAN
                        Repeat what you just said for 
                        clarity.  I want to make sure I 
                        heard you correctly before I do 
                        anything I may or may not regret.

                                 EMILY
                        Damien is waiting for us in the 
                        boudoir!

           With a large swing, Alan takes the mallet and smashes Emily 
           across the face with it.  She bursts --

           -- into hundreds of fiberglass shards.  A big chunk of her 
           face (in a surprised expression) lays half-cracked on the 
           floor.  Limbs shatter.  Broken pieces scatter everywhere.

           He picks up a large piece of her face.

                                 ALAN
                             (alarmed)
                        Emily?  Et tu, Brute?

           Out from the bedroom, a shadow.  Damien slowly appears in the 
           light.  In the exact suit from his GQ Magazine spread.  

           In Alan’s size.  Alan looks up.

                                 DAMIEN
                        Like my suit, Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        The one from GQ Magazine?

                                 DAMIEN
                        Mmm-hmm.  It’ll be yours.
                             (clasps Alan’s hands)
                        -- after you eat me.
           Alan points to Emily’s shattered body.

                                 ALAN
                        Did you do this?

                                 DAMIEN
                        To the kitchen, please.

                                 ALAN
                        Absolutely not.

           He heads for the front door. 

                                 DAMIEN
                             (sing-song)
                        I’ll do to you what I did to her...

           CLOSE-UP on a chunk of Emily’s ceramic face on the ground.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        Is that what you want?  To be a 
                        shattered face on the floor?  Or 
                        did you have larger aspirations?

                                 ALAN
                        I had larger aspirations.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A pile of knock-out and pain numbing medications sit on the 
           counter.  Also: alcohol, sleeping aids, cough syrup.

           Damien pops pills into his mouth.

                                 DAMIEN
                        To loosen me up, you know?  Do you 
                        have any Cheval Blanc 1947?
                             (motions to cough syrup)
                        Want some?

                                 ALAN
                        No.  I am lucid when I butcher.

           Alan rummages through his refrigerator.  Rifles through the 
           fresh produce.  Sets turnips, garlic and onions aside.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        What a nightmarish scenario I have 
                        found myself in.  I do not want to 
                        eat this man.  His social capital 
                        is so bad that no amount of spices 
                        will help his... sour taste.
                                 DAMIEN
                        Don’t serve me with garlic.  That’s 
                        rude.  You need to enjoy my flavor 
                        as-is with no modifications.

           Damien looks through Alan’s extensive meat cleaver collection 
           in a nearby drawer.  All shiny, polished, sharpened.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        What do you think.  The J.A. 
                        Henckels International, or the 
                        Dexter-Russel?

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        What a newb.

           Alan brushes past him, elbowing him harshly.  Grabs a knife 
           from the way back of the drawer.  It’s in a cloth sack.

                                 ALAN
                        I’ll be using a vintage, non-
                        branded hog meat cleaver that’s all 
                        the rage in Croatia.  Lay down on 
                        the counter, my long pig.

           Damien lays down.  Alan binds him tightly to the counter with 
           a thick, roasting twine.  With zero warning, Alan hacks 
           Damien’s left hand off.  He yelps out in pain.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (over yelling)
                        That’s for interrupting my lunch at 
                        BG Restaurant with Perfect Head.  I 
                        couldn’t fully immerse myself in my 
                        Gotham Salad.  It put a huuuu-ge 
                        damper on my entire week.

           Alan walks around to the other side.  Quickly chops off 
           Damien’s right hand.  He writhes and screams in agony.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        That’s for fucking my girlfriend 
                        with way too much authority.  She 
                        is not your pig.  You are my pig.  
                        Get it?  Like, do you get it??

                                 DAMIEN
                        (unintelligible screaming)

           Alan grips a jumbo turnip tightly.  Roughly shoves it in 
           Damien’s mouth.  Leans next to him, spitting in his ear.
                                 ALAN
                        Your suit is getting absolutely 
                        trashed.  I’m still going to try 
                        and return it for Bergdorf’s 
                        credit.  If I can get the blood, 
                        sweat, tears, and entitlement out.

           Alan walks to the end of the counter.  Eyes Damien’s feet.  
           Damien shakes his head.  His screams, muffled.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        This... well, this is for 
                        contacting me on a cannibal website 
                        begging to be eaten.  IDIOT!

           -- he swiftly chops off Damien’s left and right foot (socks 
           and shoes still on).  Alan gathers them, along with Damien’s 
           left and right hand.

           He drops all the limbs on Damien’s chest.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you know anything about Bergdorf 
                        Goodman’s return policy?  I’ve 
                        actually never returned anything.

           Damien breathes in, sharp.  Alan picks up Damien’s left hand.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (leans in)
                        See this?  This is a hand you will 
                        never get back.  Can’t be attached.  
                        It’s literally over for this hand.

           Grabs a foot and bops Damien’s nose with it.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Look at this foot!  You’ll NEVER 
                        get this foot to work again.  Get 
                        it?  You’re destroyed.  Your life 
                        is over.  How does it feel?

           Alan rips the turnip from Damien’s mouth -- LOUD, EAR-
           PIERCING SCREAMS.  Alan shoves the chopped off foot (with 
           shoe and sock still on) into Damien’s open mouth.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Look at you.  Your own foot is in 
                        your mouth.  Pathetic!

           Damien writhes.  Muffle-cries in pain.  Vessels in his 
           forehead bursting.  Sweat dripping down his head, pooling 
           under his neck.  Blood spilling and dripping onto the floor.
                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Can you smell the exquisite, full-
                        grain Italian calfskin leather?  
                        Can you taste it, Damien?  Do you 
                        feel like you’re in a quaint 
                        Italian town overlooking the 
                        Mediterranean Sea?  I do.

           Alan looks in his protein powder cabinet.  EMPTY.  He cuts up 
           lemon and cucumber wedges.  Plops them into a glass of ice 
           water.  Pulls up a chair next to Damien and sits.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (staring off into the 
                              distance, sipping)
                        I’m at an exclusive bar in Italy.  
                        I got in because I occasionally 
                        fuck the owner’s dog walker after 
                        transcendental meditation.  She 
                        called in a favor for me.

           Alan notices Damien’s breathing getting slower.  More 
           labored.  He sets down his ice water.  Unties Damien’s binds.  
           Damien struggles to get away.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?  You have no 
                        feet, no hands.  No social 
                        influence.  Your meat is going to 
                        be undeniably dry, lacking flavor.  

           Alan grabs him.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        You’ve stalked me.  So, you’re 
                        probably familiar with my pre-
                        cooking “marination” methods.  

           He bends Damien over the counter -- 

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to need a little bit of 
                        en-dor-phins in you.  Some dopamine-
                        injected oxy-to-cin!  
                             (high-pitched)
                        You know?
                             (regular voice)
                        You know.

           Alan enters him from behind.  Rather violently, but with the 
           astute attention and care that coaxes a semi-earnest orgasm.  
                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I really have to schedule a 
                        cholesterol test next Tuesday.      
                        I cannot be over 200mg/dL.

           The shoe-clad foot drops out of Damien’s mouth.

                                 DAMIEN
                             (growls)
                        Do it, Alan.  

           Alan’s surprised.  

                                 ALAN
                        Do what?

                                 DAMIEN
                             (hyper insanity)
                        KILL ME!  STAB ME!  I’M AT MY PEAK 
                        FLAVOR -- RIGHT NOW!  EAT ME!  
                        PREPARE MY THIGHS IN A PERUVIAN 
                        CEVICHE!  PROMISE YOU WILL EAT ME!!

           Damien laughs maniacally.

                                 DAMIEN (CONT'D)
                        BASTARD!  DON’T LET ME GO TO WASTE!  
                        PAIR A SMOKY ARGENTINE MALBEC WITH 
                        MY BUTTOCKS!  SWEAR YOU WILL??

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Oh, Jesus.  I only have a Benmarco 
                        Malbec...

           Alan sinks a knife into him.  Twists.

                                 ALAN
                        One bite.

                                 DAMIEN
                             (orgasm, ecstasy)
                        Thank... you...

                                 ALAN
                        I may put a small amount of ketchup 
                        on it.  For flavor.

                                 DAMIEN
                             (alarmed)
                        No.  Not ketchup.  Alan --

           Damien’s eyes flutter closed.  The life drains out of him.  
           Alan shifts his weight to hold him up.  Shakes him a bit.
                                 ALAN
                        Damien?  I never caught your last 
                        name.  What is it?  Wrathford?  Do 
                        you have a less sadist/masochist 
                        next-of-kin I should notify?

           -- but he’s dead.  SILENCE.  Alan stands in a blood-soaked, 
           limb-strewn kitchen.  Half-naked.  

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It’s weird because when I woke up 
                        this morning, this really isn’t how 
                        I imagined the day going.

           An e-mail ping sounds.  Alan checks it.

           From: Bergdorf Goodman Promotions                                       
           To: Alan Pierce                                                                
           We’ve just added TOM FORD special edition clip-on sunglasses 
           in Rose Gold/Green to our app -- $1,950.00!  Pre-order, now!

                                 ALAN
                        I do need new sunglasses.  I should 
                        probably pre-order these.

           INT. ALAN’S DINING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           A LAVISH FEAST set out.  Crisp white linen table cloth.  The 
           best flatware, the best plates, the best napkin rings.

           All of Damien’s organs are cooked to perfection.  Delectable, 
           elaborate recipes.  Served on exquisite, designer china.

           Behind the table -- a WINDOW WASHER (30’s) cleans the 
           building’s apartment windows.  Listens to headphones.

           Alan, utterly miserable, sits at the head of the table.  
           Napkin tucked into his neck collar.  Loud sigh. 

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I can’t help but wonder where my 
                        life would be if I didn’t post that 
                        ad on the cannibal website.  I 
                        shouldn’t have asked.  I really 
                        shouldn’t have asked.

           He puts a small chunk -- exactly one bite -- on his plate.  
           Hits a ketchup bottle until a massive dollop plops on top. 

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        It will be bad.  It will make me 
                        severely sick.

                                 (MORE)

                                 ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He would never know if I didn’t eat 
                        him.  However, I am a man of my 
                        word.

           He places it in his mouth.  Bites down.

           IT’S VERY HARD.

           -- so hard, he drops his fork and knife.  Spits out PLASTIC.  
           A white, hard chunk rolls across the table.

           Blood (from a chipped tooth) dribbles down his chin.  The 
           drops deeply stain the beautiful, luxurious table linen.

           Alan picks up the chunk.  Looks at it. 

                                 ALAN
                        It’s... solid plastic.

           He pushes away his plate.  Grimaces.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Damien.  You have no followers.  
                        You taste like nothing because you 
                        are nothing.  Empty, hollow.  You 
                        are literal plastic.

           Alan glances at the window washer.  There’s something “off”.  
           He gets up from his seat to look closer.  The washer is 
           frozen in a washing position.  They are a mannequin.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (taps window)
                        Hello?

           Zero response.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I said HELLO!  Look.  Whatever you 
                        just saw -- I did not want to eat 
                        that guy.  He wanted me to eat him.  
                        It’s very complicated.

           Out of the corner of his eye, Alan spots a Hermés Crocodile 
           Peacoat.  It hangs on a coat rack in the foyer.  Not his.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        This must be Damien’s.  It’s the 
                        latest in semi-formal winter wear.

           He tries it on, admiring himself in the mirror.  Cut just 
           right -- his same size.  He grabs his Louis Vuitton shoulder 
           bag (Perfect Head’s hair sticking out) and walks outside.
           EXT. ALAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           It’s lightly snowing.  Everyone on the street is a flawless 
           MANNEQUIN.  Doormen.  Hot dog vendors.  Children, families 
           strolling along the sidewalk.  People inside shops.  

           All frozen in place.  Staring at phones.  Clutching shopping 
           bags.  Hailing cabs.  Eating, mid-bite.  Usual “city stuff”.

                                 ALAN
                             (dazed)
                        Am I -- am I the only real person 
                        in New York right now?  

           Snow whirls and flutters around him.  Glistens under street 
           lamps.  Alan is PANICKED.  He races from mannequin to 
           mannequin, rustling them.  Approaches an unmoving WOMAN.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                             (to “Woman”)
                        Excuse me, Miss?  What’s happened 
                        to everyone? 

           Her shoulder -- that he has grabbed -- snaps off.  He tries 
           to put it back on to no avail, finally throwing it down.

           Alan runs down the street.  Skidding on snow, ice.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        PLEASE, anyone!
                             (to nearby “Man”)
                        Chemical warfare?  A manufactured 
                        disease?  Am I a mannequin, too?

           Alan runs to a large set of glass doors, out-of-breath.  
           Stares at his reflection.  Pokes his face.  Assures himself 
           his skin is real.  Looks up at the sign above the door:

                                    BERGDORF GOODMAN’S

           A gold-plated beacon.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        When nothing else makes sense, 
                        Bergdorf’s always does.

           INT. BERGDORF GOODMAN’S - DAY

           It’s quiet.  Alan wanders room-to-room, taking refuge in the 
           exceptional quality (and large selection) of luxury products.

           Armies of well-dressed shoppers clutch armfuls of bags.  Wide 
           smiles, glee.  All frozen in time.  All mannequins.  
                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        The decor!  The clothing, the hats.  
                        Cuff links.  The suits!  Scarves, 
                        gowns, rompers.  Everything.

           Fingers graze fabrics as he inhales the scents.  Feels the 
           wrist seam of a faux fur coat on an official store mannequin.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Burberry cashmere wool mohair.  
                        Some of the finest.  Wash in cool 
                        water, lay flat to dry.

           He’s a bit giddy that no one is there.  He sprints through 
           the SHOE SECTION.  Gathers piles of shoes.  Spins around.

                                 ALAN
                        Smell that!  This intoxicating 
                        aroma -- drenched in pure Italy.  
                        Astonishing Sutor Mantellassi! 
                             (verge-of-tears)
                        Prada spazzolato creeper brogue 
                        platform shoes.  Calf hair low-top 
                        sneakers.  The $260 Salvatore 
                        Ferragamo shoe cleaning kit... 

           Alan sinks into a pony hair chair.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ll take it.  And I’ll take that.  
                        And this.  I’ll take this and that 
                        and that.  I’ll take it all.

           EXT. BERGDORF GOODMAN’S - DAY

           Alan loiters in front one of their famous, competitive WINDOW 
           DISPLAYS (that we can’t see yet).  His Louis Vuitton shoulder 
           bag slung across his back.  It’s still snowing around him.

           WE PULL OUT.  Dozens of holiday shoppers move behind him.  
           The world is alive again.  He stares forward with an 
           intensity -- a furrowed brow -- at the store window display.  

           THE STORE WINDOW.  We pan up from the bottom, seeing 
           mannequin feet.  A “holiday spectacular” theme at an office 
           desk.  Gift bags piled at the stylish heels of PARTY-GOERS.

           Alan leans in.  Taps the glass.

                                 ALAN
                        Peek-a-boo!
                             (whispers)
                        I found you.
           REVEALED.  In the window “scene”: TRISHA, SoulCycle girl 
           JESSICA, TIFFANY, and DAMIEN’s heads are on mannequin bodies.  

           “Damien” folds his arms, bemused.  Wears the latest men’s 
           suit style as seen in GQ Magazine.  “The girls” are giggling, 
           impeccably draped in stunning Bergdorf’s party outfits.

           Half a dozen BERGDORF GOODMAN holiday shopping bags sit at 
           their feet.  They gush over “Trisha’s” prop phone.

           Happy expressions.  Flawless faces.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        I gave you girls everything you 
                        could possibly want.  This is how 
                        you repay me?  You’re --
                             (disgust, motions to 
                              Damien)
                        With him??

           He points to the empty “prop bags” at their feet.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        What’s in there?  Who got you that 
                        stuff?  A shopping spree?  Is  
                        someone else financing you?  

           Leans in further.  Palms against the glass.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        Trisha.  Come out.  Come play with 
                        me!  Won’t you come out?  Talk to 
                        me?  Return my calls?  You have a 
                        phone.  I can see it!
                             (presses nose to glass)
                        We can be together...

           SUDDENLY.  A gloved hand on his shoulder.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        Alan Pierce.

           Alan turns.  It’s Stranger.  He’s wearing a wool coat, scarf, 
           and beret.  He rubs his hands together in the brutal cold.  

                                 STRANGER (CONT'D)
                             (freezing)
                        Give me the head, Alan.

                                 ALAN
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.  Who are you?
                                 STRANGER
                        Her head.  Now.

           Alan begrudgingly reaches into his Louis Vuitton shoulder 
           bag.  Takes out Perfect Head’s head.  It’s an obvious plastic 
           mannequin head.  He grips her tightly by her hair.  Unmoving.

                                 STRANGER (CONT'D)
                        Alan.  I need to clean it up and 
                        get it back on the 4th floor.

           Stranger grabs it.

                                 STRANGER (CONT'D)
                        Steal from me again, and we’ll have 
                        a problem.  Knock it off, dude.

           Alan takes out an American Express centurion black card.  The 
           best, most exclusive, highest-limit card one could have.

                                 ALAN
                        Please.  May I purchase them?  All 
                        of them.  The entire window.  With  
                        clothes.  With the gift bags, too.

                                 STRANGER
                        Not until the end of the season.  
                        We’ve been over this many times.

                                 ALAN
                             (frustrated)
                        But I know them!

           Alan grabs for Perfect Head.  Stranger yanks it out-of-reach.  
           He walks away as Alan tugs his coat shoulder with urgency.  

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        They’re trapped inside the display.  
                        They hate it.  They want to come 
                        home to my studio.  They told me.  

                                 STRANGER
                        You can pick them up in two months.

           He disappears into the hectic crowd.  Alan steadies himself 
           against the window glass, clutching his stomach in pain.

           INT. ALAN’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Mannequin parts are everywhere.  Jutting out of the sink.  
           Scattered on the floor.  Fully made-up heads lay sideways on 
           counters.  Limbs torn off.  Most are partially smashed.  
           Alan grips a plastic arm.  Repeatedly bashes it against the 
           counter.  He carefully gathers the small plastic chunks.

           Puts it in his GRINDER.

           Emily wears a sexy Agent Provocateur Avery playsuit.  She 
           lingers outside the kitchen, seductively.

                                 EMILY
                        Honey, I wish you wouldn’t eat 
                        that.  The plastic is killing your 
                        stomach.  What did your doctor say?

           Alan drops ice in the grinder.  Adds Whole Foods “gluten-
           free” water.  Blends it, ignoring her.  In his own world.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        OK, well.  It’s Thursday.  You know 
                        what that means.  I’ll be waiting.

           INT. ALAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emily -- slightly perturbed -- sits among piles of MANNEQUINS 
           in various undress.  Male, female.  She balances a phone on 
           her shoulder while painting her nails a hedonistic, ruby red. 

                                 EMILY
                             (in phone)
                        May we talk later, Kate?  I have to 
                        have sex with the mannequins again.  
                        It’s such a bizarre fetish, but, 
                        you know how hard it is to date.  
                        Especially in New York!

           All department store-quality.  They stick out of every 
           corner.  Half are fully dressed, half are “naked”.

           CLOSE-UP.  Many are savagely ripped apart.  Appendages and 
           eyes gouged out.  Heads crudely mounted on the walls.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                             (giggle)
                        Aiden like, steals them from 
                        Bergdorf’s.  Says he “knows” them 
                        because he shops there so 
                        frequently.  He names them!

           Heads and limbs peak out from under the bed.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        Has little story lines.  Spends 
                        sooo much money dressing them up!

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        One’s his “boss”, one’s a model in 
                        GQ Magazine.  Some he says are in 
                        his SoulCycle class.  It’s cute.  
                        Until he tries to --

           A loud grinding noise comes from the kitchen...

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                             (low)
                        -- eat them!  Blending them up to 
                        eat the dust.  I had to call his 
                        doctor.  He was getting so sick.

           Alan hacks up a lung.  She pauses.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        He’s cooped up in here all day.  
                        Only talks to UberLUX drivers and 
                        Bergdorf’s sales people.  It’s not 
                        healthy!  Has family money, but why 
                        not get a little side job?
                             (sighs)
                        Also, Bergdorf’s is going out of 
                        business.  What with retail “dying” 
                        and all.  I haven’t the heart to 
                        tell him, yet.

           INT. ALAN’S WORKSPACE - NIGHT

           TAP-TAP-TAP of keyboard keys...

           Alan quickly scrolls through endless filtered, vibrant 
           Instagram pages.  Fake limbs strewn about his workspace.  

           An open GQ Magazine sits nearby.  Faces circled in ads.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Anatomically perfect bodies.  
                        Everyone is a doll.  There is no 
                        awkward phase, perfection is 
                        mandatory.  This is the world.  
                        This is my world.

           He stops on the page of Instagram model NATALIA (27).

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        Look at that facial structure, that 
                        jaw bone.  Symmetry in all the 
                        right places.  My salivary glands 
                        are awakened.  280K followers?  
                        Yes!
           Alan puts on his glasses.  Starts painting her image (from a 
           post) on the plain canvas of a blank mannequin head.  
           Beautiful strokes of acrylic bring her features to life.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’ll stalk her out at Masa.  Only 
                        the freshest ingredients served, 
                        the freshest meat attending.  I’ll 
                        wear my best suit -- my Ermenegildo 
                        Zegna sharkskin trofeo two-piece in 
                        light blue -- to impress her.

           He picks out a human hair wig from his ample supply (under 
           his work desk).  He adjusts it, carefully combing parts of it 
           back.  Totally mimics the Instagram post on his screen.

                                 ALAN (V.O.)
                        I’ll take her back to my studio.  
                        Butcher her up, cook the scraps.  
                        Grind her bones into a protein 
                        shake.  The health benefits of 
                        ingesting perfect symmetry are 
                        insane.  I’ll feel so-much-better!

           Alan ties a Hermés scarf around her neck.

                                 ALAN 
                        Would you like that, darling?

           Her mouth curls up into a smile.

                                 NATALIA
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        I love you, Alan.

                                 ALAN
                        I love you, too.

           THE END.
