                                                         FADE IN:

           EXT. BUCHANAN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

           A place of beauty. Hallowed halls of brick and stone. Birds 
           chirp. Bells toll, stately and serene.

           Statues of long-dead rich white men look out over perfectly 
           manicured lawns.

           PULL BACK THROUGH ornate gothic windows, into the...

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           ...Where students sit at attention, laptops open. Eager 
           undergrads who would consider themselves woke.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (O.S.)
                        If you've done the reading, which 
                        you should have--

           We move across the sea of mostly WHITE faces, toward the 
           front of the room...

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        --you probably noticed the big ol'
                        trigger warning on the syllabus.

           In the middle of the pack, we find... KUNLE (21, Black), 
           listening intently to the lecture.

           But looking closer, we see Kunle's doodling in the margin of 
           his notes. He's sketching a cute GIRL, who's biting her pen, 
           deep in thought. He's actually pretty good.

           At the front of the room, PROFESSOR CLARKE (50s, White, 
           British) stands behind her lectern.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I know we're inches away from 
                        Spring Break, but I'd like us all 
                        to stay focused and respectful 
                        today. Sound good? So, we've talked 
                        about the power of language...

           Kunle looks over at a cute girl, biting her pen. We'll come 
           to know this girl as BIANCA (21, White).

           As the professor goes on, Kunle feels a tap on his shoulder. 
           He turns, reluctantly, to see...

           SEAN (21, Black), his best friend, leaning in 
           conspiratorially. He's a big, athletic-looking guy, incapable 
           of being totally inconspicuous.
                                 SEAN
                            (whispering)
                        Yo. I got us into Blackout.

                                 KUNLE
                        For real?

           Sean does a quick, quiet dance of celebration, before 
           slouching back down in his seat, eyes glued to the phone 
           screen hidden in his lap. He resumes texting.

           Kunle turns back to the lecture, where...

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE
                        ...we're talking about hate speech. 
                        You are free to step outside if you 
                        need to...

           Suddenly, Kunle looks down. Sean is sneakily handing him a 
           Gatorade bottle. Kunle shakes his head. Not now.

           Sean clocks Kunle's drawing. Takes a big swig of "Gatorade." 

           Kunle, embarrassed, turns the page, hiding his sketch.

           A beat. Kunle's phone buzzes in his pocket. He takes it out. 
           It's a series of texts from Sean:

                   you so thirsty

                   you drawing your own hentai [cry-laugh emoji]

           Kunle looks over to see Sean is, in fact, stifling a laugh. 
           He replies:

                                              [brown middle finger 
           emoji]

                   i gotchu fam

                   tonight im your wingman

                   we'll find you a nice horny drunk chick

                   [string of nonsense emojis, including many eggplants]

           Kunle rolls his eyes, turns his attention back to class:

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        Before we go any further, I just 
                        want to re-state the trigger 
                        warning. Good? Good. So. Let's talk 
                        about... the infamous N word.
           The word NIGGER is projected, large, on the screen overhead.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        The word "nigger" has a long and 
                        terrible history.

           Sean and Kunle exchange glances. Did she just say it?

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        It occupies a unique space in 
                        modern American vernacular, as it 
                        is so taboo that some of you are 
                        likely feeling uncomfortable right 
                        now, even when the term is used in 
                        an isolated, academic context. My 
                        question for you is: what makes 
                        this word so powerful?

           The class is quiet. Then a WHITE STUDENT raises her hand.

                                 WHITE STUDENT
                        I mean, because it's racist?

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE
                        There are other racist, offensive 
                        words. Why is nigger different?

           It catches the room off-guard, again.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        The word originates in the Spanish 
                        negro, and at first it was a 
                        neutral term...

           As she continues, Sean leans toward Kunle.

                                 SEAN
                            (sotto)
                        Yo...Is this allowed?

                                 KUNLE
                        I mean... It's on the syllabus... 
                        There was a trigger warning.

                    PROFESSOR CLARKE
                                                      SEAN
                                          She keeps saying it.
           --whereas the word "nigga" 
           with an "a" at the end 
           occupies a different space, 
           somehow lesser than its hard 
           r counterpart--

           Kunle notices students glancing over at him, uncomfortable.
                                 KUNLE (CONT’D)
                        She's British. Maybe she doesn't 
                        know...

                                 SEAN
                        If she don't know, why's she 
                        teaching a class on it?

           A beat, as they both realize... the professor has gone quiet. 
           And she is looking right at them.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE
                        I don't mean to put you two on the 
                        spot, but it sounds like you have 
                        something to say. Please...

           Sean doesn't seem to want to say anything.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONT'D)
                            (sincere)
                        This is a safe place. What do you 
                        think keeps this word so powerful?

           We pull out to see the rest of the students, waiting eagerly 
           for Sean and Kunle to weigh in.

                                 KUNLE
                        I... I think part of it is because, 
                        as a society--

           The lecture hall doors burst open, revealing a horde of DRUNK 
           GUYS (19ish, White) wearing suits of armor made of Budweiser 
           boxes, holding long "swords" made of duct-taped beer cans.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        SPRING BREAK, YEAAAAAH!

           Kunle watches, stunned, as the drunk guys charge all the way 
           across the room... and out the opposite doors.

           A beat. Everyone is staring at him once more.

                                 PROFESSOR CLARKE
                        Sorry about that. You were saying?

                                                   SMASH TO TITLE:

           Music BLARES like a POLICE SIREN. One word fills the screen:

           05/30/20

           EXT. LECTURE HALL - CAMPUS - DUSK

           Students flood out of the lecture hall, Sean and Kunle among 
           them. Sean shakes his head at Kunle. They walk and talk:

                                 KUNLE
                        What? I was participating in the 
                        discussion. You could've spoken up, 
                        if it bothered you so much. You 
                        just sat there--

                                 SEAN
                        In silent protest.

                                 BIANCA (O.S.)
                        Kunle!

           The girl from Kunle's drawing falls in step with them. She's 
           got boss nerd energy.

                                 BIANCA (CONT'D)
                        Hey guys. That was...

                                 KUNLE
                        Weird? Yeah...

                                 SEAN
                        That was fucked up.

                                 BIANCA
                        She shouldn't have put you guys on 
                        the spot like that. I'm on Student 
                        Senate, if you want to like... 
                        start a movement or something. 
                        Totally up to you. No pressure.

                                 KUNLE
                        Thanks. We'll, uh, think about it.

           An awkward beat. Kunle clearly wants to talk to her about 
           something--anything--but can't find the words.

                                 SEAN
                        You going out tonight, B?

                                 BIANCA
                        For once, I am. Got a pass to 
                        Underground. You?

                                 KUNLE
                        Nice. We're, uh, going to some 
                        parties too...
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        Seven parties.

                                 BIANCA
                        So... all the parties. You're doing 
                        a Legendary Tour?
                            (beat)
                        Wooow. It took me three weeks of 
                        ass-kissing just to get into one.

                                 KUNLE
                        Good thing you didn't get pink eye. 
                        From all the ass-kissing.

           Sean cringes, but she seems to find it charming.

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh I did. But seven parties. You 
                        guys must have like super crusty 
                        pink eye. Virulent conjunctivitis.

                                 KUNLE
                        We're not going for the parties, 
                        really. It's been kind of like our 
                        inside joke, since freshman year-

                                 SEAN
                        We gonna be the first niggas at 
                        this school to do a Legendary Tour.

                                 BIANCA
                        Is that... something people keep 
                        track of?

                         SEAN
                                                     KUNLE
           Yeah.
                                          Yeah.

                                 SEAN
                        The Black Student Union has 
                        something called...

                                                        FLASH TO:

           INT. BLACK STUDENT UNION - HALL OF FIRSTS - DAY

           We see the whole HALL OF FIRSTS wall, an expansive array of 
           PHOTO PLAQUES.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        The Hall of Firsts. You get a fancy 
                        plaque if you're the first black 
                        person to do something at Buchanan.
                                 KUNLE (V.O.)

                        But they also include other firsts 
                        like First Black Man to set foot in 
                        Omicron.

           This is a plaque featuring the same woman from the Black 
           Student Government President plaque.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DUSK

           Back to Sean, Kunle, and Bianca, walking and talking.

                                 SEAN
                        So yeah, we're gonna make Buchanan 
                        history tonight. We're on our way 
                        to pick up our Blackout passes 
                        right now.

                                 BIANCA
                        Well I salute you in your endeavor. 
                            (she salutes)
                        See you guys out there?

                                 SEAN
                        We'll text you when we get to  
                        Underground. You got her number?

           Kunle can tell what he's doing. Helping. It's obvious.

                                 KUNLE
                        I do.
           05/30/20

                                 BIANCA
                        Text me!

           She waves, walks off. Kunle watches her go.

                                 SEAN
                        She wants your dick bruh.

           They walk and talk, back toward the doors...

                                 KUNLE
                        She's just being nice.

                                 SEAN
                        Nice to your dick.

           EXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DUSK

           They continue out into the courtyard.

                                 SEAN
                        What's the problem? She likes you.  
                        I'm telling you: she craving that 
                        BBC. Or small-BC, I ain't seen it. 

                                 KUNLE
                        I don't know... We're graduating in 
                        two months. I don't want to start 
                        something, just to break up.

                                 SEAN
                        Or like, you could just smash.
                            (beat)
                        We're gonna be living like a half 
                        hour away from here next year. The 
                        city's not that far.

           Beat. Kunle changes the subject:

                                 KUNLE
                        So should we like... say something? 
                        About Professor Clarke? That was 
                        fucked up, right? Isn't it like our 
                        moral imperative to do something?

                                 SEAN
                        We're still talking about this?

                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                                          Okay, guess so.
                         KUNLE
           She didn't have to say it to 
           make her point...
                                 KUNLE
                        But on the other hand, it's a class 
                        about blasphemy and taboos. It's 
                        literally called Blasphemy and 
                        Taboos. So if we got her fired, 
                        would that be, like, censorship? 
                        I'm against censorship.

                                 SEAN
                        I mean, we could start a moral 
                        crusade. Or we could just... not.

                                 KUNLE
                        I guess she wasn't throwing the 
                        word around, like, willy-nilly.

                                 SEAN
                        No, that was some willy-nilly-ass 
                        shit. She didn't have to say it. 
                        She wanted us to react.

           Kunle gives him a thoughtful look. Sean can see what's 
           coming: Kunle's entered into intellectual discussion mode. 
           Once he's started, he cannot be stopped.

                                 KUNLE
                        But that was kind of the point, 
                        right? To analyze why we have that 
                        reaction. Why is it so bad? Like, 
                        if a white man says the n-word 
                        alone in the woods with no one 
                        around to hear it, is it bad?

                                 SEAN
                        This white dude walks into the 
                        middle of the forest just to say 
                        the n-word?

                                 KUNLE
                        He's never said it before, never 
                        says it again. He doesn't hate us.  
                        He just wants to whisper it quietly 
                        to himself. Like...
                            (whispering)
                        Nigger.

                                 SEAN
                        That's fucked up.

                                 KUNLE
                        Why though?

                                 SEAN
                        You're such a fuckin' Oreo, man.
           That stings a bit, but Kunle pushes forth. 

                                 KUNLE
                        From a deontological perspective, 
                        maybe a word can be inherently bad. 
                        But from a consequentialist 
                        perspective-

                                 SEAN
                        It's not that complicated: Most of 
                        the rules are made by wypipo. We 
                        made like one rule that we ask 
                        white people to respect. One. Thou 
                        shalt not use that one word. But 
                        they don't like us telling them 
                        what to do, so they be looking for 
                        loopholes. So when your white man 
                        whispers nigger in a forest, he 
                        breaketh the covenant. It ain't 
                        like pure evil, it's disrespect.

           Kunle takes this in, thoughtful.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Anyone ever called you nigger, 
                        Kunle?

                                 KUNLE
                        You.

                                 SEAN
                        Not like that.

                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                         KUNLE
           I mean... online--
                                          No. To your face. For real.

                                 KUNLE
                        ...No.

           Sean shrugs. Then they don't need to keep talking. BUZZ. He 
           gets a text.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        I think this was a productive 
                        discussion.

                                 SEAN
                        We all really learned something...
                            (re: the text)
                        FUCK. Victor gave away our 
                        Underground passes. Fuck Victor. 
                        Man, where we gonna find 
                        Underground passes this late?
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        I don't know but I believe in you.

           QUICK CUTS:

           - A KEY going into a LOCK.

           - KUNLE and SEAN put on lab coats, safety googles, gloves.

           - Kunle pulls a tray of PETRI DISHES from a SPECIAL FRIDGE.

           INT. BIO LAB - NIGHT

           Kunle peers down his microscope at a MOLD SAMPLE.

                                 SEAN
                        I think I got a lead.

           Sean texts furiously, taking swigs from a GATORADE BOTTLE 
           filled with a BRIGHT PINK LIQUID. He offers some to Kunle, 
           who declines.

                                 KUNLE
                        I just can't go too hard tonight. 
                        I've gotta be here to check my mold 
                        samples in the morning.

                                 SEAN
                        You sound like a young mother, and 
                        those are like your gross little 
                        fungus babies.

                                 KUNLE
                        They are my little fungus babies.
                            (to his fungus)
                        Aren't you? Who's gonna get daddy 
                        published? You are.

           Sean is thoroughly grossed out.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        You think maybe you should come 
                        into the lab this week? Your data 
                        won't analyze itself. Just saying.

                                 SEAN
                        It's Spring Break. It's a break. I 
                        have like three weeks til it's due.

                                 KUNLE
                        You're here. You could get some 
                        work done. Three weeks is nothing.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        Three weeks is three weeks. And I 
                        am working. On passes for 
                        Underground.

                                 KUNLE
                        If we can't get into all seven 
                        parties, it's not the end of the 
                        world. It will be the end of the 
                        world if you don't graduate, man.

                                 SEAN
                        Kunle. We're making history here. 
                        Get your priorities straight.

           Kunle gives up, for now. He tried.

                                 KUNLE
                        Well, can you at least ask for an 
                        extra pass for Carlos? It seems 
                        like he should come to one party 
                        tonight. He's always wanted to go 
                        to Underground.

           Sean hands Kunle his Gatorade bottle. Kunle takes a small 
           sip. He almost spits it out, horrified.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, what is this?

                                 SEAN
                        Death punch. We need to get a buzz 
                        going, we're on a schedule. I'll be 
                        right back. Hurry the fuck up.

           Sean sheds his lab coat, rushes out of the lab.

           Kunle sighs. Takes another tiny sip of death punch. Ugh, 
           nope. He screws the cap back on the Gatorade bottle...

           INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a tiny bundle of PARTY PASSES, small colorful cards, 
           each the size of a business card. Sean's fratty friend LEO 
           (19, Puerto Rican) flicks through the bundle, finds two for 
           UNDERGROUND. Holds it out...

           Sean takes it.

                                 SEAN
                        Thanks man, I owe you one.
                                 LEO
                        Yeah you fuckin' do. You're lucky, 
                        I almost gave my last Undergrounds 
                        to a cute freshman. Then I found 
                        out she's trying to do long 
                        distance with her boyfriend, so now 
                        I gotta wait that shit out.

           Sean looks up at someone, walking his way... 

           ASA (21, Black), his recent ex, a smart, no-bullshit young 
           woman, currently in her bathrobe, shower caddy in hand.

           He bids farewell to Leo, and gives Asa a charming smile. But 
           she knows him too well to be impressed. She walks right past 
           him, toward her dorm room.

           He trails along behind her.

                                 SEAN
                        Asa. Where you gonna be tonight?

           Asa isn't sure she wants to tell him. A beat. She can't help 
           it, a part of her still likes him.

                                 ASA
                        Equinox. And Underground.

                                 SEAN
                        Me too. Me and Kunle, we're finally 
                        doing our Legendary Tour.

                                 ASA
                        For real? Sounds intense. And 
                        possibly ill-advised.

                                 SEAN
                        "Intense and possibly ill-advised" 
                        is the tagline for the night.

           She unlocks her door, but lingers in her doorway.

                                 ASA
                        As your friend, I just wanna say 
                        for the record that maybe you 
                        should take it easy.

                                 SEAN
                        I'd love to take it easy, but we're 
                        making history--

                        I'm serious. You want to end up on 
                        probation again?

                        You're gonna do what you're gonna 
                        do. Just don't die.

                                 SEAN
                        I'm not gonna die.

                                 ASA
                        Don't be dragging Kunle into some 
                        bullshit. That boy is Black 
                        Excellence. There's still hope for 
                        him. Bye Sean.

           She snaps the door shut, leaving him alone in the hall.

           INT. BIO LAB - NIGHT

           Kunle's talking on the phone with his MAMA (50s, Black). She 
           has a Nigerian accent.

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        Your Anti sent you a package. Did 
                        you get it?

                                 KUNLE
                        Oh, I haven't been home yet--

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        Remember to call her and say thank 
                        you. I told her you got into 
                        Princeton and you'll be doing your 
                        PhD there, and now she is telling 
                        everyone you're going to be a 
                        doctor.

                                 KUNLE
                        Well technically, I will be a 
                        doctor, just not of medicine.

                                 MAMA
                        It's not too late to go to med 
                        school. You would be a wonderful 
                        cardiologist.

                                 KUNLE
                        Mama...

                                 MAMA (V.O.)
                        I know. I'm so proud of my baby... 
                        But you know what professors get 
                        paid, Kunle?

           Sean bursts in. Fourteen colorful passes fanned out in his 
           hand. He fans himself with them, victorious.
                                 SEAN
                        You better be ready to fucking 
                        party. Look at this shit.

                                 MAMA (V.O.)
                        Party? What party?

                                 KUNLE
                        No--It's not really a party. Sean 
                        and I are just hanging out with 
                        some friends tonight.

           Kunle mouths "my mom." Sean gives him an apologetic look.

                                 MAMA (V.O.)
                        Why are you going to a party? You 
                        should be working on your thesis.

                                 KUNLE
                        I am--

                                 MAMA (V.O.)
                        If you don't do well on your 
                        thesis, Princeton will unadmit you. 
                        It's not too late for them to 
                        change their mind, you know. I've 
                        seen in happen. You will lose your 
                        fellowship--

                                 KUNLE
                        Mama. I know. I'm working on it. 
                        Literally right now I am standing 
                        in the lab, working on it.

                                 MAMA (V.O.)
                        I don't like that Sean boy. He is a 
                        bad influence. Undisciplined. On 
                        his Instagram, he is always vaping. 
                        Tell him that vaping is bad for his 
                        health.

                                 KUNLE
                        I will.

           He looks up at Sean, who he notices is drawing something 
           rather elaborate on the whiteboard.

                                 MAMA
                        You don't vape, do you?

                                 KUNLE
                        Of course not. It's bad for you--
           05/30/20

                                 MAMA
                        What does he want to do with his 
                        life, besides party and show his 
                        abdominal muscles to the Internet?

                                 KUNLE
                        He's figuring it out--

                                 MAMA
                        No ambition... Why don't you hang 
                        out with that Asian boy from your 
                        debate club?

                                                  MAMA (CONT'D)
                         KUNLE
           Brian Phan? I do--
                                          Or your friend Carlos, the 
                                          one who interned at SpaceX? 
                                          He seems like a sweet boy. 
                                          Oh, I have a patient, I have 
                                          to go. Remember to call Anti-

                                 KUNLE
                        I will. Bye Mom.

           Kunle hangs up. Takes a breath. 

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        My mother would like me to tell you 
                        that vaping is bad for you. Please 
                        block her on Instagram.

                                 SEAN
                        Hell no. Your mom's scary. She'll 
                        call me and make me un-block her. 
                        Alright, I need you to pay 
                        attention, this is important.

           Pull back to see... Sean's drawn a MAP of the campus parties, 
           complete with all the night's party names, locations, times.

                        Our Legendary Tour. We start at 
                        Blackout, and work our way east.

           IMAGINED SLOW-MO MONTAGE OF THE AWESOME NIGHT AHEAD:

           FIRST STOP ON THE MAP: BLACKOUT

           INT. BLACKOUT PARTY - NIGHT

           Kunle and Sean step past the Bouncers, through the fog, and 
           into...Blackout. Everyone's in all white, looking awesome 
           under the blacklights. Lasers dance across their skin.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        First, Blackout. This is essential: 
                        they will have an ice luge. We need 
                        to go early before it gets gross.

           Alcohol streams down a magnificent ice luge, into the mouths 
           of Sean and Kunle.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        We will play no more than two 
                        rounds of beer pong. Then we will 
                        head to...Kappa. 

           SECOND STOP ON THE MAP: GREEN ROOM

           I/E. GREEN ROOM PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean whispers the password to a Bouncer...

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        But we don't go in the front door. 
                        No. We go in the side door... Give 
                        them the password, and go straight 
                        upstairs to the Green Room.

           Kunle and Sean roll into a psychedelic private party that is 
           100% green. Green lights, green walls, green everything.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        You do not eat any of the baked 
                        goods, unless you want to be high 
                        out of your motherfucking mind.

           Imaginary Kunle politely turns down a pot brownie from one of 
           the partygoers. Sean takes one and nibbles on it...

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Then we gotta get through stops 
                        three through five real quick. Zeta-
                        Eta-Theta...

           QUICK CUTS:

           THIRD STOP ON THE MAP: ZETA-ETA-THETA

           INT. ZETA-ETA-THETA PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean and Kunle dance in a slightly too well lit room.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Lame but we gotta do it.

           FOURTH STOP: OMICRON PHI KAPPA

           INT. OMICRON PHI KAPPA  PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean and Kunle dance. They're wearing nothing but trash bags 
           for pants.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Omicron Phi Kappa. They're ABC--
                        anything but clothes.

           FIFTH STOP: PHI PHI PHI (TRI-PHI)

           INT. TRI-PHI PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean and Kunle pound energy drinks.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        ...Quick pit stop at Tri-Phi for 
                        energy drinks. Gotta make sure 
                        we're ready for...

           SIXTH STOP ON THE MAP: EQUINOX

           INT. EQUINOX PARTY - NIGHT

           The moment imaginary Sean and Kunle enter the new-age/earth 
           mother themed party, flower garlands are put on their heads.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Number Six... Equinox. Asa's 
                        supposed to be there.

           We see Dream Asa, looking like a badass flower goddess.

           BACK TO REALITY--

           INT. BIO LAB - NIGHT

                                 KUNLE
                        You guys are talking again?

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 KUNLE
                        Like, just friends talking, or...?

                                 SEAN
                        We'll see.

           BACK TO MONTAGE--
           05/30/20

           INT. EQUINOX PARTY - NIGHT

           Dream Asa walks up to Sean, and dances with him.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        Here we dance.

           Sean, Asa, and Kunle begin to dance with abandon, surrounded 
           by friends. Drinks in hand. It's utter bliss.

                                 SEAN (V.O.)
                        And then finally... the best for 
                        last... Underground.

           LAST STOP ON THE MAP: UNDERGROUND.

           I/E. UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean and Kunle step up to the party. A ray of light hits 
           them, as if the heavens have opened up.

           Kunle sees someone inside, surrounded by a halo of light... 
           Bianca. Beckoning them inside.

           The whole crew steps into the party, and disappears into the 
           blinding heavenly light.

           BACK TO REALITY:

           INT. BIO LAB - NIGHT

           Sean puts down the yardstick, admiring his work.

           He turns back to the whiteboard.

                                 SEAN
                        You take Bianca home, I take some 
                        even hotter chick home, and that's 
                        our night. Any questions?

                                 KUNLE
                        So, did you get the extra 
                        Underground pass? For Carlos?

                                 SEAN
                        Yo, it was hard enough to get two 
                        passes. I'm not wasting any favors 
                        on fucking Winnie the Pooh. What 
                        would it be like if he came along? 
                        Think about it: One, he's gonna 
                        insist on wearing that stupid 
                        fucking fanny pack.

                        Two, he'll scare away any and all 
                        women within a hundred yard radius 
                        by offering them granola bars and 
                        talking about his SpaceX signing 
                        bonus. And three, he can't hold his 
                        liquor so you'll have to babysit 
                        him all night while he throws up, 
                        because I'm not doing it again.
                            (re: Kunle's look)
                        He's happy where he is. He started 
                        playing games after his last class 
                        yesterday, and hasn't left his room 
                        since. We probably won't see him 
                        for the rest of the week, he's so 
                        happy. We should remind him to 
                        like, eat and shower and stuff. He 
                        might actually die. ANYWAY. Any 
                        other questions?

                                 KUNLE
                        Are we gonna die?

                                 SEAN
                        No. But you're gonna want to die a 
                        year from now, when you realize 
                        this will be the greatest 
                        accomplishment of our lives, and 
                        it's all downhill from here.

           Kunle closes his special refrigerator. He takes out his key 
           to lock it, but right before he puts it in--

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        SHIT!

           Startled, Kunle turns around.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        It's already 7! We still need to 
                        get food before we pregame.

           As they leave, we hold on the refrigerator cabinet. It's 
           barely--just BARELY--cracked open.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, COLLEGE TOWN - NIGHT

           Music plays as Kunle and Sean make their way down main 
           street, both eating pizza as they go. Sean is working his way 
           through three slices stacked on top of each other.

           Drunk WHITE GIRLS eye Sean and Kunle, wary. Cross the street.
           As they get further from campus, things get more run-down. 
           They walk past a vacant lot filled with overgrown weeds. Past 
           old-ass houses, held together by sheer willpower.

           EXT. CHEAP STREET - NIGHT

           An EXHALE OF SMOKE. It's darker now. Sean vapes as he and 
           Kunle continue down the cracked sidewalk. He offers the vape 
           to Kunle, who declines.

                                 SEAN
                        You sure man?

                                 KUNLE
                        I can't get high and drunk, I've 
                        gotta pick a lane. I told you I 
                        need to be in the lab super early--

           Kunle stops in his tracks.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Oh shit. Did I lock it? Did I lock 
                        it??

           Sean has no idea what the fuck he's talking about.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        My mold samples. I need to go back.

                                 SEAN
                        You serious? We've only got thirty 
                        minutes to pregame and get to 
                        Blackout. Just text our labmates, 
                        see if one of them can close it--

                                 KUNLE
                        I have to lock it closed with the 
                        key--it comes open!

                                 SEAN
                        Can't they just, like, jam a fork 
                        in it or something?

                         KUNLE
           A fork? What??
                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                                          ...Just to keep it closed til 
                                          tomorrow.

                                 KUNLE
                        It's my thesis! My fungi need to be 
                        at the right temperature and 
                        humidity, or they'll die. Can't we 
                        just... skip the pregame?
                                 SEAN
                        NEVER skip the pregame. Man, if 
                        we're late to the first party, the 
                        whole schedule will be off...

                                 KUNLE
                        Just go ahead without me. I'll meet 
                        up with you there.

                                 SEAN
                        No. I'll drive you back to campus. 
                        But you better be fucking quick... 
                        We got like 5 minutes to pre-game 
                        and change when we get back. Have 
                        anything?

                                 KUNLE
                        I think I have some gin.

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck gin. That shit tastes like 
                        Christmas Tree.

                                 KUNLE
                        I'll make you a Ginnamon Toast 
                        Crunch.

           They approach a beat up old MINIVAN parked on the curb. It's 
           Sean's. He goes to the driver's side, unlocks the doors.

                                 SEAN
                        The fuck is that?

                                 KUNLE
                        Exactly what you think it is. 
                        Carlos invented it. Sounds weird 
                        but it's actually delicious--

           But then, Sean is looking past Kunle, frowning at something. 
           Kunle turns to look toward...

           Their SHITTY DUPLEX APARTMENT BUILDING. The door is ajar.

                                 SEAN
                        Hell no, he did not leave the door 
                        unlocked again.

           Sean charges past Kunle, up the stoop and through the open 
           door. Kunle follows close behind, as--

           INT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           It's completely dark inside. Sean beelines for his bedroom.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        CARLOS! Motherfucker, my PS4 better 
                        still be here.

           Kunle stops on the threshold, notices a PINK CAKE BOX, 
           addressed to him. He picks it up. 

           He steps inside, flicks the lights on... crosses into the 
           kitchen. He quietly sets the box on the counter, opens it. 

           Inside, a cake in Princeton colors, orange and black. It says 
           PRINCETON on it. The inside of the box lid says 
           "Congratulations Kunle! We are so proud of you!" He closes 
           it.

           He looks for somewhere to hide the cake box, out of sight. As 
           he hides the cake, we pull back to see, in the foreground...

           A pair of WOMAN’S LEGS, with bloody knees, sticking out from 
           behind the sofa in the living room. A lamp and some books 
           have been knocked down onto the floor.

                                 SEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Is anything missing in there?

                                 KUNLE
                        I don't think so.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kunle steps into the living room. And then he sees her. WTF?

           Beat. Cautious, Kunle inches forward. Looking down at...

           An UNCONSCIOUS YOUNG WOMAN, laying face-down on the floor. 

           She’s young, maybe 18, and WHITE. She wears a short dress 
           made of PINK DUCT TAPE, and lays there barefoot.

           Sean comes back down the hallway, oblivious.

                                 SEAN
                        Everything seems like it's still 
                        here. But... fucking Winnie the 
                        Pooh. Ima hide his weed until he 
                        learns how to lock the door behind 
                        him--

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean.

           Kunle points at the young woman. They exchange glances... Who 
           the fuck is that?
           They move to the side of her, to see her face. But it's half 
           hidden by her hair.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           Sean gets real close to the girl. He CLAPS in her face.

           She doesn't stir.

                                 SEAN
                        Wake up! Wake up!

           Kunle kneels down beside her. Sean watches anxiously.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        You know her?

           Kunle doesn't. He reaches out toward her--

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        What you doing? Don't touch her--
                        this is like a crime scene!

           Kunle takes her pulse.

                                 KUNLE
                        She's alive. She's... breathing. 
                        Pulse is fast, breathing's slow... 

                                 SEAN
                            (relief)
                        Fuck.

           Kunle rolls the girl onto her back. He takes her by the 
           shoulders, SHAKES her gently.

           Her eyes flutter open for a moment, and then close again. She 
           GROANS, rolls back onto her side. She's clearly out of it.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        What's wrong with her?

           Kunle notices her scraped up knees. Her skirt is pushed up a 
           little too much for comfort...

           He takes a blanket off the couch, drapes it over her lower 
           half. That's better. But still not good.

                                 KUNLE
                        Should we like...call 911?

           He looks up at Sean, but Sean’s eyes are looking down the 
           hallway. He's freaking out.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        Carlos.

           Sean points to the door at the end of the hall. LIGHT comes 
           out from the crack under one door.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        What if he's dead? Fuck. I'm too 
                        fucking high for this shit right 
                        now. Go check. GO!

           Sean pushes a reluctant Kunle down the hallway.

           Kunle proceeds slowly down... Leaving Sean alone. 

           Sean can barely look down at the girl. He clearly wants to be 
           anywhere but here.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - HALLWAY/CARLOS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kunle pauses outside the door. He listens, but hears nothing.

           He cracks the door open, peeking inside. The room is filled 
           with a smoky haze. The walls are filled with posters of anime 
           and SpaceX rockets.

           CARLOS (20, Chicano) is sitting on a yoga ball in front of 
           his gaming computer, earbuds in, extremely focused on his 
           game of Civilization.

           He takes a hit from his bong.

                                 KUNLE
                        Carlos. There's this girl on the--

           Carlos takes out one of his earbuds.

                                 CARLOS
                        Wait. I am presently at war with 
                        Russia and the Aztec Empire. Shit 
                        is getting real.

                                 KUNLE
                        Do you know the girl out there?

                                 CARLOS
                        Wait a second--

           Kunle snatches the mouse from Carlos’ hand.

                    CARLOS (CONT'D)
                                                     KUNLE
           Hey!
                                          This is a turn-based game! 
                                          There is no urgency! There's 
                                          this girl--
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                            (suddenly intrigued)
                        Ahhh, girl problems?

                                 KUNLE
                        There is an unconscious white girl 
                        in our living room.

           Carlos looks at him like, What?

           Suddenly, they hear Sean YELLING downstairs--

           INT. THE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kunle rushes in, Carlos trailing close behind.

           The girl has VOMITED all over the floor. She's coughing. Sean 
           watching her in horror--

           Carlos immediately retches at the sight of the vomit. He 
           shields his eyes.

                                 CARLOS
                        Who is she?

                                 KUNLE
                        We don't know.

           Kunle rushes to her, putting her on her side in recovery 
           position, as she continues to COUGH.

           The coughing subsides. Silence.

                                 SEAN
                        Is she... dead?

           Kunle pokes her on the arm. No response. Then...

           She rolls onto her back. Looks at him, glassy-eyed.

                                 GIRL
                        Mmhnghh... WheresMaddy...? 

                                 KUNLE
                        Hey, what'd you say?

                                 GIRL
                        Canyoutellherim...? Ifeelweird.

           Kunle kneels down, rolls her onto her side again.

                                 SEAN
                        Stop touching her!
                                 KUNLE
                        We have to keep her on her side, or 
                        she could inhale vomit and die... 
                        I'm First Aid Certified.

           Sean rolls his eyes. Of course he is.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, what's your name?

           Nothing.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        We should call 911, right?

                                 CARLOS
                        Yes?

           Kunle takes out his cell. Dials 9...1...

                                 SEAN
                        Nigga, are you crazy? Stop. STOP.

           Kunle stops.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        You know what the cops are gonna 
                        think? They're gonna come in here, 
                        shoot us and arrest us for killing 
                        this white bitch.

                                 KUNLE
                        Shoot us and arrest us? We didn't 
                        do anything wrong--

           The second Kunle looks back down at the phone to dial, Sean 
           SLAPS it out of his hand! It lands in the puddle of VOMIT.

                     KUNLE (CONT'D)
                                                     CARLOS
           What the fuck?!
                                          Ughh.

                                 SEAN
                        We don't have to do nothing wrong. 
                        Just gotta be in the wrong place at 
                        the wrong time. White girl down, in 
                        a house that reeks like 
                        motherfucking weed? Your 
                        fingerprints and DNA are all over 
                        her! Carlos, you were here the 
                        whole fucking time! What's your 
                        alibi?

           Carlos doesn't have a good answer.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        We can just tell them--

                                 SEAN
                        They ain't gonna listen. The cops 
                        don't know you're basically white 
                        inside. They gonna walk up in here, 
                        see three scary brown guys standing 
                        over this tiny little white girl. 
                        Y'all don't see how fucked this 
                        looks? We can't call 911.

           Kunle's about to argue, but hesitates... He exchanges glances 
           with Carlos. Maybe Sean's right. 

           They look down at the girl at their feet. She breathes slow.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kunle, Sean, and Carlos all sit on the couch, thinking: what 
           the fuck are they gonna do?

                                 CARLOS
                        Perhaps we could persuade a friend 
                        to come here and call 911 for us. 
                        Someone less...

                                 SEAN
                        Brown? So, a white person. 

                                 CARLOS
                        A female would be preferable.

                                 KUNLE
                        We could call Bianca.

                                 SEAN
                        I don't know... Like, she's nice 
                        but she don't know us that well.

                                 KUNLE
                        Asa?

                                 SEAN
                        I'd rather not put my life in the 
                        hands of my ex-girlfriend. Plus, 
                        she's black. We need a white girl.

                                 CARLOS
                        Wow... I don't really know many of 
                        my white female peers. Troubling.

           They sit in silence.
                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        You could call White Sean. A 
                        football player never gets in 
                        trouble.

           Kunle sighs, nods. It's the best they've got so far.

           Sean dials, calls. It rings.

           We hear the voice of WHITE SEAN, 21, who is somewhere loud.

                                 WHITE SEAN (V.O.)
                        Sup Sean?

                                 SEAN
                        White Sean! You on campus?

                   WHITE SEAN (V.O.)
                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
           Sorry man, I'm kinda-
                                          Where are you?

                                 WHITE SEAN (V.O.)
                        Oh, uh, I'm actually on a 
                        microbrewery tour with my mom-

                                 SEAN
                        So you're not at school?

                                 WHITE SEAN (V.O.)
                        Nope. Hey, I didn't think I'd like 
                        fuckin' hipster beer, but-

                                 SEAN
                        Ok that's great man, gotta go.

           Sean hangs up.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Who else can we call?

                                 CARLOS
                        Brian Phan?

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah, Asian is neutral to cops.

                                 KUNLE
                        Brian's in Cabo for break.

                                 SEAN
                        Come on, y'all, think of white 
                        people.
                            (beat)
                        We're like 1% of the school! How do 
                        we not know any white people?
           They all think as hard as they can. Nothing.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Maybe we're overthinking this. 

           Sean gets up, goes over to the girl. She is lightly snoring.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        HEY.

           She looks up at him, bleary eyed, annoyed her rest has been 
           interrupted. She closes her eyes again.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey. How bout we call a friend to 
                        come get you. Do you have a phone? 
                        Phone?? Hey! Wake up!

           She moans. She puts her hand on her heart, but that doesn't 
           mean anything to Sean.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                            (looking around)
                        Do you guys see like a purse? Or a 
                        phone?

           They look around the room. 

           Kunle finds a pair of sparkly girl's sneakers. Nothing else.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        So all we know is this fucking 
                        sorority girl got wasted, and 
                        walked in here by mistake, right?

                                 CARLOS
                            (high)
                        Like Goldilocks. And we're the 
                        three bears.

                                 SEAN
                        Look what she's wearing. ABC. 
                        Anything But Clothes. She was at 
                        Omicron tonight. We could just... 
                        take her back.

                                 KUNLE
                        And what... walk in with her?

                                 SEAN
                        We could just lay her down outside, 
                        like, where someone can find her.
                                 KUNLE
                        Oh, so the plan is to dump the 
                        unconscious girl outside the frat 
                        party? Yeah that's much better.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah no... Too risky. Someone sees 
                        us, they might jump to conclusions.

                                 CARLOS
                        True.

           Kunle looks at them in disbelief.

                                 KUNLE
                        Also... she’s fucking unconscious! 
                        We can’t just leave her somewhere!

                                 SEAN
                        You have a better idea?

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah. We call 911.

                                 SEAN
                        Or we just let her sleep it off and 
                        she'll be fine. I been that drunk 
                        before...

                                 KUNLE
                        We don't even know if she's drunk. 
                        What if she's, like... roofied?

           They're all starting to freak out now...

                                 SEAN
                            (to Goldilocks)
                        Why’d you have to come here?

           A sad beat.

                                 CARLOS
                        ‘Cause it was just right. Not to 
                        hot, not too cold... Sorry.

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck this. This isn't my problem. 
                        This is not our problem.

                                 KUNLE
                        This is our problem.

                                 CARLOS
                        She is already in our house.
                                 SEAN
                        Because someone doesn't know how to 
                        lock the goddamn door.

           Carlos cowers.

                                 KUNLE
                        Why didn’t you just let me call 911 
                        before? Now we've waited too long. 
                        It's gonna look weird that we 
                        haven't called.

                                 SEAN
                        Then good thing we're not calling.

           A tense look between them.

           But suddenly, the girl stirs. Then COUGHS, dry heaves. Kunle
           rushes to Goldilocks' side.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Stop fucking touching her, man!

           Ignoring Sean, Kunle keeps her on her side in rescue 
           position, as she coughs and coughs - a terrible sound.

                                 KUNLE
                        I’m calling 911. I’m calling.

                                 SEAN
                        No you're not.

           Kunle steels himself, reaches into the vomit puddle. Picks up 
           the phone. Carlos retches.

           Kunle wipes the phone off on the blanket. Hands shaking, 
           Kunle starts to dial. 9-1-1...

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Kunle. Do not fucking do this.

           Kunle hesitates. His finger hovers above SEND. He's torn.

           They all look down at the girl, just laying there, quiet.

           Kunle looks at Sean, who shakes his head slowly. Then at 
           Carlos, who just looks utterly terrified.

           CLOSE ON Kunle's finger, hovering over the SEND button. 

           Kunle really doesn't want to be the one to pull the trigger. 

           He just... can't do it.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        What if... What if we take her to 
                        the hospital. Just...say we found 
                        her? It's the truth. 

           Sean and Carlos look at him. It's actually...a good idea.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Hospital’s not that far, right? 
                        Like, what... ten minutes?

                                 SEAN
                        So we just... check her in, and 
                        leave. Totally anonymous.

                                 CARLOS
                        Like gentlemen. And I'm sure our 
                        fair maiden will appreciate that we 
                        saved her from the ambulance bill.

           They all relax a bit. This seems reasonable.

                                 KUNLE
                        So, we’ll be done in like, half an 
                        hour? I still have to stop at the 
                        lab... Then I think we can probably 
                        still make it to Blackout.

                                 CARLOS
                        Blackout? Are we going to Blackout? 
                        Excuse my language, but fuck yes.

                                 KUNLE
                        Oh, yeah...

           Carlos grabs his coat, as Sean shoots Kunle a dirty look.

                                 CARLOS
                        I'm quite sure I'll need a drink 
                        after this.

           A long beat. They all look down at Goldilocks as it sinks in. 
           They’re really doing this.

                                 SEAN
                        Wait. We're not putting this chick 
                        in my van. Fuck no.

                                                          CUT TO:

           I/E. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The minivan CHIRPS as it unlocks.
           Sean, Kunle, and Carlos stand together in the doorway of the 
           apartment, all wearing "white" preppy clothing. Carlos is 
           indeed wearing "that fucking fanny pack" strapped diagonally 
           across his chest. Sean has Goldilocks cradled in his arms, 
           bundled up in the blanket. 

           Carlos creeps toward the van, ahead of the others.

                                 SEAN
                            (sotto)
                        Why'd you have to tell him about 
                        the party?

                                 KUNLE
                        I didn't mean to--

           Suddenly, Goldilocks MUMBLES something incoherent.

                                 SEAN
                        Hey, what'd you say?

           She nuzzles into Sean’s chest, asleep.

           Carlos beckons to them: the coast is clear.

           Sean and Kunle hurry the rest of the way to the minivan. 

           Carefully, Sean sets Goldilocks in the back seat. She 
           immediately slumps over like a dead person.

           The guys gather around, taking in how messed up this looks.

                                 CARLOS
                        Shotgun.

           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT

           They all get in at once: Sean in the driver’s seat, Carlos in 
           the passenger’s seat, and Kunle in the back with Goldilocks.

           Carefully as he can, Kunle lifts Goldilocks so she’s leaning 
           up against the window. He buckles her seatbelt.

                                 CARLOS
                        Perhaps Goldilocks should eat 
                        something? I've got some granola 
                        bars.

           Carlos takes a granola bar out of his fanny pack, offers it 
           to Goldilocks, who doesn't take it.

           Sean shoots Kunle a look.

           Kunle takes it. Isn't sure what to do with it.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        Try to keep her from puking all 
                        over the backseat.

                         KUNLE
                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
           ...How?
                                          Ready?

                                 CARLOS
                        Ready.

                                 SEAN
                        Let’s do this.

           With that, they pull away from the curb, into the night.

           PRELAP: Thumping music, bass so loud you can barely hear 
           anything else...

           EXT. OMICRON  - PARTAAAAY - NIGHT

           A huge, fancy frat house. Three Greek letters loom large over 
           the entrance: OMICRON PHI KAPPA.

           People stumble around on the lawn, drunk college kids (mostly 
           White) wearing Anything But Clothes: trash bags, duct tape, 
           cardboard... but sexy. Push past them--

           INT. OMICRON PARTY - NIGHT

           Into the heart of the beast, past the couple making out and 
           the 18-year-olds shotgunning beers, toward the dance floor, 
           where the party is just hitting its stride.

           Staggering out of the gyrating mass, we find MADDY, (20, 
           White). Aspiring influencer but she's getting an econ degree 
           just in case. Totally smashed. Dressed to party, but she 
           looks distressed... Drink in one hand, phone in the other, 
           she’s looking around. Looking for someone.

           We follow her through:

           The FOYER... Nope.

           The KITCHEN... Nope.

           Out into...

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Maddy walks up to her right hand girl ALICE (20, White), 
           who's sitting tipsily on the shoulders of a tall, cute junior 
           boy with a white knight complex, RAFAEL (20, pale AF).
           05/30/20

                                 ALICE
                            (laughing)
                        Fuck you, don’t do that!

                         MADDY
                                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
           Alice--
                                          Oh my god, Maddy, he won’t 
                                          let me down!

                                 MADDY
                        Have you seen Emma?

                                 ALICE
                        Not since we got here.

                                 MADDY
                        Can you see her from up there?

           Alice scans the crowd.

                                 ALICE
                        Uhh.... No.

                                 MADDY
                        Fuck.

           Maddy is on the verge of panicking. This is not good.

                                 ALICE
                        She probably just went to sleep or 
                        something.

                                 MADDY
                        She doesn’t have keys to our place.

                                 ALICE
                        Just, like, call her.

                                 MADDY
                        I’m not an idiot. I called!

                                 ALICE
                        OK, jeez.

           A beat. Rafael puts Alice down. Their buzz has officially 
           been killed.

                                 RAFAEL
                            (concerned)
                        Sorry, what's going on?

                                 MADDY
                        I don’t really, like, know you? I 
                        just want to speak to my friend.
           05/30/20

           An awkward beat.

                                 ALICE
                            (to Rafael)
                        Just one sec, OK?
                            (to Maddy)
                        Okay, do you remember where you 
                        last saw her?

                                 MADDY
                        She was playing beer pong with some 
                        people... I don't know. That was a 
                        while ago.

                                 ALICE
                        Like how long ago? Like what, half 
                        an hour?

                                 MADDY
                        An hour? And a half? Two?

                                 ALICE
                        Two hours? Maddy, she could be 
                        anywhere.

                                 MADDY
                        I KNOW.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Who are you looking for? I can 
                        help.

                                 MADDY
                        I’m sorry, who the fuck even are 
                        you?

                                 ALICE
                            (pointed)
                        This is my friend Rafael. From my 
                        Arab-Israeli Conflict seminar.

                                 MADDY
                        Oooohhh.
                            (beat)
                        Sorry I though you were some rando. 

                                 ALICE
                        She's probably still here 
                        somewhere. She wouldn't just leave, 
                        right?

                                 RAFAEL
                        So who are we looking for?
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                        My sister. Emma.

           Maddy pulls up Goldilocks's Instagram. It's GOLDILOCKS.

           INT./EXT. MINIVAN - NIGHT

           Goldilocks sleeps in the back seat, as the minivan makes its 
           way down the street. Music pulses somewhere in the distance.

           Sean drives with both hands on the wheel, tense. The guys sit 
           in utter silence.  This is the longest drive of their lives.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean...You're driving too slow.

                                 SEAN
                        It's fine.

                                 KUNLE
                        Driving too slow looks weird.

           Reluctantly, Sean speeds up a little.

                                 CARLOS
                        Sean?

                                 SEAN
                        Yes?

                                 CARLOS
                        You're still driving pretty slow. 
                        Just saying.

           Annoyed, Sean speeds up a little more.

           A beat.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        You motherfuckers want to drive?

           Kunle points ahead of them: 

           EXT. STREET - SOBRIETY CHECK POINT - CONTINUOUS

           cop cars, blocking the road.

           I/E. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

                                 KUNLE
                        Looks like a sobriety checkpoint.
           05/30/20

           Fuck. Sean takes the Gatorade bottle out of his jacket 
           pocket. He tosses it into the floor in the back seat.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Wait, how drunk are you?

                                 SEAN
                        Not very. I'm pretty high though.

                                 KUNLE
                        Then why the fuck are you driving? 
                        Pull over. I'll drive.

           Beat. Sean turns onto an adjacent street. Suddenly they're in 
           the thick of it: 

           EXT. FRAT ROW - CONTINUOUS

           This is it. Spring Break central. Drunk students flow down 
           the street, into the road, hopping from party to party. 

           INT. MINIVAN PARKED - OMICRON PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           Sean pulls over, unbuckles his seat belt.

                                 CARLOS
                        That is Omicron, right?

           They all look. They are parked right in front of...

           OMICRON PHI KAPPA. The frat house is alive, pulsing with 
           light and sound.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        It's right here. Which is, if may I 
                        point out, much closer than the 
                        hospital...

                                 SEAN
                            (beat)
                        I mean... It is right here.

                                 KUNLE
                        No. No! We can't just dump her 
                        here. That's not right--

                                 SEAN
                        Not dumping. Returning her from 
                        whence she came. Someone will find 
                        her, and they can call for help. 
                        Then you can go save your mold, and 
                        we can get on with our lives.
                            (beat)
                        We'll stay until someone helps her. 
           05/30/20

           They look back at Goldilocks, who's awake, but struggling to 
           sit upright.

                                 KUNLE
                        How would we even get her out of 
                        the car? There are too many people 
                        around.

           Hmm... They all look out the window:

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Pledges man the front door to the frat. There's a line 
           forming out the door. People mill up and down the sidewalk.

                                 CARLOS
                        It's like a stealth mission. We 
                        just have to pick her up, wait for 
                        a gap in the crowd, make sure 
                        nobody's looking...

           Sean points. Kunle follows his gaze to the shadowy area off 
           to the side of the house.

                                 SEAN
                        We'll put her over there. Carlos 
                        can report her to the bouncers, 
                        then leave. Sound good, Goldilocks?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Huh?

           A long beat. Finally, Kunle gives in. Nods.

                                 CARLOS
                        Stealth mission is a go. Now we 
                        wait...

           MONTAGE, AS MADDY, ALICE, AND RAFAEL SEARCH THE FRAT:

           INT. OMICRON PARTY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Maddy bursts in, pushing past the line.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma? Are you in here? 

           INT. OMICRON PARTY - TRASH CAN - NIGHT

           Alice approaches DRUNK GIRLS (one nursing the other as she 
           throws up in a trash can), shows them a photo on her phone.

                                 ALICE
                        Have you seen this girl?
           05/30/20

           The drunk girls shake their heads.

           INT. OMICRON PARTY - HALLWAY/ROOMS - NIGHT

           Rafael walks down a hallway, checking room after room. He 
           opens one door, then--horrified--closes it.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Sorry!

           INT. OMICRON PARTY - ROOM - NIGHT

           Maddy circles around a room, searching. She takes a swig from  *
           her Solo cup, trying to suppress her growing anxiety.

           Out of the blue, a FRAT BOY traps her up against a wall, 
           putting his hands on the wall on either side of her body. 
           It's a little scary. He puts his mouth close to her ear.

                                 FRAT BOY #1
                        Hey... What's your name?

                                 MADDY
                        Uh, I'm busy right now.

           She ducks under his arm, and darts away. She shudders. Ugh.

           - The montage quickens as Maddy, Alice, and Rafael move from 
           room to room, person to person, looking for Goldilocks. But 
           she's nowhere to be found.

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           The coast seems mostly clear, for now. Except, way down the 
           sidewalk, there's a GAGGLE of students headed their way.

           INT. MINIVAN - OMICRON PARTY - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS
                        Once that group clears the car, we 
                        should do it. Someone needs to go 
                        over there and make sure the coast 
                        is clear.

                                 SEAN
                            (to Kunle)
                        Go make sure it's safe.

                                 KUNLE
                        Me? You do it.

                                 SEAN
                        You're the most naturally 
                        camouflaged.
           05/30/20

           Carlos reluctantly nods in agreement. 

           Kunle sighs. Gets out. He walks all the way to the... 

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - SIDEYARD - NIGHT

           He's careful to stick to the shadows. The sound is drowned 
           out by the thumping of the music inside.

           He looks for people, cameras. Nothing.

           As he creeps into the darkness to get a better look, he 
           notices TWO PEOPLE coming his way. It's Alice and Rafael.

           He ducks behind a BIG WOODEN PILLAR THING (we can't tell 
           exactly what this is). We see Alice and Rafael only by their 
           shadows on the ground, from Kunle's POV:

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        Sorry about all this, I didn't want 
                        to ruin your night.

                                 RAFAEL (O.S.)
                        It's fine. Happy to help. Is Maddy 
                        always so... intense?

                                 ALICE
                        Maddy's cool. But yeah, she's 
                        intense. I mean she's my best 
                        friend, but I wish her life were a 
                        little less exciting sometimes. I 
                        really am sorry about this.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Dude. Stop apologizing. It's not 
                        your fault. It's not so bad. I like 
                        hanging out with you.

           A beat. A very charged beat. They kiss. Hard. They make out 
           against the pillar. 

           Kunle can feel it moving against his back. Ugh.

           Alice and Rafael pull apart. Both smiling.

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        We should get back to the... Uh... 
                        To be continued?

           Alice and Rafael disappear. 

           A beat. Kunle waits until they're gone. He comes out of the 
           darkness to see if the coast is clear. It is.
           05/30/20

           INT. MINIVAN - OMICRON PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean squints into the darkness.

                                 SEAN
                        I can't see shit.

           Kunle emerges from the shadows, waves: coast is clear.

                                 CARLOS
                        Let's get into position.

           The gaggle of students draws closer, then passes by.

           Sean and Carlos open the van door. They scoot Goldilocks out. 
           But she's heavier than she looks, and not very cooperative.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Come on, Goldilocks.

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - SIDEYARD - NIGHT

           Kunle watches Carlos and Sean help Goldilocks out of the car. 
           She can sort of stand up... But still, it looks bad.

           Kunle hears something behind him. He signals for Sean and 
           Carlos to go back.

                                 CARLOS
                        Abort. Abort.

           Carlos and Sean put Goldilocks back into the van.

           A DRUNK GUY (BLACK) staggers out of the dark, and casually 
           starts pissing on the pillar. He locks eyes with Kunle, gives 
           him a polite nod.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        How's it goin?

                                 KUNLE
                        Good. Just... getting some fresh 
                        air.

                                 FRAT BOY #1 (O.S.)
                        Hey! They're pissing on our sacred 
                        totem!

           Kunle turns to see THREE FRAT BOYS in beer packaging armor 
           pointing at them. Marching toward them.

           Kunle notices now that the pillar has carvings of symbols and 
           faces in it. And the Drunk Guy is laughing.
           05/30/20

                                 FRAT BOY #1 (CONT'D)
                        These Gamma Tau bitches keep 
                        pissing on our totem. 

                                 FRAT BOY #2
                        Maybe we need to teach them some 
                        respect. You piss on our totem, we 
                        piss on you. Get them.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        Gamma Tau!

           The Drunk Guy does the official Gamma Tau WAR CRY, and runs 
           off like a madman.

           Then Kunle realizes: they're also coming for him. He BOLTS.

           INT. MINIVAN - OMICRON PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean just wants so badly to get this over with. He tries in 
           vain to get Goldilocks to focus.

                                 SEAN
                        Goldilocks. You want to go back to 
                        the party, don't you? All you have 
                        to do is walk to that door...

                                 CARLOS
                        What the hell...

           Sean turns to see Kunle running straight for them, with a 
           bunch of angry frat boy cardboard knights following him, 
           brandishing their beer can wizard staffs.

                                 SEAN
                        Aww shit.

           Sean scrambles into the driver's seat, starts the car.

           Kunle dives into the back, SLAMS the door shut.

                                 KUNLE
                        GO. GO!!

           Sean puts the car in gear. But the frat boys are closing in.

           Sean pulls out of the spot, coursing with adrenaline.

                                 SEAN
                        What happened?

                                 KUNLE
                        They're trying to piss on me!
           05/30/20

           I/E. MINIVAN - OMICRON/FRAT ROW - CONTINUOUS

           As they're driving off, an EMPTY BEER CAN bounces off the 
           fender. Then another, and another.

           Then someone throws an UNOPENED CAN, which hits hard, 
           SHATTERING the taillight.

                                 SEAN
                        THE FUCK.

           Kunle looks back, sees some of the frat boys still chasing 
           them. Gradually, they recede from view.

           Sean turns down another street.

           I/E. MINIVAN - NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH STREET - NIGHT

           The minivan drives past a sign that says THIS NEIGHBORHOOD 
           PROTECTED BY NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

                                 SEAN
                        But why were they trying to piss on 
                        you though?

                                 KUNLE
                        They thought I was from Gamma Tau-

                                 SEAN
                        I knew Omicron was racist as fuck. 
                        That's the black frat!

                                 KUNLE
                        Dunno if it was racism--

                                 SEAN
                        These bitch-ass white boys try to 
                        hold you down and piss on you, and 
                        you're defending them? This is a 
                        hate crime, yo.
                            (beat)
                        We should go piss on their totem.

                                 KUNLE
                        No. I told you that was a bad idea. 
                        We should've just gone straight to 
                        the hospital. Pull over, I should 
                        drive.

                         SEAN
                                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                                          Sean. Pull over.
           Can we just get this over 
           with?
           05/30/20

           Goldilocks sits upright, squirming uncomfortably in her seat. 
           Her eyes are closed.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Ineedtapee.

                                 CARLOS
                        I believe Goldilocks needs to 
                        urinate.

                                 SEAN
                        Tell her not to pee in my 
                        motherfuckin car.

                                 KUNLE
                        I don't think she's gonna hold it, 
                        man. Maybe you should pull over.

           Sean reluctantly pulls over...

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK - NIGHT

           They're in a small, shady public park, nestled inside a 
           residential neighborhood. It's very dark, nobody in sight...

           Sean watches from the driver's seat, anxious, as Carlos and 
           Kunle helps Goldilocks out of the car.

           Goldilocks stumbles over to a bush, in the shadows.

                                 CARLOS
                        Can you pee right over here?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Thanks.

           The second they let go, she falls, rolls onto her back.

                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. OMICRON PARTY - FRONTYARD -  NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Goldilocks's profile photo, on a cell phone. 

                                 PLEDGE
                        Yeah I think I saw her. She was 
                        pretty drunk.

           Looking down at it is a PLEDGE (18), who wears a pillowcase 
           loincloth. As he studies the photo, he gives out wristbands 
           in exchange for passes.
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                            (very drunk)
                        And? Where'd you see her?

           Alice and Rafael come up to Maddy, listen in:

                                 PLEDGE
                        She tried to take a nap in the coat 
                        room. Then she left.

                                 MADDY
                        Which way did she go? Which way did 
                        she fucking go?

                                 PLEDGE
                        I don't know. Jeez.

           Maddy clocks Alice, who shakes her head. Nothing.

                                 MADDY
                        I think... we need to call the 
                        police.

           Some PARTYGOERS overhear, shoot her a nasty glance.

           Alice gives all the partygoers a "no don't worry, she won't" 
           look. She gently ushers Maddy aside. Maddy is on the verge of  *
           turning into a nervous mess. Alice gently takes Maddy's Solo 
           cup out of her hand and replaces it with her Hydroflask full 
           of water.

                                 ALICE
                        You need to hydrate--

                                 MADDY
                        We need to do something--

                                 ALICE
                        Maddy. Drink the water. We're going 
                        to keep looking, okay?

           Maddy obeys. She chugs all the water in one go. Alice and 
           Rafael exchange glances.

                                 MADDY
                        We looked EVERYWHERE.

                                 ALICE
                        Maddy. No we haven't. What's gonna 
                        happen if you call the cops right 
                        now? We're underage.

                                 MADDY
                        We'll... get in trouble.
           05/30/20

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. And you will be shunned-- 
                        shunned--for the rest of your life 
                        at this school. So maybe we take 
                        another look around before we 
                        panic.

                                 RAFAEL
                        You've tried calling her?

           Maddy gives him a look. Does he think she's an idiot?

                                 MADDY
                        Yes, I've called her. I've called 
                        her like thirty times. It just 
                        rings and rings.

                                 RAFAEL
                        That means her phone is still on...

           Alice catches on.

                                 MADDY
                        Ok, so she's ignoring me? How is 
                        that helpful?

                                 ALICE
                        Does she have an app like Find My 
                        Friend? We can track her.

           Maddy did not try that. It’s a good idea. 

           Maddy pulls up the app on her phone. It zeroes in on a PIN. 
           Hovering over the location is Goldilocks's profile pic.

           Maddy and Alice stare down at the screen, puzzled.

                                 RAFAEL
                        See, there she is.

                                 ALICE
                        That's just a few blocks away... 
                        Maybe she got lost. We should go 
                        get her.

           Alice gives Rafael an apologetic look.

                                 RAFAEL
                        I'll walk you guys there.

                                 ALICE
                        You don't have to...
           05/30/20

                                 RAFAEL
                        No, I want to. If she goes too much 
                        further, that's not a great 
                        neighborhood.

           A look between them. Alice smiles, grateful.

           Maddy clocks this, rolls her eyes. She texts Goldilocks, 
           angrily:

                                         i can't believe you just left

                                              i'm gonna fckin kill you

           I/E. MINIVAN PARKED - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Sean scrolls through Instagram, trying to calm himself down. 

           It's photo after photo of people partying at Blackout. 
           Underground. Leo high AF in the Green Room. 

           Sean's FOMO intensifies.

           He comes across a photo of Asa. He zooms in on it. 
           Accidentally HEARTS it. He quickly un-hearts it. He glances 
           up to see...

           A NOSY WHITE LADY (50s) standing in her window, across the 
           street, watching. Let's call her KAREN.

           Sean tries his best to give her a polite smile. She hides 
           behind the curtain. But she's still there, watching...

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK - NIGHT

           Goldilocks wades into the bushes, stabilizing herself against 
           a tree, as Kunle and Carlos avert their eyes, standing guard.

           Kunle checks the time.

                                 KUNLE
                        I'm so fucked...

                                 CARLOS
                        Can't you grow more mold?

                                 KUNLE
                        No!

                                 CARLOS
                        But you already got into Princeton. 
                        Can they un-admit you?
                                 KUNLE
                            (whispering)
                        YES! They can!

           Kunle looks to make sure Sean didn't overhear. He didn't.

           We hear Goldilocks start to pee. It's a lot of pee.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Don't mention Princeton in front of 
                        Sean, please.

                                 CARLOS
                        You still haven't told him? He 
                        thinks you're living together next 
                        year.

                                 KUNLE
                        He shouldn't just assume that...

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah, but it's rather uncouth to 
                        let him keep assuming. He didn't 
                        take it too hard when I told him 
                        I'm gonna have to move for my job 
                        at SpaceX.

                                 KUNLE
                        No, you're right...

           Goldilocks is still peeing.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Wow, she really had to pee.

                                 CARLOS
                        Have you ever noticed that when you 
                        talk about a girl's urine, it's 
                        pee, but if you talk about a guy's, 
                        it's piss?

                                 KUNLE
                        Really? Is that a thing?

                                 CARLOS
                        I don't know. I just noticed it.

           She finally stops peeing. She pulls up her underwear, but as 
           she stands up, she falls over into the bush again.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey.
           05/30/20

           Kunle and Carlos turn to see a jittery MAN (20s, White) has 
           sidled up to them. They tense up.

           Goldilocks lays in a bush behind them, out of sight.

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Whatchu got?

           Kunle and Carlos are confused.

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        Special K? Apple jacks?

                                 KUNLE
                            (to Carlos, sotto)
                        Cereal?

                                 MAN
                        Got any caps? Cheese? Angel dust?

                                 CARLOS
                        Ohh. We don't have any drugs, sir.

                                 KUNLE
                        We're not... salespeople.

                                 MAN
                        You got any jelly beans?

                                 KUNLE
                        No.

           I/E. MINIVAN PARKED - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Sean watches Kunle and Carlos talking to this white guy. WTF? 
           He looks back over at Karen, who is how holding up her phone.

           INT. NOSY KAREN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           KAREN'S POV: Karen takes a blurry photo of this suspicious 
           activity with her phone.

           I/E. MINIVAN PARKED - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Sean rolls down the window and gives Kunle and Carlos a 
           pointed look: WTF are you doing?

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS
                        Sorry, man. Here.

           Carlos takes a granola bar out of his fanny pack, hands it to 
           the guy, who accepts it, a little confused.
           05/30/20

           INT. NOSY KAREN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           KAREN POV: She snaps a blurry photo of this "transaction."

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK - NIGHT

           The drug-seeking man shrugs, pleased enough. He shuffles off.

                                 KUNLE
                        Why'd you do that? He could've 
                        robbed us.

                                 CARLOS
                        He looked hungry.

           Kunle and Carlos wait until he's a safe distance, and then 
           turn to Goldilocks.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Up you go.

           They help her to her feet. She laughs.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Wooo!

           Kunle and Carlos hurry Goldilocks out of the bushes...

           On the way back to the van, she stops. Heaves.

           Kunle pulls her hair back. She pukes. He and Carlos wait 
           patiently for her to finish. Then they press on...

           All the way to the van.

           I/E. MINIVAN PARKED - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Is this my Uber?

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah. Come on.

           They help her inside.

                                 SEAN
                        Hurry up. This fucking lady. She's 
                        watching us.

                                 CARLOS
                        What lady?

           They all look where Sean's pointing. But Karen has 
           disappeared from her window.
                                 KUNLE
                        Get out. I'm driving.

                                 SEAN
                        Just get in, man.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean. You're paranoid. Because 
                        you're high. Which is why you 
                        shouldn't be driving.

           Sean is paranoid. He's freaking out a little.

           Kunle walks around the back of the car. He notices...

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Tail light's out.

           Sean comes out to take a look. 

           The tail light is totally SHATTERED. SHIIIIT. 

                                 SEAN
                        We're gonna fucking die tonight. I 
                        can feel it, man. We get pulled 
                        over, we die. We call 911, we die--

           Carlos comes out to see what the deal is.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean. Yes, this isn't good. But 
                        panicking won't help.
                            (Sean's still panicking)
                        Look at me, man. We aren't gonna 
                        die tonight. Think about it, 
                        statistically. How many people 
                        actually get shot by cops? It's 
                        really, really unlikely, right? I 
                        mean... do you actually know anyone 
                        who's been shot by the police?

                        CARLOS
                                                      SEAN
           No...
                                          Yes. I do.

           Sean's answer catches Kunle and Carlos off-guard.

                                 SEAN
                        My cuz.

                                 CARLOS
                        I'm sorry, man--

                                 SEAN
                        He's not... He's still alive.
                                 KUNLE
                        What'd he do?

                                 SEAN
                        "What'd he do?" To deserve getting 
                        shot? Nothing! NOTHING. He was just 
                        sitting in his friend's house, 
                        playing Call of Duty.

                                 KUNLE
                        And they just showed up for no 
                        reason?

                                 SEAN
                        I mean, his friend was trapping. 
                        Small time. The cops busted the 
                        door down, and my cuz "scared them" 
                        when he stood up. So they shot him. 
                        They shot him in the ass.

           A long beat. Carlos giggles. He can't help it.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        It's not funny! He has to use a
                        colostomy bag now.

           Carlos shuts up. Damn.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        He did some stupid shit, but he 
                        didn't deserve that.

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah, but you see how this is
                        different, right? We're not... 
                        criminals. We just have a busted 
                        tail light.

                                 SEAN
                        You know how often I get stopped 
                        when my tail light ain't busted? We 
                        can't drive like this.

                                 CARLOS
                        Guys...

           Carlos points. Incoming:

           Karen and her angry, heavily-beerbellied husband, who we'll 
           call MR. KAREN (50s, White), march toward them. They 
           approach, careful to keep a safe distance.

           Karen is nervously RECORDING on her phone. It's way too dark 
           and blurry to see much at all, but she's trying.
                                 MR. KAREN
                        We can see what you're doing. We 
                        don't tolerate that in our 
                        neighborhood.

                                 SEAN
                        Sir. We're leaving--

                                 MR. KAREN
                        Get outta here.

                                 KUNLE
                        We're not doing anything wrong. We 
                        were having some car issues--

                                 MR. KAREN
                        I said get.

                                 CARLOS
                        Come on, let's go.

           Kunle gets in the driver's seat. Carlos gets in the back.

           Sean walks around front but Mr. and Mrs. Karen follow.

                                 SEAN
                        Get that phone out my face, please.

           But Karen keeps it up.

                                 KAREN
                        We already got your picture up on 
                        the Good Neighbor app. 

                                 SEAN
                            (sotto)
                        Racist old bitch.

                                 MR. KAREN
                            (puffing up)
                        What did you just say?

           Sean jumps in the passenger seat.

                                 MR. KAREN (CONT'D)
                        What did you just say???

           Sean shuts the door. Kunle drives off, ASAP.

           But Kunle's kind of bad at driving. And he's not comfortable 
           driving this minivan. So he drives a little slow.

           Goldilocks laughs, totally out of it.

                        Racisssolllbiiitchh. Biiiiiitch!

                                 SEAN
                        You get it. Goldilocks gets it.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE KAREN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maddy, Alice, and Rafael wheel up the road. Maddy is on the 
           back of Alice's bike. Rafael is on his motorized unicycle. 

           They stop where the guys were parked seconds ago. 

           Maddy looks up to see Karen and Mr. Karen watching them from 
           their driveway.

                                 RAFAEL
                        This is where she was, right?

           Alice looks down at the pin on Maddy's phone. 

                                 ALICE
                        The pin's moving again. I think... 
                        she's in that car.

           Alice points at the minivan, in the distance.

                                 KAREN
                        Y'all kids stay away from those 
                        men. You shouldn't be buying drugs. 
                        Get on out of here!

           Karen and Mr. Karen huff, return to their house.

                                 MADDY
                        Ok, what the fuck?

           They give chase...

           INT. MINIVAN - DRIVING - NIGHT

           We see Alice, Maddy, and Rafael at a distance, in the rear 
           view mirror.

           Kunle drives, death-gripping the steering wheel.

                                 KUNLE
                        She seriously thought we were drug 
                        dealers. What if she called the 
                        cops? We're gonna get pulled 
                        over....
                                 SEAN
                        And if we get pulled over for a 
                        busted tail light, our lives are 
                        over. Not so easy being the driver, 
                        is it?

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean, what do we do?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Hey. Hey. Are you a rapper?

                                 SEAN
                        No.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Chance the Rapper?

                                 SEAN
                        No.

                                 KUNLE
                            (to Carlos)
                        Yo can you make sure she's 
                        hydrating?

           Carlos is on it. He looks around for the Gatorade bottle 
           Goldilocks was drinking. He reaches to the ground, past the 
           ORANGE BOTTLE (real Gatorade), for the PINK ONE full of DEATH 
           PUNCH.

                                 KUNLE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        So? Ideas anyone? Please??

           Carlos unscrews the bottle, puts it into her hands. 

                                 CARLOS
                        Drink this. It's good for you.

           She takes a big swig. Winces. Drinks some more.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                            (blackout)
                        Hey. Are you a rapper?

                                 SEAN
                        Yes.

           Her face lights up.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        My brother has got a car we can 
                        borrow. He lives around the corner.

                            (beat)
                        You got a better idea?

           Kunle sighs. Fine.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Turn left up here.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Alice pedals faster, Maddy clinging to her, as Rafael whirs 
           along beside them... 

           The minivan stops at the stop sign.

           They're gaining... Gaining... So close!

           But the minivan pulls ahead. And... it's gone. Turns out cars 
           are faster than bikes and motorized unicycles.

           EXT. THE HOOD - NIGHT

           Chain link fences. Traphouses. This is the part of town the 
           university asks the students to avoid.

           The minivan pulls up in front of an apartment building with 
           an overgrown lawn. The guys all get out. 

           But Sean stops Carlos.

                                 SEAN
                        Stay here with her.

           Carlos gets back in the car, as Kunle and Sean make their way 
           toward the door.

           INT. MINIVAN - TERENCE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Carlos looks over at Goldilocks. She's holding onto the door, 
           the seat, stabilizing herself.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Issall... spinning.

                                 CARLOS
                        It'll be okay. Just drink some more 
                        of this. Hydrate or die-drate.

           He helps her drink more "Gatorade."

           EXT. TERENCE'S PLACE - NIGHT

           DING DONG. MALIK (22, Black), bargain bin hypebeast, answers 
           the door. Looks Sean up and down, noting his "white" clothes.
                                 MALIK
                        Baby Sean, whatchu doin here? 

                                 SEAN
                        Hey. I gotta talk to my brother.

           INT. TERENCE'S PLACE - NIGHT

           It's a small hangout going on. About EIGHT GUYS (Black, 20s-
           30s) sitting around, drinking, smoking.

           Sean daps a few of the guys as he comes in. Kunle lurks 
           behind him, awkwardly.

                                 MALIK
                        He's here somewhere... Who's your 
                        friend?

                                 KUNLE
                        Oh, uh, Kunle.

                                 SEAN
                        Gotta find Terence. Be right back.

           Sean disappears, leaving Kunle behind with Malik.

           Kunle notices OTHER GUYS eyeing him, curious. He sticks out, 
           a preppy nerd in the hood.

                                 MALIK
                        Malik.

                                 KUNLE
                        Kunle... I already said that.

                                 MALIK
                        You know Baby Sean from school?

                                 KUNLE
                        Yes. We're roommates. ...You all 
                        call him Baby Sean?

                                 MALIK
                        Yeah.

           He offers Kunle a joint. Kunle declines, awkwardly sits down 
           on the couch next to a guy with FACIAL TATTOOS (20s, Black).

                                 FACIAL TATTOO GUY
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 MALIK
                        This is Kunle, Baby Sean's friend 
                        from college.
           05/30/20

           Kunle tries to hide his nerves.

                                 FACIAL TATTOO GUY
                        Kunle. So you're like, a real 
                        African brother?

                                 KUNLE
                        Uh, my family's Nigerian, but I 
                        grew up here.

                                 BIG GUY
                        Naw, you ain't from here.

                                 FACIAL TATTOO GUY
                        Nice kicks.

           Kunle looks down at his shoes, suddenly very anxious.

                                 KUNLE
                        Thanks. Where's the restroom?

           Malik points the way. Kunle rushes down the hall.

           INT. TERENCE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sean's with TERENCE (20s, Black), mid conversation. They're 
           around the same age and look a lot alike, but Terence's years 
           have been harder and longer.

                                 TERENCE
                        Nah.

                                 SEAN
                        Please. It's a family emergency. 
                        Kunle's grandma's on her death bed.

                                 TERENCE
                        Get a Uber or some shit. You high, 
                        nigga. You ain't driving my car.

                                 SEAN
                        Kunle's driving. Pleeease?

           A beat. Terence relents.

                                 TERENCE
                        Wait here.

           EXT. THE HOOD - NIGHT

           The street is dark. Maddy, Alice, and Rafael move slowly down  *
           the sidewalk. Maddy looks around.
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                        Where the hell are we? This is 
                        like... the hood.

           They're all getting a little nervous.

                                 ALICE
                        Can you pedal for a while, Maddy? 
                        I'm getting really tired.

                                 MADDY
                        I really would but I have bad 
                        knees. Plus, we're like super 
                        close.

           Way down the street in the distance, we can just barely see 
           the MINIVAN.

           INT. TERENCE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sean's surrounded by Malik and some old HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS.

                                 MALIK
                        Feels like we ain't seen you in 
                        months. Where you been?

                                 SEAN
                        Just been busy, you know. Working 
                        on my thesis. It's this big project 
                        you have to do to graduate-

                                 TERENCE (O.S.)
                        Nah, he's just got better things to 
                        do than hang out with a bunch of 
                        broke-ass niggas.

           Sean turns to see Terence has reappeared.

                                 SEAN
                        Not true.

                                 TERENCE
                            (skeptical)
                        Yeah.

           Terence hands Sean his car keys.

                                 TERENCE (CONT'D)
                        I need my car back tomorrow.

           INT. MINIVAN - TERENCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Goldilocks holds her face in her hands. Slumps onto Carlos.
                                 CARLOS
                        Whoa. You okay?

           She moans, looks up at him. He helps her sit upright, trying 
           to keep her from passing out.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Stay awake, okay? Can you tell 
                        me your name? I'm Carlos. What's 
                        your name?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Emma.

                                 CARLOS
                        Emma! Emma. Hey, it's alright, you 
                        just need to stay awake for me. Do 
                        you want a granola bar?

           He offers one to her. She blinks, shakes her head.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Are you a freshman? No? I'm a 
                        senior. I'm a mechanical aerospace 
                        engineer, aka rocket scientist. I 
                        got a job at SpaceX lined up. You 
                        know Elon? Elon Musk. He'll be my 
                        boss. Pretty cool, right? ...Hey, 
                        what year are you? Emma?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        I'm... twelfth. Twelve-fphth.

                                 CARLOS
                        Twelfth? ...Wait, you're in high 
                        school?

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Shhhh.... My sister said... She 
                        said not to tell.

           Carlos takes this in. She's a minor. Shiiiiit. 

           Suddenly, Goldilocks BURSTS INTO TEARS. 

                                 GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
                        She... she hates me. Shehatesme.

           Carlos is way out of his league here. He pats Goldilocks on 
           the back.
                        CARLOS
                                               GOLDILOCKS (CONT'D)
           It's alright.
                                          Whydoesntshe want... wanna 
                                          hangoutwithme? Shehate... she 
                                          hatessme, shehatesme.

                                 CARLOS
                        I swear she likes you. She told me.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        She did?

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah. It's gonna be okay...

           As Goldilocks continues her incoherent muttering, Carlos 
           picks up the Gatorade bottle. He's about to hand it to her, 
           when... he sees something. The ORANGE BOTTLE ON THE FLOOR.

           He smells the pink stuff. This is NOT Gatorade.

           INT. TERENCE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Kunle sits on the ground, adding to his group text, which 
           begins "Is anyone in the lab tonight? Can someone lock my 
           cabinet?" He types:

                            i will pay you $100 to go to the lab rn

                   can't

                   sorry, kunle

                   i'm not around

           Someone BANGS on the door. And again.

                                 BIG GUY (O.S.)
                        Hey! People are waitin' out here.

           INT. TERENCE'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           A flushing noise. Kunle sheepishly emerges from the bathroom, 
           to an annoyed guy waiting. He clocks Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        Were you hiding in the bathroom?

                                 KUNLE
                        No...

           Sean rolls his eyes, hands the car keys to him.

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Guys?
           Carlos and Goldilocks stand in the open doorway. Carlos 
           supports a VERY VERY drunk Goldilocks with one arm, holds up 
           the pink Gatorade bottle with the other.

                                 SEAN
                        What are you doing? Get back 
                        outside-

                                 CARLOS
                        This is not Gatorade. It's alcohol! 
                        She's been drinking this since we 
                        left the house--

                                 SEAN
                        That's my...

                                 KUNLE
                        Death punch?

                                 CARLOS
                        Death punch?

           As if on cue, Goldilocks throws up a ton of pink stuff on the 
           floor. She sags against Carlos, knocking him off balance.

           She falls over, bringing Carlos down with her. She then rolls 
           around on the floor, laughing.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        WOOOOO.

           Sean clocks Terence, taking in the scene, horrified.

                                 CARLOS
                        Hi Terence. Sorry...

                                 TERENCE
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 KUNLE
                        We found this girl. We don't know 
                        who she is--

                                 CARLOS
                        Actually her name is Emma and she 
                        just told me she's in high school.

           All other guys in the room stare down at Goldilocks. Beat. 

                                 MALIK
                        Nope.

           In unison, the bystanders in the room all NOPE OUT at once. 
           They pick up their shit, start moving toward the front door.
           05/30/20

           Facial Tattoo Guy shakes his head at Kunle as he leaves.

                                 FACIAL TATTOO GUY
                        That's some shit y'all.

           Terence turns to Sean.

                                 TERENCE
                        Explain.

           EXT. TERENCE'S PLACE - NIGHT

           Maddy, Alice, and Rafael slow to a stop, a short way down the  *
           street from the minivan. On high alert.

                                 MADDY
                        It says she's here somewhere.

           A DOG BARKS behind them, and they all jump and look:

           The dog is trapped behind a fence with a BEWARE OF DOG sign, 
           growling and gnashing its teeth at them.

           Maddy, Alice, and Rafael study Maddy's phone. Together, they 
           look up at Terence's place. 

           They clock a WHOLE BUNCH OF BLACK MEN scattering out of a 
           house at the same time. WTF?

           INT. TERENCE'S PLACE - NIGHT

           Terence is struggling to wrap his head around this.

                                 TERENCE
                        So y'all found a passed out, 
                        possibly roofied white child in 
                        your house, got her even drunker, 
                        and then you thought it would be a 
                        good idea to bring her to my house? 
                        Sean! You know I'm on parole. And 
                        you lied to me?? Kunle, is your 
                        gramma even dying?

           Kunle's obvious confusion answers the question.

                                 SEAN
                        We're just trying to help her. 

                                 TERENCE
                        That's nice but I cannot afford to 
                        get involved in any kind of shit. 
                        Gimme my keys. Give them to me.
                                 SEAN
                        My tail light's out. We need to 
                        take her to the hospital-

                                 TERENCE
                            (interrupting)
                        Not in my car, you don't. 

           Beat. Kunle hands over the keys. Sean wheels on him.

                                 SEAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 KUNLE
                        We don't have time to argue, Sean. 
                        We have to go.

           Kunle doesn't know what else to say. He starts helping 
           Goldilocks up. Carlos jumps in to help him.

           Sean's about to leave, when Terence pulls him back.

                                 TERENCE
                        Have you lost your damn mind? You 
                        can't go with them.

                                 SEAN
                        What?

                                 TERENCE
                        Something happens to that girl, 
                        they will be fine. Even if they get 
                        caught, they'll be fine. Probably. 
                        You won't be. Kunle rich, ain't he? 
                        Ain't his parents fuckin' dentists 
                        or some shit?

                                 SEAN
                        Doctors.

                                 TERENCE
                        Let them handle it.

           Off Sean, considering...

           EXT. TERENCE'S PLACE - NIGHT

           Kunle and Carlos head down the steps toward the minivan, 
           carrying Goldilocks between them.

                                 KUNLE
                        Where's Sean?
           05/30/20

           Beat. Sean appears in the doorway. He rushes out to join 
           them.

           EXT. TERENCE'S HOUSE - ACROSS THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Rafael, Maddy, and Alice are all looking around, and glancing 
           back down at the pin location.

           The dog BARKS at them as they talk:

                                 ALICE
                        Which house is it? I can't tell.

                                 RAFAEL
                        I really can't see anything.

           Kunle and Carlos help Goldilocks to the minivan. Carlos has 
           draped the blanket around her shoulders. But the whole scene 
           is very dimly lit...

                                 ALICE
                        That's the same car, right?

                                 RAFAEL
                        You two stay back. I'll go get a 
                        closer look.

           He takes a deep breath, steeling himself to go over.

                                 NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        'Scuse me.

           Rafael yelps in alarm. A mildly annoyed dog-owning NEIGHBOR 
           (40s, Black) eyes them with annoyance and suspicion. Her dog 
           continues to growl.

           Alice and Rafael tense up. Maddy's too drunk to fear anymore.

                                 NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
                        Can I help you? Y'all lost?

                                 ALICE
                        We're good. Thanks.

           Alice, Rafael, and Maddy move a short distance away. The 
           Neighbor watches them.

           Maddy struggles to stand upright. She's looking...

           INT. MINIVAN PARKED - TERENCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kunle and Sean hop into the front.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        We need to keep her awake. Put some 
                        music on.

           Sean puts some rap on the radio, LOUD.

                                 SEAN
                        What? She likes rappers.

           Carlos opens the door for Goldilocks.

           EXT. TERENCE'S HOUSE - ACROSS THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 MADDY
                            (to Alice)
                        We need to stop them! Get on!

           Maddy gets back on the bike, but Alice is too slow. She's 
           getting exhausted.

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        Hurry!

                                 ALICE
                        I'm trying. I'm just, I'm really 
                        tired--

           Maddy, impatient, gets off the bike. She runs into the road 
           on foot, as Goldilocks climbs (of her own volition) back into  *
           the minivan. Carlos shuts the door.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma? Emma!

           She staggers down the street, as Kunle pulls away from the 
           curb. The guys don't see Maddy, or hear her over the music, 
           as they drive off.

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        Emma!

           Beat. Maddy, frustrated, whips out her phone. 

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        I'm calling the cops.

           She dials 911. Presses SEND. Puts the phone to her ear, 
           shooting a quick glare at Alice. Immediately the 911 
           DISPATCHER (a Black woman) picks up.

                                 911 DISPATCHER (V.O)
                        911, what is the nature of your 
                        emergency?
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                        My sister, she's been taken.

           INT. MINIVAN DRIVING - NIGHT

           Kunle drives. Glances in the rearview mirror, where Carlos is 
           trying to get Goldilocks to drink some real Gatorade.

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck my brother, man. Maybe we can 
                        get my cousin's car-

                                 KUNLE
                        No. I'm not stopping. We'll take 
                        the backroads, through the woods. 
                        It's a little longer, but nobody 
                        goes that way. We won't get pulled 
                        over. Probably.

                                 SEAN
                        Probably?

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean. This is officially a fucking 
                        emergency. We have to get her to 
                        the hospital, NOW.

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, so you're in charge now?

                                 KUNLE
                        I'm sorry, did you want to drive? 
                        Oh, you can't, because you've been 
                        literally drinking and smoking pot 
                        since 3pm.

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, apologies, I should have 
                        assumed this highly unlikely 
                        situation would arise.

                                 CARLOS
                        Let's all take a calming breath and 
                        remember we're all on the same 
                        team. Granola bar, anyone?

                                 SEAN
                        Stop with the goddamn granola bars. 
                        Nobody wants a fucking granola bar.

                                 CARLOS
                        Geez.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        Let's just get this over with. I 
                        just want to make sure we didn't 
                        kill this girl, save my mold, and 
                        go the fuck to sleep.

                                 SEAN
                        What about the parties?

           A beat.

                                 CARLOS
                        I've still got energy.

                                 KUNLE
                        You guys should just go without me. 
                        I'm not really in the mood anymore.

           Sean bites back his anger. He simmers quietly.

                                 CARLOS
                        Emma, hey, don't sleep.

           Goldilocks bats his hand away, and slumps against the window.

           EXT. TERENCE'S HOUSE - ROAD - NIGHT

           Maddy paces back and forth under a street light. She's 
           slurring her words, getting a bit emotional. 

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        So, your sister got in a car with 
                        three Black or Latino men that you 
                        didn't recognize... of her own 
                        volition.

           Alice and Rafael watch Maddy's face, but can't hear the other 
           end of the conversation.

                                 MADDY
                        What?

                                 911 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        You said "one of them opened the 
                        door, and she climbed in the car." 
                        Do you have reason to believe she 
                        was coerced?

                                 MADDY
                        She wouldn't just get in some 
                        random guys' car! She's a fucking 
                        seventeen-year-old. Isn't this 
                        illegal?
           Alice and Rafael exchange glances.

                                 RAFAEL
                        You should probably...

           Alice sighs. Ever the responsible one, she goes to Maddy.

                                 911 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Ma'am, I need you to stay calm, 
                        please. I'm just trying to 
                        understand your emergency.

                         ALICE
           Maybe I should--
                                                     MADDY
                                          It feels like you're trying 
                                          to accuse me of being like 
                                          racist or something? And I'm 
                                          not!

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Are you intoxicated, ma'am?

                                 MADDY
                        How is that important? I saw what I 
                        fucking saw--

           Alice takes the phone from Maddy, who tries to grab it back.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello? I'm sooo sorry. My friend's 
                        just upset because it's her sister.

           She mouths STOP IT at Maddy, who huffs.

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        I understand.

                                 ALICE
                        Is there any way you can do a 
                        welfare check? We're tracking her 
                        phone so we have her current 
                        location.

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Sure. We'll send our next available 
                        officer to check it out.

           Alice glances back at Maddy and Rafael. Rafael is trying 
           unsuccessfully to comfort a hostile Maddy.

           EXT. BACKROADS - NIGHT

           The minivan cuts down the narrow path. Gradually buildings 
           disappear, and it's all woods. The headlights illuminate the 
           long, dark road ahead.
           05/30/20

           INT. MINIVAN DRIVING - BACKROADS - NIGHT

           The guys sit in silence. Driving through the darkness.

                                 NAVIGATION (O.S.)
                        GPS signal lost.

                                 KUNLE
                        Shit.

                                 CARLOS
                        I know where we’re going. I have a 
                        really good sense of direction. My 
                        mom says I'm like a homing pigeon.

                                 KUNLE
                        Cool. So where do I go?

                                 CARLOS
                        Turn right at the place with the 
                        weird tree. I'll tell you...

           Carlos is bad with awkward silences.

                                 SEAN
                        Is she still alive?

                                 CARLOS
                        Hey, are you still alive?

           Goldilocks looks at him... confused.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Where... Wherearewe? Who're you?

                                 CARLOS
                            (losing patience)
                        Can you drink this?

           He hands her the Gatorade, but she slaps it away. Looks 
           around. Sees the WOODS... Suddenly, she's gripped by FEAR.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Wherethefuck...Whereareyoutakingme?

           Carlos clocks this. Oh shit.

                                 CARLOS
                        Hey... It's alright-

           She freaks out, SCREAMS. She wriggles her way out of the 
           blanket, wildly kicking the back of Kunle's seat.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        Ahhh! Stop!

           She SHRIEKS even louder. She flails--

                                 CARLOS
                        We're just getting you some help--

           But she isn't listening, she's screaming. When Kunle's head 
           is turned, she KICKS Kunle in the face, splitting his lip.

           Kunle loses control of the van--swerves!

           Then, overcorrects!

           The van glides off the road, into a DITCH, coming to a soft 
           yet abrupt stop.

           A long beat. They're all dazed. 

                                 KUNLE
                        Is everyone OK?

           Goldilocks reaches for the door, trying to open it. Carlos 
           grabs her arm to stop her, but she PUNCHES him in the face.

                                 CARLOS
                        OW!

           She punches him AGAIN. And AGAIN. His nose GUSHES BLOOD.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        OWWW!

                                 SEAN
                        Jesus!

           But she manages to open the van door--

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH / WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Goldilocks STUMBLES OUT into the darkness. She instantly 
           disappears into the trees--

                                 KUNLE
                        FUCK!

                                 CARLOS
                        Don't worry, I'll get her!

           Carlos gets out, chases her. The darkness envelops him.

                                 SEAN
                        Great. Now we lost two idiots.
           05/30/20

           Kunle gets out, looks around. The forest is so dark, he can't 
           see anything. He's bleeding.

           Carlos re-emerges from the shadows, winded, his nose still 
           bleeding. There's blood all over his face and shirt. 

                                 CARLOS
                        She went that way.

           He points generally out into the trees. It's not helpful.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Ow. I think she broke my nose.

           Carlos pulls two mini-flashlights out of his fanny pack, 
           gives one to Kunle. He inspects the area for clues.

                                 KUNLE
                        WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU!

           Kunle hears laughter. Strange, pained laughter. He wheels 
           around to see Sean, laughing quietly to himself in despair.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Come on, we need to find her.

           Sean gets out of the van. Looks down at his tire. It's FLAT.

           He laughs harder, a half-crazed laugh. Kunle watches, 
           worried. But he's barely holding it together himself.

                                 CARLOS
                        Guys, look...

           He shines his light on a set of footprints in the dirt...

           And then, Carlos is hot on the trail. Kunle and Sean follow 
           close behind...

           EXT. INTO THE WOODS - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS
                        She went this way.
                            (re: Kunle's skepticism)
                        Look at the way the grass is bent. 
                        The branches are broken... I got 
                        this, guys. I'm an Eagle Scout.

                                 KUNLE
                        Guys... We... How are we...?

                                 SEAN
                        Carlos is a fucking Eagle Scout. 
                        He's gonna find this bitch.
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS
                        Can we please stop calling her 
                        "bitch"? It's not nice. She's a 
                        human woman.

           A beat.

                                 SEAN
                        Alright, let's find this... human 
                        woman.

           Carlos and Sean proceed. 

           Off Kunle, about to fucking cry...

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT

           An exhausted Alice rides with Maddy on her bike. Rafael 
           coasts along beside them on the electric unicycle. 

           Rafael holds the phone now. They're following the pin.

                                 ALICE
                        They still haven't moved?

                                 RAFAEL
                        No, they're still sitting there.

                                 MADDY
                        Should we call 911 again?

                                 RAFAEL
                        We've called three times...

                                 ALICE
                        They're probably pretty busy 
                        tonight... It's spring break.

                                 MADDY
                            (sarcastic)
                        Wow, yeah, it is Spring Break. 
                        Let's not bother them, then.

                                 ALICE
                        Maddy... chill.

                                 MADDY
                        Chill? My sister got in a creepy 
                        fucking murder van with some 
                        strangers, and you are suggesting 
                        we do WHAT exactly? Nothing?

                                 ALICE
                        We're going to figure it out.
           05/30/20

           Rafael looks over at Alice, clocking her exhaustion.

                                 RAFAEL
                        You sure you don't want me to 
                        switch with you, Alice? This really 
                        isn't that hard to ride.

                         ALICE
                                                     MADDY
           Sure.
                                          We can't stop, guys.

           Alice stops. She's so tired. She swaps vehicles with Rafael. 

           Rafael gives Maddy a look as he mounts the bike.

                                 MADDY
                        What? What?

           Rafael starts pedaling, with Maddy holding onto his 
           shoulders.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Alice has been driving you all 
                        night. You could, I don't know, be, 
                        like, grateful.

                         MADDY
                                                     ALICE
           Excuse me?
                                          Rafael, it's alright--

                                                     MADDY
                        RAFAEL
           You're awesome and cool and 
           deserve better, Alice. Just 
           saying--
                                          Oh my god, you don't even 
                                          know me. You don't get to 
                                          white knight and be offended 
                                          on her behalf. I'm freaking 
                                          out because my sister has 
                                          been taken and that 911 lady 
                                          was a total bitch to me--

                                 ALICE
                            (blurting it out)
                        But you could be, you know, not 
                        actively mean. We're here, right?

                                 MADDY
                        Jeez, I'm sorry, I'm having a hard 
                        night.

                                 ALICE
                        And we're here for you, Maddy. 
                        Because you brought a high schooler 
                        to a frat party and neglected her 
                        for two hours. We're here.

           Maddy is surprised at this. She bites her tongue.
           05/30/20

           They enter the woods, disappearing into the dark.

           INT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Our heroes have descended deeper into the forest. They're lit  *
           only by the glow of their phone flashlights and the moon.

                                 KUNLE
                        You sure you know the way back?

                                 CARLOS
                        As long as we can see the stars, 
                        we're fine. The car's that way.

           He points backward, into pure darkness. Kunle and Sean 
           exchange glances. But Sean shrugs--they're in too deep now.

           Kunle looks up at the sky. He can sort of see the stars.

           Carlos stops at the base of a tree. Troubled.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        The trail stops here.

                                 KUNLE
                        ...Seriously?

           Carlos keeps looking. But yep, nothing.

                                 SEAN
                        So, she must be around here, right?

                                 CARLOS
                        Or she backtracked...

                                 KUNLE
                        Or... maybe--no offense--you're in 
                        no way qualified to track people 
                        through the woods?

                                 CARLOS
                        I'm an Eagle Scout. I learned to 
                        track animals--

                                 KUNLE
                        But this isn't Boy Scouts. This 
                        isn't a video game. This is real 
                        life. We can't, like, reload if 
                        you're wrong. I don't see anything. 
                        Do you see anything? Look! THERE IS 
                        NOTHING! NOTHING!

           They are, indeed, surrounded by utter darkness.
           Watching Carlos investigate the area, Sean's fear and doubt 
           are getting the better of him.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        This was so stupid. If she dies out 
                        here, it's kind of your fault.

                                 SEAN
                        Hold up. This chick gets trashed, 
                        walks into my crib, and jumps out 
                        the car while we're trying to save 
                        her, and somehow it's my fault?

                                 KUNLE
                        I said we should just call 911, and 
                        you wouldn't let me. We need help-

                                 SEAN
                        Wouldn't let you? You decided not 
                        to. We all decided not to call. I 
                        didn't make you do shit.

           Sean looks to Carlos for backup.

                                 CARLOS
                        He didn't force you not to call.

                                 SEAN
                        I said if you called, it was on 
                        you. You didn't want it to be on 
                        you, because you knew I was right. 
                        Because you're kind of a pussy.

                                 KUNLE
                        I'm a pussy? You've been afraid of 
                        everything this whole night!

                                 CARLOS
                        Guys, can we not call each other 
                        pussies? It's kind of sexist. 
                        Pussies are tough enough to give 
                        birth. I think the word you're 
                        looking for is "coward."

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah, don't be such a sexist, Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        Don't be such a little bitch.

                                 CARLOS
                        That's also arguably sexist--
                                 SEAN
                        You were around real black men for 
                        like two seconds tonight, and you 
                        hid in the bathroom.

                                 KUNLE
                        I wasn't hiding! What do you want 
                        me to say? Sorry my parents are 
                        doctors? Sorry my childhood was 
                        happy? You don't have the authority 
                        to revoke my blackness.

                        CARLOS
                                                      SEAN
           Guys, please--
                                          Don't stop now. Keep going.

                                 KUNLE (CONT’D)
                        It's hilarious how you think you're 
                        so wise. Like you've got "street 
                        smarts." Because what, you know 
                        where to buy acid? Oooh, you've 
                        tried drugs? Wow, who cares? Last I 
                        checked, getting fucked up all the 
                        time doesn't mean you know things. 
                        It just makes you fucked up.

                                 SEAN
                        Oooh, shit's getting real now.

                                 KUNLE
                        We don't have time for this. I'm 
                        doing it. I'm calling 911.

                                 SEAN
                        No you're not.

                                 KUNLE
                        Yes I am.

                                 SEAN
                        No you're not.

                                 KUNLE
                        Yes I am.

           Kunle digs into his pocket, pulls out his phone. But Sean 
           immediately snatches it away! 

           Kunle jumps at it, but Sean holds it just out of reach...

           Not wanting to humiliate himself further, Kunle turns to 
           Carlos, fuming.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        Give me your phone. GIVE IT TO ME.
           Slowly, Carlos takes out his phone. But he looks to Sean, who 
           shakes his head.

                                 SEAN
                        We're wasting time. We need to look 
                        for her.

                                 KUNLE
                        WE LOST HER IN A FUCKING FOREST. We 
                        need help.

           Beat. Kunle attempts to SNATCH the phone from Carlos... 
           SUCCESS! He runs a short distance away--

           He unlocks the phone, when Sean TACKLES him to the ground--

           Sean and Kunle wrestle over the phone. Kunle struggles in 
           vain. Sean is much bigger, much stronger--he easily plucks 
           the phone from Kunle's hands.

           Sean stands up, shoves the phone back into Carlos' hands, and 
           bends down over Kunle, who's laying defeated on the ground, 
           rubbing his bruised arm.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        You're being a dick.

                                 SEAN
                        You're being a dick.

                                 CARLOS
                        Can we maybe all stop fighting?

                                 SEAN
                        How about we put it to a vote. All 
                        in favor of calling 911?

           Kunle raises his hand. Looks pointedly at Carlos.

           A long look between them. Carlos doesn't want to call.

                                 KUNLE
                        You're both cowards.

           Just then, they hear the sound of someone VOMITING.

           They look up, just in time to see... Goldilocks, partway up a 
           tree.

                                 CARLOS
                        Found her.

           Sean gives Kunle a look. See?
           05/30/20

           EXT. IN A TREE - CONTINUOUS

           Sean goes to help her down. Goldilocks looks around confused, 
           dazed. She's gotten worse.

                                 SEAN
                        Don't worry, Goldilocks, we're 
                        taking you to the hospital.

           She wriggles, trying to get free.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        No. No hospital...

                                 SEAN
                        Yes hospital.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        No hospital...

           She falls against Sean's chest, too drunk to do much else.

           PRELAP: The sound of wheels on asphalt.

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT

           It's very, very dark. Two lights weave back and forth in the 
           distance, as if dancing. They're growing closer and closer...

                                 RAFAEL (V.O.)
                        Can you try to sit still?

                                 MADDY (V.O.)
                        I am.

           Finally we can make out what these are. It's Alice, Maddy, 
           and Rafael--the lights of their respective vehicles 
           illuminating the path ahead.

           RAFAEL studies the Find My Friend app. They're closing in on 
           Goldilocks's pin.

           They move deeper into the dark, dark forest.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Alright this is getting creepy. 
                        They should be like 400 feet away. 
                        Why would anyone be stopped here?

                                 ALICE
                        Whoa, guys, look...

           He points into the distance: a minivan parked in the ditch. 
           They stop, just in time to see... FLASHLIGHTS in the trees.
           05/30/20

           Alice and Rafael turn off their lights. They all slow to a 
           stop in the shadows, and scamper into a...

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - HIDING SPOT - NIGHT

           Here, behind some foliage, they watch as three dark figures 
           emerge from the forest...

           And the tall one is cradling someone in his arms.

           Maddy, Alice, and Rafael gather around and study the Find My 
           Friend app. They are right next to the pin, now.

           They look up again. Sean passes in front of a sliver of 
           light, and for a moment, they can see... 

           It's a GIRL in his arms. Emma. It's definitely her.

                                 MADDY
                        Omigod, it's her...

           Maddy, Rafael, and Alice take in the sight, unsure what 
           they're seeing. But they know whatever it is, it's bad.

           But Sean and Emma disappear into the shadows once more, and 
           Maddy's suddenly gripped by terror.

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        Omigod, omigod, is she... What'd 
                        they do to her?

           Alice shushes her. 

           They look over at the guys. Sean, cast in shadow, takes 
           something big out of his trunk (a tire).

                                 RAFAEL
                        They're putting her in their murder 
                        van. We have to do something.

           Maddy is full on crying now. 

           Rafael and Alice exchange glances. 

                                 ALICE
                        Should we, like, call 911 again?

                                 RAFAEL
                        We should call 911 again.

           Maddy sobs into Alice's shoulder.

           Rafael fumbles with his phone. His hands are shaking so hard 
           he can't dial.
           05/30/20

           Alice takes it from him. She dials 911. Presses SEND.

           Rafael peeks out from their hiding spot, looking at the 
           shadowy figures in the moonlight.

                                 RAFAEL (CONT'D)
                        What are they doing? They're just 
                        standing there.

                                                 911 DISPATCHER
                         ALICE
           I don't know... It's creepy.
                                          911, what's your emergency?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes, hi, it's us again. We called 
                        in about the girl in the van?

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Oh yes, we have word out to our 
                        officers to look for the vehicle--

                                 ALICE
                        Well we're, like, hiding and 
                        looking at them right now, and 
                        we're pretty sure now that 
                        something bad is going on. She's 
                        unconscious, and they've brought 
                        her into the middle of the woods.

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        What is your location?

                                 ALICE
                        Uh...
                            (to Rafael, sotto)
                        Where even are we?

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           The guys put Goldilocks back in the car.

           Sean starts working on the tire. 

                                 KUNLE
                        Hurry.

                                 SEAN
                        I am.

           Carlos clocks the tension between them.

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - HIDING SPOT
           05/30/20

           Alice is still on the phone with 911. Rafael shows her the 
           GPS map on his own phone.  

                                 ALICE
                        We think we're on Highland Road--

                                 MADDY
                            (into phone)
                        We have reason to believe they 
                        could be drug dealers.

                                 ALICE
                        But we're not sure...

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Alright. You stay where you are, 
                        ma'am. We're gonna find you.

           But Maddy starts creeping out of the hiding spot...

                                 ALICE
                            (whispering)
                        What are you doing?

                     911 DISPATCHER
                                                     MADDY
           Ma'am?
                                          I have to make sure she's 
                                          alright.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Maddy, no--

           Maddy tiptoes across the road, strangely nimble.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           Alice and Rafael watch as Maddy slowly creeps down the road, 
           drawing closer to the van...

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Carlos holds the flashlight for Sean, who is fixing the tire, 
           unscrewing a bolt.

                                 CARLOS
                            (to Sean)
                        Need help?

                                 SEAN
                        Should only take a minute.

           Kunle leans moodily against the van. Carlos can't stand how 
           upset everyone is.
                                 CARLOS
                        When we're done here I think we 
                        should all just go to Underground. 
                        I know you're tired, Kunle, but I 
                        think you'll be glad you went. This 
                        feels bad now, but someday this is 
                        all gonna be a crazy story.

                                 KUNLE
                        Maybe.

           A twig snaps. Kunle hears it, looks...

           We see Maddy's hiding behind the van, eyes wide. She stays 
           very still.

           Kunle figures it was nothing.

                                 CARLOS
                        You remember when we tried to sneak 
                        into Underground? Freshman year?

                                 SEAN
                        And got your dumb ass stuck in the 
                        bathroom window.

                        CARLOS
           Yeah.
                                                  SEAN (CONT'D)
                                          Like fuckin' Winnie the Pooh.

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah, that's what you said. You 
                        remember? And then we all went to 
                        you room, got high and watched 
                        1970s Winnie the Pooh compilation 
                        videos on YouTube? I feel like 
                        that's the night we all became 
                        friends.

           A beat. Sean and Kunle take this in.

           Maddy, meanwhile, musters up the courage to rise from her 
           hiding place very slowly, and peek in through the car window.

           She finally sees her sister. Passed the fuck out.

           She grabs the door handle. She begins, very VERY VERY slowly 
           and quietly to open the car door.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        It's kind of poetic, right? I mean, 
                        it's kind of our friendiversary. 
                        It's like we've come full circle: 
                        we all go to Underground together. 
                                 (MORE)
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Finally. Good thing too, since it's 
                        our last chance.

           Kunle looks over at Sean, who avoids his gaze.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        So you have to come too. Come on, 
                        Kunle. Don't be a party pooper.

                                 KUNLE
                        I can't.

                                 SEAN
                        He can't. Let him be a party 
                        pooper. It's fine.

           Kunle bristles.

                                 CARLOS
                        Come on, Kunle...

                                 KUNLE
                        I can't go. If I go, you can't go. 
                        Sean only got two passes.
                            (beat)
                        Sean only got passes for himself 
                        plus one. So. You should go.

           Carlos puts two and two together: he wasn't invited.

                                 CARLOS
                        Oh... So... You guys--

                                 SEAN
                        I didn't think you'd want to come.

           INT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Maddy has cracked the door open. She gets a hold of her 
           sister's ankle, tries to shake her awake.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma. Emma, wake up.

           It isn't working...

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS
                        No, it's alright. That's fine. I 
                        mean, I shouldn't have assumed.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        I didn't know it meant that much to 
                        you, man. You don't go out much. I 
                        thought you were gonna stay in and 
                        play Civ...

                                 CARLOS
                        I was! Yeah. It's fine. It's fine.
                            (beat)
                        I should go check on her.

           Carlos opens the van door...

           Just as Maddy withdraws, trying her best to close the van 
           door without making a sound. Fuck.

           INT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Carlos gets in the back seat beside Goldilocks. He slams the 
           door shut behind him, as...

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Maddy notices the edge of her dress is caught in the van 
           door. Double fuck.

           On the other side, Sean tightens up the last bolts on the 
           tire.

                                 SEAN
                        He was getting all sentimental and 
                        shit. You didn't have to do that.

           INT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Carlos sits beside Goldilocks, listening...

                                 KUNLE
                        You're the one who calls him a 
                        neckbeard behind his back.

           Carlos instinctively puts his hand on his neck, where he does 
           actually have some beard... Not wanting to hear more, he puts 
           his headphones in.

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Sean gets to his feet, tire iron in hand.

                                 SEAN
                        The fuck is wrong with you?
                                 KUNLE
                        Me? This whole night you've 
                        been obsessed with your Legendary 
                        Tour. It's not gonna happen. We 
                        have bigger shit to worry about 
                        right now. Also, college is almost 
                        over. If you spent like a tenth of 
                        the effort on your thesis that you 
                        spent trying to get into parties, 
                        you might actually have a job offer 
                        by now.

           Sean coolly pulls out his vape.

                                 SEAN
                        You know what? Once college is 
                        over, I don't need a fucking 
                        lecture every day. Maybe we don't 
                        need to live together.

           A beat.

                                 KUNLE
                        Okay. Well maybe this is a good 
                        time to tell you I got into 
                        Princeton. And I've already decided 
                        I'm going. So, yeah, we're not 
                        gonna be living together.

           A long look between them.

                                 SEAN
                        Congratulations. Princeton. Wow. 
                        You really are better than the rest 
                        of us, aren't you?

           Sean just shrugs.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        I guess this is good, right? We 
                        don't need to pretend we have 
                        anything in common.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sounds good.

           A beat. They both turn to walk back toward the van, just 
           as...

           Maddy manages to tear herself free quietly. She starts 
           creeping away from the van.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        Uh oh. Your mold's prolly dead by 
                        now.

                                 KUNLE
                        That's nice.

           But then... Maddy trips.

           Sean and Kunle both turn and look, to see... MADDY, frozen, 
           like a deer in headlights.

           Caught, Maddy hops to her feet, grabbing a long stick off the 
           ground. She wields it like a sword.

                                 MADDY
                        Let her go!

           She takes a swing. The guys take a step back.

                                 KUNLE
                        Hey...

           Kunle raises his hands in a gesture of peace.

           Causing Maddy to start swinging at them like a madwoman--

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - HIDING SPOT - NIGHT

           We get the POV of Alice and Rafael. Alice is still on the 
           line with the Dispatcher.

                                 ALICE
                        I think... she's fighting them?

                                 RAFAEL
                        Where are the fucking cops?

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        The police are driving down 
                        Highland Road, looking for you. 
                        Please stay visible.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Are we sure this is Highland Road?

           Alice shakes her head.

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Maddy whacks Sean and Kunle a couple times with her branch. 
           They fend her off.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        Stop that! Please! Just--

           But Maddy does not stop. She just swings harder.

           INT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Carlos has his headphones in. He's listening to SAD MUSIC, 
           eyes closed, unable to hear anything.

           EXT. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - NIGHT

           Maddy stops whacking them, taking a step back.

                                 SEAN
                        Why are you hitting us? WHO ARE 
                        YOU?

           Maddy brandishes her branch at them, wild-eyed with fear.

                                 MADDY
                        WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

                         SEAN
                                                     KUNLE
           Nothing!
                                          What the fuck!?

           Sean grabs the stick from Maddy's hands mid-whack, causing 
           her to SCREAM in horror.

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - HIDING SPOT

           Rafael struggles to pinpoint them on the GPS.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Sorry, it's not Highland, we're on 
                        Elm Drive I think? Sorry!

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Elm Drive? Copy. Please stand by.

           They all look up. They can't see them (behind the van).

                                 ALICE
                        Where'd they go?

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Maddy backs up, TRIPS over a root! She TUMBLES to the ground!

           The guys come to an abrupt halt. Maddy holds her ankle, 
           groaning in pain.

           As Sean and Kunle close in, she fumbles in her bag for...
           PEPPER SPRAY! She takes aim, and SPRAYS... Only to 
           accidentally spray herself. She SCREAMS.

                                 MADDY
                        FUUUUUUUCK! OWW!!! FUCK THAT HURTS. 
                        OH MY GOD THAT HURTS.

                                 KUNLE
                        Oh my god, are you OK?

                                 MADDY
                        Fuck off! Don't touch me!

           She tries to aim the spray at them.

                                 KUNLE
                        You're gonna spray yourself again.

           Blinded, Maddy tries to turn the pepper spray around, but in 
           the process drops it on the ground.

                                 MADDY
                        I saw what you did to my sister! 
                        The police are on their way!

           They look down at the trembling, pepper-sprayed girl. Sean 
           and Kunle take this in... This is fucked.

           Maddy rubs her eyes, until she's able to open just a little 
           bit. She squints up at them.

                                 SEAN
                        We didn't do anything to your 
                        sister. She--

                                 KUNLE
                        --We found her. We were trying to 
                        make sure she's OK--

           But Maddy finds the pepper spray again, aims it toward them.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah I don't think she believes us.

           A beat. Kunle extends a hand to her.

                                 KUNLE
                        Can you stand?

           Maddy ignores his gesture. She uses a tree to climb, 
           unsteadily, to her feet. She's clearly sprained an ankle. She 
           backs away slowly...
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        You need help. You're hurt.

                                 SEAN
                        Did you hear her? Po-po gonna be 
                        here any minute. Goldilocks will be 
                        fine. We need to get the fuck-

                                 KUNLE
                        And now she's running away.

           Sure enough, Maddy is limping away as fast as she can! 

           They follow behind her as, weeping, Maddy limps out into...

           EXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - MIDDLE OF ROAD - NIGHT

           Kunle and Sean can barely see in the darkness here.

           Maddy points back at them with one accusing finger.

                                 MADDY
                        It's them! It's them!

           Suddenly, someone shines a BRIGHT FLASHLIGHT in Sean and 
           Kunle's face. They can't see who's holding it (Alice).

                                 ALICE
                            (in her deepest voice)
                        Stay back! Put your hands up!

           Kunle and Sean raise their hands in the air. Petrified.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        GET ON THE GROUND! You're under 
                        arrest. Don't move.

                                 911 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                            (indistinct)
                        Ma'am please don't impersonate a 
                        police officer--

           Kunle and Sean obey. They get on their knees, slowly lower 
           themselves to the ground, face down.

           Kunle and Sean look at each other, afraid.

                                 KUNLE
                        Please, this is a mistake, Officer. 
                        We didn't do anything--

                                 ALICE
                        DON'T MOVE!
                                 KUNLE
                        We were taking her to the hospital--

           IN KUNLE'S POV: He turns his head slowly, his eyes 
           adjusting... enough to clearly see...

           That Alice is not a cop. They lock eyes...

                                 ALICE
                        Don't move!

                                 KUNLE
                        You're not... They're not cops.

           Sean and Kunle both look up at her...

           Alice backs away from them, startled. Her phone slips out of 
           her trembling hand. It hits the ground, bounces...

           The screen's shattered. The call ends as the phone goes dead.

                                 ALICE
                        Fuck.

           Slowly, Kunle and Sean get off the ground. Confused.

           Everyone exchanges looks. Recognition dawns on Rafael, Sean, 
           and Kunle's faces. Then--

                                 KUNLE
                        What the hell--

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Rafael?

           Carlos gets out of the minivan, staring.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 RAFAEL
                        What are you doing here?

                                 CARLOS
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ALICE
                        What the fuck is happening?

           Sean and Kunle get to their feet, as Carlos walks over to 
           join them in the street.
                        CARLOS
                                                     RAFAEL
           We got a flat tire...
                                          We've been looking for her 
                                          sister.

                                 KUNLE
                        Her sister?

                        CARLOS
           This is so weird.
                                                     MADDY
                                          Someone explain what the fuck 
                                          is going on right now.

                                 ALICE
                        You know them?

                                 RAFAEL
                        That's my cousin. And his 
                        roommates...

           Suddenly, Maddy, is brandishing her pepper spray again.

                                 SEAN
                        Bitch, don't spray us.

                         MADDY
                                                     KUNLE
           STAY BACK!
                                          Maybe don't call her bitch 
                                          right now.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Rafael)
                        Tell her we're cool!

                                 RAFAEL
                        You guys aren't like... kidnapping 
                        that girl, right?

                                 KUNLE/CARLOS/SEAN
                        No!

           Maddy and Alice look back and forth between Carlos and 
           Rafael. A strange standoff. Maddy keeps her finger on the 
           pepper spray trigger.

                                 ALICE
                        He's your...cousin?

                        RAFAEL
                                                     CARLOS
           Yeah.
                                          Yeah.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You don't... look...

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah, he looks super White. He gets 
                        that a lot.
           05/30/20

                                 RAFAEL
                        I'm Mexican.

                                 SEAN
                        You do look super White, though.

                                 RAFAEL
                        I'm aware.

                                 ALICE
                            (still suspicious)
                        What are you guys doing here?

           A beat. Rafael wants to know, too.

                                 KUNLE
                        We're... trying to take this girl 
                        to the hospital. We found her--

                         MADDY
                                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
           Found her??
                                          --she just walked into our 
                                          apartment--

                                 MADDY
                        This is bullshit!

                         SEAN
           Just let him explain!
                                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                                          I WANT TO TALK TO MY SISTER. 
                                          NOW.

           Maddy looks like an enraged, wounded animal. Kunle and Sean 
           move out of the way, to let her by.

           Alice and Rafael help Maddy limp over toward the minivan...

           I/E. MINIVAN - IN A DITCH - CONTINUOUS 

           Maddy slides into the back seat, next to Goldilocks, who is 
           asleep.

           The sight of her is enough to sober Maddy up a bit. She is 
           careful to keep her pepper spray trained on Kunle and Sean.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma? Omigod, what did you do to 
                        her?

                                 SEAN
                        We came home, she was passed out on 
                        our floor... That's all we know. 

                                 KUNLE
                        We've been trying to take her to 
                        the hospital.
                                 MADDY
                        Emma? EMMA?

           Maddy hands her pepper spray to Alice. She shakes Goldilocks. 
           Goldilocks moans, barely audible.

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        Did they hurt you?

           Goldilocks barely opens her eyes. She doesn't reply. She 
           closes them again.

                                 CARLOS
                        How did you even find us?

           Rafael shows him the Find My Friend app. Carlos is confused.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        But she doesn't have her phone...

           Maddy, meanwhile, puts her ear to Goldilocks' chest, but 
           something's in the way... Maddy reaches slightly under the 
           collar of Goldilocks' shirt, pulls out a CELL from her bra.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Ohhhh. Yeah we didn't check there.

                                 MADDY
                        I can't hear anything.

                                 KUNLE
                        She's still breathing, that means 
                        her heart is beating.

                                 MADDY
                        Back off!

                                 KUNLE
                        I'm just trying to help.

                                 MADDY
                        If you're just trying to "help" 
                        then why are we in the middle of 
                        the fucking forest right now? Why 
                        did you stop at some weird house? 
                        You think we're stupid?

                                 KUNLE
                        We wanted to avoid getting pulled 
                        over. The taillight's out. We were 
                        trying to borrow another car from 
                        his brother, but we couldn't.
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS
                        We know this all looks weird... 
                        Bad. But that's the truth.

           Rafael walks around the back of the minivan.

                                 RAFAEL
                        The tail light is out.

                                 MADDY
                        Of course you're going to side with 
                        your own cousin. They're lying. 
                        These two chased me!

                                 KUNLE
                        You were clearly intoxicated and 
                        injured, we wanted to make sure you 
                        were okay-

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah, last thing we need tonight is 
                        another passed out floppy-ass white 
                        chick in here. Why were you so 
                        quick to pepper spray us, huh? Is 
                        it 'cause we're black?

           Maddy is caught off guard by this question. She quickly 
           calculates the best response to not seem racist:

                                 MADDY
                        Pft...No.

           Maddy looks to Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        I don't know. Maybe there's a 
                        chance this was all a big weird 
                        misunderstanding? I mean, it kind 
                        of tracks.

           KUNLE goes to check on Emma. Her breathing has slowed. He 
           checks her pulse.

                                 MADDY
                        You just believe them? Are you a 
                        fucking idiot?

                                 ALICE
                        No, Maddy. I'm not a fucking idiot.
                            (re: Kunle)
                        He genuinely looks like he's trying 
                        to help.
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                        Don't touch her!

                                 CARLOS
                        It's alright. He's First Aid 
                        Certified.

           Kunle sets Emma's wrist down. Concerned.

                                 KUNLE
                        Do you know how much she drank?

           A beat. Maddy, in her panic, forgets that she's supposed to 
           be hating him.

                                 MADDY
                        She had some shots and some beer? 
                        Then she wandered off... I dunno.

           Alice is beyond fed up with Maddy.

                                 KUNLE
                        She's still getting drunker. She 
                        threw up a lot, but...

                                 MADDY
                        She's gonna be okay, right? She's 
                        not, like, gonna die?

           A beat.

                                 KUNLE
                        When did you call 911?

                                 ALICE
                        Like ten minutes ago?

                                 RAFAEL
                        We're not even sure they're looking 
                        in the right place. We could call 
                        them back-

                                 SEAN
                        You can't just say, "Nobody's being 
                        kidnapped, false alarm." They're 
                        still gonna send a buttload of cops 
                        over here.

                                 ALICE
                        I'll just...
                            (beat)
                        Okay yeah, I see your point.
                                 MADDY
                        She's getting really cold...

           Kunle looks at Emma, worried. Maddy looks at Kunle like a 
           deer in headlights.

                                 KUNLE
                        Okay. We need to take her to the 
                        hospital.

           Sean looks at him like "Fuck no."

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        The ambulance isn't here. I don't 
                        know where it is, but it's not 
                        here, and the hospital isn't far--

                                 SEAN
                        I have a better idea. They wait for 
                        the ambulance, and we get the fuck 
                        out of here.

                                 KUNLE
                        We can't just leave them in the 
                        middle of nowhere!

           Sean sighs.

                                 SEAN
                        Then... they take her to the 
                        hospital, and we still get the fuck 
                        out of here. They can even take my 
                        car, I don't even give a shit 
                        anymore.

           Sean tosses Rafael his car keys.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        But everyone darker than a paper 
                        bag needs to get the fuck out of 
                        here, now.

           Sean jogs across the street and picks up Rafael's electric 
           unicycle.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        The fuck is this? Carlos, you know 
                        how to ride this thing?

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah, but... we can't just--

                                 SEAN
                        Yes we can.
           05/30/20

           Sean puts the unicycle aside, picks up Alice's bike instead.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        They gonna be here any second. I'm 
                        not about to be a hashtag. Come on.

           Sean mounts the bike. Turns to Kunle, as if to say, "Get on."

           But Kunle hesitates.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        We did it: we got her help. You 
                        want a ride to your lab or not?

           Kunle's torn. He looks at Emma. At everyone staring at him.

                                 KUNLE
                        You guys are too drunk to drive. 
                        One of us has to stay... 

                                 CARLOS
                        I can drive. I'm fine now.

                                 SEAN
                        Don't be a fucking idiot.

           Carlos takes the keys from Rafael. Everyone piles into the 
           minivan. Carlos throws the unicycle into the back.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        I ain't playing. The cops think we 
                        kidnapped a white girl. We gotta 
                        go.

                                 CARLOS
                        I can't just leave them.

           Sean turns to Kunle with a question in his eyes.

                                 SEAN
                        Think about Princeton! Think about 
                        your stupid fucking mold! Come on.

           But Kunle's decided. He takes Emma's pulse again.

           Sean can't believe them. It sinks in: he's alone on this.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        Fine. You guys want to play the 
                        fucking hero, you do that. I'm out.

           Sean gets on the bike. Beat.
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                            (to Kunle)
                        And for the record, I don't care if 
                        you think I'm a little bitch-ass 
                        coward. At least I'll be alive.

           With one final look at Kunle and Carlos, speeds off down the 
           road. And he doesn't look back.

           Sean is cast into shadow. Things are really dark now, without 
           the light of the headlights. All that illuminates him is the 
           light of the moon... Until the darkness swallows him whole.

           Kunle doesn't wait to watch him go. He gets in the back seat.

           INT. MINIVAN DRIVING - BACKROADS - NIGHT

           On Kunle, as it sinks in... Sean's not coming back.

           Rafael is in the passenger seat, Kunle and Emma share the 
           center row, while Alice and Maddy share the very back.

           Kunle locks eyes with Carlos in the rear-view mirror.

                                 CARLOS
                        Everyone ready?

           Carlos slams on the gas...

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Sean, still shaken, rides as fast as he can down a suburban-
           looking street. He's speeding downhill, flying... All alone.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The minivan cuts its way down the long road.

           EXT. FRAT ROW - UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean stops right in front of...

           UNDERGROUND. And it looks just as glorious as it did in his 
           imagination. It's like he's finally waking from a bad dream. 

           He walks toward the entrance, noticing the Drunk Omicron Frat 
           Boys from earlier vengefully pissing on the front lawn, 
           hooting and hollering.

           Sean proceeds to the door, hands over his Underground pass to 
           a BOUNCER. Steps through the door, swallowed by the crowd...
           05/30/20

           EXT. MINIVAN - BACKROADS - NIGHT

           Maddy holds Emma's hand... while Kunle takes Emma's pulse on 
           her other wrist. 

           Carlos drives fast down the long, empty roads. All is quiet.

           Maddy clocks Kunle's worry.

                                 MADDY
                        What?

                                 KUNLE
                        She's not really breathing 
                        anymore... I think we need to... I 
                        need to start CPR.

                                 CARLOS
                        Should I stop?

                                 MADDY
                        Should he stop?

                                 KUNLE
                        No... We need to keep going.

           He unbuckles, lays Emma onto her back across the seat, lifts 
           her head into the proper position.

           He begins CPR.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        I've never done this on a real 
                        person before.

                                 CARLOS
                        You got this man.

           Kunle starts chest compressions. He sings softly to himself:

                                 KUNLE
                        Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, 
                        stayin' alive--

                                 MADDY
                            (through tears)
                        Can you like...not sing that song 
                        right now?

                                 ALICE
                        It's to keep the right tempo for 
                        CPR. I saw it on Reddit...

           Carlos joins in, trying to be supportive....
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS/KUNLE
                        STAYIN' ALIIIIIIVE...

           Suddenly, behind them, a cop car pulls onto the street... 

           INT. COP CAR - NIGHT

           OFFICER PETERSON (40s, White) clocks the broken tail light.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        Tail light's out.

           His partner, OFFICER YOUNG (30s, White) sighs.

                                 OFFICER YOUNG
                        It's been a long night. We can just 
                        let it go.
                            (long beat)
                        Wait... Gray Kia Sedona. License 
                        plate Delta Delta Bravo 0110.

           Officer Young checks the computer. Shit.

           INT. - MINIVAN - BACKROADS - NIGHT

           Suddenly a siren wails behind them.

                                 RAFAEL
                        Guys I think we have a problem.

           Kunle looks up, still humming softly...

           The cops are indeed pulling them over.

                                 CARLOS
                        What do I do? Pull over?

                                 KUNLE
                            (to the tune)
                        I can't stop doing this, or she 
                        might dieeeeee...

                                 ALICE
                        Put the flashers on!

           Carlos searches for the emergency lights button.

                                 CARLOS
                        I don't know where anything is on 
                        this car.

           He finds them. But... he also runs a stop sign.

           A voice booms from a speaker:
                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Pull over.

                        RAFAEL
                                                     CARLOS
           Dude!
                                          SHIT.

                                 ALICE
                        I'll just wave at them.

           Alice rolls down the window, and pokes her head out at the 
           police. She waves her arms at them.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Pull over NOW. Let the hostage go.

                                 ALICE
                        We're not hostages!

                                 CARLOS
                            (yelling)
                        We're going to the hospital!

                                 RAFAEL
                        They can't hear you. Turn right!

           Carlos turns right. The cop car draws even closer.

                                 CARLOS
                        They really think we kidnapped you!

           The minivan speeds down the road, and the HOSPITAL is 
           suddenly in view. Just a few more blocks--

           But the cops start a maneuver to get them to pull over! 
           They're gaining on the minivan.

           Carlos speeds up.

                                 CARLOS (CONT'D)
                        Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.

           Kunle is doing the chest compression like a machine He looks 
           down at Emma's face. 

           He's getting tired. Very tired. But he pushes on...

           Maddy wipes her tears away.

                                 MADDY
                        This is all my fault, isn't it?

                                 ALICE
                        Maddy...
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY
                        I ditched her because I didn't want 
                        to be hanging out with a high 
                        schooler. I'm so fucking stupid.

                                 ALICE
                        We're almost there.

           Kunle rises up from another rescue breath to see...

           A WAVE OF COP CARS descending on them now, as they're closing 
           in on the...

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           The EMERGENCY sign looms in the distance. The light at the 
           end of the tunnel.

           Carlos swings a hard right into the hospital driveway.

           The cop cars squeal after him--

           Suddenly, the minivan comes to a halt, right in front of the 
           Emergency Room entrance...

           But they're surrounded by police cars in a matter of seconds.

           INT. MINIVAN - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Everyone is quiet... Except for Kunle. He hums his desperate, 
           frantic cover of Stayin' Alive. Two rescue breaths for every 
           thirty compressions. And repeat...

           He looks up, in his daze, surveying the situation. And it's 
           not great...

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Several POLICE OFFICERS jump out of their cars, ducking 
           behind them for cover. These are soft, small-town cops, not 
           used to seeing this kind of action. A voice booms out of the 
           speakers:

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        Come out with your hands up.

           INT. MINIVAN - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

                                 CARLOS/RAFAEL
                        Shit.

           Kunle glances at Carlos, who's sitting very low in his seat.
           05/30/20

                                 CARLOS
                        We have to get out.

                                 KUNLE
                        If I stop, she might die.

                                 CARLOS
                        You might die.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (O.S.)
                        STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE, NOW.

                                 KUNLE
                        Can't stop.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (O.S.)
                        You have until the count of three.

                                 KUNLE
                        Go.

           Carlos puts his hands up.

                                 CARLOS
                        I love you Kunle. I love you, cuz.
                            (to Alice and Maddy)
                        I don't know you but I love you 
                        too. Shit.
                            (then)
                        What do we do? How do we open the 
                        door with our hands up?

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (O.S.)
                        One.

           Kunle locks eyes with Maddy. She's definitely feeling sober 
           now, stroking Emma's hair.

                                 ALICE
                            (to Maddy)
                        Us first.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (O.S.)
                        Two.

           Maddy understands, nods.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM DOORS - NIGHT

           The van sits in silence, surrounded by police.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (V.O.)
                        Three.
           05/30/20

           Suddenly, one of the van doors opens. And out steps 
           someone... Hands raised. The hands are white. It's Alice, 
           with Maddy close behind her.

           They look up at the police officers, trembling.

                                 ALICE
                        There's been a mistake--

                                 MADDY
                        We're not kidnapped--

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        HANDS UP.

           In a flash, the police rush forward--

           Time seems to stretch. The red and blue of the police lights 
           too bright in Kunle's eyes.

           The sound is drowned out, as he continues CPR.

           WE SEE IMAGES, IN SLOW MOTION:

           - Maddy gets on her knees, hands up, as the police press in.

           - Emma lays unconscious, as Kunle compresses her chest again 
           and again and again...

           - Carlos and Rafael slowly get out of the car. They disappear 
           into the blur of the police lights...

           - Alice puts herself in front of Kunle, but... Suddenly, 
           there's a blinding light in Kunle's face--

           - He can see silhouettes--COPS running toward them, grabbing 
           at Alice, pulling her out of the way.

           - And then Kunle finds himself looking into the unfamiliar 
           eyes of Officer Peterson. The rest of the cop's face is cast 
           in shadow--

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (CONT'D)
                        Hands up!

                                 MADDY (O.S.)
                        STOP! My sister needs a doctor!

           INT. MINIVAN - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

           Kunle's breath catches, as he notices... a GUN, in Officer 
           Peterson's hand. It's the single longest moment of his life.

           Suddenly, we SNAP BACK TO REALTIME:
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        Officer, we were just trying to--

           But without hesitation, the Officer pulls Kunle from the car,  *
           SLAMS him to the ground. 

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM DOORS - NIGHT

           Suddenly, Kunle is lying prone, with a cop kneeling on his 
           back, stunned.

                                 KUNLE
                        Please, she needs help.

                                              OFFICER YOUNG (O.S.)
                                          Ma'am, hands on your head.
                     MADDY (O.S.)
           STOP! MY FUCKING SISTER IS IN 
           THERE.

                                 ALICE
                        He was just doing CPR, Officer. Get 
                        off of him!

           In Kunle's POV, he can just barely see Maddy, facing off with  *
           a cop, indignant. Sheer white privilege radiates out from 
           her, like a protective forcefield.

                         MADDY
           OMIGOD LISTEN TO ME.
                                                  OFFICER YOUNG
                                          Miss, you need to calm down--

                                 MADDY
                        Are you serious? USE YOUR FUCKING 
                        EYES, MY SISTER IS DYING IN THAT 
                        VAN! STOP ARRESTING US AND GET A 
                        DOCTOR. NOW.

           A beat. Officer Peterson takes his knee off Kunle's back.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        We need a medic!
                            (to Kunle)
                        Stay there.

           Kunle wouldn't dare move. He lays there, stunned.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON  (O.S.)(CONT'D)
                            (to Officer Young)
                        Alcohol poisoning?

                                 OFFICER YOUNG (O.S.)
                        Looks like it.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON (O.S.)
                        Fucking Spring Break.
           05/30/20

           A moment later, the PARAMEDICS rush in. We're in Kunle's POV 
           as he sees them lift Emma onto a gurney, and wheel her away.

           He manages to turn his head. He finally sees Maddy, Alice, 
           Rafael, and Carlos. None of them are on the ground, like him.  *
           They're all kneeling in a line, hands on their heads.

           Kunle lays there, breathing hard, his eyes wide open.

           The red and blue of the police lights dance across his skin. 
           He lays there, still as a dead man, as we rise up into a 
           BIRD'S EYE VIEW of the scene...

           INT. UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean knocks back a drink, frustrated. Sad-drunk. This is 
           clearly not as epic and wonderful as he was expecting.

           He sees Asa. 

           Goes up to her. Beat. He kisses her. Intense. 

           At first she's into it, but something's off. She gently 
           pushes him away.

                                 ASA
                        Sean, you okay?

           Sean just fucking can't. He leaves a mystified Asa behind...

           As he pushes through the crowd, Bianca cheerily makes her way 
           toward him.

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey!! How goes the Legendary Tour? 
                        Where's Kunle?

                                 SEAN
                        He's not coming.

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh. I thought...

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah. He doesn't like parties. He 
                        just likes fungus.

           Sean takes a big swig of booze, leaves her there.

                                                          CUT TO:
           05/30/20

           INT. UNDERGROUND - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sean kneels in the bathroom stall, in front of the toilet, 
           totally hammered. He spits, not feeling good. But he can't 
           even throw up.

           He sits down on the floor. Beat.

           He takes out his phone. Checks Find My Friend. 

           He focuses in on Kunle.

           They're at the hospital. Relief washes over him, but also 
           something else. Something darker. Guilt, shame.

           He puts his head back. Opens his eyes. 

           He focuses on a spot on the ceiling. A moldy spot.

           Off Sean, thinking...

           EXT. UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT

           Sean walks over to a table of snacks. Grabs a PLASTIC FORK...

           He hands his bundle of party passes to a very surprised 
           FRESHMAN on his way out the front door.

           EXT. HOSPITAL CURB - NIGHT

           Kunle and Carlos sit on the side of the road, hands on their 
           knees. Officer Young keeps an eye on them.

           Officer Peterson approaches, Rafael and Alice in tow.

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        Alright, I'm giving you kids a 
                        warning. You're free to go.

                                 KUNLE
                        Is she going to be OK, Officer?

                                 OFFICER PETERSON
                        We'll have to wait and see. She 
                        blew a 3.1. If someone's 
                        unconscious, just call the pros 
                        next time. Alright?

           Kunle, Carlos, Rafael, and Alice nod.

           EXT. MINIVAN - UNIVERSITY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Kunle, Carlos, Alice, and Rafael all hop out of the van. 
           They're in a university parking lot.
           05/30/20

                                 ALICE
                        I'll let you know what I hear from 
                        Maddy.

                                 CARLOS
                        Thanks.

                                 ALICE
                        Well that was an adventure. Sorry 
                        again for calling the cops on you. 
                        I mean, it did look really weird...

           She sort of laughs, nervously. Kunle and Carlos aren't ready 
           to laugh about it yet.

                                 RAFAEL
                        God, Abuelita would kill me if I 
                        got you shot.

                                 CARLOS
                        She would.

           An awkward beat.

                                 ALICE
                        Cool. Well. See you?

           Rafael and Carlos fistbump. Rafael and Alice walk off, hand 
           in hand, leaving Carlos and Kunle alone.

           Kunle takes long, deep breaths.

                                 CARLOS
                        Are you alright, man?

                                 KUNLE
                        I have to go check my mold 
                        samples... Maybe I can still save 
                        some of them.

                                 CARLOS
                        It's okay if you're not okay.

           Kunle looks at him, a bit shell-shocked. Beat. He tries to 
           brush it off.

                                 KUNLE
                        I'm fine.

           Carlos takes him by the shoulders.

                                 CARLOS
                        Kunle. You're my hero. You were a 
                        fucking badass.
                                 KUNLE
                        I almost fucking pissed myself.

                                 CARLOS
                        Me too. I think I actually did a 
                        little... To the lab?

           Off Kunle and Carlos, as they walking together into the 
           night.

           INT. BIO LAB - DAWN

           Kunle walks to the lab with Carlos. He notices...

           His cabinet. Someone has wedged the door closed with a FORK, 
           and closed it with some tape for good measure.

           Kunle takes this in. Looks down to see...

           Sean sitting on the ground, passed the fuck out. He stirs as 
           Kunle and Carlos approach. 

           He staggers to his feet. He's VERY drunk. 

                                 SEAN
                        You're alive!

                                 CARLOS
                        Yeah.

           Nobody's sure quite what to say. Sean almost trips, but 
           steadies himself.

                                 KUNLE
                        Looks like you had a legendary 
                        night after all.

                                 SEAN
                        ...How's Goldilocks?

                                 CARLOS
                        She should be okay.

           Kunle inspects the fridge closure.

                                 SEAN
                            (re: the fridge cabinet)
                        I tried to close it... I wasn't 
                        sure how to tell if mold is alive 
                        or not. 

           Kunle turns away from him. He goes to get a microscope from a 
           nearby shelf, starts setting it up.
                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        I ran into Bianca. She asked about 
                        you. I think she still wants your 
                        dick...

                                 KUNLE
                        Cool.

                                 SEAN
                        You gotta call her, man.

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah. I will.

           Carlos inches toward the door.

                                 CARLOS
                        I'm gonna... bathroom.

           He leaves Sean and Kunle alone.

                                 SEAN
                        So like, what happened after...

                                 KUNLE
                        Carlos drove us to the hospital, we 
                        got in a car chase with the cops--

                                 SEAN
                        You're fucking with me.

                                 KUNLE
                            (serious)
                        No.

                                 SEAN
                        Holy shit. Winnie the Pooh outran 
                        the cops!?

                                 KUNLE
                        You should be nice to him. He's a 
                        cool guy.

                                 SEAN
                        I know... I'm just. I'm sorry. I'm 
                        so sorry. For everything. Everyone 
                        always wants to know if they'll be 
                        the one to stand the fuck up when 
                        shit gets real. And now I know: I'm 
                        a little bitch. I'm sorry for 
                        saying your mold is dead. If it is, 
                        I'll tell Princeton it was my 
                        fault.
           05/30/20

           Beat.

                                 KUNLE
                        There was this moment tonight. I 
                        had to do CPR.

                                 SEAN
                        For real?

                                 KUNLE
                        Yeah. And the cops showed up, and 
                        this one officer had a gun... And 
                        all I could think was, I'm gonna 
                        die right now. For no fucking 
                        reason.
                            (beat)
                        But I didn't. Everything turned out 
                        okay. I'm just saying... I never 
                        want to feel that way again. I know 
                        why you left. And I don't blame 
                        you.

                                 SEAN
                        I'm sorry that happened to you, 
                        man.

                                 KUNLE
                        It's fine. Everyone's fine.

                                 SEAN
                        No. It's not fine. It's not fine.

           A long look between them. Suddenly, Kunle's on the verge of 
           tears. He tries to push it down, not wanting to cry in front 
           of Sean, of all people. 

           But, to his surprise, Sean hugs him. A warm, brotherly hug.

           A long beat. It's a nice hug.

                                 KUNLE
                        I really am sorry about the 
                        Legendary Tour.

                                 SEAN
                        It wasn't, like, about the parties. 
                        When I found out you were going to 
                        Princeton, I thought I should--

           Kunle pulls out of the hug.

                                 KUNLE
                        Wait, you knew?
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN
                        I found out before you did. I saw 
                        the big envelope in the mail--

                                 KUNLE
                        Why didn't you say anything?

                                 SEAN
                        Why didn't you say anything?? I was 
                        like fuck you! You're just gonna 
                        leave and never tell me? So I 
                        just... Everyone knows you're gonna 
                        be the fucking Barack Obama of 
                        fungus. You're gonna win a fuckin 
                        Nobel Prize, you're gonna have your 
                        own Wikipedia page. You're gonna 
                        leave here and none of this is even 
                        gonna even matter to you ten years 
                        from now. I know it's stupid, but I 
                        just thought if I could pull off a 
                        Legendary Tour and get us on the 
                        Hall of Firsts, it would like, 
                        prove... I don't know. Prove that 
                        we were both here. That we were... 
                        friends or some shit.

           Kunle looks Sean square in the eyes.

                                 KUNLE
                        Sean. We're still gonna be friends 
                        after we leave here... You're my 
                        best friend. Don't tell Carlos.

                                 SEAN
                        You're my best friend too.

                                 KUNLE
                        I was gonna tell you about 
                        Princeton... But I'm not even sure 
                        I want to go.

                                 SEAN
                        The fuck are you talking about, 
                        it's Princeton. You have to go--

                                 KUNLE
                        I don't know... I'd be moving so 
                        far away. And if I go somewhere 
                        where everyone's excellent, I'll 
                        probably be below average.

                                 SEAN
                        Kunle. Don't be a stupid idiot. 
                        You've gotta go. 
                                 (MORE)
           05/30/20

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        And I mean, I don't have a job, I 
                        don't have to live here. Maybe I'll 
                        look for something in... what state 
                        is Princeton in?

                                 KUNLE
                        New Jersey--

                         SEAN
           Ugh.
                                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                                          It's really not so bad. But 
                                          it's only an hour from Philly 
                                          and New York...

           The hug continues. It's nice.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        For the record, I think you could 
                        have a Wikipedia page someday. 
                        Finishing your thesis and 
                        graduating would help. You don't 
                        have to have it all figured out--

                                 SEAN
                        Shhh... No lectures.

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        Group hug!

           Out of nowhere, Carlos joins their hug, making it a group 
           hug. The three of them embrace. Beat. It becomes a little too 
           much and they all let go.

           INT. BIO LAB - MINUTES LATER

           Kunle puts a slide under a microscope.

           He looks. A suspenseful beat.

                                 KUNLE
                        It's... I think it's gonna be okay.

           They all breathe a sigh of relief.

                                 KUNLE (CONT'D)
                        I'm so tired.

                                 SEAN
                        I'm so hungry.

                                 CARLOS
                        I gotchu fam.

           Carlos hands Sean a granola bar from his fanny pack. Sean 
           eats it, grateful.
           05/30/20

           Kunle locks the cabinet properly this time, with the key. The 
           three of them leave together.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DAWN

           The sun rises over campus once more.

           Carlos, Sean, and Kunle walk down the sidewalk, passing some 
           Drunk Frat Boys on their walks of shame.

           They wander toward home together, tired yet content.

           INT. THE APARTMENT - A NEW DAY

           Sean, Kunle, and Carlos are gathered together on the couch, 
           playing a particularly intense game of JENGA.

           Kunle's PRINCETON CAKE lays out. Kunle cuts it, distributes 
           pieces to some guests:

           Rafael is here, as are Bianca and a few others.

           Sean clocks Bianca flirting with Kunle. Gives him a look 
           across the table.

           Someone knocks at the door. Kunle jumps up to get it...

           INT. THE APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           The door swings open. To Kunle's surprise, it's Maddy and 
           Emma. Awake, alert, and put together. Emma holds a large GIFT  *
           BASKET.

                                 MADDY
                        Hey. Is Carlos here?

                                 SEAN (O.S.)
                        WHO IS IT? IS IT PIZZA?

                                 KUNLE
                        CARLOS, COME HERE.

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        DO I HAVE TO?

                                 KUNLE
                        YES.

           A beat. Carlos appears at his shoulder. Oh.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma, this is Kunle and Carlos. 
                        They saved your life. 
                                 (MORE)
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        We don't want to intrude. We just 
                        had something to say...

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        Thank you so much for everything, 
                        for getting me to the hospital. And 
                        sorry for apparently breaking into 
                        your house and throwing up 
                        everywhere. So embarrassing.

                                 MADDY
                        I live literally two houses down 
                        from you guys, so she must have 
                        thought this was my place.

                                 GOLDILOCKS
                        That's what we think I thought, 
                        because honestly I don't remember 
                        anything.

           Emma laughs. Kunle and Carlos laugh along with her, a tinge 
           of anger simmering under the surface of their smiles.

                                 MADDY
                        We can pay for any rugs that need 
                        to be cleaned--

                         KUNLE
                                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
           It's cool. Hardwood floors.
                                          Or the car...

                                 KUNLE
                        It's all good. We're just glad 
                        you're better.

           A beat. Maddy wants to say something, but can't get it out. 
           It's starting to get awkward. She can't stall any longer.

                                 MADDY
                        Emma, why don't you go ahead, I 
                        need to talk to them for a minute.

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks so much again.

           Emma hands Carlos the gift basket, and leaves the three of 
           them alone.

                                 MADDY
                        I had something I wanted to say.

           She awkwardly takes out a prepared statement.
           05/30/20

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        Kunle, Carlos, I want to extend my 
                        deepest apologies for what 
                        transpired the other night. I am 
                        working on myself and what I put 
                        out into the world. I'm sorry you 
                        ended up bearing the burden of my 
                        responsibility to look after Emma. 
                        I'm sorry I yelled at you when you 
                        were trying to help. I'm sorry I 
                        tried to pepper spray you... 
                        Alright, this is weird.

           Maddy puts the letter away. She struggles to find the words.

                                 MADDY (CONT'D)
                        I know this isn't enough. I'm 
                        just... I really am sorry.
                            (long beat)
                        I never got a chance to thank you 
                        for saving Emma's life that night. 
                        She doesn't realize how close she 
                        was to actually fucking dying... So 
                        thank you. I know it won't fix 
                        things, but if there's ever 
                        anything I can do, like, if you 
                        want to get into pretty much any 
                        party, I can do that. Anytime.

                                 KUNLE
                        It's fine. We're cool.

                                 MADDY
                        Well, offer stands. You know where 
                        to find me. Two houses down.

           Maddy gives the guys one last apologetic look. She leaves. 
           Kunle shuts the door.

                                 CARLOS
                        "We're cool?" Are we though?

                                 SEAN
                        I mean, in a way you're lucky she 
                        was there.

           Reveal Sean's been watching from the doorway.

                                 SEAN (CONT'D)
                        In another timeline, we're at your 
                        funeral right now. If she hadn't 
                        been there yelling at the cops, it 
                        would've gone worse. They would've 
                        just killed you.
           05/30/20

                                 KUNLE
                        You don't know that.

                                 SEAN
                        Neither do you.

           Kunle turns this over in his mind. Carlos claps them both on 
           the backs. Sean and Carlos head back toward the party. 

           A beat. Kunle follows them into...

           THE APARTMENT - THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Where everyone else is happily gathered around the Jenga 
           tower, laughing, drinking. At ease. Kunle settles onto the 
           couch between Sean and Carlos.

                                 BIANCA
                        It's your turn, Kunle.

           He leans forward, reaches for his Jenga piece... The tower is 
           tall and full of holes. It's already wobbling...

           When he touches his block, a siren sounds outside, somewhere 
           in the distance. Kunle's smile falters at the sound. He can't  *
           relax, as the siren grows louder.

           A beat. Kunle reaches out, rests his block at the very top of  *
           the tower. He looks into camera, as the tower teeters 
           dangerously.

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                      THE END.

           MID-CREDITS CODA:

           INT. BLACK STUDENT UNION - HALL OF FIRSTS - DAY

           We see Kunle and Sean sneak into the Hall of Firsts at night 
           with a step ladder. They hang a plaque high, high up on the 
           wall, where nobody will notice....

           They leave, quick as they came. 

           A slow zoom in on the counterfeit plaque: a cute photo of 
           Kunle and Sean (with Carlos photobomb) that says FIRST MEN TO 
           SNEAK THEMSELVES INTO THE HALL OF FIRSTS.
