                        "During the early years of the Cold War, 
                        the United States and the Soviet Union 
                        had two ways to deploy their nuclear 
                        arsenal -- from the ground and from the 
                        air. But that changed in the 1960s..." 

           FADE IN:

           EXT./ESTAB. SOVIET NAVAL BASE - PATROPAVLOSK - NIGHT

           The middle of nowhere. That's by design -- this is the 
           Headquarters for the Soviet Union's Pacific Fleet. 

                                 "February 24, 1968"

           Torpedoes and ballistic missiles are loaded onto a 300 foot 
           long Soviet nuclear sub--

           -- The K-129. 

           As Soviet sailors head inside, A YOUNG SAILOR lingers, 
           savoring the last cigarette that he'll enjoy for months.

           AN OFFICER confiscates the sailor's cigarettes, yells at him 
           to get on the sub.  Once he's gone, the Officer lights up a 
           confiscated cigarette.

                      constantly shift the locations of nuclear 
                      weapons that could single-handedly wipe 
                      out U.S. and Soviet cities..."

           EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT

           The K-129 descends beneath the water as it leaves the harbor. 

           INT. BRIDGE - K-129 - LATER

           As the sailors go about their business, the RADIOMAN sends an 
           encrypted message: 

           "Systems Normal. Will report in two weeks."

           INT. SOVIET NAVAL WATCH COMMAND - DAY

                      Chyron:  "Two Weeks Later... March 8, 1968"

           A Young Signalman scans through different radio frequencies, 
           searching for any message from the K-129. Nothing.

                                                            CUT TO:

           SHOTS OF SOVIET SHIPS -- NAVAL AND CIVILIAN -- 

           -- patrolling the K-129's path in the international waters of 
           the Pacific Ocean. The CAPTAINS radio each other that they're 
           not finding any trace of her. 

           The SCREEN splits. 

           The Soviet ships shift to the LEFT HALF. 

           THE RIGHT HALF shows: THE US NAVAL TRACKING STATION-- 

           -- as A YOUNG US SIGNALMAN spins the radio dial, picking up the 
           Soviet Captains' chatter. NAVAL OFFICERS hover next to him. 

                                 YOUNG US SIGNALMAN
                        I've never seen this, where they're 
                        talking over open channels so... 
                        openly. I think... I think they 
                        lost the K-129. 

           On his superiors' stunned expressions, 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC - DAY & NIGHT

           Over the next months, the Soviet ships slowly disappear one 
           by one -- giving up the search. And when the last one 
           vanishes, 

           THE CAMERA LOWERS BENEATH THE OCEAN, until it finds --

           -- "A FISH."
           Not a real one. This one is an aluminum mini-sub full of 
           audio-video surveillance gear, including a camera that is 
           capturing photos of the ocean's floor. 

           The "fish" is being towed by--

           -- THE USS HALIBUT. 

           The Navy's spy sub. It's distinguished by a giant hump on the 
           front of it, affectionately known as--

           -- THE BAT CAVE. 

           Filled with all sorts of hi-tech equipment, including -- 

           -- A DARK ROOM.

           A SAILOR shuffles through thousands of the "fish's" photos. 

           Stops. Can barely make out what looks like, what could be... 

           ... A SUB'S SAIL (the tower-like structure on the top of the sub).

           The sailor jumps up, flings open the darkroom door, races out-- 

           -- and runs into a closed door because his eyes haven't 
           adjusted to the light.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME TIME

           Chyrons identify: 

           - CAPTAIN JIM BRADLEY (Naval Intelligence). He's the Navy's 
           Chief Spy. Mid 30s. His coiled-spring personality at odds 
           with his genteel Southern accent. 

           - DR. JOHN PINA CRAVEN (Navy's top scientist). And smartest -- 
           according to him. 

           They stand in front of easels that are filled with a photo 
           collage of the K-129. 

           They're excited; the smartest kids in class presenting their 
           latest science report to their favorite teacher. The 
           "teacher" is--

           -- REAR ADMIRAL THOMAS MOORER (Chief of Naval Operations). 
           Admiral Moorer (40s) is a towering and voluble personality. 
           Rarely have to guess what's on his mind. 

                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                           (comes closer)
                        Look at it! Just sitting there, 
                        waiting for us to come and get her.  
                           (looks back)
                        And the Russians have no idea we've 
                        found her?

                                 CRAVEN
                           (shakes head "no")
                        Speaking of retrieval, sir... we've 
                        come up with a plan. 

           Craven places photos and drawings of their retrieval plan on 
           the easels.  Moorer leans in...

                                 CRAVEN
                        We'll use a remote controlled mini-
                        sub to go down to the target--
                           (flips the drawings)
                        -- then we'll employ small 
                        explosive charges to gain access to 
                        the sub-- 

                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                        Wait, what?  You're gonna blow a 
                        hole in the sub? 

                                 CRAVEN
                        Just a small one to gain access--

                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                        But I want the whole damn sub! 
                        Those Commie bastards got the whole 
                        damn Pueblo! 

           Craven and Bradley exchange looks as they face every military 
           officer's worst fear -- how to explain a plan to somebody 
           with a lower IQ, but a higher rank. 

                                 BRADLEY
                        Sir, the Pueblo was a surface 
                        ship that was boarded by the 
                        North Koreans. This is a sub 
                        three miles down.

                                 CRAVEN
                        It's impractical, if not 
                        impossible, to bring a sub up from 
                        those depths. 
                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                        Well, what is it? Impractical or 
                        impossible? 

                                 BRADLEY 
                        Sir, I think what John is trying to 
                        say is that the best way for us to 
                        proceed is to remove selected 
                        material-- 

                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                        "Selected material?!" We've got a 
                        chance to pull off the biggest 
                        intelligence coup of the Cold War 
                        and you want to think small? 
                           (glares at them)
                        I want everything... Nuclear 
                        missiles, logs, cryptographic 
                        codebooks. I don't want bacon, 
                        gentlemen. I want the whole damn 
                        pig! 

           As he storms out, he tells an AIDE:

           Empty except for walls of chalkboards and one person... 

           DAVE SHARP. Late 30s, but still gets checked out by the 
           female undergrads. His dry sense of humor (mostly) masks his 
           intensity.

           The chalkboards are filled with equations. Hours, if not 
           days, of work. Dave stares at them...

           ... then erases it all. Not angry, just methodical. 
           He restarts, chalking numbers and equations. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Christ Almighty!  I thought you 
                        were supposed to be smart!  

           Dave turns, is stunned to be facing --

           -- JOHN PARANGOSKY. (Assistant Deputy Director of Science & 
           Technology for the CIA.) 

           "JP" to friends and foes (often the same person). Mid 40s. 
           Dressed, as always, in a tailored suit. He's short; with a 
           physique that betrays his strong affection for French 
           cuisine. A lifelong bachelor, the CIA is his wife and 
           mistress.

                                 JP
                        I've got a job for you.

           On Dave's stunned expression,

                        ocean engineering.

           JP shakes his head, annoyed (his default attitude).

                        Nobody at the Company does.  But

           JP stops talking as a WAITRESS deposits a couple greasy

                        That they're doing noble work?

                                 JP
                        Those that can, do.  Those that 
                        can't, teach.

           JP grins as his target finds its mark. 

                                 JP
                        Listen, we both know you're going 
                        to do this because it's your way

                        that you're not that stupid hick 
                        from the sticks of Kentucky.  Isn't 
                        that what your teacher said?    
                           (off Dave's look, smiles)
                        God, I love psych evals.  

           As he walks off:

                                 JP
                        See you Monday.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm not doing it.  

           JP ignores Dave, knows he's got him.

           EXT./ESTAB. SUBURBAN HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           David pulls up in his boxy Chevy Impala, to what, up until a 
           couple months ago, was his house.  As he walks up the 
           driveway, sees his son WILLIAM (10) shooting baskets.  He's 
           his father's son -- his shot is efficient and repeatable. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        'Member, keep that elbow in.  

           William runs over, hugs his dad.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Ready for a big weekend?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Does a bear crap in the woods?

           Dave laughs; the one good thing about only seeing your kid on 
           the weekend is that they constantly surprise you.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Where'd you hear that?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        School.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        You're gonna love military school.
                           (they smile)
                        Your mom inside?
           William nods.  As Dave walks in, calls out to William.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Hey... a bear craps anywhere he wants.   

           As William grins, 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Dave walks in, greets his ex-wife GAIL (30s; childhood 
           sweetheart from Kentucky) with a kiss on the cheek.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Thanks for keeping him last night.

                                 GAIL
                           (nods)
                        I needed to get my clock cleaned in 
                        Monopoly anyway.  I hope he doesn't 
                        grow up to be a banker.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        My money's on philosopher.
                           (off her confused look)
                        Inside joke.   

           Gail stands back, appraising Dave.   

                                 GAI
                        What's going on?  You're like 
                        vibrating-- 

           She realizes that can only mean one thing.  And she's not 
           happy about it:

                                 GAIL
                        What's JP want?  

           He thinks about denying it, but she knows him too well. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        It's just brainstorming something 
                        for a couple months.  Tops.  
                           (beat)
                        I haven't said "yes".  

           She scoffs, wipes chalk dust out of his hair.   
                                 GAIL
                        Spend all night in your lab, Dave?    
                        Thinking on this thing you haven't 
                        said "yes" to?
                           (no response)
                        And I'm sure it's so part-time that 
                        it'll allow you to keep teaching.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm not a professor.  

                                 GAIL
                        Really?  'Cause your paycheck says 
                        otherwise.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        This is my way back in.  

                                 GAIL
                           (laughs)
                        Back into what?  Twenty hour days? 
                        Never seeing your family? Stress-
                        induced health problems? 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        It's not gonna be like Oxcart.  

                                 GAIL
                        Good.  Because you don't have your 
                        marriage to sacrifice anymore.  

           She glances outside at William -- the one relationship that 
           he still has to sacrifice.   

                                 GAIL
                        You guys should get going.  Enjoy 
                        what little time you have left--

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Gail--

                                 GAIL
                        I meant this weekend.   

           She did (and didn't).  As she walks out, Dave calls after 
           her:

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm just thinking about it.

           Like JP, she doesn't look back.  Knows that he's doing it.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT. GENERIC OFFICE BUILDING - TYSON'S CORNER, VA - DAY 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AKA "THINK TANK" - SAME TIME

           Dave and his team of eight engineers.  Watching--

           DR. EARNEST RUGGLES. Late 20s.  Optimistic and excitable -- 
           he's a golden retriever in human form.  Living out his 
           childhood dream of working for the CIA (even if it is as an 
           engineer).

           Ruggles enthusiastically pitches an idea (with diagrams):

                                 RUGGLES
                        ... we use mini-subs to attach 
                        booster rockets to the sub, which 
                        will raise it up. 

           He mimes the sub being raised theatrically. 

           DR. JACK SPARKMAN (40s; a chain-smoking cynic) interjects: 

                                 SPARKMAN
                           (sarcastic and skeptical)
                        Like Lazarus? 

                                 RUGGLES
                           (not getting either)
                        Exactly. 

           Everybody looks at Dave, who rolls a mini-basketball between 
           his hands as he thinks.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Interesting.  But even if we could 
                        get it to the surface, how could we 
                        keep it up there? 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Uh, I'm working on that. 

                                 SPARKMAN 
                        I know! 
                           (they all look at him)
                        Jesus will keep it on the surface. 

                                 RUGGLES
                           (harsh profanity for him)
                        Screw you, Jack.

                                 SPARKMAN
                        That's religious persecution.
                                 RUGGLES
                        You know, at least, I'm trying 
                        here. 

                                 SPARKMAN
                        Hey, I've got a lot of great ideas. 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Name one!

                                 SPARKMAN
                           (thinks, then:)
                        I think we should break for lunch.

           The other engineers all cheer.  Sparkman stands, takes a bow.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           MCDONALDS WRAPPERS

           Cover the conference table.  Dave and team sit in silence.

           CHINESE TO-GO CONTAINERS

           On the table.  Complete SILENCE.  Hit (yet) another wall. 

                      "Three months (and lots of take-out) later"

           Sparkman balances chopsticks on his nose. Ruggles stares at 
           the ceiling tiles. 

                                 JP (O.S.)
                        What the hell is going on here?! 

           JP strides in, aghast at the inactivity. 

                                 JP
                        Besides nothing?!
                           (to Ruggles)
                        How many? 
                                 RUGGLES
                        How many... what, sir? 

                                 JP
                        Ceiling tiles! How many god damn 
                        ceiling tiles are up there! 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Uh... a hundred-and-thirty-nine... 
                        and a half--

                                 JP
                        Great! Thank you! I'm sure the American 
                        people will be happy to know that after 
                        sixteen weeks, some of the country's 
                        greatest engineering minds finally 
                        figured out that there are a hundred-and-
                        thirty-nine ceiling tiles in an office 
                        building in Tyson's Corner, Virginia!

           A beat. 

                                 RUGGLES
                        And a half. 

                                 JP
                        What? 

                                 RUGGLES
                           (a hesitation)
                        A hundred-and-a-thirty-nine and a half. 

           JP doesn't even know what to say to that. Turns to Dave. 

                                 JP 
                        You might want to start shopping 
                        for one of those sport coats with 
                        patches on the elbows.

           He storms out. Silence. Sparkman points to the ceiling. 

                                 SPARKMAN
                        That's actually more like two-thirds.

           The engineers all crack up, minus Dave -- he's worried that 
           JP's right.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - VIRGINIA BEACH PIER - DAY 

           Families stroll in, ready for a fun Saturday. David and 
           William are among them.  But one thing makes them different:
           Dave carries a stack of thick technical textbooks. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Alright, what are the rules again?   

                                 WILLIAM
                        Check in every twenty minutes.  

           Dave hands him a ten dollar bill.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        And?

                                 WILLIAM
                        And don't tell Mom you worked. 

           Dave forks over another ten dollar bill.  

           PICNIC AREA - LATER

           David's engrossed in one of his books.  Suddenly, he looks 
           up.  Checks his watch.  Realizes William hasn't checked in.

           He jumps up, but he doesn't panic. Instead he goes to the 
           entrance and starts working his way through the park 
           methodically -- front to back.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (calling out)
                        William!  William!

           Nothing.  Now he starts to panic.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        William!--

           He stops, sees him in the Penny Arcade.  William's oblivious, 
           engrossed in an arcade claw game.  

           Dave goes to him.  Kisses the top of his head.   Watches as  
           William manipulates the joystick, lining up the claw above 
           the largest stuffed animal.  

           He hits the button, the claw drops, and scoops up its prize.

           On Dave's open-mouthed stare,

                        A god damn kids arcade game?!  
                        That's your brilliant idea.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        The math pencils out--

                        Well, maybe we need a new pencil.   
                           (beat)
                        Or better yet, a new lead engineer.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        This is the best idea.  The only 
                        real idea that we've been able to 
                        come up with after six months.  

           He waits for JP to bite his head off.  When he doesn't:

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        There's an ocean drilling company 
                        out in LA, Global Marine.  They 
                        have the technology to do this.  
                        Their chief naval engineer, John 
                        Graham, he's the best in the field.   

           JP hesitates for a beat, then reluctantly:

                                 JP
                        Alright, we'll go out and see what 
                        they have to say.

           He waves Dave away, but Dave doesn't leave.  

                                 JP
                        What?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        There's just one problem.   

           off JP's expression,

           INT. OFFICE - GLOBAL MARINE - SAME TIME

           CURTIS CROOKE (40s) is dressed casually with longish hair -- 
           the epitome of California living. 
           He's the VP of Global Marine -- smart enough to talk 
           engineering with his engineers, charming enough to convince 
           potential clients to write the company large checks...

           ... which is what he's doing right now. 

                                 CURTIS 
                           (to TWO POTENTIAL CLIENTS)
                        ... our technology is cutting edge--

                                 SECRETARY (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Excuse me, Mr. Crooke. But I have a 
                        gentleman who is saying he needs to 
                        see you immediately about a job.

                                 CURTIS
                        Tell him I'm with clients and that 
                        I'll get back to him.
                           (to Clients)
                        I did not tell her to say that.
                           (they all laugh)
                        As I was saying-- 

                                 SECRETARY (OVER INTERCOM)
                        He won't give his name. 

                                 CURTIS
                        Tell him to call back after lunch.
                           (to clients)
                        Where was I?--

                           (also concerned)
                        Perhaps we should reschedule.

           CURTIS' OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           JP and Dave walk in.  JP immediately shuts the door.  

                                 CURTIS
                           (annoyed)
                        Who are you? 

           JP ignores him, goes over to the windows. Pulls the blinds.
                                 CURTIS
                           (buzzes intercom)
                        Sarah, call security--

                                 JP
                        I'm John Parangosky. And this is 
                        Dave Sharp.  We work for the CIA. 

                                 CURTIS
                           (into intercom)
                        Forget about security.
                           (to JP)
                        The CIA, as in the Central 
                        Intelligence Agency? 

                                 JP
                        No. The Culinary Institute of America. 
                        How were your eggs this morning?
                           (hands Curtis a piece of paper)
                        This is an NDA that says you're 
                        committing treason if you divulge 
                        anything I'm about to tell you.

           Curtis is unsure whether to sign it. Curiosity wins out. 
           After he signs:  

                                 JP
                        How's John Graham's drinking? 

                                 CURTIS
                           (thrown)
                        How'd--
                           (realizes who JP works for)
                        John hasn't had a drink in eight 
                        years--

                                 JP
                        How do you know that?

                                 CURTIS
                        Because he told me. 

           JP scoffs.  Curtis gets offended.  

                                 CURTIS
                        And because in the eight years he's 
                        been here I've never seen him 
                        exhibit any signs of being under 
                        the influence of anything other 
                        than nicotine and caffeine.  That's  
                        how I know.  

           JP thinks for a beat, then hits the intercom.  
                                 JP
                        Sarah, get John Graham in here. 

           Curtis is getting annoyed at the questions and JP's 
           presumption.  

                                 CURTIS
                           (points to NDA)
                        I signed this thing.  So how about 
                        telling me why the hell you chased 
                        fifty million dollars of business 
                        out of my office?

                                 SECRETARY (OVER INTERCOM)
                        They say he's out.  

                                 JP (INTO INTERCOM)
                        It's three PM.  Where is he?

                        CURTIS
                                            SECRETARY (OVER INTERCOM)
                                          They said he's sailing.
           He's probably down at the 
           shipyard--

           JP looks at Curtis.  

                                 CURTIS
                        He likes to work out problems on 
                        his boat.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Well, at least he's not at a bar.

           JP doesn't see the humor.   

                                 CURTIS
                        We can always do this another time--

                                 JP
                           (sitting down)
                        We'll wait.   

           Exactly what Curtis was afraid of.

           INT. JOHN GRAHAM'S OFFICE - GLOBAL MARINE - DAY

           JOHN GRAHAM (50s) walks into his office, clutching a 
           cigarette in one hand, a coffee in the other.  A one-two 
           punch that he's perfected so well that he can drink the 
           coffee without removing the cigarette.  
           John's brilliant, but gruff.  He graduated top of his class 
           at MIT. (And didn't receive one vote for "Most Personable.")  

           John goes over to his drafting table, which is covered with 
           plans for his latest ship, but also with napkins and odd bits 
           of paper on which he's jotted down notes or drawings.  

           His secretary CANDY GILLETTE (late 20s) comes in.  Tough and 
           pretty (and there are many men at work who've made the 
           mistake of reversing those two attributes).  

           Her pay-stub might read "secretary" but she sees her job as 
           John Graham's protector. 

                                 CANDY
                        Curtis has been calling non-stop, 
                        says he needs you up in his office 
                        as soon as you get back.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Uh-huh.  

           He doesn't look up.  Continues drawing.

           INT. CURTIS' OFFICE - NIGHT

           John Graham strolls in, notices JP and Dave.  

                                 JP
                        How was your sail?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Delightful.
                           (to Curtis)
                        Who the hell is this?

                                 JP
                        We're from the CIA.  Sign this.

           As JP hands him the papers, he sniffs at Graham, seeing if he 
           smells of alcohol. Detecting nothing, JP hands him a pen.  

           Graham looks at Curtis, who nods.  Graham signs the papers. 

           Curtis finally gets to ask the question he's been dying to 
           ask for the past four hours:

                                 CURTIS
                        So, how can Global Marine help you 
                        gentlemen?   
                                 JP
                        We need you to vet a...
                           (still doesn't like this)
                        ... plan that we've come up with.   

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (surprised)
                        Why the hell's the CIA's getting 
                        into the ocean drilling business?  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        We're not.  We're going to pick up 
                        a nuclear-armed Russian sub from 
                        the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.  

           As Curtis and John Graham exchange a look of disbelief, 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           INT.  CURTIS' OFFICE - LATER

           Dave finishing his briefing.  Leans back.  Waits for John and 
           Curtis to recognize his brilliance:

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        It'll never work--

                                 JP
                        Jesus!  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        It will.  The math works.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Yeah, sure if your assumptions are 
                        made without the benefit of a day 
                        spent at sea.

           He waits for Dave to contradict him, but of course he can't.  

           Dave gets the sense that, for the first time in a long time, 
           he's not the smartest guy in the room.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (begrudgingly)
                        Though the underlying idea, a grunt 
                        lift, is sound.  In fact, it's the 
                        only possible way to do it.  

           The begrudging tone is because he has a hard time when a 
           great idea doesn't originate in his brain.
                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (brightens)
                        Okay, so what would we need to 
                        change?  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Alright, first off, you'd need pipe 
                        string that has a cross section of... 

           He pulls out a a bar napkin from his pocket.  Starts jotting 
           down computations on it.

                                 JP
                           (sotto to Dave)
                        A bar napkin?--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        -- of about 160 square inches.  Problem 
                        is that'd have to be custom-built.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Okay.  What else?  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        None of our ships can handle that 
                        pipe string or the weight you're 
                        gonna be pulling up.   

                                 JP
                        Whose can?  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Nobody.  You're going to have to 
                        build a ship.

           INT. CAR - LOS ANGELES - LATER

           Post-meeting.  Dave and JP sit in the back of a car.  Dave is 
           excited; sees the meeting as a win.  JP stews.  Then:

                                 JP
                        When you brief ExCom, let's not bring 
                        up the fact that Graham's an alcoholic--

           Dave doesn't care.  He's thrilled to be back in the game, in

           Dave, JP, along with DICK HELMS (CIA Director) and CARL 
           DUCKETT (Assistant Director for Science & Technology) present 
           their plans to-- 

           -- THE EXCOM, a committee that advises the president on all 
           intelligence matters. It's populated by some of the most 
           powerful people in the country, and chaired by arguably the 
           most powerful -- HENRY KISSINGER. 

           As everyone drinks coffee and munches on pastries, Dave 
           stands, makes the presentation with a slide-show.  (Dave is 
           sharp, confident.  No trace of the guy in the bathroom.)   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        ... Global Marine will build the ship.

           SLIDE -- a mock-up of the ship John Graham came up with.  And 
           it's the strangest ship you've ever seen -- it has a huge 
           moon pool in the middle (essentially a hole in the middle of 
           its bottom) and a giant derrick in the middle.
                                 ADMIRAL MOORER
                        Impressive. 

           Moorer's title is chyroned -- Chief of Naval Operations. But 
           then "former" appears in front of his title. Then his new 
           title is chyroned -- Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   

           Other participants are not as impressed. Especially--

           -- ADMIRAL ELMO ZUMWALT (Current Chief of Naval Operations). 
           He's mid 40s and a Navy man through-and-through (he's rumored 
           to hum "Anchors Aweigh" when he makes love to his wife). 

           He puts down his coffee mid-sip -- what the hell kind of ship 
           is that?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Lockheed, who we've had great success 
                        with in the past, will build the 
                        barge and then construct the Capture 
                        Vehicle in the barge.  

           SLIDES -- A huge BARGE (it's covered; resembles a floating 
           soundstage) and the CAPTURE VEHICLE (CV), which does look 
           like a giant version of a kids' claw game.  

           NOTE: All the slides show how incredibly unique, cool, and 
           complicated this heist will be.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        The capture vehicle, enclosed in 
                        the barge, will then be towed to 
                        Catalina Island, where it will be 
                        submerged... 

           SLIDES -- show the barge submerge.  Then its roof retracts.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        ... The capture vehicle will then 
                        be transferred into the ship, 
                        invisible to the outside world.   

           ZUMWALT'S HORROR -- increases with each passing slide.

           SLIDES -- as the bottom of the ship hovers over the open 
           barge.  The ship's bottom opens and the CV is transferred 
           into it.  It's an impressive magic trick.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Based on meteorological data, we'll 
                        have an eight week period in the late 
                        summer months where the seas will be 
                        calm enough for us to operate.

                        capture vehicle is lowered, via custom-
                        built pipe string, three miles down to 
                        the K-129.  

           SLIDES -- as the Capture Vehicle (CV) hovers over the sub; 
           the CV's sixteen giant tines (each 60 feet long) spread out. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        The tines will then be driven into 
                        the seabed and enclose the sub.

                        Let me get this straight. The CIA 
                        wants to build a ship, even though 
                        they've never built one. And they 
                        want us, the US Navy -- whose job 
                        is to literally build and operate 
                        ships, to pay for it?!

                        I think there are just too many 
                        unknowns, too many variables.

                                 SECRETARY OF STATE
                           (sotto)
                        And too many dollars.   

           Murmurs of assent from other members.  Zumwalt seems 
           relieved.  The CIA team is disappointed -- except for Dave, 
           who is crushed.  

           Everyone looks at Kissinger, assuming he'll drive the stake 
           through the heart.  Then--

           BAM!  A hand slams down on the conference table.  Belongs to:
                                 REAR ADMIRAL MOORER
                        What the hell are we doing?!  We 
                        have a chance to land a decisive 
                        blow in the Cold War, to finally 
                        tilt the balance of power toward 
                        good for good! 
                           (beat)
                        Is it bold? Yes! Thank God! Because 
                        gentlemen, we're dealing with an enemy 
                        who is bold enough to have the North 
                        Koreans commandeer one of our ships.  
                        In international waters! 
                           (looks around)
                        Is it expensive?  Hell yes! But if 
                        you think it's too expensive, then 
                        I ask you, how much would you be 
                        willing to pay to get a fully armed 
                        Soviet submarine?!

           Silence.  Then: 

                                 KISSINGER
                           (inscrutable)
                        I'll take it to the President.

                        No clue. But if I'm ever on trial 
                        for murder, I want Moorer giving 
                        the closing argument. 

           They laugh.

                        Hello?

           Spartans would consider the apartment minimalist.  Dave 
           dribbles a basketball, phone to his ear.  (INTERCUT with JP 
           at his home, making an elaborate sandwich).

                                 JP
                        Congratulations.  You convinced them 
                        to fund the most audacious covert 
                        operation the United States has ever 
                        attempted...    

           Dave pumps his fist.

                                 JP 
                        ... audacious enough to cost anyone 
                        and everyone associated with it 
                        their jobs if it doesn't work.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Don't worry, JP.  I'm not going to 
                        let you down.   

                                 JP
                        Thank you for that reassurance.  
                        I'm sure that I can throw out my 
                        sleeping pills now.  

           JP takes a big bite of his sandwich.

                           (through full mouth)
                        The one wrinkle is that the Navy 
                        wants to run the recovery.  Says we 
                        don't know the difference between 
                        the stern and the bow.  And since I 
                        had to look it up, can't argue with 
                        them.   So we're going to build the 
                        ship and the components, test them, 
                        and then hand it over.   

                                 DAVE SHARP 
                        When do we start?  

                                 JP 
                        You move out to LA next week.

                        Me?  JP, I told you, I can't 
                        relocate--

                                 JP
                        And I don't trust that drunk John 
                        Graham.  So I want someone I do 
                        trust with their boots on the 
                        ground out there.  And if it's not 
                        you, Professor, let me know so I 
                        can find somebody else.   

           As Dave agonizes over the decision:

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - GAIL'S HOUSE - DAY

           Taking a break from their hoops game, Dave informs his son 
           William about his decision.  William's now 12 -- he still 
           sees his father as his hero, but the worship is not 
           unconditional. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        ... it actually won't be that 
                        different.  I'll be coming back 
                        every other weekend--   

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll see you half as often as I see 
                        you now.  How is that not 
                        different?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I don't like it either, and I 
                        wouldn't have to go if it wasn't 
                        important.  You understand that, 
                        right?

           William nods.  He does get that. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        How long will you be gone?

           court.  Smiling, arms around each other.   

           Dave puts the photo in his wallet -- the time for 
           sentimentality over -- and pulls out some work.

                      "Summa Corp Deep Ocean Mining Headquarters"

           A taxi pulls up.  Dave, Sparkman, and Ruggles emerge.  Under 
           Dave a chyron appears with his cover title:  "Director of 
           Recovery - Summa Corp Deep Ocean Mining".

           INT. SUMMA CORP HQ- MINUTES LATER

           The public office of the cover story. Filled with EMPLOYEES 
           who are "building" the world's first ocean mining company.  

           Dave and group are led through the office by a burly 
           mustachieo'd guy in his late 40s. This is STEVE CRAIG. 

           Steve's former LAPD and a current CIA contractor / fixer. His 
           could-give-two-shits attitude separates him from the CIA 
           lifers. 

           A chyron gives us his cover title: "Office Manager - Summa 
           Corp Deep Ocean Mining".  

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        So how was the flight? 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Ah, the turbulence over the Rockies 
                        was awful. And we were fighting the 
                        jet stream the whole way. And--

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Yeah, don't really care. Just making 
                        small talk to cover the walk.

           He leads them into A REMOTE OFFICE. 

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        And here's our good friend Harvey 
                        Wallbanger. 
           He pushes open a couple metal storage cabinets, revealing a 
           secret staircase. 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Whoa... that is so cool. 

           Sparkman shakes his head at Ruggles' gee-whiz attitude. But 
           as the others head down the staircase, Sparkman lingers and 
           checks out the hidden passageway. 

                                 SPARKMAN
                           (under his breath)
                        Bitchin'.

           As the group heads down the staircase, Steve and Dave's real 
           jobs are chyroned:  "Head of Security - Azorian Program" and 
           "Director of Recovery - Azorian Program".

           They enter an unmarked door, revealing --

           THE HIDDEN OFFICE SPACE. 

                          "Azorian West Coast Program Office"

           Steve gives the quick tour.  Points to VAULTED ROOM.  

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Secure comms in there, including 
                        the Donald Duck phone. 

                                 RUGGLES
                        Why do they call it the Donald Duck 
                        phone? 

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Because it makes your voice sound 
                        like Mickey Mouse.

                                 RUGGLES
                        Then why do they call it the Donald 
                        Duck phone?

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                           (sotto)
                        Wow. I'm feeling even better than I 
                        was yesterday about you guys 
                        getting that sub. 
                           (shakes head; points)
                        Bathroom's there-- gotta jiggle the 
                        handle.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Where's John Graham's office?

                        Down the hall, but he's at the 
                        shipyard.   

           Candy walks up, introduces herself.  

                                 CANDY
                        Hi, I'm Candy, his secretary. 

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        And his tamer.  But most 
                        importantly, Candy's the organizer 
                        of our weekly volleyball game.

                                 CANDY
                        Well, we all have to do our part to 
                        keep our part to keep the world 
                        safe for democracy.  
                           (scrutinizes Dave)
                        So you're Dave Sharp?
                           (he nods)
                        Huh. You don't look like a total 
                        asshole.

                        First impressions are often 
                        misleading. 

           Everyone but Dave laughs.

                                 CANDY
                        Nice to meet you all.  

           As she walks away:

                        I love California.  

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        I'll get you set up in your offices 
                        and then, Dave, I got a little 
                        surprise for you.

           Dave and his team admire a convertible Corvette.
                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        JP wanted to get you a Pinto to save 
                        money, but I convinced him that the 
                        head of a Hughes division wouldn't be 
                        caught dead driving a Pinto. 

           Dave climbs in.  Turns it on.  Revs the engine.

                        What do I get?

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Which one are you again?

           Everyone but Sparkman laughs.

                        excited we are to be working with 
                        our new partner, Howard Hughes, on 
                        his latest adventure.  

           It gets pin-drop silent for a beat, then the reporters 
           EXPLODE with questions about Hughes.

           As JP, Walt, and Duckett eat lunch they flip through 
           newspapers and magazines trumpeting Hughes' latest adventure.   

           In the photos, there's a scaled-down version of the machine 
           that Howard Hughes is going to use to scoop up manganese 
           nodules (it looks like a giant vacuum cleaner).

           ONE OF THOSE ARTICLES

           being cut out of the newspaper with an exacto knife.  The 
           knife wielder is:  

           ANATOLIY SHTYROV (40s; Analyst -- Underwater Espionage for 
           the Soviet Union's Pacific Fleet).  Shtyrov chomps an apple 
           as he  pins the article to a BULLETIN BOARD. 

           Shtyrov is an iconoclast.  His nickname is "Moodozvon" 
           (Russian for "wacko"). And he's probably the smartest person 
           in the Russian Navy, but his inability / refusal to play 
           office politics has guaranteed that he will never get a dacha 
           or earn a promotion. 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL that the bulletin board is filled with other 
           articles about the venture.   Words are highlighted in 
           various articles:  "North Pacific", "ocean floor", "one-of-a-
           kind ship".

           Shtyrov steps back, stares at the board.   As he finishes the 
           apple (core and all), go--  

           -- OUTSIDE SHTYROV'S OFFICE WINDOW

           His is the only light on in the building.  Like Dave Sharp, 
           Shtyrov's also a bit of an obsessive.

           INT. ANTEROOM OF JOHN GRAHAM'S OFFICE - WCPO - DAY

           Dave waits outside with Candy, John's secretary.  They can 
           hear John ARGUING with somebody in his office.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Who's he meeting with?

                                 CANDY
                        His eleven o'clock.  

           He gives her a look -- that's helpful.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Well, would you do me a favor and tell 
                        him that his twelve o'clock would 
                        prefer not to become his one o'clock?

                                 CANDY
                        Oh, he knows you're here.  

           Annoyed, he taps his foot on the floor.  Candy can't help but 
           smile.  

                                 CANDY
                        Could I get you another cup of 
                        coffee?  Decaf perhaps?  

           As he gives her a look, the door bursts open and John's #2 
           SHERM WHETMORE (40s; the build and temperament of a bouncer) 
           storms out.  John waves Dave in.

           Filled with drawings and models of the Hughes Glomar 
           Explorer, the ship he's in charge of building.   

           Dave walks in, taking inventory of the space and John, who 
           looks stressed and fidgets with a small piece of metal.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        What's that?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        A small piece of metal.
                           (beat)
                        Glad I could clear that up for you.   
           He stands, gestures to the door.  Dave doesn't move.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        John, I've been doing some 
                        calculations on the roll 
                        stabilization.  And I’ve got some 
                        concerns.   

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        I don’t.
                           (calls through door)
                        Candy, how we making out on that 
                        coffee?   

           Candy comes in, curtsies.  

                                 CANDY
                           (sarcastic British accent)
                        Here you are, M'lord.

           John laughs as he takes the coffee.   

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Take a seat.  Dave was just telling 
                        me how to build a ship.  
                        Fascinating stuff.  

           Candy sits.  Dave's annoyed, but soldiers on.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I was suggesting that we need to 
                        increase the roll stabilization to 
                        eight-and-a-half degrees. 

           He pulls a thick report out of his briefcase.  Puts it on 
           John's desk.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        As I point out in my report--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        The roll's fine at eight.  

           Dave shakes his head, takes back the report.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Should I throw this away or do you 
                        want to?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (shrugs)
                        Up to you.
           Dave looks like he's going to leap across the desk.  Candy 
           tries to play peacemaker:

                                 CANDY
                        Don't take it personally.  John's 
                        too obstinate and egotistical to 
                        take suggestions from anyone.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        She's right.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (loses it)
                        Well maybe he should!  Because then 
                        maybe we'd have the damn keel laid 
                        like we're supposed to. And maybe I 
                        wouldn't be getting my ass reamed 
                        out by JP because we're behind 
                        schedule--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (innocently)
                        Maybe you should hire somebody else 
                        then.

           Dave shakes his head at John's ace in the hole.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        We can't, John.  As you well know.

           He paces.  Hates the power dynamic between them.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm not the enemy, John.  And I'm 
                        concerned about you--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (scoffs)
                        You've got plenty to be concerned 
                        with.  Your capture vehicle, the 
                        pipe string-- 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        You look like hell--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        If you think I'm drinking again, 
                        stop beating around the bush and 
                        just ask me!

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Are you drinking?   
                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        That's a personal question--

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Oh god--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Listen, I haven't had a drink in 
                        twenty-nine-hundred-and-sixteen

                        tonight that I can make it to 
                        twenty-nine-hundred-and-seventeen.  
                        But after the day I've had--
                           (looks at Dave for a beat)
                        I'm not so sure.

                        Glad this is all a fucking joke to 
                        you!

           He storms out of the office.  Candy shakes her head at John.

           EXT. SUN SHIPYARD - DAY - FLASHBACK

           The Hughes Glomar Explorer (HGE) is framed out.  Even this 
           early in its development, it's clear what an odd ship it is -- 
           mostly because of the huge derrick that reaches 100 feet 
           above the ship's deck--   

           Suddenly that giant derrick starts tilting.  WORKERS scurry 
           out of the way as the derrick SMASHES onto the deck.  

           John Graham and Sherm Whetmore race out of their construction 
           trailer office.  Stare in shock.   

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Is everybody okay?!--

           John lurches into an uncontrollable spasmodic cough.  

                                 SHERM WHETMORE
                        John, you okay?--

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (waves him off)
                        Go!--
                           (coughs)
                        Check--
                           (coughs)
                        Everyone.  

           Sherm races off leaving John coughing.

           Unbeknownst to JP, a WINDOW WASHER appears behind him.

                        We've detected no breaches...   

           The crowd starts laughing.  JP's confused, but eventually 
           turns around.  

           The window washer waves to JP.  The crowd laughs harder.

           JP doesn't.

                        ... why are you yelling at me?  I 
                        didn't forget to close the drapes?

           John's at the wheel.  It's parked.

           He's parked outside a dive bar.

           Dave nearly jumps out of his skin when Candy opens his 
           passenger door.

                        What-- How--?

                        I'm good at tracking people.  Part 
                        of my training as a Russian spy.  

           He laughs as she climbs in, carrying a bag of chips.

                                 CANDY

                        Only when he's had a really 
                        stressful day.  So almost every 
                        night on this job.

                        Why does he do it? 

                                 CANDY
                        Said it was like taking a cold 
                        shower.  But I never got why people 
                        did that, so...

           She offers him the open bag of chips.  He takes some.

                        volleyball with everyone?

                        Because I'm here to work.

                        the impossible.  
                           (off her look)
                        I'm joking.

                        No, you're not.

                        I think all your worrying, all your 
                        hard work, I think it's really 
                        about something else.  I think it's 
                        because there's a little boy inside 
                        of you who is scared...

           Dave tenses up.  Doesn't like where Candy's psychoanalyzing 
           is going.

                                 CANDY
                        ... of me kicking his ass on the

                           (laughs, relieved)
                        Well, that's probably true.  
                        Besides, basketball's more my game.

                                 CANDY

           Dave argues with OSCAR "OTT" SCHICK (40s), Lockheed's Program 
           Manager about the Capture Vehicle aka --

           -- THE CLAW. This is what will actually pick up the sub. It's 
           huge -- 180 feet long, 58 feet wide, and 54 feet high and 
           four million pounds. 

           Or worded differently...

           ... as long as 4 city buses, as wide as 6 buses, as tall as 4 
           buses, and weighs as much as 100 buses. 

           Huge. 

           Ott points to the Claw's tines (16 of them, each 60 feet tall). 
                                 OTT SHICK
                        ... I can't know if these tines 
                        will be strong enough unless we get 
                        core samples.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        How close to the K-129 do the 
                        samples need to be from? 

                                 OTT SHICK
                        How close?  Right next to the damn 
                        thing. 

           Seeing Dave's reaction, Ott runs his hand through his 
           thinning hair. Dave puts his arm around Ott's shoulder. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Relax, Ott, I don't want you to

                        to visit at least half-a-dozen 
                        sites so we don't tip our hand.

           Dave says it begrudgingly, as if it's a huge character flaw.

           JP stares at Dave in disbelief.  Starts laughing at the 
           absurdity of the architect of this mission being seasick.

           court for William.  Not there.  

           Scans the bench.  But William's not there either.

           EXT. GAIL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dave argues with William (now 15) as Gail looks on.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        ... you don't want to play next 
                        year, fine.  But you can't quit--  

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's done, Dad.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (to Gail)
                        Would you help me out here please?

                                 GAIL
                        No.  We talked about it.  It's what  
                        he wants--

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I didn't raise a quitter.

           William laughs.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        You didn't raise anything.  Jesus, 
                        get over yourself.  

           He turns his back to Dave, walks out.  
                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Don't walk away from me.

           William ignores him.  Dave follows, puts his hand on his 
           son's shoulder.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey--

           William turns around, shoots out the heel of his hand into 
           Dave's chest.  Dave's jolted back into the wall.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sorry.  You okay?

           Dave doesn't answer; too stunned.  Not by the power of the 
           shot, but that it came from his little boy...

           ... who, he realizes in a flash, is not so little anymore.

           INT. JET - THAT NIGHT

           Dave heads back to the West Coast.  Staring at the photo of 
           him and ten-year-old William.  

           Barely resembles the teenager from today.  As Dave thinks 
           about the years that he'll never get back,

           Dave, already looking queasy, stands on the deck of the 
           Glomar II (not the ship our guys are building) as it pulls 
           out, bound for the reconnaissance mission.   

           FURTHER DOWN THE PORT--

           -- A RUSSIAN COMMERCIAL SHIP is tied up.

           A SAILOR photographs the Glomar II.

                                                      MATCH CUT TO:

           The PHOTO is on the bulletin board in--
           SHTYROV'S OFFICE.

           All four walls are covered by bulletin boards and they're all 
           filled with information about Howard Hughes' sea adventure 
           and the disappearance of the K-129.   

           And Shtyrov is pitching his boss's-boss, REAR-ADMIRAL V. A. 
           DOMYSLOVSKIY (Chief of Naval Intelligence Pacific Fleet).

                                 SHTYROV
                        I believe the Americans are trying 
                        to raise the K-129.  

                                 DOMYSLOVSKIY
                           (laughs)
                        With this ship?

                                 SHTYROV
                        No.  It's much too small.  I think 
                        they're using it for reconnaissance.  
                        This is the ship they're using.  

           He points to photos of the still-being-built Hughes Glomar 
           Explorer.  Domyslovskiy shakes his head.

                                 DOMYSLOVSKIY
                        This is Howard Hughes's ship.  

                                 SHTYROV
                        Supposedly.   

                                 DOMYSLOVSKIY
                           (scoffs; looks around)
                        I think you've been spending too 
                        much time in here, Anatoly.  
                           (beat)
                        We looked everywhere for that sub--

                                 SHTYROV
                        But--

                                 DOMYSLOVSKIY
                        But even if the Americans found it, 
                        it would be impossible to raise a 
                        sub from those depths.   

                                 SHTYROV
                        I agree, it strains credibility and 
                        technically, it appears impossible.  
                        But what if it's not?  What if the 
                        Americans do get it... and Moscow 
                        finds out that we knew about it.
           Domyslovskiy realizes he's stepped into Shtyrov's trap -- 
           that he can't un-know what he now knows.  His plausible 
           deniability is gone.      

                                 DOMYSLOVSKIY
                        You better be right.

           The 10'x'10 intelligence-gathering platform (aka "the DORK") 
           is on the ocean floor.  It's filled with cameras and 
           canisters to gather soil samples (and manganese nodules -- 
           the ostensible reason they're out here.)

           The platform is close to the K-129, but its weak lights only 
           tease us with a glimpse of the sub.   

           We WHIP UP the three miles of pipe string that attaches the 
           Dork to --

                        It's Russian, but it's commercial.

                        It does.  But picking up a nuclear-armed 
                        sub, not so much.

                        Seymour Hersh is on line one.

           A long beat.

                           (being "optimistic")
                        Maybe he's selling subscriptions?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SY HERSH'S HOUSE - WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           SY HERSH (30s) pours martinis out of a shaker into two 
           glasses as he talks to someone o.s.

                                 SEYMOUR HERSH
                        ... I understand that there are 
                        national security implications. 

           Carries a martini over to Bill Colby, who sits in a tattered 
           club chair. His hat, literally, in hand.

                                 BILL COLBY
                        I appreciate that, Sy. And if you 
                        hold off until we get the sub, I 
                        promise you'll have it exclusive. 

           Hersh sips the martini, then nods.  Deal.

                        answer some questions about another 
                        story I'm working on... 

           Colby's relief evaporates. Knows exactly what story Hersh is 
           talking about:

                                 BILL COLBY
                        A break-in at a local office

           ... The TWO GATES start to open.  
           They're supposed to move away from each other so that a giant 
           hole is created in the bottom of the ship. 

           Supposed to. But they don't. 

           Instead all hell breaks loose. 

           The violent wave action tosses the gates around in their 
           guides as though the gates were made of plywood instead of 
           nine-foot thick steel.

           DIVERS

           tethered to safety and breathing lines, drop into the MOON 
           POOL. 

           Swim to the center, avoiding the bucking gates. Until--

           -- a diver is sucked through the open gates. 

           BAM! The uncontrolled gates SLAM SHUT.  They lose sight of 
           the diver. Can only see his severed breathing line.  

           After an excruciatingly long beat, the gates open. The diver 
           swims through them back into the moon pool.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Pull him up! Pull him up! 

           The diver is pulled out of the pool. But-- BAM! BAM! The 
           gates keep slamming. 

           JP, CURTIS, AND ZUMWALT

           take this all in. 

           And Zumwalt, a man who has spent his life at sea, is shaken. 

           Finally the divers secure the gates. The BANGING stops.  

           Dave turns to JP and Zumwalt, but Zumwalt's already on his 
           way back to the helicopter -- he's seen enough.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (to JP)
                        We'll get to work figuring this out--

                                 JP
                        No, you won't.  'Cause you're 
                        fired, Professor.

           Dave's stunned.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        It's not his fault--

                                 JP
                        Not alone!  God knows I know that!  
                        But since I can't fire you, he 
                        goes.  Somebody's being held 
                        accountable for this!

           He starts off.  Graham calls after him:
                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        John, after some deep soul-searching, 
                        I've realized that in an effort to 
                        foster an environment of 
                        accountability, I'm going to quit.  

           JP turns around.  Stews for a beat in the corner he's painted 
           himself into.  Then:

                                 JP
                        Sharp, you're rehired.  
                           (beat)
                        Now fix this god damn ship.  

           He storms off with Walt in tow.  Dave and John Graham stare 
           at each other for a beat.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        You're welcome.

                        "I'm welcome?!"  Fuck you, John!  
                        You got me a job back I lost 
                        because of you!   
                           (calming down)

                        Not like this, Sherm.  I saw his 
                        face up there.  

           He waits for John Graham to deny it, but he doesn't.

           John Graham and Sherm Whetmore inspect the gates.  John lets 
           loose a terrible COUGH.  Sherm looks at him, worried.  Sees 
           how frail and how much weight John's lost.  The toll it's 
           taken on his friend.   

                                 SHERM WHETMORE
                        You alright?

                        Will be when I figure out what the

                        You always do.  

           John nods, goes back to the work.  Then stops.  Turns to his 
           old friend.  Vulnerable.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        But what if I can't?

           Dave's Corvette's the only car in the lot.  

           Dave is shooting baskets by himself.  Not casually.  He's 
           drenched in sweat.  It's like he's playing a game against 
           himself -- trying to exhaust himself.      

           Candy walks over.  A beat.  

                                 CANDY

           A beat, then Dave passes her the ball.  She hits a basket.  
           Dave shoots to answer it, when--

           -- his vision goes blurry. 

           The ball goes way left of the basket.   

                                 CANDY
                        You trying to throw this?

           But as he tries to blink away the blurriness, it doesn't go

                        ... it's called Central Serus 
                        Retinopathy, which is a fancy way 
                        of saying that stress has created 
                        tiny holes in your retina and fluid 
                        is leaking through them.

                        holes will heal on their own.

                           (so does he)
                        Thank you. 

           Another long beat.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Well, I should get back. 

           Dave turns to go. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Hey--
                           (Dave turns around)
                        -- wanna play hooky? 

           INT. SPARKMAN'S PINTO - DAY

           Following John Graham, who pulls into a MARINA PARKING LOT. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Shit. 

           EXT. DOCK - MARINA - LONG BEACH - DAY

           Dave and John walk down the dock to John's sailboat. John 
           steps on, but Dave pauses.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Everything okay?

           Dave hesitates. He should tell John that he gets seasick... 

           ... but that would mean telling John that he gets seasick. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           THE SAILBOAT 

           Heading into the bay.  John's at the tiller, smoking a 
           cigarette. Content.  This is where he's happiest.  Dave is 
           miserable; white-knuckling the railing.
                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (yelling over wind)
                        The wind's whipping. Beautiful day 
                        for a sail. 

           They pick up speed; the boat smashes into the waves. Dave's 
           face goes green.  John sees this; starts LAUGHING. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Why would somebody who gets seasick 
                        spend four and a half years of 
                        their life trying to raise a sub?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm not sea--

           He leans over the side, spews chunks into the water. John 
           laughs harder. Swings the tiller...

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Coming about. 

           ... Dave ducks the boom.  They head back into the harbor. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Thanks.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (still laughing)
                        No, thank you.  Most fun I've had 
                        on the water in a long time.  
                           (beat)
                        And I bet the fish appreciated 
                        their lunch.

           His LAUGHTER echoes as they head back in. 

           JOHN'S SAILBOAT - LATER

           Safely tied up at his slip. Dave drinks a beer, John enjoys a 
           Coke and a cigarette. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Now this kind of sailing I could 
                        get used to. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        You're a regular mariner. 

           They sit there for a beat. 
                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Are we going to be able to make 
                        this work?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        The gates? 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (nods; quietly)
                        All of it.  'Cause right now, the 
                        pipe string, the capture vehicle, 
                        nothing's working.
                           (beat)
                        And I haven't even figured out what 
                        the hell I'm gonna do if Russians 
                        follow us and send divers down.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Well, I wasn't dumb enough to sign 
                        up to oversee all of that. But as 
                        far as the ship goes, I think we'll 
                        get there-- or at least I'll die 
                        trying.

           Dave doesn't laugh at the gallows humor.  Stares out at the 
           water.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I can't fail, John.  I've 
                        sacrificed too much.  It can't all 
                        be for naught.   

           Dave looks away; ashamed that he let his vulnerability show. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        So it wasn't all about keeping the 
                        world safe for democracy?

           Dave can't help but smile at John, at his fellow traveler.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        My old man was a wildcatter back in 
                        Texas.  Anyway, he'd been drilling 
                        this hole for a while, sure it was 
                        gonna be the motherlode.  "Matching 
                        Cadillacs for me and your mother."  
                           (takes a drag on cigarette)
                        Nobody got Cadillacs.  We barely 
                        kept our house.  He was devastated.  
                        Hell, I was devastated and I was 
                        only seven.  But I'll never forget 
                        what he told me. "Sometimes you get 
                        oil, sometimes you get mud. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                                 JOHN GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        And it ain't nobody's fault but a 
                        bunch of old rocks and dead 
                        dinosaurs." 

           Dave considers that for a long beat:

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I don't think I'd be a good oilman. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (laughs)
                        Probably not.    
                           (tosses cigarette into the water)
                        We should probably get back, put 
                        our heads together and figure out 
                        how to make those gates work.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (taken aback)
                        Is that your way of asking for my 
                        help?  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        No, it's my way of throwing you a 
                        bone to boost your spirits.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           TWO MARTINIS BEING POURED

           by Seymour Hersh's practiced hand.  Once again, he's hosting 
           Bill Colby in his home office.   

                                 SEYMOUR HERSH
                        My exclusive is in danger of 
                        turning very non-exclusive. 
                           (beat)
                        Somebody wants this story out.  

           He hands Colby the martini.  

                                 SEYMOUR HERSH
                        Made yours a double.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - WCPO - NIGHT

           Once again, Dave's car is the only one in the lot. 
           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Dave struggles in vain to solve the problem with the gates.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Dave shoots baskets by himself, still trying to find the 
           answer.   Every once in a while, he will pause as inspiration 
           strikes. 

           A beat later, he curses and shoots again.   

           INT. BATHROOM - DAVE'S CONDO - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Dave, in a towel, slides the shower door open to turn the 
           shower on.  Steps in. 

           Stops.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Sneaking a cigarette, John works in his bed as he reads a 
           book (it's about the Ghost Army of WWII).  The PHONE RINGS. 
           Answers it.

                                 DAVE SHARP (O.S.; ON PHONE)
                           (excited)
                        What if we had wheels on the bottom 
                        of the gates in the guides, like a 
                        shower?-- Then when the gates 
                        locked in there'd be a little dip 
                        where the wheels could go?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM (INTO PHONE)
                           (long beat, then:)
                        Are you sitting in your condo 
                        naked?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        No. 

           REVEAL -- Dave naked in his condo.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'm standing. 

           They both laugh.  
                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Sharp, maybe you're not completely 
                        useless as a marine engineer. 

           Dave relishes the "high praise" from John Graham.  Then:

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Shit.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        What?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        What if we actually figure this all 
                        out and then they don't let us go?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Why wouldn't they let it go 
                        forward?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        'Cause it's Washington.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                                   Excom Meeting
                                     June 51974

           INT. CABINET ROOM - SAME TIME

           The meeting that will determine the mission's fate.   

           Dave sits against the wall with other underlings as JP, 
           Duckett, and Colby make their case to the most powerful 
           people in the world, including PRESIDENT NIXON.  

                                 JP
                        ... After our changes, we're 
                        confident that the systems will work. 

                                 ADMIRAL ZUMWALT
                           (scoffs)
                        I was on that ship! It is unsafe a 
                        couple miles off the California 
                        coastline, but you expect us to 
                        just take your word that it'll be 
                        okay in the middle of the Pacific?!

           Dave taps his foot anxiously... knows it's not going well. 
           But powerless to do anything about it.
                                 ADMIRAL ZUMWALT
                        And we haven't even heard a 
                        contingency plan. What the hell's 
                        going to happen if the Russians 
                        send divers down there when you're 
                        pulling their sub up?  

                                 JP
                        We're working on that.  

                                 ADMIRAL ZUMWALT
                        And what the hell happens if they 
                        board you? 

           A beat as JP tries to project confidence in his answer:

                                 JP
                        Our contingency plan needs to line 
                        up with our cover story so... 
                           (beat)
                        The plan would be to repel them 
                        with water hoses until the Navy 
                        arrives-- 

           The military guys nearly spit-take.  Zumwalt looks around the 
           table incredulously (and theatrically).  

                                 ADMIRAL ZUMWALT
                        I'm sorry, but I will not allow any 
                        of my men to serve on this mission. 
                           (beat)
                        The Navy refuses operational 
                        responsibility for this mission. 

           SecDef Schlesinger nods in support.  A big blow.  

           The CIA group look to Kissinger.  He stares back blankly.  
           Bigger blow.

           Finally they turn to their last hope, Joint Chief Chairman 
           Admiral Moorer.  The guy who started this thing.

                                 ADMIRAL MOORER
                        I think we should cancel it.

           The CIA is incredulous.

                                 ADMIRAL MOORER
                        I want those missiles more than 
                        anyone, but the Navy's saying it's

                        It's easy to say that when you 
                        won't be the one on the ship--

                        I'll go.  I'll lead it.

                        The CIA's trying to avoid 
                        responsibility by doubling down on 
                        a plan that doesn't work--

                        been built.  And we built it for

                        sub that's sitting three miles 
                        below the ocean's surface.

                                 JP
                        When we were tasked with coming up 
                        with a plan to recover the sub, I 
                        thought it was a fool's errand, a 
                        pipe dream, a way to pacify 
                        somebody's bruised ego.

           He glances over at Admiral Moorer.

                                 JP
                        And I wasn't alone.  In fact the 
                        only reason we have this 
                        opportunity is because the Russians 
                        think it's impossible.  It was 
                        impossible.  But over the past five

           his closing argument.

                        do more sea trials, go later--

                        We can't!  As you know, there's six 
                        weeks out of the year that we can 
                        operate in those seas.  But our 
                        cover story won't hold 'til next

           After a beat, JP turns back to President Nixon.

                        Rugs.  You don't owe me anything.  

           Ruggles nods, but still feels like a coward.  They shake 
           hands.  Then Dave watches his good friend walk out of the 
           driveway, his mission over.  

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - WCPO - NIGHT

           Dave's alone at work.  A knock, then Candy comes in, carrying 
           take-out.  Sets it up on Dave's desk and opens a couple 
           beers.

           As Dave eats and works, Candy eats and reads a book.  It's 
           clear that this has become their routine.

                                 CANDY
                        When are you going home?
                           (off his confused look)
                        To see your son.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        After I get back, when I move back.

                                 CANDY
                        You're not going before?  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (beat, shakes his head)
                        Don't have time.  

           Goes back to his work.   

                                 CANDY
                        Well, you should make time then.  

           Dave looks up, annoyed.   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I'll be back there soon full-time 
                        anyway.  

                                 CANDY
                        What if you're not?

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I wrote him a letter.  I'm going to 
                        send it to Gail.  

                                 CANDY
                        A letter?  David, you need to go--

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        My god, you sound like Sparkman.   
                        Everything's going to be fine on 
                        the mission.  
                           (beat)
                        And why the hell's it matter so 
                        much to you?  
                                 CANDY
                        Better question is why doesn't it 
                        matter so much to you.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Of course it matters to me...

           He starts to say more, but stops.  

                                 CANDY
                        Then go.  You'll regret it if you 
                        don't.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        I can't go.  

                                 CANDY
                        Why not?  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Because when I see him... 
                           (quietly)
                        I realize how much of a failure I am.  

                                 CANDY
                        David--

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        It's true.  I failed as a father, 
                        as a husband.  And I can't have 
                        that in my head right now... any 
                        more than it already is.  Because I 
                        can't fail at this too.

           Candy takes Dave in for a long beat.  Sees that he really 
           believes he's a failure as a father and husband.   

                                 CANDY
                        You beat your son?  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Of course not.  

                                 CANDY
                        Provide for him, care for him?  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Yeah.  

                                 CANDY
                        Love him?
                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (beat; quietly)
                        More than anything.   

                                 CANDY
                        Your problem is that you think if 
                        you're not perfect, that you're a 
                        failure.  But life isn't like that.  
                           (beat)
                        David, you might not be father of 
                        the year, but you’re a long way 
                        from a failure -- trust me on that.

           It's clear she's speaking from experience.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (quietly; looks down)
                        I wouldn't even know what to say. 

                                 CANDY
                        Well, I'd start with...

           Dave looks up, ready to receive her wisdom. 

                                 CANDY
                        "hi."

           As Dave laughs:

           EXT. GAIL'S HOUSE - DAY

           William shoots baskets by himself.  Misses.  The ball goes 
           past him and is scooped up by Dave as he walks up the 
           driveway.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Hi.

           Nothing.  Dave has no idea what to say now.  So he doesn't 
           say anything.  

           Just passes the ball back to his son.

           As William shoots, Dave rebounds for him.  Keeps feeding him 
           the ball.     

           After a half-dozen shots, William passes the ball back to 
           Dave to shoot.   
           As Dave shoots,

                                   July 20, 1974

           THE HUGHES GLOMAR EXPLORER - LONG BEACH - DAWN

           Under intense security and secrecy, final preparations are 
           made for the departure.  Steve Craig and Captain Gresham (the 
           Captain from the recon missions) watch as equipment and huge 
           amounts of food are brought on board.

           ON THE PIER

           Candy hugs Dave good-bye.  Breaks the hug, then hugs him 
           tighter.  Off the hug's intensity:   

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Did John tell you something about 
                        the ship he didn't tell me?  

           Candy laughs, shakes her head.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Tell him I said "goodbye", okay?

                                 CANDY
                        I'll see you soon-- 

           She kisses him.  Pulls back.  Looks around.  Nobody noticed.  

                                 CANDY
                           (embarrassed)
                        I'm sorry--  

           Dave pulls her behind a storage container.  As he dips and 
           kisses her like that iconic photo of the sailor kissing the 
           Nurse after WWII, PRELAP:    

                                 DAVE SHARP (V.O)
                        So that's the contingency plan?  

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DAVE'S BERTH - THE EXPLORER - DAY

           He and Steve Craig stare at the contingency plan--
           -- a handful of guns from Big 5 Sporting Goods.  Not exactly 
           enough to hold off the Russian Navy. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        The fire hoses are looking better 
                        and better.

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        That's why I came up with a Plan B.  

           He goes out, then wheels in six cases of Russian vodka. 

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Best vodka in the world. If you're 
                        boarded, hopefully your guests will 
                        be more interested in your 
                        hospitality than doing a thorough 
                        inspection of the ship.
                           (off Dave's dubious look)
                        It also has one other benefit.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        What's that?

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        You can drink it if the ship sinks.   

           Dave and Steve laugh.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM (O.S.)
                        It's not gonna sink.

           Dave and Steve are shocked by John's appearance.  Still has 
           his hair, but he's frail and shockingly thin.  Sensing that 
           he's a third wheel, Steve excuses himself:

                                 STEVE CRAIG
                        Good to see you, John.  I'm just 
                        gonna make sure the gangplank is 
                        still up.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        How you doing, John?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (laughs)
                        Better than your powers of 
                        perception obviously.   
                           (beat)
                        Brought you a little something.
                           (hands Dave a small vial)
                        Ancient Chinese sailors used this 
                        for seasickness. 
                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Does it work?

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (offended)
                        How the hell should I know? Never 
                        had occasion to use it.  
                           (beat)
                        There's one other thing...

           John hands him the tiny piece of metal that he always rubs.

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Ah... the tiny piece of metal.

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Pull tab from the last can of beer 
                        I ever had. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                           (reads the tab)
                        "Schlitz?"  Jesus, you really were 
                        an alcoholic.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (laughs)
                        Yeah, if jonesing for a Schlitz 
                        isn't rock bottom, I don't know 
                        what the hell is.  

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Thank you, John.  

           John nods, but looks away.  Uncomfortable with the emotion. 

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Anyway, you probably got a million 
                        things to get squared away. 

                                 DAVE SHARP
                        Million and a half. 
                           (beat)
                        I'll see you when I get back. 

           They both know that's a lie.  

                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                        Yeah.  Maybe we'll go for a sail. 

           Dave laughs as they shake hands. Then, to Dave's surprise, 
           John pulls Dave in for a fierce hug. 
                                 JOHN GRAHAM
                           (urgent)
                        Now go get some god damn oil.

           Dave watches as the giant well gates start to open and pull 
           apart. It's much smoother than last time.

           Except ten pieces of string are painted a greenish-blue.

           THE ROUGHNECKS 

           load the pipe string under the watchful eye of John Graham's 
           lieutenant, Sherm Whetmore.

           It's an impressive ballet of coordination and brute strength. 

           A sixty-foot piece of pipe is pulled out of storage by a 
           crane and... 

           .... conveyored up to the top of the derrick, 240 feet above 
           the deck.  Then... 

           ... another crane spins the pipe and holds it vertically as 
           it's lowered into the preceding pipe... 

           ... where it's screwed into place, then driven down. 
           Another piece in an ever-expanding chain that will eventually 
           reach three miles. 

           The power for this process comes from--

           THE HEAVY LIFT SYSTEM.

           Forty-eight hydraulic pumps operating pressures of up to 
           3,000 psi. So deafening and literally teeth-rattling that the

           Shtyrov and Domyslovskiy, their futures now co-mingled, pace 
           the control center.  It's tense.  Everyone smokes, except 
           Shtyrov, who calmly chews an apple.

           A COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER runs over with a secure message.  
           Starts to hand it to Domyslovskiy, but Domyslovskiy refuses 
           to take it -- he's still trying to distance himself from 
           this.

           Dave and the Department Heads stare intently at the MONITORS,

           ... undocking the four million pound Clementine from the 
           Docking Legs and transferring it to the pipe string. 

           UNDERWATER 

           BOOM! BOOM! 

           The pipe string and Capture Vehicle smash into each other, 
           causing-- 

           THE ENTIRE SHIP

           to shake.  Physical shock waves from the collisions are 
           visible on the derrick structure. But that's not what's the 
           scariest part... the sound is. 

           It sounds like the ship is being torn apart. 
           THE BRIDGE

           Captain Gresham and his crew look at each other. Terrified.

                        Feel like we're being taken down by

           coming toward them.

                        If the Explorer moves, then maybe 
                        it really is a commercial ship.

           But it's hard since there's such a long lag time between Hank 
           moving the joystick and then Clementine carrying out the 
           command. 

           Finally, Hank exhales.   Lets go of the controllers.

           It's so loud that they can barely hear.  The coffee mugs on

           They apply more hydraulic power-- SMASH!  The coffee mugs are 
           marched off the control panel.

           THE EXPLORER

           Rolled even more on to its side, battered by giant waves that  
           crash over the deck.  But still, over MOTHER NATURE'S FURY, 
           the hear the scariest sound anybody on board has ever hard.  
           It's coming from-- 

           THE PIPE STRING UNDER THE SHIP.

           Because of the ship's seven-degree roll, every connection 
           between the sixty-foot pieces of pipe-string STRAINS.  

           And if a piece of string snaps, it will start a cataclysmic 
           chain reaction that will send the pipe-string smashing back 
           up into the ship.

                        Remember when you stormed into Graham's

                        to be able to go to eight-and-a-half 
                        degrees instead of eight and he told 
                        you to pound sound?

           A giant vacuum-looking contraption (a life-sized version of

                        They don't know the sub's location 
                        or condition--

                        Then get me an unsecure one! I 
                        don't care! I want to talk to that

                        Carl, you can't call Sharp.  The 
                        Russians will hear everything. 
                        Everything will be compromised. The

           THE CATWALK ABOVE THE MOON POOL  - EXPLORER - DAY

           Dave, by himself, watches as the water's drained from the 
           moon pool, revealing the forty foot piece of the K-129.  
           Ironically, there are also manganese nodules scattered around 
           that were scooped up when they picked up the K-129. 

           Sparkman comes over.  Puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. 
           Dave doesn't acknowledge it, just stares at the chunk of sub. 

                                 SPARKMAN
                        We did good, Dave. 

           No response from Dave.  Then:

                        Have 'em bring up the Geiger counters.

                        I want to look at those tines, see why 
                        they broke. Maybe even get the data up 
                        to Lockheed while we're heading home so 
                        they can get a head-start.

                        Fixing it for the next mission.

           As it heads back to Hawaii, we see:

           SHOTS OF THE EXPLOITATION.

           - The crew, wearing their protective suits, use blow torches 
           to cut their way into the sub. 
           - They pull out codebooks, a nuclear-tipped torpedo. 

           - Sparkman crawls through the sub. Stops when he sees a dead 
           sailor.

           The sailor is the young one who was smoking a cigarette on 
           the K-129 before she departed.  

           Sparkman reaches out with his gloved hand and closes the 
           sailor's eyelids.

           PRELAP the Soviet Union National Anthem...

           Dave and the rest of the crew watch solemnly as a crane picks 
           up the container.  Gently places it in the ocean. 

           As the Soviet Anthem fades away, it's replace by a TAT-A-TAT-
