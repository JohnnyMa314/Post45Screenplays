           INT. SURGERY ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

           CU: TWO GLOVED HANDS move carefully on a HOLOGRAM TOUCH 
           SCREEN, showing a HUMAN BRAIN, mid-operation.

           CU: the FACE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN (20s) in surgery, the 
           crown of her skull opened up, where robotic un-manned tools 
           hover and operate, at the direction of-

           Pull back to see: LYNN ROBERTS (32, deep, intelligent eyes- 
           she’s not cold but there’s a certain flat unhappiness, a 
           permanent distance), leading an ALL MALE TEAM. 

           Her focus is razor sharp as her hands move against the 
           SCREEN, completing the procedure. Machines BEEP, WARNING-

                MALE NURSE
                                       LYNN
                              Hold steady-
           She’s at 60, needs oxygen 
           Doctor-

           Finally the STINT is in- the beeping stops. A WAVE OF RELIEF. 

           INT. PHYSICIAN WASHROOM - HOSPITAL - LATER

           Lynn stands alone, scrubbing out, washing up. Her white 
           scrubs camouflage her against the neutral palette.

           INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - HOSPITAL - LATER

           SECRETARIES (dresses, heels) powder their noses and chat-

                                 SECRETARY 1
                        ...Poor thing was trying for a 3rd 
                        but couldn’t get pregnant again...

           In the ROW OF LOCKERS- Lynn (trousers, blouse, trench) ties 
           her white tennis shoes, heads out... 

           INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL LOBBY - LATER

           As Lynn walks down a blue corridor, the CONSERVATIVE CLOTHING 
           and MID-CENTURY LINES AND COLORS are making make us guess 
           we’re somewhere near the 1950s-

           EXCEPT THAT NOW- Lynn approaches a GLASS SECURITY DOOR, waits 
           as- A RED LASER SCANS HER FACE- 

           IT’S THIS STRANGE COMBINATION OF 50S CULTURAL IMAGES AND 
           MODERN HIGH-TECH THAT MAKES US WONDER WHAT YEAR WE’RE IN. 

           The door unlocks... admits her through to...
           INT. LOBBY - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           A neutral palette and sleek design, both vintage and modern. 

           Lynn passes a HOLOGRAM TV showing THE REPORTER (a perfect Ken 
           Doll, the One and Only News Reporter) and waves to PAM (20s, 
           pregnant, perfectly put together) at the front desk- 

                                 PAM
                        Goodnight, Dr. Roberts.

           EXT. PLAZA - UNKNOWN CITY - EVENING

           This city is mostly New York, but with some unfamiliar 
           buildings and landmarks. It’s undeniably beautiful, though we 
           sense something’s slightly off...

           Everything’s subtly over-curated and the people are eerily 
           HOMOGENOUS: most are WHITE MEN (suits/uniforms) and ALL THE 
           WOMEN (skirts/dresses) in sight (except Lynn) are with 
           CHILDREN, while PEOPLE OF COLOR quietly dot the margins.

           Lynn crosses briskly through the STATE SQUARE- formed by 4 
           BLACK SKYSCRAPERS, like futuristic repurposed cathedrals.

           Lynn’s IMPLANTED CELL PHONE RINGS- a small HOLOGRAM pops up 
           in her periphery- this is Lynn’s TWIN BROTHER, DUKE (32, 
           charismatic, a bright contrast to Lynn.) She accepts- sliding 
           the hologram in front of her.

                                 DUKE 
                        Hey! Happy birthday to us!

           She doesn’t match his enthusiasm- but can’t help but smile.

                                 LYNN
                        Yep. Happy birthday to us... 

                                 DUKE 
                        You’re coming tomorrow, right?

                                 LYNN
                        It’s my nightmare but I’ll do it if 
                        that’s what you’re asking.

                                 DUKE 
                        That’s what I’m asking.

                                 LYNN
                        Fine. I’m coming from work and I’m 
                        wearing pants.
                                 DUKE 
                        Well thank you ahead of time, for 
                        coming to our birthday party.

                                 LYNN
                        -Your birthday party. 

                                 DUKE 
                        (studying her...) You ok, Lynny?

                                 LYNN
                        (defensive) Ya- you ok, Duke? (...) 
                        Is anyone interesting coming 
                        tomorrow- or just your friends?

           FLASH - a HAND on the side of a FACE-

           Lynn pauses to rub something out of her eye, then continues-

                                 DUKE
                        Glad you’re making the best of it- 

                                 LYNN
                        Oh come on- you know your friends 
                        are kind of- plastic, at best.

                                 DUKE 
                        But yours are non-existent, Lynn. 
                        So plastic is the best we’ve got-

                                 LYNN
                        So far I give your humor a D+-

                  DUKE
                                    LYNN (CONT'D)
                              Loveyoubye.
           Oh come on! Not even 
           passing?!

           INT. STAND-UP RAMEN BAR - UNKNOWN CITY - LATER

           RED, SLEEK, SMALL: only room for the UNMANNED COUNTER and the 
           Kyoto-style bar opposite, where MOSTLY MALE PATRONS stand, 
           eating and interacting with their phone holograms.

           Lynn orders on the touchscreen- pays with her fingerprint. 
           She stands to wait against the wall, foregoing the open seat. 

           On the TV, a COMMERCIAL for “FAMILY FIRST” PLAYS: a STRAIGHT 
           WHITE MARRIED COUPLE and KIDS, boasting happy perfection-

                                 COMMERCIAL V.O.
                        ...Family First. Shouldn’t you get 
                        to be happy, too...?
           Off Lynn: a subtle flicker of annoyance, as she looks away...

           INT. STAIRWELL - LYNN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A beautiful 1920’s building renovated with modern flare.

           Carrying a take-out bag, Lynn climbs the winding marble 
           stairs, her hand gliding along the black metal railing that 
           swoops upward in a delicate curl.

           Lynn puts a key in the door which pulls up a SCREEN on the 
           lock plate- it SCANS HER FACE and opens.

           EXT./INT. VARIOUS - LYNN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A sleek modern apartment, with high ceilings and red accents. 
           We establish the circular layout as Lynn (pajamas) walks from

           Her BEDROOM through the BATHROOM to the GUEST BEDROOM, and 
           out to the...

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Lynn sits on the grey couch, in front of the HOLOGRAM TV, 
           eating her steaming noodles.

           LATER

           A pink cupcake with a candle. Lost somewhere else, Lynn 
           stares past it. And then, suddenly overwhelmed- she presses a 
           SMALL BLUE BUTTON ON HER FOREARM. 

           A beat, as it hits her bloodstream, and- she RELAXES. Then 
           blows out the candle and takes a bite...

           INT. LYNN’S BEDROOM - LYNN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Lynn lies in bed, her only pause between the relentless, 
           monotonous days. She stares at the ceiling, as if looking for 
           an answer- then relents, closing her eyes...

           EXT. WOODS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - DREAM SEQUENCE

           We follow TINY LYNN (4, happy, cut-offs and high-tops) 
           running up a dirt trail, bare knees brushing tall weeds. She 
           pauses, turns back toward us and now-

           ABRUPT CUT: She’s CHILD LYNN (10), on the SAME HILL, panting 
           smiling. She turns to keep running, as from FAR OFF somewhere-
                                 ANN (O.S.)
                        Lynn... Lynn...

           Reaching the crest of the hill, she turns and now-

           SUDDEN CUT: She’s TEEN LYNN (16, finding her way) lying on 
           fresh grass, looking up at the sky-

           CU: A HAND gently holding the side of Teen Lynn’s face...

           Teen Lynn stares lovingly up at ANN (60, an alluring mix of 
           strength and depth that makes us instantly drawn to her.)  

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be afraid...

           Off Teen Lynn: holding still, as Ann reaches into her eye...

           INT. VARIOUS - HOSPITAL - DAY

           WASH ROOM - Lynn scrubbing out, washing up. 

           LOCKER ROOM - Lynn (slacks, sweater) ties her tennis shoes. 

           HALL - The RED LASER scans Lynn through the glass security 
           door and she walks past Pam at the front desk.

           EXT. DOCKS - UNKNOWN CITY - LATER

           An empty wooden dock, jutting out into the sea. Lynn pulls 
           her trench coat closed against the wind, as she walks...

           An acute picture of her aloneness: Lynn stands at the end of 
           the dock, overlooking the lapping water. She’s crying.

           FLASH - a CHAOTIC burst of WATER everywhere-

           Dazed, Lynn startles, realizing a COUPLE approaching behind. 
           She wipes her face, composes a smile as she leaves.

           EXT./INT. ELEVATOR - DUKE’S INDUSTRIAL LOFT - NIGHT

           As she waits for the ornate gold elevator- Lynn pulls her 
           black heels out of her bag and switches shoes.

           Lynn rides up, surrounded by gold-framed mirrors forming the 
           walls. A corner reflects unending visions of her. She stares 
           coldly at herself, not liking what she sees. 

           Then, as if losing a silent argument, she reaches into her 
           purse- glides on some stupid fucking pink lipstick...
           INT. PARTY - DUKE’S INDUSTRIAL LOFT - NIGHT

           A CROWD of 20s/30s, dressed MODERN 50s CHIC. The MEN and 
           WOMEN are segregated into distinct areas. As Lynn makes her 
           way through, we hear snippets of CHATTER...

                                 MALE GUEST 1
                        (showing hologram footage) Ya, 
                        Kilimanjaro was amazing.

                                 MALE GUEST 2
                        Oh we did Kilimanjaro yesterday- 
                        was incredible!

           Lynn finds Duke standing by his wife, AMY (26, doll-face, 
           very pregnant), encircled by friends. 

                                 DUKE
                        Hey! My other half!

                                 LYNN
                        Happy birthday, Duke.

           Duke wraps her in a big hug- she softens into him- then 
           kisses Amy’s cheek. Now adorable THOMAS (3, big brown eyes) 
           runs up and Lynn scoops him up into a hug.

                 THOMAS
                                    LYNN (CONT'D)
           Auntie Lynn!
                              Ahh Uncle Thomas!

                                 THOMAS
                        (laughs) No I’m not uncle!

                                 DUKE
                        (proud, to friends) You guys know 
                        my twin sister Lynn, the surgeon?

           The LOOKS- oh, we know- The Girl Surgeon. Amy fidgets 
           awkwardly. Lynn smiles, presses the button on her arm...

           LATER

           Lynn nervously hovers the perimeter, trying to discern the 
           lesser of 2 evil conversations to try to enter...

                                 FEMALE GUEST 1
                        ...women’s report very inspiring, 
                        with Franc’s view on the 
                        progressive woman choosing to stay 
                        home, focus on motherhood-

                                 FEMALE GUEST 2
                        (earnest) We’re finally moving past 
                        only valuing the career women!
           Lynn edges toward the other side of the room...

                                 MALE GUEST 3
                        ...doing a story on the new 
                        direction of biotechnology and 
                        cortical interface progress. It’s 
                        truly groundbreaking.

                                 LYNN
                        Oh, did you say Brighton? That’s 
                        where I work-

           Male Guest 3 and FRIENDS stare at Lynn- she crossed a line.

                                 MALE GUEST 3
                        (curt) Yes, Duke mentioned. 

                                 LYNN
                        ...Ya. Well I’m on the board for 
                        the biotechnology program so if you-

                                 MALE GUEST 3
                        -The story’s done. We primarily 
                        focused on Dr. Roberts’ work on 
                        bypassing the neurofeedback loop in 
                        addressing temporal lobe injury. 

           She pauses, uncomfortable, just as Duke passes by, smiling-

                                 DUKE
                        That’s her work. Dr. L Roberts.

           Duke leaves, leaving Lynn exposed. The men are stunned.

                                 MALE GUEST 3
                        (bitter) Oh then, please tell us- 
                        what does the future look like...?

           LATER

           A GLOWING BIRTHDAY CAKE in front of Duke, as everyone sings.    
           As they finish the song, Duke catches Lynn’s eye, smiles-

                 EVERYONE
           (singing)...Happy birthday to 
           you...
                                      DUKE-
                              (lip synching to her) Happy 
                              birthday to you...

           Lynn smiles back- the one person that sees her.
           EXT. STREET - UNKNOWN CITY - LATE NIGHT

           Lynn walks home down a picturesque street, lined with trees 
           and bulb lamps. It’s lovely- but she’s bothered, as she knew 
           she would be. As she always is. 

           FLASH - ECHO of a WOMAN’S VOICE - “Lynn!”

           Lynn turns back to see... an empty street. She hurries on.

           EXT. BACK YARD - ANN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ANOTHER TIME

           NOTE: the scenes from ANOTHER TIME SPARK like interruptions 
           to the moment- but will gradually merge into one story.

           Tiny Lynn (red pajamas) stands frozen in the back yard, 
           impervious to the THUNDERING-DOWN RAIN, when suddenly- ANN 
           (48) comes sprinting from the back door, screaming-

                                 ANN
                        LYNN!... LYNN!

           Ann crouches down, trying not to scare her- but Tiny Lynn 
           isn’t scared- she’s TOTALLY BLANK, disassociated. 

           Ann scoops her up, clutching her tight, sheltering Tiny 
           Lynn’s wet body with her own, as she heads back inside...

           INT. STAIRWELL - LYNN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           CU: Lynn’s tennis shoes on the winding stairs.

           CU: Lynn’s hand along the black metal railing.

           INT. VARIOUS - LYNN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           BEDROOM 

           Lynn (pajamas) pulls off the large grey pillow, tosses it 
           onto the red velvet chair, pulls back the comforter, turns to 
           walk into the bathroom, but- 

           SHE CAN’T- BECAUSE INSTEAD SHE ENTERS THE BEDROOM AGAIN- 
           WHERE THE BED IS MADE, PILLOW IN PLACE, JUST LIFE BEFORE.

           Confused, she tries to turn into the bathroom again but- 
           SHE’S STILL IN THE BEDROOM. SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. 

                                 LYNN
                        (scared) Ok, no. What the fuck.  
                        Hello...?
           LIVING ROOM 

           Lynn hurries to look out the window- then opens the front 
           door, as if searching for an explanation... 

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        Ok. It’s ok...

           BEDROOM 

           She walks back in and... walks into the bathroom. Everything 
           perfectly normal now.

           Off Lynn: looking around, DEEPLY RATTLED...

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - BROWNSTONE - NEXT DAY

           Lynn and her PSYCHOLOGIST (50s, balding, warm) sit across 
           from each other in overstuffed mustard chairs. 

                                 LYNN
                        -No the room wasn’t there- it’s 
                        like I wasn’t really- in my house. 

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        So where do you think you were...?

                                 LYNN
                        No, I don’t think I was somewhere 
                        else- I was. I’m telling you- 
                        something is wrong! 

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Lynn, how do you feel right now?

                                 LYNN
                        That I’m not... safe. Ever. And the 
                        blurry vision and the... headaches 
                        and the gaps in my memory and... 
                        why do I keep having the dream 
                        every night? 

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        Yes, the medication should have 
                        stopped it by now. Still no sense 
                        of who she might be...?

                                 LYNN
                        No... 

           Now the Psychologist startles- as if from an ELECTRIC SHOCK- 
           and his entire countenance and tone shift- more robotic/harsh-
                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        -I’m concerned about your grasp on 
                        reality and this latest hysteria- 

                                 LYNN
                        (defensive) -It’s not hysteria-

                                 PSYCHOLOGIST
                        All your symptoms are from the 
                        virus, so we need to increase your 
                        meds again and I want you to re-
                        enter the family first program.

           FLASH - BLURRY SHAKING CYLINDRIC LIGHTS

           Lynn stares at her Psychologist, like he’s sentencing her.

                                 LYNN
                        ...Of course.

           INT. VARIOUS - LYNN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           LIVING ROOM - A deep mix of fear and conviction fills Lynn’s 
           eyes as she closes her curtains, checks the lock on her door. 

           Lynn pours whiskey in a small porcelain cup. 

                                 LYNN
                        To... the truth. 

           She downs the shot. 

           ENTER MONTAGE: as LYNN TRIES TO CREATE THE GLITCH AGAIN:

           - Lynn walks a circle through the house, over and over-

           - Faster now, Lynn runs laps through the house- changes 
           direction- runs backward- stumbles, laughs at herself-

           - Losing hope, Lynn tips her body back and forth over the 
           threshold: bathroom to bedroom, bathroom to bedroom and then-

           FWAAP! THE LIGHTS FLASH AND NOW- 

           WE’RE IN COMPLETE DARKNESS and TOTAL SILENCE, except the 
           sound of LYNN’S HEAVY BREATHING- 

                                 LYNN (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Hello?! What the fuck. HELLO?! 

           HER BREATH QUICKENS, TURNING TO PANIC, WE CAN HEAR SHE’S 
           STRUGGLING BUT CAN’T SEE WITH WHAT, until finally- 
           FROM LYNN’S POV: DARKNESS and then through the fluttering of 
           her right eye, BLINKS OF LIGHT as- 

           HER FINGERS REMOVE A TINY GLASS BEAD FROM HER RIGHT EYE... 

           FLASH - A MYSTERIOUS GIRL’S EYES

           And now she can see...

           SHE’S FLOATING IN THE CENTER OF A BRIGHT, ALL-GLASS 120 
           SQUARE FT. VIRTUAL REALITY POD. SHE’S WEARING A TIGHT, NUDE-
           COLORED FULL-BODY SUIT and her face is PALE.

           In SHOCK and TERROR, Lynn stares at the pod, then at her 
           body, hovering there alone in space-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        HELLO?! WHAT IS THIS? WHERE AM I? 
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!

           SHE TRIES TO REACH FOR A WALL, OR THE GROUND- BUT CAN’T. HER 
           MOVEMENTS ARE LIMITED TO HER CURRENT HOVERING POSITION. 

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        HELLO?!

                                 COMPUTER VOICE (O.S.)
                        (delightful) Hello, Lynn. We see 
                        you’ve come off-line. One of our 
                        VTI guides will be with you 
                        momentarily. Please remain calm- 
                        there is nothing to worry about.

                                 LYNN
                        What?! Who are you?! Where am I?! 
                        What’s happening?

           And now the BACK WALL RETRACTS INTO ITSELF REVEALING A SECOND 
           SLIDING GLASS DOOR, AND BEHIND IT, STANDING ON THE GROUND IS- 

           DEV (well-groomed, navy weighted VR suit, a nervous urgency 
           underlines his friendly voice.)

           NOTE: The frame stays tight, limiting our scope to Lynn’s pod-

                                 DEV (V.O.)
                        Hello, Lynn. My name’s Dev and I’m 
                        a guide here. I’m going to de-
                        pressurize your pod so I can enter. 
                        As the gravitational force 
                        stabilizes, you’ll lower to the 
                        ground- I’ll try to give you a 
                        smooth landing. Ready?
           Slowly Lynn (rigid) descends to the ground...

                                 DEV
                        Nice and easy, 3...2... touchdown.

           The instant Lynn’s feet touch- she COLLAPSES to the floor and 
           starts HYPERVENTILATING. Dev quickly enters and attaches 
           oxygen mask to her face, then a scanner to read her vitals-

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        Your lungs are adjusting to the 
                        decreased oxygen levels but you’ll 
                        feel better in a few minutes. Take 
                        a few deep breaths for me-

           Like a CAGED ANIMAL, Lynn’s eyes dart wildly to- the MASK on 
           her FACE- the WEIGHT of her BODY- the TOUCH of HUMAN hands- 

                                 DEV (CONT’D)
                        It’s ok, Lynn. You’re doing great. 

           CU: Lynn’s terrified eyes, looking up at him-

           INT. HALLWAY - VTI HEADQUARTERS- LATER

           Dev quickly pushes Lynn (covered in blankets) in a wheelchair 
           down a WHITE BARREN HALLWAY. A BRIGHT LIGHT shines toward 
           them, from behind stainless steel double doors.

           Lynn squints, shrinking back from the light ahead, as Dev 
           hurries forward, pushing anxiously toward it...

           EXT. SMALL LOADING DOCK - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS 

           Now Dev’s running, pushing Lynn toward a waiting BLACK SEDAN, 
           the only car in sight. As they reach it-

           GRAY JOHNSON (brilliant, ruffled-handsome, his mind is always 
           on numerous things at once) steps out, opens the back door as-

                                 DEV
                        She’s coherent but has extreme 
                        hypertension, low respiration, very 
                        high risk of shock. She’s gonna 
                        need some sort of lung support as 
                        soon as you get there.

                                 GRAY
                        On 3...?

           They lift Lynn into the back seat. Pallid and frozen with 
           shock, she tries to object or resist, but can only manage-
                                 LYNN
                        No, what’s happening? Where am I? 

                                 DEV
                        And if she speaks while we go 
                        through, they’ll pick up a signal-

           Off this, amidst the urgency- Gray pauses a beat to really 
           look at Lynn- he’s totally fucking awe-stricken- 

                                 GRAY
                        You’re safe now, Lynn-

           -Just as he takes the MASK from Dev- PUSHES IT OVER HER MOUTH 
           and- she SLUMPS back, dazed with the HIGH...

           INT. EVANS' OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           This office is hidden somewhere in the belly of the building 
           and this guy is working alone, off the radar.

           At his desk, JIM EVANS (40s, VTI Special Security, rigid) 
           studies HOLOGRAM SCREENS, when- his expression changes- like 
           it takes a moment to believe what he’s seeing-

           REVEAL ON SCREEN: AN EMPTY POD...

           Leaning into the screen, he refreshes the feed - EMPTY. He 
           tries REWINDING the POD FOOTAGE- but there’s an ERROR. 

           Confusion rising to worry, he picks up his phone-

                                 EVANS
                        Need location for Citizen 1001- and 
                        check pod cameras and entry history-

           INT. SURVEILLANCE DEPT. - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME TIME

           The SURVEILLANCE CHIEF (50s, staunch) makes his way through 
           the ROWS OF SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, tracking CITIZENS.

                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF
                        Give me a minute-

           As he heads to his office, we hear snippets of directives- 

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS
                        ...illegal web activity... Citizen 
                        Score dropped below 500, invoking 
                        travel restriction... State officer 
                        requested- suspicion of perverse 
                        sexual activity...
           He walks into his OFFICE- runs the search, relaying what he 
           sees in real time, on his SCREENS-

                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF
                        (casual) ...Looks like a system 
                        glitch caused her to come offline. 
                        Seems protocol was followed by the 
                        guide who brought her to- wait... 

           INT. EVANS' OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME TIME

           PANIC overcomes Evans as he listens-

                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF (O.S.)
                        ...there’s a series of disruptions 
                        on the Northwest feeds-

                                 EVANS
                        -Lockdown the campus, code red 
                        search now!

           INT. HALLWAY - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Evans, SPRINTING down the hall-

           INT. BLACK SEDAN - MOVING - LATER

           Gray drives and Dev rides in the passenger seat. They exhale, 
           as they pull away from the VTI EXIT CHECK POINT, onto-

           The STREETS of a GHOST TOWN MANHATTAN- familiar and other-
           worldly, with 1/3 of the people and lights. Like a country 
           emerging from war, parts of the city look frozen in time 20 
           years ago- while others are modern.

           Dazed, Lynn gazes through the back window, at:

           - An ELECTRONIC BILLBOARD- listing STATE OFFENDERS- PHOTOS 
           AND NAMES of ALFRED ALBANI and JAMES SMITH, with emails, 
           phone numbers, addresses, and Citizen Scores. 

           - Streets of boarded-up buildings and abandoned homes.

           - In a PARK- a heavy presence of STATE POLICE, patrolling...

           Gray pulls up to a STREET CORNER, as Dev pulls on a hoodie 
           and beanie, then checks a SMALL BLACK DEVICE on the floor-

                                 DEV
                        You got 5 minutes left offline-
                                 GRAY
                        Thank you.

           As Dev jumps out, Gray pulls back onto the street...

           INT. HALLWAY - VTI HEADQUARTERS - MINUTES LATER

           Evans marches down the hall with PHYLLIS (60s, VTI Special 
           OPS, ageless, kempt. Ruthlessly self-restrained, she can 
           inspire fear with a flick of the eyebrows or annoyed smile.) 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        How did this happen? 

                                 EVANS
                        We’re unsure how she came offline. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Your entire position centers around 
                        knowing her location at all times.

                                 EVANS
                        (afraid) ...Yes. I realize.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        No one else is aware of her 
                        identity?

                                 EVANS
                        Correct. 

           INT. SURVEILLANCE CHIEF’S OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           The Chief gives the updates. Evans’ posture is shrinking 
           under the shadow of Phyllis’s growing rage beside him...

                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF
                        ...a car that left campus 18 
                        minutes ago with a badge we can’t 
                        track, facial recognition scans 
                        that don’t exist, and no thermal 
                        signatures for the 3 passengers.

           Phyllis stares, a fissure forming in her composure, realizing-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        So it wasn’t a system failure. 
                        Someone broke her out...
                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF
                        We can’t be positive but yes- and 
                        it appears whoever it was is 
                        familiar enough with our defense 
                        protocols to maneuver around them.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Stop telling me all the things they 
                        did that you can’t understand! 
                        (...) So we run forced re-entry. 
                        How long will it take?

                                 EVANS
                        About 5 minutes to activate 
                        symptoms, 10 to full cardiac 
                        arrest. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Fine. 

           Off Phyllis: overtaken, realizing there’s an enemy fighting 
           her for Lynn...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           A beautiful apartment, with a collision of time periods. In 
           the CENTER is: a HUGE ALL-GLASS GREENHOUSE- the layers of 
           PLANTS and VINES on the walls block our view in.

           Lynn’s asleep on a leather couch. Groggy, she starts to wake, 
           confused: something happened... 

           As she blinks her eyes open, she STARTLES into PANIC- and 
           she’s already up, backing away-

                                 LYNN
                        Where am I? 

           Gray jumps up, steps away: hands up, trying to steady her- 

                                 GRAY
                        Whoa, Lynn, it’s ok. My name is 
                        Gray. It’s ok- I brought you here 
                        to keep you safe. 

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Try to move slowly- you’re still 
                        very drugged. 

           Lynn turns to see- RUTH (50s/60s, grey hair, kind and fierce, 
           piercing eyes that look right through you.) Ruth smiles, both 
           amazed and unsurprised this moment has come. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I’m Ruth. I need to check your 
                        pulse- 

           As Ruth steps forward and reaches for Lynn, she jumps back- 

                                 LYNN
                        Don’t touch me! Tell me where I am-

           But Ruth is un-phased, continues sure-footed on the path...

                                 RUTH
                        You were in a life pod at Virtual 
                        Truth Industries. Now you’re out, 
                        in the real world. 

           Lynn looks like she saw ghosts. She reaches for the BLUE 
           BUTTON on her arm- but there’s nothing there- only a line of 
           TINY CUTTING SCARS on her forearm and now, her voice cracks-

                                 LYNN
                        None of my life is real...?

                                 RUTH
                        There’s a lot to explain but right 
                        now, I need you to listen to me. 
                        Your body has been infiltrated and 
                        there are hundreds of AI tracking 
                        devices in your body, sending VTI 
                        information and making it 
                        impossible for you to survive here. 
                        We need to remove them before it’s 
                        too late. 

           Lynn steadies herself on the couch, suddenly dizzy, fighting 
           off the increasing nausea and her throbbing head-

                                 LYNN
                        What...? That can’t be...

           Gray studies Lynn, trying to think of a way to assure her-

                                 GRAY
                        When you came offline- you knew to 
                        reach in your eye because of the 
                        dream, right? 

           Lynn stares, threatened: how could he know that...? 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Your grandmother planted that dream 
                        in your mind, in case you ever 
                        needed help. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been running glitches every 
                        month to break you out.

                                 RUTH
                        (firm) I need you to trust me, Lynn-

           Suddenly Lynn’s body goes SLACK, TREMBLING in a SEIZURE, 
           violently PALE- her JAW, TIGHTENING. As she starts to 
           collapse- Gray catches her and they lead her to...

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           A magical, other-worldly space, with LIVING GREEN WALLS of 
           PLANTS, VINES, MOSSES, and BLOOMS. 

           In the center: 6 DISC-LIKE LAMPS hang over what looks like an 
           ELABORATE WHITE TANNING BED- bathed in warm light. 

           Lynn (bra/underwear) lies on the table, convulsing, with 
           panicked eyes, unable to speak. Gray (gloves/glasses) 
           URGENTLY whisks around the room, preparing everything, as 

           Ruth (gloves/glasses) places a CONSTELLATION OF NEEDLES 
           around Lynn’s body: toes, shins, abdomen, eyelids, upper lip-

                                 RUTH
                        ...acupuncture needles to prepare 
                        your nervous system. You won’t feel 
                        much yet because your nerves are 
                        dormant- but as your blood wakes 
                        up, you’ll feel a slight electric 
                        movement under the skin. (off Lynn) 
                        Don’t worry- I’m going to take care 
                        of you. All set here-

                                 GRAY
                        Starting UV now...

           Gray presses a button- the lamps GLOW RED-

                                 RUTH
                        When I place this last needle- your 
                        immune system will trigger the 
                        release. Take a deep breath...

           Ruth places the needle in Lynn’s sternum- Lynn GASPS- and now- 
           TINY QUAKING BUMPS form all over Lynn’s body, and then-

           HUNDREDS of TINY METAL TICK-LIKE CREATURES CRAWL OUT from 
           underneath Lynn’s skin- skittering around, like lost ants...

           Lynn MOANS in agony as her jaw tightens, body jerks and 
           trembles, like she’s fighting against something we can’t see.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        (watching a screen) Temperature and 
                        heart rate stable- Gray, go-

           Gray pulls the RED LAMP down over Lynn’s body- the RED LIGHT 
           FLASHES and- all the CREATURES STOP, dead. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Raising for posterior-

           Ruth presses a button and now LYNN’S BODY LIFTS UP, floating 
           parallel to the table, as- Gray slides a long board under her-

                                 GRAY
                        Activating magnet-

           MORE TICKS dart down from her body, sticking to the board-

                                 RUTH
                        Clear to lower-

           Gray removes the board and lowers Lynn to the table, her body 
           finally beginning to calm... her cries, quieting...

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Begin wash-

           In what looks like a sacred act- they pour buckets of 
           saltwater over her, washing her body clean. And then, finally-

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        One last dry sweep-

           The RED LIGHT FLASHES- Lynn GASPS- her body finally stops 
           fighting, everything starts to calm. 

           After a beat, the rise and fall of her chest starts to slow, 
           as the tiny needles tremble in the light. 

           Off Ruth: as she subtly exhales, with relief...

           LATER

           Ruth sits in a chair next to Lynn, who’s in and out of sleep.  

           Lynn stirs, opens her eyes. Too weak to speak, Lynn musters 
           the strength to lift Ruth’s hand to her chest, and hold it 
           there. No words. Just Lynn, looking at Ruth- thank you...

           INT. CHIEF SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Irate, Phyllis stands, skewering Evans and the Chief, as they 
           all stare in disbelief at one screen that’s gone blank.
                                 PHYLLIS
                        That’s not possible. How could she 
                        come offline? 

                                 SURVEILLANCE CHIEF
                        We’re not sure. The reports have 
                        just stopped loading.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        But the reports continue running 
                        until 48 hours after vital failure!

                                 EVANS
                        But it doesn’t appear there’s vital 
                        failure- the reports just... stop.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I can’t express the level of the 
                        futility of information you’re 
                        giving me.(...) We can’t risk the 
                        memory thread being activated. Find 
                        and kill. I want her body in my 
                        office tomorrow morning. Black op- 
                        no backup, no reports, zero static. 

                                 EVANS
                        Ok.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Tell me you understand this has 
                        just become your life’s work. And 
                        you cannot fail.

                                 EVANS
                        (afraid) I understand.

           INT. GRAY'S OFFICE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           This room is sleek, minimal, and high-tech- everything 
           designed to be packed up and taken on the go. 

           A BLUE COUCH and 2 chairs surround a coffee table and a GROUP 
           of HOLOGRAM SCREENS is connected to Gray’s laptop. Ruth and 
           Gray drink coffee, sitting across from Lynn, looking ill. 

                                 LYNN
                        ...I need my medication. 

                                 RUTH
                        Lynn, your medication doesn’t 
                        exist. Neither does the virus. 
                                 LYNN
                        Of course it exists- almost 90% of 
                        women have it. It acts like an 
                        autoimmune disease, causes swelling 
                        of the brain, memory loss-

                                 RUTH
                        -depression, disassociation. I know- 
                        the symptoms are very real. But 
                        they’re no from a virus- they’re 
                        from what they did to you inside.

                                 LYNN
                        What happened to me...? 

                                 RUTH
                        VTI started 16 years ago. The 
                        people who’d been in power knew 
                        they were about to lose it- unless 
                        they did something drastic. 

                                 GRAY
                        The plan was basically- force the 
                        country back in time. Create a 
                        giant VR holding cell, manipulate 
                        people to get them in, promise the 
                        new American dream- then erase who 
                        they are and re-program them into 
                        who you want them to be. 

                                 LYNN
                        But how? What do you mean “re-
                        program?”

                                 RUTH
                        Memory. If you erase memory, you 
                        erase identity. Beliefs, 
                        experiences, desires- everything 
                        that creates individual power.
                        Memories are wiped within 6 days. 
                        Then VTI re-programs who they want 
                        to have power and who they don’t. 

                                 GRAY
                        And the elite that VTI wants in 
                        power are also given memory wipe 
                        ability, so- if they commit a crime 
                        against someone- they can erase the 
                        victim’s memory. So they basically 
                        do whatever the fuck they want- 
                        there’s no law for them. 
                                 RUTH
                        The programming is re-inforced by 
                        “medication”- though you were 
                        obviously an exception to this.

                                 LYNN
                        What do you mean?

                                 RUTH
                        You were never supposed to become a 
                        surgeon- they tried to stop you but 
                        the drugs never worked on you. We 
                        still don’t really understand it.

                                 GRAY
                        Right now, 70% of the country is 
                        inside- hundreds more are brought 
                        in every hour. He’s been in office 
                        16 years and if he wins a 3rd term, 
                        the damage will be irreversible- 
                        it’ll be almost impossible to 
                        survive out here. If we don’t get 
                        them out now, life as we knew it- 
                        will disappear. 

           Lynn pauses, overwhelmed from all the information, swimming 
           from disgust to terror to rage...

                                 LYNN
                        It’s obviously totally inhumane 
                        what they’re doing but- what about 
                        the people that want to be in 
                        there? I mean I must’ve had a- 
                        reason I chose to go in-

                                 RUTH
                        -No, you didn’t choose Lynn. They 
                        took you in.

                                 LYNN
                        Why...?

                                 RUTH
                        I know you can’t remember but I’ve 
                        known you since you were a girl. 
                        Your Nana- Ann- was my best friend. 
                        On the night she died, she was 
                        hours away from becoming the first 
                        female President. 

           Off Ruth’s look, Gray pulls up footage-

           ON SCREEN: Compiled CELL PHONE CLIPS OF THE CRASH- a BLACK 
           SEDAN moving across the Manhattan Bridge- 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        It was election night, she had a 
                        huge lead, it was basically over. 
                        We were on the way to the party for 
                        the announcement, her car veered 
                        off the bridge, and that was it...

           Lynn watches, increasingly disturbed as-

           ON SCREEN: the SEDAN suddenly VEERS, CRASHES through the 
           RAILING- and plunges into the river. 

                                 GRAY
                        They said she died on impact, there 
                        was a huge swing of votes, and he 
                        won.

           Now Gray plays another CLIP from a different angle- pauses it- 

           Lynn stares, a haunting realization moving over her- 

           ON SCREEN: TEEN LYNN. Riding in the back with Ann.

           Lynn opens her mouth but no words come out.

                                 RUTH
                        They said you were the only 
                        survivor. They took you in as 
                        property of the state, and then 
                        used your memory to re-program your 
                        mind- and the minds of everyone 
                        else inside VTI. 

           As Lynn moves gradually from disbelief to acceptance of this 
           haunting realization...

                                 LYNN
                        How could I not remember? How could 
                        everything inside me just be- 
                        erased? I felt so- fucking 
                        depressed and- lost but I didn’t 
                        know why. They told me I was sick-

                                 RUTH
                        There’s nothing wrong with you, 
                        Lynn, and there never was. 

                                 LYNN
                        Why did they do this to me?

           ON SCREEN: 3-D HOLOGRAM OF THE BRAIN, with LIT UP GOLD MEMORY 
           THREADS that look like a cross between a DNA CHAIN and a FILM 
           STRIP- a chain of lit-up rectangular frames that twist and 
           branch off in different directions.
                                 GRAY
                        VTI’s goal was to reprogram 
                        everyone with the same memory from 
                        the same point in time. So they 
                        needed a traumatic memory millions 
                        of people shared- and Ann’s crash 
                        fit the bill. 

           ON SCREEN: a MISSHAPEN, STAR-LIKE FRAME with a DARK CENTER-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        These star-shaped frames are 
                        traumatic memories- they’re like 
                        doors into the brain’s programming. 
                        They took your memory, reprogrammed 
                        it- 

           ON SCREEN: the STAR-LIKE FRAME is removed from the bright 
           memory thread... and when the frame is re-inserted- the RIGHT 
           THREAD GOES DARK and- a NEW THREAD LIGHTS UP and BRANCHES OUT 
           TO THE LEFT.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        ...then replaced everyone else’s 
                        memory with this one. Changed 
                        history and the future all at once.

           ON SCREEN: MILLIONS of THREADS, WITH IDENTICAL STAR-LIKE 
           FRAMES and the same T branching out...

           Lynn stares, stunned and haunted by the gravity of it.

                                 RUTH
                        We believe if we can recover your 
                        original memory, we can use it to 
                        reset their programming and get 
                        them out.

           Lynn pauses, overwhelmed by the horror and the burden... 

                                 LYNN
                        ...I don’t know. Why should we get 
                        to make that decision for them? 
                        Their lives are inside there- do 
                        you understand...? Ohmygod, Duke. I 
                        need to talk to my brother-

           Lynn watches Gray and Ruth exchange a heavy look, and then-

                                 GRAY
                        Lynn, Duke and his family are AI 
                        citizens, designed based on your 
                        specific desires and needs... I’m 
                        sorry.
           Lynn’s body hollows, realizing she has nothing, not even 
           memory- and fights off accepting it-

                                 LYNN
                        NO! He’s not real...? I don’t 
                        believe you. He’s my best friend... 
                        he’s the only person that loves me- 

                                 RUTH
                        That’s not true. Your Nana loved 
                        you very-

                                 LYNN
                        -BUT I DON’T KNOW HER! She’s not 
                        real to me! None of this is! 

           Chest heaving with pain and shock, Lynn stands up.

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t understand this 
                        but- everything I know and love is 
                        still inside there... real or not. 
                        I need some time. 

           Ruth and Gray stare as Lynn walks out...

           EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           PATROL AGENTS walk through the streets, searching. As they 
           move door to door of buildings and apartments- they hold up 
           SCANNING DEVICES- taking readings of inside.

           It’s an official manhunt but they’re keeping it under the 
           radar, blending in with State Police.

           PATROL AGENT 1 holds up his device- it SCANS- BEEPS and reads- 
           NO MATCH. As PATROL AGENT 2 passes by, they chat-

                                 PATROL AGENT 1
                        Whose tracker is this anyway?

                                 PATROL AGENT 2
                        They didn’t give an identity- just 
                        the match.

                                 PATROL AGENT 1
                        Oh. You know what they did?

                                 PATROL AGENT 2
                        Nope. No file either.
           They keep moving to the next house and as they do, we PULL 
           BACK to see other streets and boroughs of the city, where a 
           COUPLE HUNDRED Patrol Agents walk the streets...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - PHYLLIS’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           CU: footage of the search, happening in real time...

           Pull back to reveal: Phyllis (long silk pajamas) standing in 
           front of a GIANT HOLOGRAM TV, watching obsessively. It’s an 
           acute picture of her aloneness. 

           We can see the growing threat is keeping her up at night, as 
           she talks to EVANS on FACETIME, split-screen with the search-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        It’s been 36 hours- we have 
                        surveillance on every street and 
                        house in the city.

                                 EVANS 
                        -As I said- they’re either outside 
                        our tracking radius or somehow 
                        blocking our signal-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        -Which means what?

                                 EVANS 
                        Which means... we have to wait 
                        until they make a mistake.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        We don’t have the privilege of 
                        time. This could be the end. 
                        (threatening) Not just for me. 
                        Prepare the terrorist narrative- 
                        and increase roundups to 10,000.

           Pushed up against a wall, Evans stares back- he has to say it-

                                 EVANS
                        We can only process 3,000 a day-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        -Then put them in the holding 
                        facility.

                                 EVANS
                        Ma’am- the UN is watching our 
                        holding population closely.

                        That will undoubtedly provoke 
                        interference, potentially several 
                        international conflicts. It’s-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        -I don’t care what it provokes! My 
                        authority is from the President- 
                        now get them in. Start with Class D 
                        offenders and low social scores. 

           Evans STOPS, stares at his tablet, something catching his eye-

                                 EVANS
                        Wait... 

           He types a command, ZOOMS IN- and stares in disbelief.

           ON SCREEN: A single BLINKING DOT.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        There’s 1 tracker still live.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Capacity to activate?

                                 EVANS
                        ...Yes, I believe so. 

           Phyllis pauses, considering what this means... 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Close the line so only you and I 
                        have access. 

                                 EVANS
                        Are you sure? We should-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        -Yes. Do it.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - PHYLLIS’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Phyllis hangs up her robe, climbs into the neatly made bed, 
           turns off the light- and turns on the TV.

           We stay on HER FACE, as she watches. Fear burns her throat. 
           Any less restraint and she’d SCREAM- but it’s all trapped 
           inside, only visible in her EYES.
           INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - ANN'S HOUSE - EVENING - ANOTHER TIME

           A distraught Teen Lynn (hoodie, cut-offs, messy bun) sits in 
           bed, DESPERATE to hide and to be seen. Ann looks at her with 
           deeply loving eyes.

                                 ANN
                        Thank god you’re different than 
                        them! Otherwise you wouldn’t be 
                        you. What are you so afraid of, 
                        Lynny?

           Look looks back at her, the answer burning in her throat.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        I know you feel broken and scared- 
                        but I wish you could trust that you 
                        don’t have to run from yourself. 
                        You’re not perfect but you are 
                        perfectly yourself. Everything 
                        inside you belongs. I love you, in 
                        this moment and always, exactly as 
                        you are. Lynn, look at me-

           Tears in her eyes, Lynn can’t look at her...

           INT. BATHROOM - BASEMENT APARTMENT - EVENING

           Lynn turns on the bath- stares, then runs her hand under it-

           FLASH - VIOLENT RUSHING WATER, from an unclear source

           Lynn squints her eyes, shaking it off.

           LATER

           Lynn lies in the bath, staring at her body, under water. 

           FLASH - Teen Lynn on the bathroom floor, distressed-

           After a beat- Lynn pours herself over her knees, folding 
           inward, holding onto herself. 

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Under the lights, Lynn wakes, groggy- to see MARY (50s, PhD, 
           warm and an easy-going, alluring confidence) who’s sitting 
           next to her, smiling.

                                 MARY
                        Lynn- it’s so good to see you. I’m 
                        Mary.

                        I was your Nana’s therapist for 10 
                        years- friends after that. I’m here 
                        to help, with whatever you need.

                                 LYNN
                        Ok... thank you...

                                 MARY
                        Sorry I didn’t come sooner- we 
                        thought it’s best I only come at 
                        night, to minimize surveillance. 
                        But during the procedure Ruth 
                        placed a radio in your ear so you 
                        can reach me any time. Just always 
                        signal first before you speak and 
                        I’ll run a scan to make sure the 
                        line is secure. Can you feel the 
                        button?

                                 LYNN
                        (feeling in her ear) No...

                                 MARY
                        Oh, I heard you- hold on, let’s see 
                        (touches ear) Test, Lynn-

                                 LYNN
                        Oh- ya, I guess it worked.

           Mary takes a breath, looking at Lynn with loving eyes.

                                 MARY
                        I’m so glad you’re ok. I can’t 
                        imagine how jarring it’s been to be 
                        pulled out of your life like this. 
                        I lost my brother when I was 21- 
                        until then we were inseparable... 
                        like you and Duke. When he died, it 
                        felt like the world stopped. So I 
                        can’t imagine what it must be like 
                        to- choose that.

           The empathetic words spark Lynn into a spiral, wanting to 
           convince herself when she says-

                                 LYNN
                        -But he’s not dying... because he 
                        isn’t real. And that’s not my 
                        choice.

                                 MARY
                        No, of course not. I’m saying I 
                        know your love was real. And I can 
                        imagine what a huge loss this is-
           Off Lynn: torn open, staring up into Mary’s kind face...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BASEMENT APARTMENT - MORNING

           Ruth and Lynn watch the end of one of Ann’s speeches. 

           ON SCREEN: Ann on the CAMPAIGN STAGE. The crowd is ECLECTIC 
           and DIVERSE but the same hope marks their eyes and tear-
           stained cheeks.

                                 ANN
                        ...the dream was always about hope. 
                        And I will protect your right to be 
                        who you are individually so that we 
                        can become who we are meant to be 
                        together, as a country.

           The Crowd ERUPTS. Transfixed, Lynn turns to Ruth-

                                 LYNN
                        ...She’s amazing.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes.

           Lynn looks off, as if staring off the edge of a cliff...

                                 LYNN
                        I wish I could remember her. Or 
                        anything. It feels like I’m 
                        choosing to let go of everything 
                        for a promise of nothing. The truth 
                        is I don’t know how long I can stay 
                        out here, without Duke... 

                                 RUTH
                        Well the truth is you can go back 
                        in anytime, if that’s what you 
                        choose. It’s up to you.

           If what Lynn said was partly a test, then Ruth passed.

                                 LYNN
                        How am I supposed to do this when I 
                        don’t even know who I am...?

                                 RUTH
                        You will soon. I promise.
           EXT./INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - NEW YORK - DAY

           Gray unlocks a metal door, leads Lynn and Ruth into a system 
           of dimly lit tunnels, eerily abandoned but repurposed. 

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        ...VTI erases memories stored in 
                        the brain but physical trauma is 
                        unique- it stores a second copy in 
                        the body-

           INT. TANK WAREHOUSE - NEW YORK - DAY

           A barren, windowless warehouse, with 30-foot high ceilings, 
           cement floors, and at the center: a TOWERING GLASS TANK (25 
           ft. high X 10 ft. diameter) full of MISTY GREY WATER. 

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        ...the tank is designed to mimic 
                        the car plunging into the river...

           A BLACK METAL LADDER runs up the back to a PLATFORM that sits 
           10 feet over the water.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        ...so when you fall into the water, 
                        it triggers the memories in the 
                        body to wake up.

           Lynn (thin white rubber wetsuit) stands next to a BLACK LAB 
           TABLE covered with strange tools. Ruth sticks ELECTRODES all 
           over Lynn’s body as Gray fits a tight white rubber ELECTRODE 
           CAP onto her head.

                                 RUTH
                        ...As we run the shocks, the 
                        electrodes show the path the 
                        electricity takes through your 
                        body, while also activating 
                        memories. Over time, we narrow the 
                        search field until we can target 
                        the specific memory thread... 

           Gray shows Lynn a LARGE BULKY DEVICE (cross between a video 
           camera and medical equipment) on a metal table. 

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        This records the activated memories 
                        as video. Anything you see in 
                        there, we can watch out here...
           PLATFORM - Ruth and Lynn climb the ladder to the METAL 
           PLATFORM, just large enough for an ELABORATE CONTROL PANNEL 
           and the GRATE launching pad. 

                                 LYNN
                        Will it hurt...?

                                 RUTH
                        Physically, not bad- headaches, 
                        nausea, dizziness. But emotionally 
                        as the memories surface- at times 
                        you may get “stuck” inside them. 
                        But don’t worry- we start with only 
                        45 seconds and pull you out. Here- 
                        this’ll help you relax- 

           Off Lynn: wincing, as Ruth reaches into her mouth and holds 
           her cheek, as she injects a syringe into her back gum. 

           LATER

           Trembling, Lynn stands on the GRATE PLATFORM over the tank 
           and stares down into the grey water. Ruth stands behind her, 
           hand on the lever. Gray is below, recording the footage.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Here we go, Lynn. 3...2...1-

           Ruth pulls the LEVER- the grate OPENS- and Lynn FALLS through 
           the air into the tank. 

           TANK - Once Lynn’s submerged, Ruth presses a button- a 
           CIRCULAR GRATE slides across the top of the tank, effectively 
           TRAPPING Lynn under water-

           UNDER WATER - Lynn treads water, nervously waiting...

           PLATFORM - Ruth studies the control panel: Lynn’s vitals, 
           shock voltage, under-water camera visual and memory thread...

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Tank locked, vitals steady, 
                        starting shock-

           Through these sequences- UNDER WATER we see Lynn’s body shake 
           under the force of the SHOCKS, while her mind is overtaken by 
           FLASHES of MEMORIES, starting to emerge... 

           UNDER WATER - a LIGHTNING STREAK snakes across Lynn’s body, 
           LIGHTING UP the grey liquid. Lynn’s body TWISTS and JERKS 
           under the force, as she sees-

           FLASH - A strange orange light shoots through darkness, like 
           an image fighting to break through
           GROUND - Gray studies the orange light, ON SCREEN-

           UNDER WATER - SHOCK- Lynn’s face strains, her head jerks 
           back, as if under a blunt force, as she sees-

           FLASH - Blurry cylindric lights SHAKE, STRANGE VOICES ECHO

           FLASH - a BLURRY FACE, hidden behind WATER

                                 RUTH (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Bringing her up!

           TANK - A CIRCULAR GRATE SHOOTS UP from the tank floor, 
           raising Lynn to the platform. Lynn GASPS for breath, COUGHING 
           UP BLACK LIQUID. Ruth leans in front of her, guiding her back-

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Lynn- you’re ok. You’re right here. 
                        Look at me- you’re ok now.

           Off Lynn: soaking wet, her mouth covered in black liquid, 
           panting, staring up in terror. 

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           Lynn lies on the table, as Ruth fits a SLEEK WHITE 
           PROGRAMMING CROWN onto Lynn’s head- the front curves around 
           her right eye and mouth, like a futuristic half-mask of armor 
           and 2 prongs reach from her forehead to the back of her skull-

                                 GRAY 
                        The second part is a procedure I 
                        developed to add enhancements to 
                        your brain’s programming. 

                                 RUTH
                        Your memory is potentially one of 
                        the most dangerous weapons in the 
                        world- you need to be able to 
                        protect it. In there and out here-

                                 GRAY
                        Ok logging you in-

           INT. VIRTUAL JAPANESE GARDEN - LATER

           Following a MASTER TEACHER, Lynn begins learning the basics 
           of JODO- punch, kick, block, roll, repeat.
                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        The enhancements promote high-level 
                        mimicry, allowing you to learn at 
                        an extremely accelerated rate. 

           INT. TRAINING STUDIO - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           A small empty room with 3 walls of floor-to-ceiling MIRRORS 
           and the 4th, a HUGE SCREEN, where the MASTER TEACHER leads.

           Lynn holds a jodo staff, trying to repeat what she did in VR. 
           She moves rigidly, struggling to embody the movements.

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        As you train in the virtual 
                        programs, your mind-body connection 
                        will increase. Eventually anything 
                        you can do in there, you’ll be able 
                        to do out here.

           Off Lynn: frustrated with how difficult it is...

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

           Exhausted, Lynn lies on the glowing table, talking to Mary, 
           who sips a glass of wine.

                                 MARY
                        So how’s it been?

                                 LYNN
                        The training?

                                 MARY
                        All of it! You know- everything 
                        since you woke up in a glass pod, 
                        moved in with strangers, and were 
                        told nothing you knew was real? 

           Lynn smiles, finding Mary’s directness somewhat refreshing-

                                 LYNN
                        It’s been hard. And confusing. I’m 
                        still numb to so much.

                                 MARY
                        Of course. As a doctor, I can’t 
                        imagine even just my work being 
                        taken from me, let alone 
                        everything. Did you enjoy your 
                        work?
                                 LYNN
                        ...Ya. It was where I felt purpose. 
                        But it feels strange to say that 
                        now, since there were 2 parts of 
                        life I enjoyed- and neither was 
                        real.

           Mary watches Lynn as she looks away, uncomfortable. 

                                 MARY
                        You know- I hope you don’t judge 
                        yourself for your life inside. 
                        There’s no use beating yourself 
                        about it- you did your best. And it 
                        was still your life. And I’d say it 
                        was a pretty good life, at that.

                                 LYNN
                        Thanks. Ya. I guess sometimes all 
                        of this still feels- impossible.

                                 MARY
                        I understand that- but deep down 
                        you must believe, or you wouldn’t 
                        have chosen to come, right?

                                 LYNN
                        What do you mean, “chose?” (off 
                        Mary’s look) I woke up here. Gray 
                        brought me.

                                 MARY
                        Oh... I thought you came to them.

           Lynn watches Mary, clearly thrown by this, which scares Lynn-

                                 LYNN
                        No. I decided to stay after they 
                        told me what’s happening and that 
                        I’m not safe out there... (off 
                        Mary) What...?

           Mary pauses, considers her words carefully. She glances at 
           the door and then lowers her voice.

                                 MARY
                        You’ve been through so much- I just 
                        never want you to feel trapped. I 
                        love Ruth and trust her with my 
                        life but... it’s up to you how far 
                        you want to go. I’ll stand by you 
                        no matter what. Ok?
                                 LYNN
                        Ok... thanks.

           Off Lynn: wondering if she feels trapped...

           FLASH - DARK SHADOWS - a brut force hits Teen Lynn’s face-

           VIRTUAL GARDEN- Lynn’s JODO is improving- her movements 
           becoming sharp and the staff, an extension of herself.

           BACK STUDIO- Lynn follows her Teacher on SCREEN, imitating 
           the moves. She’s improving every day, becoming more fluid.

           FLASH - Teen Lynn and Ann sit on the porch in the sun, happy

           FLASH - Foreheads almost touching, Teen Lynn and Ann LAUGHING 
           so hard they’re nearly crying...

           PLATFORM - Ruth increases the voltage for the shock...

           UNDER WATER - Lynn SHOOTS BACK against the tank- her right 
           eye wincing shut, her face pulling back, her mouth straining-

           FLASH - ROUGH HANDS on her face / A GENTLE HAND on her face- 

           FLASH - Teen Lynn takes Ann’s hand, knowing it’s all changing- 

                                 TEEN LYNN ECHO (V.O.)
                        Promise we’ll still always be us?

                                 ANN ECHO (V.O.)
                        Always, always...

           VIRTUAL GARDEN- as Lynn expands to multiple disciplines, the 
           FIGHT LESSONS WEAVE TOGETHER, as the days pass... 

           On a BRIDGE, she attacks deftly with the jo staff, spins into 
           a- TEMPLE, jumps and lands a TAI KWON DO kick onto a- 
           ROOFTOP, SPARRING with her TEACHER- lands a hard punch.

           BACK STUDIO - Lynn imitates the same moves here, following 
           the Teacher on screen, matching almost every move.
           PLATFORM - Lynn lies on the platform between dives, exhausted 
           and weaker than we’ve seen her. She’s unable to focus on Ruth-

                                 RUTH (ECHO)
                        Lynn, you ok? We can stop-

                                 LYNN (ECHO)
                        No... go again...

           FLASH - RUSHING WATER / a blurry FACE / sunlight in trees

           FLASH - SUNLIGHT on a hand, reaching out a window- Ann smiles-

           FLASH - Teen Lynn makes SMALL CUTS into her ARM, looks up as- 
           Ann walks in, startles, quickly grabs a cloth-

           FLASH - A CLAUSTROPHOBIC FRENZY- wet clothes, fighting, 
           SCREAMING, rough hands on Teen Lynn’s face

           FLASH - SHAKING LIGHTS, Lynn STRAINS TO MOVE her arms and 
           legs as she looks up into BLURRY FACES.... and just as the 
           faces start to come into focus-

           FLASH - A MYSTERIOUS GIRL (16, beautiful, precocious- for now- 
           we can’t see her face clearly)

           PLATFORM - Lynn GASPS for breath, wild with ANGER from an 
           old, deep place, still CAUGHT IN MEMORY-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?! What’s happening? I 
                        was about to find something real- I 
                        couldn’t move, or talk, and there 
                        are people over me and- why did she 
                        ruin it?! I was almost there-

                                 RUTH
                        It’s ok, Lynn- it’s all important. 

                                 LYNN
                        No, she’s not important! I need to 
                        see who’s in that room. I have to- 
                        stop them!

                                 RUTH
                        It’s ok. You’re not in danger 
                        anymore- you’re right here. Look at 
                        me, Lynn-

           Finally Lynn is able to focus on Ruth, and her eyes adjust, 
           as if just now re-entering the room, from the memory...
           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           The room is dark besides the glow from a HOLOGRAM SCREEN, 
           FLOATING over Lynn. She looks disturbed as she watches:

           ON SCREEN: 

           VTI TREATMENT ROOM - eerily cold and sterile, like a 
           futuristic asylum. ROWS OF VTI CITIZENS (80 WOMEN, 20 MEN) 
           are STRAPPED DOWN to beds, with MEMORY CUFFS on their heads, 
           as they undergo the memory wipe process.

           Above each person is a HOLOGRAM SCREEN, playing the memories 
           currently being erased; rapes, assaults, affairs, blackmail-

           5 MEMORY TECHS (white gowns) roam the room, overseeing 
           things, reading info on screens that are wired to the cuffs.

           Lynn stares in horror at:

           ON SCREEN: a YOUNG WOMAN (19, dazed, terrified eyes) 
           trembling, unable to move or speak. The screen above her 
           plays the MEMORY of her RAPE being erased (she lies 
           unconscious on a bed as a MAN walks toward her...)

           A LIVE REPORT below informs: “Memory Wipe 25% complete...” 

           Ruth comes in- and off Lynn’s expression, looks at the screen-

                                 LYNN
                        She can’t even move. She has to lie 
                        there and wait to wake up. And then- 
                        she’ll feel dead inside, she’ll 
                        hate her life... but she’ll have no 
                        idea why. None of them will. 

           And it’s hard for Lynn to even utter this, but she has to-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        What if I can’t do this? 

                                 RUTH
                        You can.

                                 LYNN
                        But they need help now! Their lives 
                        are being taken right now! Every 
                        day, they’re just- erasing us. If 
                        someone doesn’t do something, we’ll 
                        disappear forever-

                                 RUTH
                        You’re doing something.
                                 LYNN
                        But I’m not- it’s taking too long! 
                        I don’t understand what I’m seeing, 
                        I don’t know if it’s working. 

                                 RUTH
                        It takes time, Lynn- you have to 
                        trust the process-

                                 LYNN
                        I woke up in a pod 6 days ago! Do 
                        you think it’s easy for me to just 
                        instantly trust you with my entire 
                        life? 

           Ruth smiles, almost amused Lynn could ask that-

                                 RUTH
                        Of course not! I don’t think any of 
                        it’s easy- I think it’s fucking 
                        absurd. All of it! What happened to 
                        you then, what we’re asking of you 
                        now, the state of the world, the 
                        fucking- tank we built! 

           Lynn softens, surprised she feels so seen and understood.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I imagine it feels like a dream you 
                        can’t wake up from. But remember- 
                        they erased your knowledge of who 
                        you are. As you gain that back, 
                        you’re going to start to feel your 
                        power- and you’ll understand it’s 
                        not about you trusting us- it’s you 
                        trusting yourself.

           This moves Lynn, unlocking the vulnerability underneath-

                                 LYNN
                        I don’t know what’s happening in 
                        there. It’s getting... darker. I 
                        feel like I’m going to die.

                                 RUTH
                        I know. But those feelings are from 
                        another time.

           Lynn takes a moment to decide if she’s going to ask this.

                                 LYNN
                        Did you know I did that... hurt 
                        myself?
                                 RUTH
                        ...Yes, Ann mentioned it. She said 
                        she could see you wrestling 
                        something inside yourself- but she 
                        was never worried. She said your 
                        inner compass was right on and she 
                        knew you’d find your way.

                                 LYNN
                        But I’m so lost now. I guess I was 
                        lost then too...

                                 RUTH
                        (smiling) Oh, no. You had your 
                        battles but- you were also 
                        precocious and funny and had this 
                        spunk- you knew exactly what you 
                        wanted, even when you were young.

           Lynn’s chest aches- if only she could feel that.

                                 LYNN
                        I’m scared I won’t remember who I 
                        am. Even though the memories are 
                        coming, I can’t feel anything yet. 

           Rock solid, Ruth takes Lynn’s hand and holds it in hers, as 
           she leans in and looks Lynn right in the eye.

                                 RUTH
                        I know you can’t see it yet but 
                        your truth is coming. 

           Off Lynn: fighting to believe Ruth is right...

           ENTER MONTAGE: as Lynn continues training...

           UNDER WATER - Lynn’s body SHOOTS BACK from the SHOCK- her 
           right eye wincing shut, pulling back, her mouth straining

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        You can’t keep secrets from the 
                        body- it knows everything...

           FLASH - Sunlight- a DRIVER (40s, arrogant, on edge) turns 
           back, a strange look on his face- 

           FLASH - Sunlight through trees / Sunlight on a hand...

                                 ANN ECHO (V.O.)
                        Lynn look at me...

           FLASH - Teen Lynn in the back of a car- sunlight filters onto 
           her hand, reaching out the window. She turns to Ann, smiling-
           FLASH - Distraught Teen Lynn finally looks up at Ann

           FLASH - Teen Lynn and Ann playfully dance in the kitchen

           UNDER WATER - Exhausted, Lynn waits for the next SHOCK...

           FLASH - ROUGH hands - PANIC in water - SHAKING LIGHTS - a 
           CIRCLE OF BLURRY FACES

           FLASH - Mysterious Girl’s face, blocked by RUSHING WATER-

           UNDER WATER - Lynn (in a weakened daze) stares at Mysterious 
           Girl’s face through the water, desperate for an answer...

           PLATFORM - Ruth hits the lever- but nothing happens.

                                 GRAY
                        Bring her up!

                                 RUTH
                        I’m trying, it’s not going!

                                 GRAY
                        Shit!

           Gray rushes up the ladder, as Ruth fights to raise the lever-

           TANK - Lynn (dying for breath) struggles against the grate 
           until- her eyes roll back, unconscious, starts SINKING-

           PLATFORM - as Gray reaches the platform, Ruth finally forces 
           open the grate and DIVES into the water, after Lynn-

           UNDER WATER - Ruth grabs Lynn and pushes off the bottom- 

           PLATFORM - They reach the surface and Gray pulls Lynn up-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Lynn! Lynn! Can you hear me...?

           Gray kneels over Lynn, unresponsive, as Ruth climbs out, 
           heaving for breath, terrified as-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        LYNN! Come on, Lynn!

           Finally- Lynn COUGHS UP water, blinks opens her eyes.

           INT. RUTH’S ROOM - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           Ruth sips wine, too distracted to read the book she’s 
           holding. Gray knocks on the open door as he leans in-
                                 GRAY
                        Tough day, huh?

                                 RUTH
                        (sarcastic) Oh...? How so?

           Gray smiles- but he’s agitated and fidgety, not sure what he 
           wants to say but sure he has to say something.

                                 GRAY
                        Hey, is this still ok? She doesn’t 
                        look good. She’s weak and 
                        disoriented and- I was scared today-

                                 RUTH
                        (an edge) Of course she doesn’t 
                        look good- she almost drowned. 
                        You’re scared it won’t work?

                                 GRAY
                        No I’m just- scared for her. I’m 
                        scared we won’t be fast enough, 
                        that we won’t get them out- I’m 
                        scared because- it’s fucking scary! 
                        And it’s working but not fast 
                        enough- and she’s already beaten 
                        up... she’s finally free and now 
                        we’re putting her through hell-

                                 RUTH
                        -But she’s not free! And she can’t 
                        be free until she knows her truth. 
                        Until we undo what they did to her. 
                        ...We’re going to get her there. 

                                 GRAY
                        Ok... Ya.

           Ruth watches him, caught in his own head. He’s not satisfied 
           with that but he knows it’s all he’s getting. Before he goes-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you were great today.

           The kindness burns Ruth’s chest. As Gray leaves, she gets up-

           INT. RUTH’S BATHROOM - BASEMENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth washes her face. As she dries it, her hands tremble and 
           when she finally looks at herself in the mirror, for a moment 
           the armor has been washed off- she was afraid today, too. 
           INT. DEN - PHYLLIS’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Phyllis stands at her desk, staring at her COMPUTER SCREEN, 
           directing Evans, who’s breaking under the stress, losing his 
           patience with her questions.

                                 EVANS 
                        We’ll have 10,000 more in tonight. 
                        We’re pushing as hard as we can.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Then we have push a different way. 
                        She’s been out a week and we have- 
                        almost nothing. And today- the 
                        physical strain on her system- we 
                        have no idea what they’re doing to 
                        her- they could kill her!

                                 EVANS
                        I doubt that- but I assume at some 
                        point they’re going to hack her in. 
                        When they do, if we kill her inside- 
                        we can pull her location outside. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I’ll work on getting them in. Make 
                        sure your team is ready.

           Phyllis’s mind is working, desperate to find a way. She pulls 
           up a PROGRAM on her phone, studying...

           She whips into action- runs to the living room- clears a 
           shelf of RELIGIOUS TEXTS-

           - A MAN (robe) wheels a BOOKCASE into the closet- takes down 
           a Protest Poster that reads “FREE VTI”

           - A MARRIED COUPLE jumps up, checks on their CHILDREN, locks

           Asleep in bed, Lynn suddenly bolts upright- surrounded by 4 
           MEN, trying to attach wires to her skull. She fights them off-

                                 LYNN
                        Nooooooooooo!

           INT. GREENHOUSE - PENTHOUSE - SAME

           Lynn bolts upright from the NIGHTMARE- takes a beat to come 
           to, just as- Mary (rain coat, hood) rushes in, sopping wet-

                                 MARY
                        Lynn, it’s ok- I’m here. 

                                 LYNN
                        Oh... I had a bad dream.

                                 MARY
                        (to herself) They don’t come check 
                        on you when you scream...? Sorry 
                        I’m late. They’re turning up 
                        tracking even more and it didn’t 
                        help it’s pouring. I’m freezing.

           Flustered, Mary tries to get settled- takes off her coat and 
           puts it aside with her umbrella. Lynn watches, concerned... 
                                 LYNN
                        Are you ok?

                                 MARY
                        Ya. It’s just- getting harder to 
                        get here. They’re- everywhere, my 
                        routes keep getting blocked. Took 
                        me 2 hours tonight. But it’s ok- do 
                        you think you can go back to sleep? 
                        I know you need to rest. 

                                 LYNN
                        Are you ok to keep coming? I don’t 
                        want you to be in danger-

                                 MARY
                        Oh, the danger is inevitable. 

           Tense, Mary takes a breath, trying to shake it off and focus-

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But enough of that- I’m glad I’m 
                        here- I heard about today. You ok?

                                 LYNN
                        Ya... just exhausted. (hopeful) But  
                        more memories are starting to come-

                                 MARY
                        Oh, so you feel good about how it’s 
                        going? Ok, good- hearing about 
                        today scared me. I was worried 
                        about you.

                                 LYNN
                        Worried about what...?

                                 MARY
                        How- intense this is. And how long 
                        it’s taking. You’re not pulling the 
                        memory and you got out today but... 
                        you’ve always struggled with pretty 
                        severe depression. I worry about 
                        them pushing your mind like this, 
                        that it’s too much... unless you 
                        think you’re getting there...?

           Lynn’s disarmed, scared and ashamed that she’s failing...

                                 LYNN
                        Ya... I don’t know...
                                 MARY
                        I want to talk to Ruth, make sure 
                        she thinks you’re- on track. Or 
                        maybe you should take a break-

                                 LYNN
                        -No. I can’t stop right now. I 
                        don’t know if- I’ll get there. But 
                        I have to keep going.

           INT. GRAY’S OFFICE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - DAY

           Ruth and Lynn put on thin black gloves and VR glasses (smart 
           glasses that enclose the eye, arms affix reach around skull) 
           as Gray loads his computer and logs them in.

                                 GRAY
                        To help you differentiate real 
                        memories from those in VTI, we’ll 
                        go into your program map, which is 
                        VTI’s record of your life inside. 
                        The idea is- anything you see in 
                        here, you can rule out as VTI. Now 
                        VTI scans for hackers by scanning 
                        entries and exits. My program works 
                        in observational mode- you don’t 
                        interact in the world, so the entry 
                        doesn’t record. Here, let’s start 
                        somewhere familiar...

           INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VTI WORLD - DAY

           Ruth and Lynn land in- A BRIGHTON HOSPITAL SURGERY ROOM 
           where: Lynn (30) and her TEAM (men), perform brain surgery on 
           a BALD MAN (60s). Lynn stares, haunted, watching herself as-

                                 LYNN
                        (breathless) My first surgery...

           - A FAMILY FIRST CRUISE- 60s BIKINI-CLAD WOMEN trounce amidst 
           MACHISMO MEN. Ruth and Lynn stand on the wood deck, and watch-

           Lynn (30, 1-piece swimsuit) standing at the railing, watching 
           the HAUNTING PERFECTION of the FLIRTING SINGLES. She presses 
           the blue button, turns away to look at the emerald spray...

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why I said yes to that 
                        program...
                                 RUTH
                        You didn’t- they curate “desires” 
                        to support the cultural programming- 
                        take a cruise, get married, and 
                        their poster-child, Kilimanjaro.

           - MT. KILIMANJARO- Ruth and Lynn stand on the epic SNOWY 
           VOLCANIC PEAK. Lynn turns toward A FAMILIAR LAUGH to reveal- 

           Lynn (25) and Duke, laughing, battling to make it to the top 
           first. Duke grabs her foot, pulls her back down into the snow- 

           Heartbroken, Lynn stares longingly at Duke’s bright smile...

                                 LYNN
                        I can’t believe he was never real-

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, I think the love was real. 
                        Maybe that’s all that matters.

           Lynn smiles, thankful for feeling seen.

                                 LYNN 
                        God, everyone always came here...

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Oh their algorithm makes sure of it- 

           Lynn reaches into the sky- catches a snowflake and watches it 
           disappear on her hand...

                                 LYNN
                        ...they’re editing humanity...

           - They land back on the PROGRAM MAP Grid-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Let’s go back to your program map. 
                        The smaller slots are some of your 
                        more uncommon choices the drugs 
                        failed to prevent- attending med 
                        school, not getting married...

           Lynn studies the maze of her program... points to a tiny slot-

                                 LYNN
                        Hey, what’s that...?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Um, looks like- I’m not sure- lemme 
                        see. Hm, the code here is 
                        strange... wait- there we go-
           EXT. CITY STREET - VTI WORLD - DAY

           The Women suddenly stand in the middle of a charming Parisian-
           like side street. Something is noticeably different.

           They look around, bewildered, start walking down the street.

                                 RUTH
                        Where are we, Gray...?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        I’m not sure... I’m trying to find 
                        your location...

           But now- Mysterious Girl turns onto the street ahead of them, 
           looks back over her shoulder- laughs- 

                                 MYSTERIOUS GIRL (ECHO)
                        Come on!

           She smiles brightly, just as she DISAPPEARS behind a corner. 
           Ruth’s confused; Lynn’s frozen. They stop- SOMETHING’S OFF. 
           They both sense it.

                                 LYNN
                        Was she talking to us? I thought we 
                        can’t interact...

                                 RUTH
                        Ya, this doesn’t look right. Let’s-

           Suddenly- an UNMARKED BLACK VAN SCREECHES around a corner and 
           barrels toward them down the street-

                                 LYNN
                        Who is that...?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        I don’t know! What the fuck!

                                       LYNN
                              GRAY, LOG US OUT!
                  RUTH
           Can they see us, Gray?! Are 
           they coming at us?!

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Shit- I CAN’T! Nothing’s working! 
                        You’re off the VTI program- you’re 
                        in- something else!

                                 RUTH 
                        What do you mean we’re not in VTI?!
           INT. GRAY'S OFFICE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - SAME

           PANICKED- Gray tries code after code- as he watches them 
           standing on the street, the Van approaching...

                                 GRAY
                        I don’t know- it wasn’t a real 
                        location. Get outta there- NOW!

           EXT. STREET - CITY - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           The women SPRINT down the street- 

                                 RUTH
                        Where do we go?!

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Um- fuck, ok- end of the street- 
                        take a left down the side street- 

           They take a left onto a small walk street- like a NARROW 
           CANYON between colorful apartments- 

           The Van SCREECHES to a halt- 6 AGENTS (armed, black uniforms) 
           jump out and SPRINT down the side street after them- 

                                 GRAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Last apartment on your right- red

           They hurry down the block to the RED DOOR and- 

           INT. VARIOUS - SPANISH APARTMENT - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           BURST INSIDE- Lynn locks the door behind them. A single beat 
           to catch her breath, thinking-

                                 LYNN
                        Wait- what happens if they kill us?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        They’ll be able to pull our 
                        location. Hurry- go straight back 
                        to the kitchen- white bench by the 
                        table- should be 2 guns inside.... 

           They run through the LIVING ROOM into a country KITCHEN with 
           a breakfast nook and benches surrounding an old table- 

                                 GRAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Lynn- small hook by the back door- 
                        grab the 2 black keys-
           Ruth opens the 2 corner benches- searches through stacks of 
           old flowered linens as Lynn grabs the keys from the hooks-

                        reading them- maybe underneath...?

           EXT. SPANISH APARTMENT - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           The TEAM OF AGENTS runs down the narrow street, approaching-

           INT. KITCHEN - SPANISH APARTMENT - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth digs- finds a LOWER COMPARTMENT- opens it and pulls out 
           2 GUNS- checks to see if they’re loaded, hands one to Lynn-

                                 RUTH
                        Let’s go-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        They’re out front- gotta lead you 
                        out through the roof- go upstairs 
                        to the master bedroom-

           They run upstairs, through a LARGE AIRY, BEDROOM- knock over 
           a clothing rack of blouses and dresses, on their way into- 

           INT. BATHROOM - SPANISH APARTMENT - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           A large, wide-open airy white space with a HUGE, FLOOR-TO-
           CEILING GLASS WINDOW next to the free-standing tub.

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Should be a door to the balcony, 
                        will take you to the roof-

                                 RUTH
                        What?! There is no door.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Agents BURST INSIDE and spread out, tearing the place apart-

           BATHROOM

           The women stand there, still frozen in place, puzzled... 
                                 LYNN
                        Gray, which way is the balcony?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        It’s straight ahead! 

                                 LYNN
                        I don’t think it’s a door...

           Before Ruth can react- Lynn runs OS, then SPRINTS BACK 
           THROUGH AND CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW- breaking out onto-

           EXT. BALCONY - SPANISH APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Holy shit! Ok- far right corner, 
                        there’s a ladder that’ll get you 
                        down to the street-

           They RUN across the balcony- JUMP OVER the railing to the 
           terra-cotta rooftop- SPRINT over the tiles to the far side- 
           to the small WHITE METAL LADDER- climb down it-

                                 RUTH
                        Gray, if next time you can find a 
                        smaller, older ladder, that’d be 
                        great...

           The Agents reach the roof- guns-drawn, searching, just as-

           EXT. STREET - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           The Women jump down to the street. Against the brick building- 
           are 2 BLACK TRIUMPH motorcycles amidst a smattering of bikes.

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        The black bikes- straight ahead- 
                        subway’s 6 blocks east- go!

           Lynn tosses a key to Ruth- they jump on- FIRE UP THE ENGINES 
           and SCREECH away, just as Agents OPEN FIRE from the ROOF...

           EXT. STREET - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           On the bikes, weaving through cars, racing down the street-

           INT. GRAY'S OFFICE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - SAME

           Lynn and Ruth, sweating in their chairs, their bodies swaying 
           slightly, with the movement of the “bikes”...
                                 RUTH
                        Where the fuck are we going, Gray?!

           Gray watching the monitors, searching for the answer, as-

           EXT./INT. UNDERGROUND SUBWAY - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           COP CARS SKID out onto the street, in pursuit-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Gotta buy time while I figure it 
                        out- stairs on the left right- NOW!

           They BOMB DOWN the stairs- PEOPLE JUMP out of the way- they 
           SKID past a CELLIST performing- as the TRAIN’s DOORS close-

                                 LYNN
                        Go inside?!

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        No- follow it! Stay right behind it 
                        on the track-

           The Agents run down the STAIRS just as-

           INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           They JUMP the BIKES into the subway tunnel, CHASING THE TRAIN 
           through the darkness-

                                 LYNN
                        Where are we, Gray?!

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        I think it was a memory trap- Lynn, 
                        that girl that popped up- she’s the 
                        one from the tank?

                                 LYNN
                        Ya... I think so...

                                 GRAY
                        But you don’t know if she was real?

                                    GRAY (CONT'D)
                  LYNN
           No, I’m not sure-
                              -FUCK! GET TO THE RIGHT!

           They edge over as ANOTHER TRAIN screams by the other way- 

                                 GRAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        500 feet take the ramp on the right-
           INT. EVANS' OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           HIGH TENSION in here as Evans and Phyllis oversee the chase 
           as Evans gives orders to Agents inside.

                                 EVANS
                        Surround all the tunnel branches! 

           ON SCREENS: Lynn deftly weaves through the dark tunnel-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        How is she doing this...?

                                 EVANS
                        They enhanced her programming... 
                        which means they’ve been training 
                        her for inside.

           Off Phyllis: as the threat continues to grow out of control-

           EXT. STREET - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           They race out of the tunnel- up a graffitied ramp- to the 
           streets- 2 COP CARS FLASH on their lights, following-

                                 RUTH
                        Gray, they’re everywhere-

                                 LYNN
                        This way!

           Lynn takes a sharp turn up a SPIRAL RAMP of a HOTEL PARKING 
           LOT- up to the roof- where a BLACK TIE PARTY is taking place-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        The elevator- there-

           They WEAVE through the crowd over to the ELEVATOR, press the 
           button- waiting... BING- they drive inside- slam the button- 
           1 of the Cops spots them just as- the DOORS CLOSE-

           INT. HUGE ELEVATOR - HOTEL - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           They sit on their bikes, riding down. In the MIRROR on the 
           back wall, Lynn studies herself: her sweaty face, her heaving 
           chest. She smiles, surprised she likes what she sees...

           FLASH - the Mysterious Girl turns- water behind her- and for 
           the first time- we CAN SEE HER FACE: WARM AND LOVELY...

           Lynn stares past herself, into another time, and whispers-
                                 LYNN
                        Claire... (confident) Gray- if I’m 
                        not in VTI, I can die right?

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Ummm, no, not necessarily...

                                 LYNN
                        Ya, if this is a memory- then I’m 
                        in a separate program. If I die in 
                        here, I’ll exit back into VTI- then 
                        you can log us out-

                                 RUTH
                        But can they trace the exit?

                                 LYNN
                        No, they’ll be stuck on the 
                        interior program, right? They’re 
                        chasing us in the memory, not VTI-
                        so they won’t have our location-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        (scared) Agh, I don’t- fuck! Yes, I 
                        think so but- you could be in 
                        multiple programs- I don’t know 
                        where they overlap. Plus I’m not 
                        positive it’s a real memory-

                                 LYNN
                        -it is. At least the girl is. (the 
                        weight of this drops.) Can you get 
                        us back to where she was?

                                 RUTH
                        And then what...? 

                                 LYNN
                        (calmly) And then you’re going to 
                        shoot me.

           BING - the elevator opens, and-

           EXT. CITY STREETS - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           They BLAST out onto the streets- weaving through pedestrians-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Right at the light... 

           TIGHT TURN- Lynn skids out, almost parallel to the ground- 
           but manages to pull it up- and approach the first street-
                                 GRAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ok, straight ahead... 

                                 LYNN
                        Ya, this is it...

           They ditch their bikes and RUN down to the corner- then stand 
           there, looking around, waiting for her to appear...

                                 RUTH
                        Lynn, I don’t know-

                                 LYNN
                        No, it’s ok.

           They turn and- sure enough- it’s so strange... like déjà vu 
           but more INTENSE: Claire turns away, laughing, just as before- 

           Lynn halts- overtaken with feeling, desperate to SEE back in 
           time...

                                 CLAIRE (ECHO)
                        Come on...!

                                 LYNN
                        (quietly) Ready Ruth...? (to 
                        Claire) Hey- hold on!

           Claire turns back and Lynn reaches out her hand- Claire 
           pauses as- hands SHAKING, Ruth AIMS THE GUN AT LYNN and-

                  RUTH
                                    GRAY (O.S.)
           (terrified) Jesus Christ...
                              Fuck me...

           The Agents are closing in from all sides- just as-

                                 LYNN
                        (quietly) ready, Gray- 3...2...

           LYNN TAKES CLAIRE’S HAND- and the MOMENT THEY TOUCH-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        1- 

           Ruth SHOOTS LYNN POINT BLANK- LYNN FALLS- 

                                 RUTH
                        NOOOOOOOO-

           BLACK SCREEN, then- a FLICKER of LIGHT, and- 

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Logging off-
           INT. GRAY'S OFFICE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - SAME

           Gray is losing his shit- barely breathing. Turns to them-

                                 GRAY
                        Are you out?! 

           Ruth whips off her glasses- and FRANTICLY turns to Lynn-

                                 RUTH
                        LYNN! Are you out?!

                                 LYNN
                        ...Ya, I’m good.

           Ruth falls back with relief, catching her breath, as Lynn 
           pulls off her glasses. Gray whips back to the screen-

                                 RUTH
                        Fuck... did they track it?!

           ON SCREEN: NOTHING- just an EMPTY CORNER. It’s clear. 

                                 GRAY
                        ...think we’re good.

           A BEAT, catching their breath- it was so fucking close. Then-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        ...How’d you know she was real?

                                 LYNN
                        I just- felt it. But I still don’t 
                        know who she is.

           INT. EVANS' OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           ON SCREEN: the Agents standing on the same STREET CORNER. 

           Phyllis stare as Evans scans through the codes- then, finally-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Did we get it?!

                                 EVANS
                        Ya, we’ll be able to pull it. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        How long will it take?

                                 EVANS
                        A few hours should do it.
                                 PHYLLIS
                        Good. I want so many agents on her 
                        body that they’re complaining 
                        they’re fucking bored. And whoever 
                        these people are- destroy them.

           EXT. NYC STREETS - VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

           Snow falls over the city. The quiet and dark is EERY, like 
           3/4 of this once-thriving city’s power was cut. 

           A FLEET OF BLACK VANS snake through the dark... 

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Lynn (wearing the programming crown) lies on the table, 
           sweating. Her face STRAINS and body twitches occasionally as-

           INT. VIRTUAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           On a BRIDGE, Lynn SPARS with her Teacher, matching every 
           move, anticipating his strikes, surprising on the attack. 
           She’s impressive: finally, a fighter.

           INT. KITCHEN - BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lynn stands by the counter, drinking a glass of water. Ruth 
           comes in, noticing Lynn’s pensive look.

                                 RUTH
                        Today was scary I know, but you did 
                        great in there. The enhancements 
                        are working- it’s coming. Can you 
                        feel it?

                                 LYNN
                        Ya... in some moments I’m actually 
                        scared of it, finally knowing what 
                        happened. It was different when I 
                        couldn’t remember but now... I’m 
                        starting to feel her again...

           Ruth smiles, impressed by how far Lynn’s come.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m seeing more of Ann in you, 
                        every day- you have the same easy 
                        wisdom she did- a comfort with your 
                        own power. And yes, it’s going to 
                        hurt- for me, too. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT'D)
                        But the pain of the truth is going 
                        to be far less than the pain of 
                        lies you’ve been living in. You 
                        deserve a chance to feel it. You 
                        must- it’s the only way you can be 
                        free.

           Off Lynn: knowing that she’s right. And that it’s coming...

           INT. GREENHOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - LATER

           Mary sits down next to Lynn. Tonight she can’t hide a harsh 
           edge, sharpened by worry.

                                 MARY
                        Ruth told me about the chase. 

                                 LYNN
                        Ya... It was scary but- at least 
                        it’s starting to work...

                                 MARY
                        (sharp) In what regard?

                                 LYNN
                        I’m starting to remember. (off 
                        Mary) What...?

           Mary fidgets, the worry in her spilling over-

                                 MARY
                        Lynn, you’re so tired you don’t 
                        even look like yourself. They’re 
                        pushing too hard- it’s taking a 
                        toll. And sure, you remembered 
                        something today- that may or may 
                        not be real. And I just worry- if 
                        this doesn’t work, what kind of 
                        life will you have left out here? 
                        You’ll have nothing.

                                 LYNN
                        But nothing I had in there was real-

                                 MARY
                        (scattered) Right. Sorry, I just- 
                        was looking through your memory 
                        files today and watched that time 
                        you and Duke were running over the 
                        bridge in the rain and got soaking 
                        wet... you just looked so happy. 
                        It’s hard to see you like this. I 
                        just want you to be ok.
           Off Lynn: remembering the moment... her mind, working...

                        Let’s go-

                        I thought you were resting today.

                        Ya, your body’s tired, Lynn. And we 
                        should talk about how you’re

                                 LYNN
                        -What’s coming up is I want to know 
                        what the fuck they erased from my 
                        body. And I want to finish this.

           INT. TANK WAREHOUSE - NEW YORK - LATER

           PLATFORM - Exhausted, Lynn (triangle of ELECTRODES on her 
           sternum) catches her breath between dives as Ruth coaches her- 
                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        This is your destiny unfolding... 

           TANK - Lynn drops into the tank, without a splash-

           UNDER WATER - Lynn calmly treads water and then... SHOCK-

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        Trust it, surrender to it, and do 
                        not brace... it will come...

           She gets blown back- SLAMMING against the back of the tank-

           FLASH - Foreheads almost touching, Teen Lynn and Ann LAUGHING 
           so hard they’re nearly crying...

           PLATFORM - a SOUND in the distance- Ruth looks up, listening-

                                 RUTH
                        What was that? You have anything?

           20 STATE AGENTS tear apart the apartment, searching for Lynn,  
           confiscating equipment and dusting for prints as they go-

                        Come on, let’s go- I want names!

                        Matching prints now, loading files-

           GRAY’S VTI ROOM - Finding nothing here, the Agents move on...

           INT. EVANS’ OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           This SECRET OP is growing: 8 SECURITY AGENTS working now as- 
           Evans and Phyllis tensely watch the search on his SCREENS. 

           Tormented, Phyllis stares at the Agents in the greenhouse...

                                 PHYLLIS
                        What is it...?
                                 EVANS
                        Looks like a lab...

           A Security Agent rushes over, hands Evans a TABLET-

                                 SECURITY AGENT  
                        Sir- 2 identities confirmed-

           ON SCREEN: PHOTOS and FILES of GRAY AND RUTH 20 years earlier-

                                 EVANS
                        (reading) Gray Johnson and Ruth M. 
                        Byers. Johnson, VTI Programmer when

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Fucking Christ- how didn’t we know 
                        about her? What else?

                                 EVANS
                        (confused) That’s it. (to Agent) 
                        Nothing else for the past 20 years?

                                 SECURITY AGENT 
                        No, Sir- whatever they’ve been 
                        doing, they’ve stayed completely 
                        off-grid.

                                 EVANS
                        Then start here- track down every 
                        past residence, friend, anywhere 
                        they might go, anyone they might 
                        contact- now.

                                 SECURITY AGENT
                        Yes, Sir-

                                 LEAD AGENT (O.S.)
                        No asset in the building- but we 
                        found an entrance to a tunnel 
                        system. How should we proceed?

           As Evans turns to Phyllis for the call, the desperation 
           pushes her past a breaking point.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Blow it open.

           Evans hesitates, assuming she can’t actually be saying-
                                 EVANS
                        There’s more than 1,000 residents 
                        in this building alone- easily 
                        10,000 in range of these tunnels-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        DO IT!

           He physically falls back, afraid of her. And then-

                                 EVANS
                        Infiltrate tunnels and set devices 
                        to detonate, over.

           In the back seat, Teen Lynn smiles, watching the light dance 
           on her hand, as she reaches out the window. She turns to Ann 
           (red suit) who looks back with a sparkle in her eye. 

                                 TEEN LYNN
                        You’re gonna change the world,

                        You are too, Lynny.

           The Driver turns back, a strange look on his face. Suddenly 
           he JERKS THE WHEEL and now it all happens so fast- the CAR 
           BASHES FULL-SPEED through the RAILING- air-borne- and PLUNGES 
           INTO THE RIVER. ECHOING SCREAMS, WATER everywhere- 

           In a PANIC- Teen Lynn desperately FIGHTS HER WAY OUT of the

           Gray franticly searches his monitors for a way out. Torn,

           Teen Lynn and Ann grab onto each other, as 3 DARK SHADOWS 
           (the Driver and 2 UNKNOWN MEN) swim toward them from above...

           - AGGRESSIVE COMMOTION- Lynn and Ann separated, as- UNKNOWN 
           MAN 1 hits Lynn’s right eye- as Lynn sees the Driver grab Ann- 
           and then Unknown Man 2 brings a NEEDLE toward Ann’s neck-

           free and manages to push Unknown 1 off Lynn, who turns as- 
           The NEEDLE PLUNGES INTO ANN’S NECK- Ann’s eyes and body go 
           limp- the life leaving her eyes...

           Lynn’s violently pulled away to the surface by the Driver.

                        NOOOOO! NOOO! NANA!

           Fighting tears, Ruth pulls Lynn’s wild, heaving wet body into 
           her arms, trying to pull her back from the memory. 

                                 RUTH
                        Lynn, you’re ok. It’s over- Lynn, 
                        look at me-

           Ruth helps Lynn into a coat, then leads her down the ladder. 
           Gray finishes loading LARGE BAGS OF GEAR and before they go, 
           he sticks TINY ADHESIVE TRACKERS on Lynn and Ruth’s necks-

           A LEAD AGENT (smart glasses) follows the 3 BLINKING DOTS- 
           they DISAPPEAR and he pauses, halting the Agents behind- they 
           BEGIN blinking again- and they continue...
           INT. EVANS' OFFICE - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           ON SCREEN- Agents move through tunnels, setting devices-

           An ALARM RINGS- Evans stops- like his blood just went cold- 
           as he stares. Off his look, Phyllis stares:

           ON SCREEN- the right MEMORY THREAD LIGHTING UP, like a long 
           film strip, the frames SPARKING FULL OF LIFE.

                                 EVANS
                        She recovered the memory- and the 
                        programming is activated. We can’t 
                        kill her- we have to bring her in.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        What do you mean?

                                 EVANS
                        The activated memory is like an 
                        open door. If we kill her now- we 
                        risk someone else getting into the 
                        control center. We have to 
                        deactivate the thread first.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?! 
                        What’s so hard for you about doing 
                        your one job?

           Wild-eyed, Phyllis picks up his glass and SMASHES it into the 
           wall, cutting her hand in the process. Evans steps back as-

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        Cover every inch of that tunnel 
                        system- and run the narrative now. 
                        I want every citizen in the country 
                        to know what a sick-minded 
                        terrorist she is, to fear her being 
                        alive in their city and to cheer 
                        when we end her life.

           INT. CENTRAL UNDERGROUND TUNNEL GATEWAY - NEW YORK - LATER

           Lynn, Ruth, and Gray SPRINT through the tunnels- come to an 
           CIRCLE where the 3 tunnels meet- each has a LARGE METAL GATE.

           At the SOUTH GATE- Gray types in a code that unlocks a SCREEN- 
           it scans his face- the gate opens and they go through... 
           INT. SOUTH UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - NEW YORK - LATER

           They run to a blue 86 LAND CRUISER, waiting in the dark, 
           STOCKED for this very purpose: water, food, tech, WEAPONRY. 

           Ruth and Gray jump in front and Gray pulls out 2 TABLETS-

           TABLET 1- Ruth watches a LIVE MAP of Agents in the North and 
           East tunnels, running toward the tank. Ruth types a code- the 
           West Gate opens...

                                 RUTH
                        Closing North and East, opening 
                        West-

                                 LYNN
                        Where are we going...?

           TABLET 2- Gray watches an ELECTRIC SCHEMATIC of the tank.

                                 GRAY
                        Accessing charge... and boosting-

           EXT./INT. TANK WAREHOUSE - NEW YORK - CONTINUOUS

           Lead Agent gives a signal and 2 AGENTS run a CHARGE ON THE 
           LARGE METAL DOOR- stand back and... it BURSTS OPEN-

           They push inside and Lead Agent (bewildered) STOPS SHORT, 
           staring at the strange tank- as his TEAM spreads out.

                                 LEAD AGENT
                        What...the...fuck...?

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - VTI HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Phyllis (horrified) and Evans (mind-blown) physically lean 
           into his screens, staring at the tank, platform, etc. 

                                 LEAD AGENT (O.S.)
                        Ma’am, still no asset- but 
                        there’s... are you seeing this...?

                                 EVANS
                        What- the- fuck is that...? 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Yes I see it! How are we tracking 
                        their heart-rates if they’re not in 
                        there?! GO FIND HER!
                                 EVANS
                        I want all checkpoints, exits, anti-
                        state alerts, full city search- 
                        someone find me her fucking face! 

           INT. LAND ROVER - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - SAME

           As they fly through the tunnels, Gray watches the Agents ON 
           SCREEN, timing the FLOOD...

                                 GRAY
                        They’re in. Here we go- 10 seconds-

                                 RUTH
                        5 minutes out from Pegasus- did you 
                        confirm they’re running the story?

                                 GRAY
                        Yep, they confirmed-

                                 LYNN
                        What’s Pegasus? Where are we going? 

           INT. TANK WAREHOUSE - NEW YORK - CONTINUOUS

           Agents confiscate equipment as- SPARKS SHOOT through the TANK-

                                 LEAD AGENT
                        (jumping back) GET BACK! 

           The Agents turn as... A LOW RUMBLING-- ANOTHER SPARK through 
           the tank and... BOOM! The TANK SHATTERS and WATER FLOODS out-

                                 LEAD AGENT (CONT’D)
                        ABORT, ABORT! 

           INT. LAND CRUISER - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - LATER

           Ruth drives takes a STEEP INCLINE to a LARGE GATE. Ruth taps 
           in a CODE, the gate opens- opening to a LOWER TUNNEL SYSTEM.

                                 GRAY
                        2 minutes out- almost there-

                                 LYNN
                        ...won’t they be waiting for us...?

           EXT. VARIOUS TUNNELS - NEW JERSEY/NEW YORK - CONTINUOUS

           TEAMS OF AGENTS prepare blockades, at all different tunnels-
           INT. LAND CRUISER - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - LATER

           As they near the exit, Lynn leans forward, starting to make 
           out a SCENE OF FLASHING LIGHTS, trucks, people etc. 

                                 RUTH
                        Gray, you’re sure our guys are 
                        here? And they ran the story?

                                 GRAY
                        They’re here- ya, they ran it-

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           TENSION IS THICK- as long as they don’t make a mistake, 
           they’ll have her. Phyllis stands in back, overseeing like a 
           predator, ready to pounce on anyone that threatens this.

           The Security Teams on HIGH ALERT, searching every angle, as- 

           ON SCREENS: TEAMS of AGENTS surrounding tunnel exits.

                                 EVANS
                        All teams hold position- 

           An AGENT watching a different screen signals Evans- 

                                 AGENT 3
                        Hey, boss...? 

           Phyllis watches Evans rush over and freeze, can’t believe it-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        What is it? Pull it up-

           The Agent transfers it up to the big screen-

           ON SCREEN: an INDEPENDENT REPORTER of a WEB NEWS OUTLET- 
           standing at the Tunnel Exit, filming a LIVE BREAKING REPORT-

                                 INDEPENDENT REPORTER
                        ...shocking report that Lynn 
                        Roberts, granddaughter of late 
                        Presidential Nominee, Ann Roberts, 
                        has exited VTI. We’ve confirmed she 
                        is alive, healthy and we’re 
                        awaiting her official return into 
                        New York City any moment...

           Phyllis’s face falls dark, as Evans looks to her for the call-
                                 PHYLLIS
                        We can’t kidnap her on a live feed 
                        as the public is celebrating her 
                        fucking return- get out! Send teams 
                        to follow! 

           Now Evans is on the move, SCREAMING the new orders-

                                 EVANS
                        HOLD THE NARRATIVE! Who the fuck is 
                        on it- hold it! Did you run it yet?

                                 SECURITY AGENT 1
                        No, Sir- about to-

                                 EVANS
                        HOLD IT! DO NOT RUN IT! Back out- 
                        visible Agents proceed as security-
                        FUCK! 

           INT. LAND ROVER - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL SYSTEM - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth slows at the STEEL GRATED GATE, as they approach the 
           CROWD at the exit, on the other side. Before they go through-

                                 RUTH
                        Ok, Lynn. The reporters are going 
                        to question you- just say hello and 
                        you’re happy to be home.

                                 LYNN
                        If they know I’m out, won’t that 
                        kill me...? 

                                 RUTH
                        For now it’ll keep you alive. 

           Ruth enters a code and they drive out. The CROWD lunges, 
           snapping photos, filming- and the State Agents FALL BACK...

                                 REPORTERS
                        Lynn, how does it feel to be back 
                        in New York after 16 years? Lynn! 
                        Lynn what happened during the crash 
                        that day? What is it like inside?

                                 LYNN
                        (stunned) I feel good to be out. 
                        VTI isn’t a dream- it’s a nightmare 
                        and the citizens are prisoners.
           THE CROWD ERUPTS as Ruth drives away. Lynn looks back at the 
           PEOPLE gathered along the road, holding SIGNS: “Free Lynn” 
           and “Lynn’s truth = America’s truth” and “Finally.”

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Phyllis looks physically sick, considering if this is the 
           beginning of her end. As she watches Lynn drive away in the 
           car, she stumbles back into a chair, breathless with fear.

                                 EVANS
                        Aerial tracking- do not let them 
                        out of our sight!

           EXT. PEGASUS HELIPAD - NEW YORK - LATER

           2 MEN (suits) help load Ruth and Gray into the PEGASUS 
           HELICOPTER (futuristic eVTOL, looks like a helicopter/jet 
           hybrid.) Before Lynn climbs in, she tries yet again-

                                 LYNN
                        Gray, where are we going?!

                                 GRAY
                        To get you safe- get in!

           Lynn climbs in and as they lift off, a STATE HELICOPTER rises 
           into the air to follow them...

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           The entire room is heavy with tension as everyone watches 
           Pegasus lift into the air... followed by a State Helicopter.

           A PHONE RINGS and moments later- Evans walks back to Phyllis.

                                 EVANS 
                        They’re asking for you upstairs...

           Unsurprised, Phyllis takes a moment to think, and then...

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I want unilateral control of the 
                        tracker- destroy all the reports.

                                 EVANS
                        (unsure) Ok...
           INT. LARGE GOVERNMENT OFFICE - LATER

           Soundproof walls, no windows- a place for things that needs 
           to happen with no record. Phyllis waits at a LARGE TABLE as-

           SIMONS enters (navy suit, arrogant, enjoys this), followed by 
           5 OFFICIALS. He’s already talking as he sits across from her-

                                 SIMONS 
                        (sarcastic) Lynn Roberts taking 
                        news interviews today was a shock, 
                        considering she was supposed to be 
                        eliminated- what- a decade ago?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I was approved time for research on 
                        her to develop Sopor, which, as you 
                        know, is currently administered to 
                        the entire VTI population. And I’m 
                        sorry- who are you?

                                 SIMONS
                        Sopor was completed 5 years ago. 

           It’s subtle but Phyllis is showing some cracks- a twitch of 
           annoyance that she’s being uncovered.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I’d prefer to continue working 
                        directly with the President on this- 

                                 SIMONS
                        You must be confused- the President 
                        has no knowledge of this program 
                        nor Roberts’ current breach and is 
                        unaware we’re meeting. 

                                 PHYLLIS
                        It’s on national news she exited- 
                        you’re claiming he’s unaware?

                                 SIMONS
                        He’ll be briefed soon. In any case, 
                        there are concerns you’ve developed 
                        some sort of- alternate motivation 
                        for not eliminating her...

           Off Simons’ nod- an Official pulls up an assortment of CLIPS 
           that reveal a whole other level of OBSESSION of this manhunt:

           ON SCREEN:

           - Phyllis (pod suit) stands outside Lynn’s pod, watching her
           - Phyllis at her desk, watching her SCREEN: Lynn walks to 
           work through the familiar State Plaza...

           - Phyllis sitting in bed late at night, drinking wine and 
           watching a SCREEN- Lynn, floating in her pod...

           - Phyllis watching Lynn every day- every spare moment, every 
           time she thinks no one’s watching. Her expression rides a 
           line between passionate obsession and violent hatred.

           Phyllis blanches with shame that quickly boils to anger-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        You’ve been following me? I want to 
                        speak to the President right now.

                        Our orders were from the President. 
                        The threat Roberts now poses- was 
                        never supposed to exist. And if she 
                        gains access to the control center, 
                        the President will have to give the 
                        public a reason how such terrible 
                        “inhumane” things could happen- and 
                        you will be that reason.  

           Phyllis stares, dazed in horror, her reality vanishing...

                                 PHYLLIS
                        ...He told me to do this.

                                 SIMONS
                        And now I’m telling you to fix it. 
                        By the way I’m Rick Simons, you’ll 
                        now be reporting to me and we’ve 
                        relocated your team. Shall we...?

           As Phyllis follows him out, it’s clear if she was made of any 
           less steel, she would vomit. 

           INT. HELICOPTER - SKIES OVER ATLANTIC - LATER

           SHOCK and GRIEF hang heavy on Lynn’s body.

           Gray hesitates, anxious Lynn needs time they don’t have and  
           also hopeful the end is finally in sight.

                                 GRAY
                        Once we reach EU air space, we get 
                        an extra 3 minutes in tracking 
                        delay. So you have 9 minutes to get 
                        into the programming studio, load 
                        the memory, and get out.

                        (off her look) Lynn, are you ok?

                                 LYNN
                        Ya, just exhausted.

                        but- you did it. It’s happening.

                                 RUTH
                        I know it’ll take time to process 
                        everything but- you were amazing 
                        today. And we’re almost there.

           Gray and Ruth look hopefully at Lynn, still reeling...

           EXT. REAR BATHROOM - HELICOPTER - LATER

           Lynn comes out of the bathroom- startles at MARY’S VOICE-

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        (urgent) Lynn it’s Mary. Don’t say 
                        anything- just go to the back and 
                        lock the door.

           INT. BACK COMPARTMENT - PEGASUS HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

           Confused, Lynn walks back and CLOSES THE DOOR, keeping quiet- 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Lynn- you can’t let them hack you 
                        in like this- it’s fucking 
                        reckless! I found out if VTI kills 
                        you in there- they’ll have control 
                        of your mind. 

                                 LYNN
                        What? Are you sure...?
                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        When I confronted Ruth, she lost it- 
                        and cut me out. Something’s wrong. 
                        (...)Do you feel better, after 
                        pulling the memory? Are you ok now? 

                                 LYNN
                        (overwhelmed) I don’t know... 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Fuck. This is what I was afraid of. 
                        (reluctant) Are you sure you felt 
                        the liftoff during take off?

                                 LYNN
                        (confused) I don’t- remember. Why?

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Because right now we have no idea 
                        what’s real! And gravity’s one of 
                        the hardest things to mimic in 
                        pods... Are you sure you saw the 
                        whole memory in the water?

                                 LYNN
                        Wait, what are you- ohmygod do you 
                        think we’re back inside...? Mary, 
                        what are you saying?

                                 MARY
                        ...I’m saying I’m scared. I’ve 
                        known Ruth 20 years and never seen 
                        her like this. She’s had access to 
                        your brain and the programming and 
                        the memories... is there any way 
                        you can be absolutely sure you’re 
                        out?

           Stricken by the threat... Lynn’s body empties as she searches 
           for any possible answer but-

                                 LYNN
                        ...No...

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Ok. I’m going to find out but you 
                        have to stall. And be careful. They 
                        can’t know we’re talking or they’ll 
                        cut our line.

           Off Lynn: spiraling with the fear that she doesn’t know 
           what’s real or who she can trust...
           INT. FRONT COMPARTMENT - HELICOPTER - LATER

           Gray and Ruth sleep in their seats, then STARTLE SUDDENLY at-

           Lynn standing over them, pointing a GUN at them, her hands 
           SHAKING from the WILD STORM raging inside her.

           Gray freaks out- jumping back. Ruth fights to remain still, 
           trying to calm whatever force has taken Lynn.

                                 LYNN
                        HOW DO I KNOW YOU’RE REAL?! How do 
                        I know we’re outside right now? 
                        PROVE THIS IS REAL!

                  GRAY
           Lynn what the fuck?! Put down 
           the gun!
                                       RUTH
                              Gray, stop- don’t fight her! 
                              Something’s happening, she 
                              can’t trust us- just stay 
                              with her- 

           Lynn points the gun back and forth, threatening-

                                 LYNN
                        If that memory is true, then why 
                        don’t I remember my life? 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a life-defining memory, Lynn. 
                        It’ll take time to integrate it...

                                 LYNN
                        How long?! How long until I feel- 
                        better?! How long until I feel like- 
                        the person you say I am?!

                                 RUTH
                        I think soon...

                                 LYNN
                        ...Is it true if they kill me 
                        inside during the hack they’ll be 
                        able to control my mind?!

                                 RUTH
                        ...Yes. We believe they could. 

           Lynn steps closer, pushing the gun at Ruth- Gray starts to 
           move but Ruth motions for him to stay put-

                                 LYNN
                        Why didn’t you tell me that?! I 
                        can’t do this- I don’t know what’s 
                        real anymore, it’s... too much.
           Ruth stands, stepping even closer to Lynn, brushing past the 
           extended GUN- her eyes are steady on Lynn, loving even. 

                                 RUTH
                        You do know what’s real- and you’ve 
                        known a long time. Even inside, in 
                        your heart you knew something had 
                        been stolen from you. You knew you 
                        were fighting someone for your 
                        life. Now you know you were right- 
                        they stole your past. But you get 
                        to say what your future is, Lynn- 

           Lynn softens into this hope... but then fights back, scared-

                                 LYNN
                        But what if it doesn’t work?! 

                                 RUTH
                        You have to trust yourself.

                                 LYNN
                        -But I can’t! I feel totally... out 
                        of control! 

           Ruth carefully reaches her hand past the extended gun, gently 
           holds the right side of Lynn’s face-

           FLASH - ANN’S HANDS on the sides of Teen Lynn’s face

           Lynn FEELS this- and she softens, having been brought back-

                                 RUTH
                        Look at me. You are here. You’re 
                        free now. This is who you are. You 
                        are the one that will save them.

           The love is so strong- it’s painful. Lynn lowers the gun and 
           falls into Ruth’s arms, desperate to be sheltered...

                                 LYNN
                        ... I’m sorry... 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s ok. 

           Lynn releases the gun. Gray grabs it and finally exhales. 

           LATER

           Ruth and Gray secure Lynn (VR glasses, gloves, 2 safety 
           belts) into a STRANGE JUMP SEAT, mounted to the floor. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        They’re going to try to disorient 
                        you on what’s real so they can trap 
                        you. So remember on the exit- you 
                        take the ladder in and out.

                                 GRAY
                        Ok, now we’re going to enclose.

                                 LYNN
                        You know I have a thing about being 
                        trapped inside boxes, right?

           Gray presses a button- a THICK GLASS BOX rises up around 
           Lynn, sealing off at the top. On the side is HEAVY HARDWARE 
           and a control panel. Gray adjusts interior settings.

                                 GRAY
                        How’s that feel? Oxygen level ok?

           Lynn nods. Gray looks at his 3 MONITORS- checking everything- 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Here we go. Logging in...

           INT./EXT. SKIES OVER STATE SQUARE - VTI CITY - CONTINUOUS

           The CHOPPER BLADES SCREAM as they approach the 4 BLACK 
           SKYSCRAPERS. Hovering 50 feet over the NEWS BUILDING, Lynn 
           (all black) climbs down the ladder, JUMPS to the roof-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Go! 

           Lynn lands, SPRINTS to the edge, and JUMPS OFF-

           NOTE: the way she moves is incredibly QUICK- DECISIVE- CLEAR. 

           In FREE-FALL, she launches a grappling hook to a SPIRE- 
           swings to the LOWER DOME ROOF- lets go- SOARS TOWARD A CORNER 
           of 2 WALLS- just before she smashes into the side, she THROWS 
           her arms and legs out, catching herself, hundreds of feet up- 

           She free-climbs down the joint- climbs onto the tiny ledge 
           encircling THE SPIRE...

           INT. SIMONS WORK HUB - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           It’s Simons’ operation but Phyllis has the knowledge- so no 
           one knows who to look at. Evans leads a TEAM (now at 20) 
           fastidiously hunting a WALL OF MONITORS- 
           ON SCREENS: the PEGASUS HELICOPTER, in flight -- Security 
           SCANNING VTI for Lynn’s Entry -- State Surveillance of VTI 
           Citizens -- VTI Citizens’ BRAIN PROGRAMMING THREADS

           A RED LIGHT FLASHES and the PROGRAMMER is out of his chair-

                                 PROGRAMMER
                        We got her!

           The Programmer pulls it up on the BIG SCREEN- they all stare:

           ON SCREEN: Lynn scaling the ledge of the state building...

                                 EVANS
                        LET’S GO! Every tracking Agent 
                        we’ve got! MOVE! NOW!

           EXT. STATE BUILDING - VTI WORLD - CONTINUOUS

           Lynn DROPS down- now hanging from the tiny ledge by her hands- 

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Lynn- gotta move, they’re tracking-

           KICKS and SMASHES OPEN the GLASS PANE- lands on the INTERIOR 
           LEDGE- TEETERS as AGENTS MOVE IN, from above and below.

           She fixes her CABLE- runs around the LEDGE- JUMPS OFF and 
           LOCKS HER LEGS around it, swinging out. As 3 Agents LOCK IN 
           on her- Lynn LETS GO, dropping UPSIDE DOWN, swinging from her 
           feet- draws her GUN and SHOOTS- 1-- 2-- 3-- they fall. 

           As 4 more AGENTS infiltrate, she JUMPS to the FAR RAIL- SPINS 
           and SHOOTS 2. She lands and 2 MORE COME AT HER- 1 knocks her 
           gun away, 2 shoots- she dodges, grabs a LANTERN off the wall, 
           slams it over his body- KICKS THEM BOTH OFF THE LEDGE- their 
           BURNING BODIES starting fire below as she runs out- 

           INT. SIMONS WORK HUB - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           TENSION’S RISING, they watch as LYNN TEARS THROUGH ONE AGENT

           Lynn runs down the hall, turns a corner to- 6 AGENTS guarding 
           the studio. Lynn makes 6 rapid-fire moves that use the Agents 
           actions against them, in sequence-

           Agent 1 RAISES HIS GUN -- 2 RUNS straight at her -- 3 GOES 
           HIGH-- 4 GOES LOW -- 5 RAPID-FIRE SHOOTS -- 6 STAYS BACK 

           Lynn jumps OVER 2, uses 1’s GUN to shoot 2 in the back-- 
           THROWS 1 over her body to KNOCK BACK 3-- pulls his gun and 
           shoots 4-- as his DEAD WEIGHT FALLS, she grabs his body to 
           use as a shield from 5-- shoots 3 and 5. They’re all DOWN.

           She heaves up 5’s DEAD BODY, scans his FACE at the DOOR- the 
           door opens and- SLUMP the body hits the floor.

           Towering windows and LARGE OVAL DESK where The Reporter sits. 
           As Lynn bursts inside- he reaches beneath the desk- but 
           Lynn’s already DIVING- knocks away the gun. 

           He SHOVES her and she FLIES BACK against the WINDOW- then he 
           GRABS HER BY THE THROAT, holding her in the air, choking her- 

           She fights free- throws him over herself- they both scramble 
           for the gun- she grabs it, spins and shoots him- he falls.

           Lynn (in the box) is now CONNECTED to a HUGE METAL HOOK/CABLE

           Lynn and Ruth are in shock but Gray is flung wide open, like 
           the pain has cut into him and now can’t be sutured shut. 
                                 GRAY
                        FUCK! It’s over. I mean- the 
                        future’s gone for 1- we’re headed 
                        back to the fucking 1940s but- it’s 
                        all over! They’re in there for good 
                        and we will be too... how the FUCK 
                        did we risk everything on this?

                                 RUTH
                        Gray, Calm down! For Godsake! 

                                 GRAY
                        No I’m not going to calm down! It’s 
                        my fault my family’s in there and 
                        that was my one shot to get them 
                        out! And I failed. So- no, I don’t 
                        feel very calm. I built that thing- 
                        I fucking toiled over this stupid 
                        program for 10 years for 1 shot to 
                        see my girls, to-- hold them again- 
                        I gave everything I had to this and-

                                 RUTH
                        -We all gave everything we had! 
                        Most of all Lynn! You’re not the 
                        only one with skin in the game, 
                        Gray- don’t be a fucking child! We 
                        always knew it could end here. 

                                 GRAY
                        ...So now what, Ruth?

           Ruth looks away- she never thought they’d get here...

                                 RUTH
                        ...I don’t know...

                                 GRAY
                        You don’t know? So you lead us all 
                        the way here and now we have no 
                        plan...? What a fucking joke...

           Gray walks to the back. Lynn looks out the window, as if 
           floating outside of herself...

                                 LYNN
                        He’s right- it’s over. They’re 
                        coming for us... I’m sorry. I don’t 
                        know what went wrong-

           Ruth is emptied by the shock that somehow she was wrong...
                                 RUTH
                        Nothing went wrong. We were... 
                        seconds away. They saw her- it just 
                        wasn’t enough. Maybe it was never 
                        going to be enough. (re-focusing) 
                        We have to get on the ground, split 
                        up, and run. (off Lynn) There’s no 
                        other choice. I’m sorry, Lynn.

           Ruth maneuvers over the exquisite French Alps, carving 
           between peaks. Lynn looks out at the overwhelming beauty.

                                 LYNN
                        Where are we...?

                        Chamonix. The tracking’s terrible 
                        and it’s difficult to land- hoping 
                        it buys us a little time.

                        Ya. I spent a few summers here, 
                        growing up. Feels like another 
                        lifetime...

           Ruth speaking of another life makes Lynn ache with shame.

                                 LYNN
                        I’m so sorry you spent- so many 
                        years on this and- it didn’t work-
                                 RUTH
                        Oh, sure it did. Maybe it makes me 
                        less noble or something but- the 
                        truth is I spent all these years on 
                        you. And you were worth every day.

           Off Lynn: welling with love and the looming sadness of 
           goodbye...

           LATER

           The Helicopter lands on a VAST SNOWY PLATEAU. When the 
           propellers stop- it feels like this is the most silent, 
           secret place in the world.

           LATER

           FROM FAR OFF we see 3 SMALL FIGURES hike down the side of the 
           peak toward a TINY HOTEL, a black speck on the white horizon.

           EXT./INT. TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - NIGHT

           The HEAVY SNOW hangs on branches and hides the ground below, 
           as they walk the MOONLIT snow to the OLD LOG CABIN HOTEL.

           INSIDE

           Lynn walks inside, stricken by the RAW SIMPLICITY: the wood 
           stove, the chimney, worn leather couches and DEEP, echoing 
           QUIET. They pass a COUPLE leaving and Lynn startles.

                                 COUPLE
                        Bonjour...

           Off the Couple: walking away, confused...

           INT. SUITE - TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - LATER

           A fire burns. Ruth and Lynn finish pasta and wine. It’s a 
           peaceful moment, an intentional pause before the chaos ahead. 

           Gray comes in from outside, softened from sadness.

                                 LYNN
                        Want some dinner?

                                 GRAY
                        No, I think I’m gonna lay down. 
           He starts to go but then-

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m- sorry for today. I’m just... I 
                        didn’t grieve, you know? I threw 
                        myself into this- I insisted I’d 
                        get them back, so it wasn’t over. I 
                        just can’t believe now it is. It’s 
                        like losing them all over again.

           Ruth stands up and walks over to Gray. 

                                 RUTH
                        Gray you need to know- it’s not 
                        your fault they’re inside. There 
                        was nothing you could’ve done. They 
                        chose to go in, like so many others- 

                                 GRAY
                        But it was my job to get them out-

                                 RUTH
                        It was your job to keep loving 
                        them. And you gave them everything. 
                        There was nothing you didn’t give.

           Ruth puts her hand on his cheek- a tiny gesture containing so 
           much love- his eyes well with appreciation and then he goes.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I may try to get a little rest too 
                        before we head out.

                                 LYNN
                        I won’t be able to sleep- can I go 
                        on a walk?

                                 RUTH
                        ...Ok, but stay close.

           The MOON tints the SNOW PINK, as Lynn wanders through the 
           trees. The only sounds are the CRUNCHING SNOW underfoot and 
           her BREATH on the air.

           She stops in an open grove, taking in the beauty. The QUIET 
           is haunting and healing...

           Lynn walks through the snowy trees. Suddenly- a SHUFFLE- Lynn 
           whips around, scanning through the trees- but nothing. 

           She keeps walking- then BREAKING BRANCHES- she turns and 
           spots Mary, catching up behind her. Lynn exhales-

                                 LYNN
                        You scared me. How did- when’d you 
                        get here?

                                 MARY
                        Oh, sorry. I followed, to make sure 
                        you guys were ok. I stopped by the 
                        hotel- Ruth said you took a walk. I 
                        was worried about you-

                                 LYNN
                        I want to be alone.

           Intruded upon, Lynn turns and keeps walking. When she picks 
           up her pace, Mary grows indignant, following her-
                                 MARY
                        I re-read your brain scans, Lynn- 
                        the virus is real and you have it. 
                        There was a strain they weren’t 
                        treating inside- that’s why you 
                        felt so off. The depression, 
                        nightmares, hysteria- all of it. 

           Lynn finally turns around- her face, a sheet of fear-

                                 LYNN
                        Ruth said the virus isn’t real-

                                 MARY
                        Ruth’s not a psychologist, Lynn- so 
                        she doesn’t understand. But it’s ok- 
                        you’re gonna be ok now. You can 
                        have your life back- you can be a 
                        doctor again and see Duke- he’s 
                        missed you. You got confused on 
                        what’s real but it’s not your fault-

           Shaken, Lynn turns and hurries along a cliff wall as suddenly- 
           a SHEER CLIFF and HUGE WATERFALL DROP OFF. She stops short, 
           catching herself- but now Mary’s RIGHT THERE on her heels- 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        The reason it felt like something 
                        was wrong- is because it is. 

                                 LYNN
                        No, get away from me-

           Lynn turns and her FOOTING SLIPS- SHE FALLS, the ground 
           giving way in a small AVALANCHE. As she PLUMMETS toward the 
           EDGE of the CLIFF, Lynn claws desperately for anything-

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        AGHHHHHHHH!

                                 MARY
                        LYNN!

           Finally- she grabs a branch, saving herself, cutting her 
           right arm on a crag as she does. She HOLDS ON desperately as 
           the snow tumbles around her- the FREEZING water spraying her. 

           Finally, it stops. With all her might, Lynn swings her leg up- 
           pulls herself up on the branch- grabs a rock, gradually 
           scales her way to the top where she collapses to her knees.

           Breathless, Lynn looks up at Mary standing there, watching 
           her- then looks down at the bleeding cut on her arm and- 
                                 MARY  (CONT’D)
                        Lynn? Lynn look at me-

           FLASH - Teen Lynn sits on the bathroom floor, ashamed. Ann 
           kneels beside her, holding a cloth to her bleeding arm.

                                 ANN ECHO (V.O.)
                        Lynn, look at me...

           INT. LYNN’S BEDROOM - ANN’S HOUSE - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Teen Lynn sits in bed, DESPERATE to hide and to be seen. Ann 
           looks at her with deeply loving eyes.

                                 ANN
                        I love you, in this moment and 
                        always, exactly as you are. Lynn, 
                        look at me-

           Tears burning her eyes, Teen Lynn finally looks at Ann.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)

                        don’t ever kill it. 

           And then, like water overflowing, it finally comes out...

                                 TEEN LYNN
                        I love her...

                                 ANN
                        I know, honey. I know.

           Ann pulls Lynn into a hug, sheltering her like when she was 
           small. When they let go- Ann cradles Teen Lynn’s face 
           lovingly in her hands, both of their eyes full of tears-

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        And I’m telling you- hold onto that 
                        love, even when you’re hurting. 
                        Even when you’re scared. And 
                        especially when it gets dark. Don’t 
                        forget the truth in your heart- 
                        because it will light your way. 
                        This is your future- promise me 
                        you’ll fight for it. 
           EXT. CHAMONIX WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Panting, freezing, soaked through- Lynn looks at Mary, her 
           eyes WILD with RAGE and REVELATION, as-

                                 MARY
                        Lynn! It’s ok you failed- this 
                        isn’t who you are- 

                                 LYNN
                        -NO, YOU’RE NOT REAL! I know who I 
                        am and I know what you tried to do, 
                        you fucking disease of a person-

                                 MARY
                        Lynn, it’s ok- we can fix you now-

                                 LYNN
                        GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

           Lynn lets out a FEROCIOUS GROWL OF A SCREAM- carnal and raw, 
           born years ago- then HEAVES and VOMITS BLACK, into the snow.

           She stares- something there, moving. She picks up the VTI 
           tracking tick, barely moving, like a dying bug. She stares at 
           it, disgusted, and when she looks up-

           MARY IS GONE. FINALLY.

           And now we FLASH into-

           EXT. PARK - UPSTATE NEW YORK - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Claire walks on the dirt path ahead, under a green canopy of 
           trees, filtering sunlight. She turns back and with a smile- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come on! 

           Teen Lynn catches up, marveling at this secret place...

           SUDDEN CUT - BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL- Hiking behind it, Teen Lynn 
           steps closer to the rocks, and then sees- 

           Claire’s hand, reaching through the water and she gently 
           touches Teen Lynn’s face and they’re laughing and- 

           Now THEY KISS- and it’s so BEAUTIFUL- the water spraying onto 
           their faces and the sunlight weaving between their mouths and 
           Teen Lynn smiling, so deeply happy...

           LATER - Lying on grey rocks in the sun, Teen Lynn gazes at 
           the sky, as Claire reads from a thin, worn book.
                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        “...that the future is entering 
                        into us to transform itself within 
                        us long before it happens...”

           Teen Lynn smiles, like she can see the path forward...

           EXT. RIVER - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Teen Lynn (fighting wildly) is ROUGHLY PULLED from the water.

           EXT./INT. UNKNOWN SUV - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Teen Lynn (soaking wet) SCREAMING WILDLY- STUFFED into the 
           back seat of a SUV- rough hands reach to her neck- she’s OUT.

           INT. UNKNOWN HALLWAY - UNKNOWN BUILDING - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Teen Lynn (nude VR suit) walks down the hall with GUIDES 
           (navy suits) in front and behind her. Everything- her eyes, 
           her mouth, her stride- are DRUGGED AND NUMB.

           INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - UNKNOWN BUILDING - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           A hauntingly cold, clinical room- Teen Lynn lies on a WHITE 
           LAB TABLE, her arms and legs RESTRAINED as FIVE CYLINDRIC 
           LASERS lower over her- SHAKING, as they administer SHOCKS. 

           As her body TWITCHES and JERKS under the brut force, tears 
           gently stream down her numb, terror-filled face.

           INT. POD - VTI INDUSTRIES - 16 YEARS BEFORE

           Lynn lies in the center of the floor- the Guide places the 2 
           tiny VR CAMERA BEADS into her eyes. There is no reaction left 
           in Lynn’s face, just a new certain flat unhappiness.

                                 GUIDE (O.S. ECHO)
                        All clear and... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

           Lynn’s body RAISES UP, FLOATING PARALLEL in the center of the 
           pod- then brought into VERTICAL FLOATING position. 

                                 GUIDE (O.S. ECHO) (CONT’D)
                        In position, seal pod. Welcome to 
                        VTI, enjoy your stay.

           As the DOOR SEALS SHUT, we notice a small PINK TRIANGLE on 
           the door-frame. And Phyllis standing outside, watching Lynn.
           INT. SIMONS WORK HUB - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Frozen still, Phyllis stares at her phone. As Evans franticly 
           oversees, he sees Phyllis’s darkening expression, walks over-

                                 EVANS
                        What is it...?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        ...She knows. 

           EXT. CHAMONIX WOODS - LATER

           Lynn (a new fiery will in her eyes) trudges through the snow, 
           tracing her way back through her tracks...

           EXT. FRENCH ALPS SURROUNDING CHAMONIX - CONTINUOUS

           Agents (black specks on the snow) search the vast peaks...

           INT. SUITE - TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - LATER

           Ruth and Gray are panicked, waiting for Lynn when- she walks 
           in, wet and freezing but full of light.

                                 RUTH
                        Lynn! What happened?! Are you ok?

                                 LYNN
                        I remember everything. I can feel 
                        everything. And I know how to get 
                        them out.

           Ruth overflows with love for Lynn, as Gray looks to Ruth, 
           nervous but intrigued...

           LATER

           Gray’s small monitor is set up on the coffee table and 
           they’re hovered around it.

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        Can you access the brain map of VTI 
                        citizens’ amygdala activity?

                                 GRAY
                        Think so, hold on- ya- right here-

           He pulls up an IMAGE- the AMYGDALA THREADS ARE ALL DARKENED.
                                 LYNN
                        (amazed) That’s what I thought... 
                        it’s because they’ve been alone so 
                        long. They have to watch it 
                        together. 

           Ruth and Gray look at each other, sensing it’s true- but it 
           doesn’t change that they’re still out of time.

                                 GRAY
                        Ok, but- I can’t get you back in. 
                        Plus they’re- what, an hour out? We 
                        don’t have enough time to do this 
                        before we run.

                                 LYNN
                        What if I don’t run...? I 
                        surrender, and once they bring me 
                        in- we run it from inside. 

           A grave beat, as they look at each other, considering...

           LATER

           The set up is rudimentary to the point of looking DANGEROUS. 
           Lynn (adhesive strip across forehead) lies on the floor and 
           Ruth kneels over her, holding a LARGE, LONG NEEDLE. 

           Gray has 2 SCREENS connected to his computer, a strange 
           board, and metal box with electric leads coming out. 

                                 RUTH
                        Take a deep breath-

           Lynn GASPS as- Ruth SHOVES the NEEDLE DEEP into the back of 
           her jaw. Gray turns on a switch and-

           ON SCREEN: an MRI VIEW of LYNN’S SKULL- the needle just 
           bordering on 2 lobes of brain tissue...

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        There it is. Nice and easy...

           Ruth pushes the needle deeper, curving it back- Lynn fights 
           against the brutal pain, trying to keep her mouth open- and 
           Gray cringes at the sight, having to turn away.

           ON SCREEN: the needle pushes into the occipital lobe- 3 
           inches deep now- and attaches a DEVICE to the brain stem. 
           Ruth and Gray desperately watch the screen until finally-

           ON SCREEN: a tiny dot BLINKS on the brain stem attachment.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        (exhaling) It’s in. 

           LATER

           Gray fits a wire of LED LIGHTS into the crown of a SHORT 
           BLACK WIG Ruth’s wearing. Then he presses a remote button- 
           tiny dots project onto Ruth’s face.

                                 GRAY 
                        The facial interference should get 
                        you about 24 hours. As soon as 
                        she’s in the lab- I’ll log you in. 

           Then he holds up a FACIAL RECOGNITION scanner to Ruth’s face- 

           ON SCREEN: a digital image loads- a photo of ANOTHER WOMAN.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re good.

           EXT. TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX WOODS - LATER

           Snow falls, as they pause in the heaviness of what to say and 
           what not to. Lynn takes Ruth’s hand and smiles, imagining-

                                 LYNN
                        What will you do once we’re free?

                                 GRAY
                        ...I just want to lie in bed with 
                        my family. The girls won’t be small 
                        anymore so- I guess maybe we 
                        wouldn’t even fit but... it’s just 
                        the image I’ve held onto all these 
                        years. All of us together, so close-

                                 RUTH
                        I want to be somewhere in the 
                        mountains. I can’t even say how 
                        long I’ve missed the sun, the 
                        trees. No offense to you Gray but 
                        that was a lot of years in a 
                        basement-

                                 GRAY
                        (laughs) None taken. I could’ve 
                        only done it with you, Ruth.

           Ruth smiles, breathing in the scenic beauty around them.

                                 RUTH
                        And there’s someone I owe a call...
           They let the daydream linger a moment, before finally-

                                 LYNN
                        Thank you, Gray- for building the 
                        road here. And for believing I was 
                        worth it. And Ruth, amidst 
                        everything that was taken- I know 
                        now you were the gift given to me. 
                        You’re the only person that could 
                        have healed me from the past, and 
                        you’re the only people that could 
                        have pulled me into the future. 
                        Thank you.

           She hugs them both, squeezes Ruth’s hand, and that’s it...

           INT. TUNNEL - INSIDE MT. BLANC - LATER

           Gray (baseball cap, backpack) runs through the tunnel...

           EXT. PEAK ABOVE TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - LATER

           Reaching the crest of a peak, breathing hard- Ruth turns back 
           and pauses, taking one last look at the long road here...

           INT. SIMONS WORK HUB - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           ALARMS HOWLING and the entire room BUZZING-

                                 EVANS
                        WE GOT HER! WE GOT HER! LET’S GO!

           And every person in the room focused- on radios, calling 
           support, organizing back up, to agents, to helicopters-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I want every inch of that building 
                        surrounded! It has to be perfect!

           EXT. TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - CONTINUOUS

           SWARMING AGENTS form a perimeter around the hotel, as- Lynn 
           (hands up) walks outside the front door, surrendering.

                                 LEAD GROUND AGENT
                        Hold all fire- hold! No moves 
                        outside- Line 1 start moving in-

           Everyone watches in shock/confusion as Lynn surrenders...

                        DO NOT LET UP! DO NOT LET UP!

           EXT. TINY HOTEL - CHAMONIX - CONTINUOUS

           Lynn waits as the Agents move closer and then- aggressively 
           force her to the ground, until finally-

                                 LEAD GROUND AGENT
                        ...Confirmation we have Roberts-

           INT. SIMONS WORK HUB - VTI HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           The room ERUPTS in relief- everyone shaking hands and 
           celebrating, except for Phyllis, staring in suspicion...

                                 PHYLLIS
                        (quietly) Why is she doing this...?

           EXT./INT. STATE HELICOPTER - CHAMONIX - LATER

           Apprehending Lynn continues to be an overzealous operation- 
           as Agents roughly load her into the helicopter.

           LATER - 5 ARMED GUARDS keep weapons on Lynn, in flight. She 
           looks steady and focused, despite the extreme intensity.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK ROAD - CHAMONIX - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth emerges from the trees to a road. She waits, EXPOSED, 
           FEAR creeping in until- a RANGE ROVER comes around the corner 
           and stops. 

           Inside CLAUDE (60s, German, studious) smiles, seeing Ruth.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY - CHAMONIX - CONTINUOUS

           As they wind back down the mountain, Ruth is a little flush, 
           nervous as she tries to figure out how to say-

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you. I didn’t know if you’d 
                        come... 
                                 CLAUDE
                        I said I’d wait... granted I didn’t 
                        know you meant this long but...

           He smiles and it softens Ruth into a relieved smile as well.

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        I like your fugitive look.

           INT. TRAIN - FRANCE - LATER

           Gray holds his breath as the TRAIN AGENT places Gray’s 
           PASSPORT into the FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER-

           ON SCREEN: a GREEN DIGITAL FACIAL FILE- which then pulls up a 
           photo of a DIFFERENT MAN. It reads CLEAR-

           The Agent double-takes- hands Gray his passport, moves on...

           EXT. CLAUDE’S APARTMENT - GENEVA - LATER

           The Range Rover pulls to a stop in a tiny alley. Claude jumps 
           out, grabs Ruth’s bag and leads her up the narrow stairs.

           INT. DEN - CLAUDE’S APARTMENT - GENEVA - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a bit of a cozy mess- books everywhere, papers and 
           sketches, and a large desk, overlooking the Rhone River. As 
           Ruth starts setting up, Claude watches her a moment...

                                 CLAUDE
                        Do you need anything else? Water?

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe wine...?

           He smiles, turns to go but then pauses, turns back-

                                 CLAUDE
                        The Swiss don’t provide coordinated 
                        tracking, which will buy you a bit 
                        of time. But- they will find you 
                        eventually.

           Ruth offers a gentle smile- more for him than herself.

                                 RUTH
                        ...I know. However long we have, 
                        I’m glad to be here.

           Claude smiles, his heart pounding with hope and love.
                                 CLAUDE
                        Yes, me too.

           INT. GARE DU NORD TRAIN STATION - PARIS - LATER

           Gray steps off the train into the current of the crowd. He 
           moves as quick as he can while staying with others- and now 

           MAURICE (40s, Parisian, a purist) is at his side and they’re 
           moving, with no greeting, nothing to attract attention.

                                 MAURICE (FRENCH)
                        Car’s this way-

           INT. BMW 2002 - PARIS - LATER

           Maurice and Gray fly through the streets of Paris. It’s quiet 
           except the RACING ENGINE and the French radio, popping in. 

           INT. MAURICE’S APARTMENT - ST. GERMAIN - PARIS - LATER

           Maurice locks the door and whips closed all the curtains- 
           then finally turns- as if just now actually seeing Gray.

                                 MAURICE
                        My old friend.

           They hug. It’s emotional- full of love and relief and fear.

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        How can I help?

                                 GRAY
                        (pained) You have to go. 

                                 MAURICE
                        I was afraid you’d say that.

                                 GRAY
                        If they come... 

           He doesn’t have to finish. They both know the end of the 
           sentence.

           EXT. HELI LANDING PAD - VTI HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           As the State Helicopter touches down, Phyllis approaches, 
           flanked by Simons, Smith and Evans, and 10 Agents behind. The 
           wind whips against Phyllis as she stares, ravenous...
           As they lead Lynn out, Phyllis stands face-to-face with her. 
           Phyllis’s perfect composure has finally come undone- and 
           there’s no hiding the HATRED and FEAR RAGING inside her.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Welcome to the end.

           Off Lynn: unshaken, staring back at her...

           Everything in here is off-record and involving the fewest 
           people possible.

           LAB: A large lab table, HEAVY MACHINES (medical/tech), and

           Phyllis oversees the Techs SCAN LYNN’S BODY with devices. Her

           The Techs pull THE MACHINE ARM into position behind Lynn’s 
           right ear and- A TINY LASER DRILLS INTO LYNN’S SKULL. Lynn’s 
           face shakes and strains, under the pain.

           Lead Tech leaves and Phyllis steps over Lynn, leaning in 
           close. Phyllis is edgy with nerves, passionate with hate.

                        dreamed up, deep down you know it 
                        was wrong. You know we’ve created a

           Phyllis leans so close to Lynn’s face, it’s almost intimate-

                        You no longer exist. Because you

           1, wrestles away his gun- spins and shoots AGENT 2, then as 
           Agent 3 attacks from behind, she DUCKS and clips his legs- 
           shoots him point-blank. 

           DESPERATE- Simon’s bursts in- Lynn KICKS HIM back and he 
           CRASHES INTO THE GLASS as Agent 4 rushes in- she forces his 
           gun on Simons, SHOOTS-- then fires 3 more shots into the 
           office and finally back on himself as she kicks him to the 
           floor- he shoots himself on the way down. 

           ONLY PHYLLIS LEFT- she’s coming at Lynn with a gun- Lynn 
           dives at her with fury, knocks away her gun, kicks her back- 
           and SLAMS Phyllis down onto the table. 

           She TIES DOWN PHYLLIS’S ARMS AND LEGS, trapping her there.

           on the ground- suddenly pulled down by gravity. 

           Lynn searches for the MAIN BOARD- removes the COVER- scans a 
           CHART OF WIRES/fuses- finds access to EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN. 
           She almost can’t believe she’s saying-

                                 LYNN
                        I’m here. Preparing to shut down-

           INSERT Gray- Accessing the final hack- then pauses, amazed-

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        Ok, Lynn- straight out the east 
                        hall- you’ve got 2 minutes to exit 
                        the building... Logging off here-

           INSERT Ruth- hopeful as she takes one last look-

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Logging off here- see you soon.

                                 LYNN
                        See you soon.

           INSERT- Gray and Ruth’s SCREENS both GO DARK and now- 

           LYNN PLUGS IN- sets the SHUTDOWN for 1 min and leaves...

           INT. VARIOUS HALLWAYS - VTI HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Groups of Agents try to get to Lynn from different directions- 
           yet again, reach locked doors, blocking their way.

                        In that moment, on the threshold of 
                        sleeping and waking, past and 
                        future...
