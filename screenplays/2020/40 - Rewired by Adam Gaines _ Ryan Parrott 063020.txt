           INT. CAMPUS POST OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- A FADED, DISHEVELED PACKAGE. 

           Sloppily addressed. Aggressively taped. Just looking at it 
           invokes a ticking sound. 

           It sits on a wood counter, imbuing a sense of menace. 

           But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. This isn’t a bomb. It’s 
           just another package, picked up and dropped off, as -- 

                                 WOMAN (O.C.)
                        Next.

           We TILT UP to REVEAL the next person in line -- 

           TED KACZYNSKI (17). 

           Brand new, ill-fitting dress jacket and cropped hair. The 
           world will come to know him by ANOTHER NAME one day, but for 
           now, he’s just... a meek and unassuming STUDENT.

           Ted approaches, laying down a letter-sized envelope.

                                 TED
                        Good afternoon. I’d like to mail 
                        this, please.

           RUTH (mid 50’s), a postmaster attendant, looks it over, 
           tapping the top left corner.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Want to put your return address?

                                 TED
                        Is that standard?

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        They’d like it to be. Otherwise, if 
                        it’s undeliverable, it ends up in 
                        the dead letter office.

           He grabs a pen at her station, adding his address.

                                 TED
                        Where’s that?

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        I’m not quite sure. Washington DC?

           Ruth notes the matching last name of the recipient. 
                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Brother or father?

                                 TED
                        Brother. Younger. I don’t think he 
                        cares what it says inside. He just 
                        likes getting mail.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Four cents.

           Ted digs into his pocket. Three pennies.

                                 TED
                        Just a second.

           He checks his other pocket. Then his jacket. Even his back 
           pocket. Nothing.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        I can make an exception this once 
                        and make change from a dollar.

                                 TED
                        I brought four cents exactly.

           Embarrassed, Ted checks the floor. Goes to one knee. Starting 
           to get desperate. 

           As he searches around, Ted glances up to find --

           The line behind him, growing agitated. Everyone is either 
           staring down at him or at the time.

                                 TED
                        Sorry. It’ll just --

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH (O.C.)
                        Kaczynski?

           Ted bolts up, hoping she found it. But --

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Come back when it turns up.

           She hands him back his letter.

                                 TED
                        Of course. Thank you.

           He takes it, shamefully walking past the judgmental line of 
           eyes and out the door.
           EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

           Autumn leaves fall across historic brick buildings. 

                               HARVARD UNIVERSITY, FALL 1959

           Teenagers wander by in Windsor knots, swing skirts and their 
           natural born privilege.

           Ted walks against the flow of the other STUDENTS, head down, 
           shorter and younger.

                                 MICHAEL (O.C.)
                        Goddamn, I miss summer.

           INT. MICHAEL’S DORM ROOM - DAY

           MICHAEL EARLWOOD (18) stares out the window at the student 
           traffic. Older and cooler than his age. Lives on charisma and 
           attention.

                                 MICHAEL
                        The warmer the weather, the shorter 
                        the skirt.

           We PULL BACK to -- ornate student living. School flag, 
           fraternity paddle, baseball decor, bigger than you’d expect.

           Ted sits at a desk. TIMER clicking away as he grades a quiz.

           Michael spins a wooden bat over his shoulders as Ted finally 
           finishes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How’d I do?

                                 TED
                        You missed a few.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How many?

                                 TED
                        Nine out of ten.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But... I got one?

                                 TED
                        Technically, yes. But --
                                 MICHAEL
                        See? That’s an improvement. A few 
                        more and it’ll be almost half.

                                 TED
                        That’s the best math you’ve done 
                        all day.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good news means it’s time for a 
                        break. I need to grab a few things 
                        at the student union --

           Michael hustles to get ready. Ted doesn’t follow suit.

                                 TED
                        Michael, your parents are paying me 
                        by the hour.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Trust me, they can afford it.

                                 TED
                        Yes, but they won’t keep me on as 
                        your tutor if you’re not improving. 
                        Now, please... let’s try to work 
                        through this.

           Frustrated, Michael slumps down into a chair. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fine, but at what point exactly in 
                        life am I gonna need algebra?

           Ted ignores him, sliding the quiz across the desk.

                                 TED
                        Simplify this expression by 
                        combining the like terms which is 
                        the same as 5 - 2, giving us...?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        Three?

                                 TED
                        3X. That’s right. Now we combine 
                        the constants and solve for x...

           Beat. Ted waits but Michael is glancing out the window again.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry. Was I supposed to 
                        answer?
           With a sigh, Ted takes back the quiz.

                                 TED
                        No. That’s fine. We can go over the 
                        rest next time.

           As Ted starts to pack up, Michael looks him over.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but 
                        what do you do for fun exactly?

                                 TED
                        I like to read.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cool. What about...?

                                 TED
                        Math.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You must get all the ladies. Get 
                        the lights real low... make them 
                        solve for X.

           Ted looks sheepishly at the quiz. Feeling judged.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So you don’t drink or smoke or date 
                        much, do you?

                                 TED
                        My grades are important. It’s the 
                        best school in the world with the 
                        best minds in the world. And if I 
                        can surpass them, well...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I get all that, but... this isn't 
                        just college, ya know? It's 
                        freedom! It's the first time in our 
                        lives we get to find out who we 
                        really are and you only do that by 
                        experimenting a little. Trying 
                        something new. I mean, there’s 
                        gotta be a little more to life than 
                        studying, right?

           Ted thinks about it, but before he answers -- DING!

           THE SMALL TIMER pings. Their study session is over.
                                 TED
                        Time’s up.

           EXT. ELIOT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ted walks back through the leaf-scattered campus. As he nears 
           his dormitory, he passes --

           AN EVENT BOARD. Covered in fliers and leaflets promoting 
           various clubs and campus activities.

           Ted slows, eyes drift across it:

           Chess club. Spanish Club. Future Business Leaders of America. 

           He stops. Looks each one over. Campus outreach. Intramurals. 

           Ted leans CLOSER. There’s a LONGING here. But as he reaches 
           for one of the fliers --

           A GROUP OF FRATERNITY PLEDGES charge past him! 

                                 STUDENT
                        Heads up, kid!

           Ted LEAPS out of the way, just in time, as they disappear to 
           their next destination, singing and laughing. Assholes.

           He gathers himself, steals one last look at the board and... 
           heads off into the night. 

           Alone.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Rows of students taking a test. Pensive. Frustrated.

           PROFESSOR GRAZIANO (50’s) paces the front of the room, 
           monitoring their progress. Coke bottle glasses. Dusty waist 
           coat. Every bit the cliche.

           He checks the clock, about to call time, when the door OPENS 
           and in walks --

           BARBARA MARTIN (Mid-20’s). Strength and grace, mixed with 
           natural authority. Fashion forward with fifties flare.

           As the two confer, every red-blooded male student forgets 
           their exam, checking her out from head to toe.

           Everyone that is... except Ted. 
           He continues to check away answers, oblivious to the other 
           horny teenagers gawking until --

           THE BELL RINGS.

           As the students SNAP down, feverishly penciling in the last 
           few answers, Ted finishes. Relieved.

                                 GRAZIANO
                        That’s time, ladies and gentlemen. 
                        Pencils down. And chapter six for 
                        next week.

           Ted packs up and heads for the door, when --

                                 GRAZIANO
                        Mr. Kaczynski.

           He finally glances up to find Graziano beckoning him over. 
           Ted sheepishly approaches.

                                 GRAZIANO
                        Ted, this is Miss... I’m sorry, 
                        what was it again?

                                 BARBARA
                        Barbara Martin.
                             (re: Ted)
                        I work in the psychology 
                        department.

           Ted shakes her hand, then realizes he hasn’t said a word in 
           reply.

                                 TED
                        Um... hi.

           His voice cracks. Graziano and Barbara pretend not to notice.

                                 GRAZIANO
                        Ted here is one of my bright young 
                        stars -- Sirius of Canius Major. 
                        Trust me, Henry will love him.

                                 BARBARA
                        I have no doubt.

                                 TED
                        I’m sorry, what’s this about?

           As Ted looks between the two, confused...
           EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - LATER

           Ted and Barbara converse along long brick walkways. Students 
           pass by on their way to class. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Don’t you love this campus? All the 
                        brick and wood? It’s like living in 
                        a museum.

           But Ted is too busy reviewing A FLIER.

                                 TED
                        Would you be willing to contribute 
                        to the solution of certain 
                        psychological problems by serving 
                        as a subject in a series of --
                             (beat)
                        Is this an experiment?

                                 BARBARA
                        It’s an opportunity. One I was 
                        hoping someone as gifted as you 
                        would recognize.

                                 TED
                        I see stuff like this all the time. 
                        Last year, they needed people to 
                        try different types of Ovaltine. 

           She brushes something off his shoulder. An excuse to touch 
           him, perhaps?

                                 BARBARA
                        This one’s a little different. I’ve 
                        been tasked with finding eager, 
                        brilliant young minds, such as 
                        yourself, who want to know... who 
                        they are. Why they feel the way 
                        they feel sometimes. Helping people 
                        find that is like... magic. It’s 
                        why I love psychology. So if that’s 
                        something you’re looking for, maybe 
                        we can find it together?

           But Ted PULLS AWAY, paying zero attention to the affection.

                                 TED
                        I appreciate the interest, but I’ve 
                        got more important things on my 
                        plate. I’m sorry. Thanks, but no 
                        thanks.

           He holds out the flier. Barbara looks him over, before --
                                 BARBARA
                        You know it’s a minimal commitment. 
                        An hour a week. And, for those who 
                        are accepted, there’s a stipend for 
                        your time. 

                                 TED
                        Accepted? But I thought --

                                 BARBARA
                        No, preliminary testing is Friday. 
                        And not everyone who applies will 
                        get in. This is an invitation. If 
                        you’re interested in seeing how you 
                        stack up with Harvard’s elite... 
                        here’s your chance. Think it over.

           Barbara heads off, leaving Ted to ponder the possibilities.

           EXT. / INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Ted ascends the marble steps, excited and unsure. Hair 
           freshly combed. Shirt starched. Inside, he finds -- 

           SEVENTY-TWO BUDDING MALE STUDENTS. 

           Potential fellow test subjects. Fitted jackets. Pleated 
           pants. The future of corporate America.

           He wanders amongst the groupings as they chat and size one 
           another up. With Ted, we clock:

           CHRISTOPHER TATE (18) finishes a soda, balancing it on the 
           arm of a chair, before thinking better of it. 

           GLENN RICHARDSON (19) chews an excessive amount of gum, while 
           rolling up a magazine to amplify a call to a familiar face.

           Ted spots -- BARBARA heading toward the podium on stage. As 
           she does, A NEBBISH STUDENT waves to her awkwardly, but...

           She doesn’t reciprocate. All business. Ted can’t help but 
           chuckle.

                                 BARBARA
                        Alright, Gentlemen, if you could 
                        all take your seats, we’ll get 
                        started.

           The boys scatter into stadium rows while psychology students 
           pass out testing booklets and answer sheets.
                                 BARBARA
                        First off, I’d like to thank you 
                        all for coming today. Each of you 
                        were invited because you represent 
                        the very best that Harvard has to 
                        offer. 

           A few students laugh or whisper. But Ted listens intensely.

                                 BARBARA
                        Please answer all the questions to 
                        the best of your abilities. After 
                        each booklet is processed, 
                        applicants will be approved for the 
                        next round or dismissed.

           The idea of not getting in straightens the students.

                                 BARBARA
                        You have exactly forty-five minutes 
                        for the first section. Good luck 
                        and your time begins... now. 

           And in a flurry, the applicants flip open the testing 
           booklets, pencils rapidly fill in dots. We catch GLIMPSES of 
           the different questions:

           A biker travels 5 feet in 0.5 seconds. At this exact speed, 
           how far will the biker travel in a minute?

           A) 250 feet  B) 500 feet  C) 600 feet  D) 1200 feet

           Terminate is the opposite of...

           A) Begin  B) Lament  C) Employ  D) Complete

                                                               FADE TO:

           Barbara writes a large “15” on the stage chalkboard. A few 
           students look nervous. Others confused... but not Ted.

           He reads another question:

           Rearrange the following words to form a complete sentence. 

           Is it true or false? 5 Pentagon A has sides

           A) A sentence cannot be formed
           B) Unable to answer 
           C) False
           D) True

           Ted marks D. Closes the booklet. Puts his pencil down. 
           Barbara spots it from the stage. Interesting.
                                 BARBARA (PRE-LAP)
                        Adams, Hayes, Roosevelt, and 
                        Kennedy.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. LECTURE HALL - LATER

           Only twenty-two male students remain. Barbara is at the 
           podium, addressing the final subjects.

                                 BARBARA
                        Kinsey and Oppenheimer. Morgan and 
                        Redstone. Cummings, Emerson and 
                        Thoreau. Bold typed names of alumni 
                        worth repeating because they cement 
                        our legacy.

           As they listen, psychology students hand out index-sized 
           documents.

                                 BARBARA
                        Over the course of the coming 
                        weeks, we would like each of you to 
                        write a brief exposition of your 
                        own personal philosophy on life.

           A psychology student reaches the end of a row where -- TED 
           sits, the only one taking notes.

                                 BARBARA
                        Not something you get from your 
                        friends or the radio or television, 
                        but one that comes from your own 
                        individual experiences. It should 
                        be an affirmation of the guiding 
                        principles with which you hope to 
                        live by.
                             (beat)
                        Upon completion of the composition 
                        and a review with Dr. Murray, you 
                        will be asked to debate the merits 
                        of your philosophy with a fellow 
                        undergraduate.

           A few look around at the competition. Some are UNNERVED.

                                 BARBARA
                        I know this all may sound daunting, 
                        but there are no winners or losers 
                        here.

                        The purpose is to utilize that data 
                        to create a unique psychological 
                        portrait of each of you.

           Ted is laser-focused. As if she’s speaking only to him.

                                 BARBARA
                        We know it can be difficult to 
                        really look critically at one’s 
                        self, but we hope that when this 
                        study is concluded, we will have a 
                        better understanding of you... and 
                        you will have a better 
                        understanding of yourself. 
                        Congratulations.

           Some of the other students chuckle. But Ted heard every word.

           INT. ELIOT HOUSE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

           Ted’s on a public phone, PACING as far as the cord allows.

                                 TED
                        Yes, I am using the detergent.

                        Good. And you have to separate. If 
                        you don’t, your whites will never 
                        stay white.

                                 TED
                        I got it, Mom. Now my turn: The 
                        permission slip. Did you get it?

                                 WANDA (O.C.)
                        Yes, we got it.

                                 TED
                        Great. But it’s not here yet. When 
                        did you send it back?

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. KACZYNSKI ILLINOIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Standard suburban presentation. WANDA and THEODORE KACZYNSKI 
           (mid 40’s) share the phone on their end.

                                 WANDA
                        Well, we wanted to talk to you

                                 THEODORE
                        We’re just doing our due diligence, 
                        son. You’re over a thousand miles 
                        away and -- 

                                 TED
                        Nine hundred and seventy.

                                 THEODORE
                        My mistake. We just want to make 
                        sure your focus isn’t being pulled 
                        in too many directions --

                                 TED
                        Focus? You mean “grades.” Have they 
                        ever been a problem?

                                 THEODORE
                        No, but --

                                 TED
                        THEN WHY WOULD YOU --

           TWO CRIMSON OARSMEN pass, regard Ted like he’s foaming at the 
           mouth. Ted stops, calms himself. Shifts away.

                                 TED
                        I don’t understand. Last year, the 
                        complaint was that I didn’t put 
                        myself out there enough. And now 
                        here I go. I beat out fifty 
                        students to get into this thing. 
                        Anybody else’s parents would be 
                        thrilled.

                                 THEODORE
                        We’re always proud --

           But Wanda takes the phone back from her husband.

                                 WANDA
                        I don’t like the language in this 
                        letter. And I don’t trust anybody 
                        that wants to take apart a person’s 
                        brain. Remember when we owned the 
                        Studebaker?

                        It never ran the same after it was 
                        in the shop for a few days.

                                 TED
                        The fact that you compared a  
                        Harvard professor to a mechanic 
                        means you haven’t heard a word I’ve 
                        said.

           Just then, Ted’s younger brother, DAVID (10), runs in from 
           the living room.

                                 DAVID
                        Is that Ted? Can I talk to him?

                                 WANDA
                        Ted, David’s here --

                                 TED
                        -- No! Don’t you dare put him on 
                        right now! 

           Wanda pulls the phone back, shaking her head at David.

                                 WANDA
                        Okay. We’re here. And we’re 
                        listening. Breathe. 

           He takes the suggestion. Deep breath. Considers his options.

                                 TED
                        The only reason I even have to ask 
                        permission from you is because I’m 
                        the youngest here. That should be a 
                        badge of honor, not a liability.
                             (beat)
                        Now, send the damn thing back or 
                        I’ll never come home.

           And Ted SLAMS down the phone. A threat he’s ready to back up.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- THE PERMISSION SLIP.

           Ted clutches it tightly as Barbara leads him down a tiled 
           hallway. He’s stiffer than normal. Nervous. 

           We can hear TYPING echoing off the walls as they go.

                        Me? No. Just the two of you. 
                        Paperwork?

           Ted hands it over eagerly as --

           They reach a frosted glass door with “H. MURRAY” stenciled 
           across it.

                                 BARBARA
                        His time is limited. Please use it 
                        appropriately. And most 
                        importantly... be honest. Good 
                        luck.

           Ted nods. Barbara gently knocks, but the typing continues.

                                 MURRAY (O.C.)
                        Come in.

           Barbara opens the door. Ted squares his shoulders and with a 
           deep breath...

           INT. PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - MURRAY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           He steps into the smoke-filled office to find --

           DR. HENRY MURRAY (60’s).

           Seated. Back to the door, typing. Gray suit. Matching hair. 
           Smoking. Murray has a Machiavellian charm mixed with 
           perpetual judgement, but... you’ll see more of that later. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Be with you in one moment. Just 
                        finishing this last page. Please, 
                        sit anywhere you like.

           Ted straightens. Is this his first test? 

           He looks over his options: A COUCH and TWO LEATHER CHAIRS.  
           Ponders if there is a right answer before choosing... A 
           LEATHER CHAIR.

           As he gets comfortable, Ted takes in the visual academia.

           Shelves of psychology texts, photographs, and artwork.

           A PORCELAIN WHALE MINIATURE sits on a shelf, bookended by --
           TWO MODEL SHIPS.

           Below it, Murray’s published work and six different hardcover 
           Melville biographies. 
                                 MURRAY  (O.C.)
                        You’d think after filling out so 
                        many reports, I’d be better.

           Ted turns. But Murray isn’t even looking at him.

                                 TED
                        I’m sorry?

                                 MURRAY
                        Typing. But I’m still just two 
                        fingers, punching keys like a 
                        monkey writing Shakespeare. But, 
                        thankfully, I am -- done.

           Murray hits the last key with a flourish. He rises, greeting 
           Ted with a handshake.

                                 MURRAY
                        Mr. Kaczynski. It’s Theodore, 
                        right? But you go by Ted.

                                 TED
                        Yes. Hello.

           Murray sits in a leather chair, but this time... 

           Ted moves to THE COUCH. Murray picks up TED’S FILE, glancing 
           through it.

                                 MURRAY
                        So, where are you from, Ted?

                                 TED
                        Evergreen Park.

                                 MURRAY
                        That’s just outside Chicago, isn’t 
                        it?

                                 TED
                        It is. Yes.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m sure coming to Cambridge must 
                        have been a bit of a culture shock. 
                        How was your first year?

                                 TED
                        No. It was great. Harvard’s been 
                        great. The teachers, the 
                        students... I honestly couldn’t be 
                        happier here.
                                 MURRAY
                        That’s wonderful to hear. And 
                        you’re on full academic 
                        scholarship? Judging by your age 
                        you must have skipped a few grades.

           Ted shrinks a little. Feeling like a child.

                                 TED
                        Um... yes. Two actually.

                                 MURRAY
                        Let me guess. Smartest kid in your 
                        school?

                                 TED
                        Well, um...

           He hesitates, uncomfortable with bragging, but -- 

                                 MURRAY
                        Ted, at Harvard, we don’t trust 
                        anyone without a little ego.

           Ted smiles. He catches sight of the far wall and changes the 
           subject.

                                 TED
                        How long have you been teaching 
                        here?

           Ted rises, gesturing to all of the plaques and photos.

                                 MURRAY
                        Awhile. A few more years and I'm 
                        gonna need them to extend the wall. 
                             (beat)
                        You know I had a friend once, math 
                        major like yourself, he could count 
                        out pi to the 27th power. Do you 
                        know any party tricks like that?

                                 TED
                        I haven’t been to many parties. So 
                        how do you like it here? At 
                        Harvard, I mean.

           Now it’s Murray’s turn to hesitate. The tables have turned.

                                 MURRAY
                        They keep moving my office so it 
                        never feels quite like home. Other 
                        than that, no complaints.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MURRAY (CONT'D)
                        Your parents... how do they feel 
                        about you being so far away? It’s 
                        gotta be close to a thousand miles.

                                 TED
                        Nine hundred and seventy actually. 

           Beat. Murray smiles. Gotcha.

                                 MURRAY
                        My mistake.

                                 TED
                        We stay in touch. They’re very... 
                        happy that I’m taking part in this 
                        study.
                             (beat)
                        As long as I keep my grades up. 

           Murray closes Ted’s file. Lights a cigarette. Thinks.

                                 MURRAY
                             (re: his models)
                        Do you know what those are?

                                 TED
                        The models? Um... ships of some 
                        sort?

           Murray rises, dropping the psychologist and showing his 
           excitement.

                                 MURRAY
                        That’s the Essex and this is the 
                        Pequod. They’re American whaling 
                        ships from “Moby Dick.” I was 
                        obsessed with it in high school. 
                        Have you read it?

                                 TED
                        No. I never got the --

                                 MURRAY
                        It’s the only true modern American 
                        masterpiece. You have to read it. 
                        Here --

           Murray pulls down A COPY.

                                 TED
                        Oh, I don’t --
                                 MURRAY
                        I insist. As you can see, I have 
                        plenty.

                                 TED
                        Thank you, sir.

           Ted reluctantly take it. It’s brand new. Never been opened.

                                 MURRAY
                        You know I skipped a grade too.

                                 TED
                        Really?

                                 MURRAY
                        Yep. Came here at seventeen. It 
                        sounds like you’ve adjusted well, 
                        but for me, that first year... a 
                        poor kid from the Bronx, it was 
                        like... being thrown into a game 
                        where I didn’t even know the rules. 

           Ted stares up at him, nodding without even knowing.

                                 MURRAY
                        Where do you stand? Who do you talk 
                        to? You have to figure it all out 
                        for yourself. So, while everyone 
                        else was tossing footballs and 
                        chasing girls, I was in my dorm... 
                        building these beauties.

           Murray gestures to his models with fondness. This time, Ted 
           takes them in with more respect.

                                 TED
                        My brother makes model airplanes. 
                        Building stuff has never really 
                        been my thing.

                                 MURRAY
                        I found a “calmness” in the 
                        isolation. Constructing something 
                        this intricate with your own two 
                        hands. The focus it requires. 
                        Painting the lead lines. Stitching 
                        the sails. Weathering the hull in 
                        just the right places. If you look 
                        here, you can see where I etched in 
                        the teeth marks with a pocket 
                        knife. See?
                                 TED
                        Oh yeah. That must have taken 
                        forever. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Both semesters. My parents thought 
                        I was depressed, but they didn’t 
                        understand. People like us...

           He pauses, hoping Ted will pick up where he left off and...

                                 TED
                        Sometimes we prefer our own mind to 
                        the company of others.

                                 MURRAY
                        I couldn’t have said it better 
                        myself.

           With that Murray steps away, getting a glass of water.

                                 MURRAY
                        You know everything said in here is 
                        kept in confidence?

           Ted NODS. Maybe he doesn’t believe it, but he wants to.

                                 MURRAY
                        These sessions, this philosophy 
                        dissertation, it’s all designed to 
                        help you find... your own path. 
                        Like the sailors on the Essex, you 
                        have to have a North Star.

                                 TED
                        Yes, sir.

                                 MURRAY
                        Good, because from the moment you 
                        stepped through that door, I’ve 
                        sensed... a hesitation.

                                 TED
                        No. I’ve answered all your 
                        questions and --

                                 MURRAY
                        You have. But this is a voluntary 
                        program and if you don’t feel 
                        comfortable --

                                 TED
                        No. It’s not that. It’s just...
           And Ted sits back down on the couch.

                                 TED
                        My parents are concerned that 
                        psychologists, that all they want 
                        to do is --

                                 MURRAY
                        Mess with your head.

           Ted nods. Exactly.

                                 MURRAY
                        What do your parents do? Are they 
                        academics?

                                 TED
                        No. They’re both smart, but my 
                        mother, she’s just a homemaker and 
                        my father, he works at a sausage 
                        factory.

                                 MURRAY
                        Well, they must derive immense 
                        pride from their son attending 
                        Harvard University.

           Ted nods again. Can’t help but like it.

                                 MURRAY
                        When I was your age, I didn’t know 
                        what I wanted or what I believed. I 
                        simply did what most kids my age 
                        did... I copied my parents.
                             (beat)
                        But yours. They aren’t exceptional. 
                        They’re not competing in mental 
                        gymnastics and they certainly can’t 
                        see the world the way you do.

           Ted BLUSHES. Uncomfortable, but flattered.

                                 MURRAY
                        If I had to guess: you’ve spent a 
                        lot of time trying to fit in. This 
                        time: try to find a way to stand 
                        out. Take a strong position. If 
                        you've got something to say, here's 
                        the forum to say it. I want to 
                        understand what’s going on it that 
                        head of yours. But the only way 
                        that happens is if you decide... do 
                        you trust me enough to let me in?
           Ted ponders the possibility and then finally... SMILES.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - MURRAY'S OFFICE - LATER

           The door OPENS, Ted steps out as Murray follows.

                                 MURRAY
                        Pleasure chatting with you, Ted. 
                        And remember, if you need any help 
                        at all, my door is always open.

           The two SHAKE and... Ted DEPARTS.

           The door closes. Murray puts his glass back on the bar and 
           reaches up to the CABINET above. 

           He opens it and inside is -- A REEL-TO-REEL AUDIO RECORDER.

           He stops the recording and removes --

           A 7-INCH REEL OF RECORDING TAPE.

           He writes A NAME across the label: “LAWFUL 001.” But as he 
           places it in a manilla envelope...

           A KNOCK.

                                 MURRAY
                        Enter.

           Barbara steps inside. Murray hands her the envelope.

                                 MURRAY
                        Transcribe. Priority. I want charts 
                        on inflection and speech patterns.  
                        I want copies distributed to the 
                        entire group for discussion 
                        tomorrow morning.

                                 BARBARA
                        It will be ready first thing.

           And Barbara is off with a recording of Ted’s conversation 
           he’s completely unaware exists.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY

           Students play frisbee. Others sit on picnic blankets, 
           chatting and reading. 
           Everyone is seemingly enjoying the day in idyllic bliss...

           But not Ted.

           The young man sits by himself at the end of long row of busy 
           lunch tables. 

           Food uneaten. Dog-eared copy of Moby Dick next to him.

           He’s huddled over a notepad, SCRIBBLING. A few discarded wads 
           of paper telegraph his frustration.

           As we MOVE IN, we see THE PAD is cluttered with lined-out 
           sentences, arrows and margin notes.

           A few words are circled.

           Melville. Class System. Exceptionalism.

           Ted RIPS a page out, crumples it and adds it to his failures. 
           He starts again, when --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, Kaczynski! You okay, man?

           He looks up to find -- MICHAEL wandering over. Books in hand. 
           Eating an apple. Wearing a pair of PILOT SUNGLASSES.

                                 TED
                        Hi. No, I just... um... I...
                             (beat)
                        Cool glasses.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not bad, right? My dad gave them to 
                        all his pilots this year. Ladies 
                        love a mystery man.
                             (re:)
                        What’s... um... all this?

           Ted instinctively starts to gather up the crumpled paper.

                                 TED
                        Just working on an outside project.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cool. Listen, I’m behind on this 
                        group biology project and kinda 
                        need to cancel our next session.
                                 TED
                        You don’t have to cancel. If it 
                        helps, we can meet earlier or later 
                        on Friday. Or, if you’d like, this 
                        weekend --

           Michael plops down across from his tutor, leaning in.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright, here’s the truth. So... 
                        Vicki Collins. You know Vicki, 
                        right? Absolutely gorgeous. Got an 
                        ass that belongs in that fancy 
                        Paris museum with the famous art.

                                 TED
                        The Louvre.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That sounds good, I’m gonna use 
                        that. Anyway, her parents have this 
                        cottage in Martha’s Vineyard and 
                        she invited me there for the 
                        weekend, so the math has to wait.

           Ted takes a deep breath.

                                 TED
                        Your next Algebra quiz isn’t going 
                        to wait.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m failing that either way. And 
                        Vicki Collins wants to try on and 
                        take off her last bathing suit of 
                        the season for me? Way better deal.

                                 TED
                        If you want to graduate --

                                 MICHAEL
                             (laughing)
                        Ted, look, my dad went to Harvard. 
                        So did my grandfather and legend 
                        has it even my great grandfather 
                        went here when it was like two 
                        buildings and an outhouse, okay? 
                        They’ll give me the piece of paper. 
                        I’m legacy with a capital “L.”

                                 TED
                        I thought college is about finding 
                        out who you are. What you want to 
                        do with your life --
                                 MICHAEL
                        And I already know. My father’s on 
                        the board at his company. They’re 
                        going to make him executive vice 
                        president next, and he’ll get to 
                        pick his own team... and I won’t 
                        even have to raise my hand.

                                 TED
                        So it doesn’t matter what you do 
                        here?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No. To me, all of this is just... 
                        summer camp until real life starts. 

           Ted NODS. Not exactly thrilled by Michael’s honesty.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But hey, if you need the money, 
                        I’ll tell my parents we’re still 
                        meeting. That way neither of us 
                        waste our time, you win, I win, 
                        even Vicki wins --

                                 TED
                        You know what? Do whatever you 
                        want. Have a good time at the 
                        beach.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ah, come on. Don’t be mad. I --

                                 TED
                        I’m not. But unlike you, I have 
                        work to do.

           Ted returns to his pad. Michael SIGHS. Shakes his head.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Tell you what, I’ll bring you back 
                        some sand. You can put it in an 
                        hourglass and watch time pass you 
                        by.

           As Michael wanders off, Ted scribbles away, not bothering to 
           look up.

           INT. BASEMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           In the bowels of the century-old building, UNIFORMED WORKERS 
           measure, saw, drill, weld, and repeat. 
           The tiled hall is a mess of tarps, tools and boxes coming in 
           and out of a room labeled: SUBJECT ROOM “A.”

           But we don’t go inside. Not yet anyway.

           Amid the chaos, Murray leads Barbara along, the two checking 
           over a list of tasks. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Hinge.

                                 BARBARA
                        Sits with you tomorrow. 11am. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Cringle.

                                 BARBARA
                        His paper’s been copied and 
                        distro’d. The rest of the 
                        transcriptions should be ready by 
                        tomorrow afternoon.

                                 MURRAY
                        And those are from Wednesday?

                                 BARBARA
                        I know they’re coming in a little 
                        slow, but I’m getting budget 
                        approval to add an extra girl.

           The two STEP ASIDE as MORE WORKERS proceed past.

                                 BARBARA
                        Are the workers going to be 
                        finished in time?

                                 MURRAY
                        Considering how much we’re paying 
                        them... they better be.

           Murray STOPS, pulling back a tarp to check the invoice on a 
           nearby crate.

                                 BARBARA
                        I was under the impression “The 
                        Stress Factory” was ready.

                                 MURRAY
                        Just making a few adjustments. 
                        Tightening bolts and connecting 
                        wires. Nothing major.

           Barbara’s attention drifts over the construction. “A few?”
                                 BARBARA
                        The administration won’t be happy 
                        about all the holes in their walls.

                                 MURRAY
                        And that’s why I’m trusting you to 
                        make sure they never see them.

           And he’s off again, Barbara following into --

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The heart of the project. Along one wall are bookshelves of 
           “Codename” binders and stacks of audio reels. Along another -- 

           THREE TRANSCRIBERS (CAROL, REBECCA and FRANCINE, mid 20’s). 
           Headphones on. Punching away on typewriters.

           Murray proceeds to -- A CORKBOARD OF TWENTY-TWO POLAROIDS. 
           All smiling male Anglo-Saxons. He looks them over, pieces to 
           a puzzle only he sees.

                                 MURRAY
                             (to himself)
                        All my means are sane, my motive 
                        and my object mad.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m sorry, what was that?

           But Murray IGNORES her. Mind already focused elsewhere.

                                 BARBARA
                        Doctor, before things get too far 
                        along, can we discuss “Lawful” for 
                        a moment?

           Murray’s eyes drift to a corner -- A POLAROID OF TED.

                                 MURRAY
                        What about him?

                                 BARBARA
                        I have some concerns.

                                 MURRAY
                        Do you, now?

           He turns and Barbara’s confidence wilts a bit under his eyes. 
                                 BARBARA
                        From my understanding, the 
                        centerpiece of this study is to see 
                        how subjects respond to heightened 
                        stress levels, correct?

           Murray says nothing. Barbara panics a little.

                                 BARBARA
                        Our cross section of subjects share 
                        commonalities in background, age, 
                        and social function, while Lawful 
                        is younger and the most 
                        alienated...

                                 MURRAY
                        You convinced Kaczynski to join and 
                        now you want to remove him 
                        because... he’s too young?

                                 BARBARA
                        No. This isn’t personal. This is 
                        purely about maintaining clinical 
                        legitimacy. 

           Murray takes a deep breath, looking over the board.

                                 MURRAY
                        Our sampling must also include 
                        extremes if we want above-average 
                        results. I have identified 
                        Kaczynski as such and weighed the 
                        consequences and decided to err on 
                        the side of compassion. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I don’t follow.

                                 MURRAY
                        People are... poorly made. I don’t 
                        mean physically, from a design 
                        perspective, the nervous system and 
                        opposable thumbs are impressive. 
                        But mentally, we have an instrument 
                        capable of infinite comprehension 
                        and abstract thought. Elegant in 
                        ways I can barely articulate and 
                        yet the mechanisms of the mind are 
                        tangled in phobias and neurosis. 
                        The subconscious swallows logic and 
                        repressed moments drag down 
                        creativity like an anchor.

                                 MURRAY (CONT'D)
                        But you and I have the ability to 
                        reach deep inside, sift through all 
                        the memories, personality, and ego 
                        and find their inner demons. And 
                        extract all that trauma and anger 
                        and frustration, piece by piece. 
                        That’s a gift only we can give and 
                        I want to share it with all of our 
                        subjects... especially “Lawful.”

           Barbara takes it all in. Inspired by his words.

                                 MURRAY
                        Now, I promise we’ll do everything 
                        in our power to protect him, but I 
                        don’t want to discount Kaczynski 
                        simply because he may look too weak 
                        or too young.

           Murray moves closer to Barbara, placing a hand on her 
           shoulder.

                                 MURRAY 
                        Two dozen applicants vied for your 
                        position, all more qualified, 
                        but... there you were, a paradox of 
                        drive and defiance. You rose to the 
                        challenge, like I knew you would.

           Barbara blushes a little.

           And with a nod, Murray returns to the corkboard. Wants to fit 
           the pieces together just right.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Murray reads over typed pages. Ted watches, apprehensive.

                                 MURRAY
                        The higher man is distinguished 
                        from the lower by his fearlessness 
                        and his readiness to challenge 
                        misfortune. That’s Nietzsche. And 
                        not even Nietzsche at his best.

                                 TED
                        I think there’s merit in what he’s 
                        saying.

                                 MURRAY
                        So do a lot of folks.

           Ted is nervous. He’s let Murray down. Murray presses on.
                                 MURRAY
                        Human nature is simply what it is: 
                        it has its dark and its light 
                        sides. The sum of all colors is 
                        grey - light on a dark background 
                        or dark on light.

                                 TED
                        Valid, don’t you agree?

                                 MURRAY
                        If you must plagiarize, avoid my 
                        favorites. I studied with Carl 
                        Jung.

                                 TED
                        Points for great taste?

           No such luck.

                                 MURRAY
                        What’s going on, Ted?

                                 TED
                        I don’t have a life philosophy 
                        because I haven’t had a life. I’ve 
                        only ever known two places. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Then start here. The train didn’t 
                        drop you off yesterday. It’s your - 
                        what - third semester? Bags 
                        unpacked, you know which building 
                        loans out dusty hardcovers and 
                        which serves mystery meat. What 
                        else do you see when you look 
                        around?

                                 TED
                        Nothing worth reporting back to 
                        you. It’s barely functioning.

                                 MURRAY
                        What’s wrong with the algorithm?

                                 TED
                        It’s the students. You know what 
                        I’m talking about, right?

                                 MURRAY
                        If I could see what you see, I’d be 
                        out of a job.
                                 TED
                        I’m tutoring one of them now. Real 
                        dense. And I find the overwhelming 
                        majority coming in, and I assume 
                        leaving here are like him, not me. 
                        Obsessed with the superficial, the 
                        material. Money, money, money. On a 
                        loop that I’m outside of. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Too bad it doesn’t just appear if 
                        you say it three times fast.

                                 TED
                        They’re born into this. I don’t 
                        know what you call it. High 
                        society? And they don’t appreciate 
                        any of it.

                                 MURRAY
                        How can you tell?

                                 TED
                        Because they don’t have to work for 
                        any of it, the way I do!

                                 MURRAY
                        You’re off making the grades and 
                        giving a shit.

                                 TED
                        Yes! And when they get handed the 
                        same diploma, on the same day as 
                        me, there’s will come with a fancy 
                        job. And I’ll be right back at the 
                        beginning, having to prove myself 
                        all over again.

                                 MURRAY
                        And you’re worried you can’t?

                                 TED
                        No. I’m more worried for the people 
                        less up to the task. Someone like 
                        my dad.

                                 MURRAY
                        And who does he have to prove 
                        himself to?

                                 TED
                        No one I guess. But it feels like 
                        he gave up. And seeing that 
                        terrifies me. 
                                 MURRAY
                        Because it might happen to you?

                                 TED
                        I assume at one point he had 
                        ambition. But lately, it’s like 
                        he’s fallen into that suburban trap 
                        of placing such importance into the 
                        most meaningless things.

                                 MURRAY
                        Such as?

                                 TED
                        After I came home freshman year I 
                        could see it so clearly. It’s like 
                        he has to mention his bowling 
                        score, because he doesn’t have 
                        anything else going on. He clings 
                        to this false sense of pride. And I 
                        want to look up to him, I’m sure I 
                        did at some point, but it just 
                        seems like he’s become... a shell 
                        of himself. All hollowed out and 
                        it’s... sad. And that’s why I want 
                        a place like this to raise up the 
                        intelligent instead of relegate 
                        them to the sidelines.

                                 MURRAY
                        That would be refreshing.

                                 TED
                        Imagine if Harvard didn’t have to 
                        grade on a curve, if everyone 
                        excelled because it was actually 
                        catered to the individual. You know 
                        a thing or two about sea-faring 
                        vessels. Doesn’t a rising tide 
                        raise all ships or something like 
                        that?

                                 MURRAY
                        I don’t know Ted...

           Ted’s deflated. Spilled his guts, and that’s all he gets? 

                                 MURRAY
                        ...Sounds like the beginning of a 
                        philosophy to me. 

           Phew... Ted’s relieved.
                                 MURRAY
                        Stand that up at the debate, and 
                        you should be in good shape.

           Ted smiles. An “Attaboy” from Dr. Murray feels like a 
           thousand rainbows on the sunniest day of your life.

           PRE-LAP sounds of TYPING.

           INT. ELIOT HOUSE - DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Small and spartan. No decorations. Just a twin bed, color-
           coded text books and a SMITH-CORONA TYPEWRITER.

           And Ted gives it a work-out. Types up a storm, his brain 
           can’t send the message through his arm and into his 
           fingertips fast enough.

           INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

           It’s midday. Students linger between rows of shelves and 
           stacks of books.

           Ted finishes checking out at the counter. He slides some 
           books into a bag, but as he heads through the door --

           He almost runs right into Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Whoa! No need for a heist, they 
                        give them out for free.

           The usually manicured Michael looks out of sorts. Moppy hair. 
           Misbuttoned shirt. Something’s off.

                                 TED
                        I didn’t realize you knew where the 
                        library was.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Third time’s a charm.

                                 TED
                        Have a good time at the beach?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was really good actually, yeah. 
                        But right after, not so much. 

                                 TED
                        Sorry to hear that.
           Ted stars to wander off, but Michael follows. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, my dad actually ended up in 
                        the neighborhood and stopped by 
                        campus, I wasn’t here, obviously, 
                        and it turned into a whole thing...

                                 TED
                             (holding back a smile)
                        Oh, that’s too bad.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So I was wondering if maybe we 
                        could pick back up with our 
                        sessions? See if you can still turn 
                        me into a mean math machine?

                                 TED
                        Unfortunately, my schedule’s filled 
                        up a bit.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Come on, man. Seriously? This is 
                        important.

           Ted stops. Considers. Almost feels bad for the guy, but --

                                 MICHAEL
                        How about I pay you double? Or 
                        better yet, name your price. I can 
                        make it worth your while and it’ll 
                        just be between you and --

                                 TED
                        Why is your answer to everything 
                        always money?

           Michael stares at Ted with bewilderment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because it works?

                                 TED
                        Not today. You can’t have anything 
                        you want, whenever you want it.

           Michael recoils a little under Ted’s glare. Oops.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I didn’t mean to insult you, I just 
                        -- if my grades don’t come up, he’s 
                        gonna pull me out of here. I just 
                        need a little help. Please.
           Ted weighs his decision, and leans in to Michael.

                                 TED
                        You want help? Here’s some advice.
                             (beat)
                        Leave.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

                                 TED
                        Leave Harvard. Stop taking someone 
                        else’s spot. You’re gonna land on 
                        your feet no matter what happens 
                        here, so go be rich and stupid 
                        someplace else.

           Michael steps back. Affronted. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fuck you, Ted.

           As the two stand there, we hear the NOON BELL RINGING 
           throughout campus.

                                 TED
                        Time’s up.

           And with that, Ted departs, all smiles. A new energy and 
           confidence brimming inside.

           INT. BASEMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Barbara hurries along, STRUGGLING with several boxes of 
           papers. Her SCARF dangling precariously. 

           She passes SUBJECT ROOM “A.” Locked. Secured. 

           The construction is finished. The workmen are gone.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Barbara ENTERS to find -- Murray pacing as the Transcription 
           Girls sit patiently at a conference table, WAITING.

                                 BARBARA
                        Sorry. Still getting the hang of 
                        the Xerox. Paper jam.

           She sets down the boxes, unwraps her scarf and spots AN 
           UNFAMILIAR FACE amongst them --
           PETER NOLAND (30’s). Jacket and tie. Perfect hair. 
           Untrustworthy smile. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Hi. I missed introductions. I’m 
                        Barbara.

                                 PETER
                        Peter Noland. Nice to meet you.

           As the two SHAKE, Murray wanders to the corkboard.

                                 MURRAY
                        Peter’s on loan from the law 
                        department.

                                 BARBARA
                        Oh, that’s great. It’ll be nice to 
                        have someone advising us.

           She begins to unstack the boxes, passing out stacks of paper.

                                 BARBARA
                        Carol, Francine, if you could help 
                        with these -- great. Thanks.

           The girls start sorting.

                                 BARBARA
                        So, now that we have all the 
                        subject’s personal philosophy 
                        essays, I figured we’d start 
                        pairing them with their debate 
                        partners. I’ve worked up an initial 
                        list, based on some preliminary 
                        scoring and their value systems. 
                        Just to try and --

                                 MURRAY
                        That won’t be necessary.

                                 BARBARA
                        I assumed you already have some 
                        partners picked out but I wanted to 
                        provide options --

                                 MURRAY
                        No. Peter will be conducting all 
                        the debates.

           Peter gives her AN AWKWARD SMILE. Barbara LAUGHS, before 
           realizing no one else is.
                                 BARBARA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 MURRAY
                        Peter will be debating each student 
                        individually.

                                 BARBARA
                        We... um... he can’t do that.

           But Murray ignores her. Barbara moves in. 

                                 BARBARA
                        We already told the students 
                        they’ll be debating their peers, 
                        not arguing... against a lawyer. 
                        We’d be lying to them. It’s 
                        unethical.

                                 MURRAY
                        Carol, show Peter to my office. 
                        Make sure he has everything he 
                        needs to get started.
                             (beat)
                        Francine, Rebecca, give us the 
                        room, please.

           Murray and Barbara wait as everyone exits. Once they’re 
           gone...

                                 BARBARA
                        Dr. Murray, the first thing you 
                        taught me was, you can’t change the 
                        variables of a study in the middle 
                        of a study. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Unless that is the purpose of the 
                        study.

                                 BARBARA
                        That doesn’t make any...
                             (biting her tongue)
                        I don’t understand where we’re 
                        trying to get to?

           Murray stares at her, DISAPPOINTED. Then picks up her scarf. 

                                 BARBARA
                        What are you --

                                 MURRAY
                        Illustrating a lesson I had to 
                        learn once upon a time.
           He SLICES her scarf in half with a LARGE PAIR OF SCISSORS.

                                 BARBARA
                        Damnit! What the hell!

                                 MURRAY
                        You see? You can’t get an authentic 
                        reaction from someone if they know 
                        what’s coming. And they won’t see 
                        this coming.

           Beat. Barbara thinks it over.

                                 BARBARA
                        I understand, but we have a 
                        responsibility to protect them 
                        from... us, don’t we? Otherwise, we 
                        could do... anything.

                                 MURRAY
                        These young men signed up looking 
                        for results. And if you coddle 
                        them, then you betray both their 
                        faith in you as well as the work 
                        itself. And in that version, no one 
                        gets what they want and all of this 
                        will have been for nothing.

           Barbara pauses. She doesn’t agree, but... has no argument.

           Satisfied, Murray refocuses on -- The STACK OF LIFE 
           PHILOSOPHY PAPERS. Most are just scribbled line paper, but 
           one in particular is -- 

           TYPED AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN THE REST. 

           Murray holds it up.

                                 MURRAY
                        Lawful?

                                 BARBARA
                        Yes. He worked very hard on it.

                                 MURRAY
                        What do you know, it’s almost like 
                        I know what I’m talking about.

           And Murray walks off, leafing through Ted’s paper as he goes.

           EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

           Overcast, cold, foreboding, students are bundled and hurried.
           It’s an awful day... that’s only going to get worse.

           INT. ELIOT HOUSE - DORM ROOM - DAY

           Ted finishes getting ready. Tie straightened. Pants pleated. 
           Shoes freshly polished.

           He feels like a million bucks.

           INT. BASEMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Ted sits PATIENTLY, bookended by other waiting students. 

           All are dressed up. And nervous.

           Someone checks the clock. Another coughs. A few silently 
           practice their ‘strong position’ to themselves.

           It’s like the waiting room for an audition. Finally...

           A door OPENS and everyone STIFFENS. 

           Barbara EXITS followed by... GLENN RICHARDSON.

           The once jovial boy is unreadable. Muscles tight. Body rigid. 
           Finally, Glenn cracks his neck, the sound echoing down the 
           hall.

           Everyone jolts, sharing concerned glances.

           But Glenn turns, a smile on his face. As he passes, he peels 
           a WAD OF GUM off the wall and tosses it back into his mouth.

           Bizarre.

           Ted watches with fascination, until --

                                 BARBARA
                        Kaczynski?

           And Ted’s gaze LEAPS to Barbara. 

           She stares back with a fake smile. Ted rises and FOLLOWS her 
           down the hall toward -- SUBJECT ROOM “A.” 

           Ted takes a deep breath and follows Barbara inside.

           INT. BASEMENT - SUBJECT ROOM “A” - CONTINUOUS

           Claustrophobic. Unsettling. Eerie.
           The room is a cacophony of wood and wires. A bulky LIGHTING 
           FIXTURE hangs perilously overhead. A GIANT MIRROR lines one 
           wall; an ELABORATE MACHINE sits on a cart in the corner.

           But Ted’s attention is focused on --

           THE CHAIR.

           Outfitted with elaborate leather straps and electrodes, it 
           resembles a high tech electric chair.

           A technophobe’s nightmare.

                                 BARBARA
                        Remove your jacket and have a seat.

           Ted obeys. A TECH takes his coat. Ted carefully takes a seat, 
           unsure if there will be pain on contact.

           It’s rigid. Uncomfortable.

           He glimpses his reflection in the mirror. Fixes his hair. But 
           then suddenly, realizes --

                                 TED
                        Um, excuse me... but where’s the 
                        student I’m debating?

           Barbara wheels over the cart. She clicks switches and sorts 
           wires on the HEART RATE MONITOR.

                                 BARBARA
                        On the other side of that wall. 
                        Please undo the top three buttons 
                        of your shirt.

           He does so.

                                 TED
                        What are those for?

                                 BARBARA
                        Try and relax.

           She APPLIES electrodes to his temples. She reaches through 
           his shirt, placing one pad on his chest. Ted FLINCHES.

                                 TED
                        Ah. Sorry. It’s cold.

           Barbara begins to strap his wrist to the chair’s armrest, but 
           Ted recoils.
                                 TED
                        Um, I’m sorry. Is all this 
                        necessary. I mean, do you need to 
                        actually strap me in?

                                 BARBARA
                        Small movements can disrupt our 
                        instruments.

           Resigned, Ted places his arm back on the rest. She straps in 
           one, then the other. 

           Barbara reaches behind him, strapping his back flush with the 
           chair. He couldn’t be more uncomfortable.

                                 TED
                        It’s a little tight.

           She ignores him, wraps a coil around his index finger.

           With a whirl, she turns on the machine. The instruments 
           CALIBRATE, clicking and buzzing to life.

           Ted tries to adjust his seat, but the accessories make it 
           nearly impossible.

                                 TED
                        Barbara, how long is this going to 
                        last?

           She gives him a half smile, and departs.

           The door CLOSES. Ted sits there, strapped in and terrified.

           Nothing but the clicking of the machine. And then --

           A set of BRIGHT LIGHTS BLAST ON. Ted SQUINTS, nearly blinded.

                                 TED
                        Hello?

           He’s lost, seeing only colors and halos, until --

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        Good afternoon.

           A voice BOOMS through static-filled speakers.

                                 TED
                        Hi. Um... good afternoon.

           He tries to locate the source but finds only his scared 
           reflection.
                                 PETER (O.C.)

                        How old are you?

                                 TED
                        Seven--
                             (louder)
                        SEVENTEEN.

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        And do you affirm that all the 
                        ideas presented in your thesis 
                        today are your own?

                                 TED
                        Yes, I do.

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        Not one word has been plagiarized 
                        or appropriated?

                                 TED
                        No.

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        And you recorded these thoughts 
                        under your own volition because 
                        they are what you believe, correct?

                                 TED
                        Yes. I’m sorry. Who are you?

           Nothing but the static of the speakers.

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        I’d like us to begin with your 
                        opening paragraph...
           INT. BASEMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On the other side of the mirror, PETER sits before a 
           microphone. Ted’s thesis lies open, along with several other 
           case files labeled “LAWFUL.” 

                                 PETER
                        You state that, “An exceptional 
                        individual can only flourish within 
                        a healthy society, one that fosters 
                        intelligence and innovation.”

           Behind him, MURRAY stands, the conductor of this orchestra, 
           as each cue builds to a crescendo.

           BARBARA is at a 16mm Arriflex Camera, filming Ted through a 
           hole in the wall. 

                                 PETER
                        “However, within an unhealthy 
                        society, the unexceptional will 
                        thrive based solely on their 
                        predetermined status and financial 
                        well-being.”

           And behind all of this -- A MAN IN A PINSTRIPE SUIT (50’s) 
           sits in the corner. We’ll call him -- STRIPE. He smokes, 
           observes, but does not participate.

                                 PETER
                        A lot to unpack here, let’s see if 
                        we can’t break this down. You think 
                        society is broken?

                                                              INTERCUT:

           Ted struggles to answer comfortably under duress. The machine 
           scratches away, outlining Ted’s emotional distress.

                                 TED
                        Yes, I think it started with good 
                        intentions, but if you want to 
                        improve, we need to stop valuing 
                        the accumulation of wealth and --

                                 PETER
                        Lift up the exceptional.

                                 TED
                        Exactly.

                                 PETER
                        Shape the rules to favor people 
                        like... yourself.
                                 TED
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 PETER
                        We don’t have time for modesty 
                        today, Mr. Kaczynski. You don’t 
                        think you’re special?

                                 TED
                        I think my grades speak for 
                        themselves.

                                 PETER
                        Harvard is lousy with 
                        valedictorians. Hang your hat 
                        somewhere else, please.

           On the other side of the glass, Murray gives Peter a signal. 

           Two more lights click on in the room. Ted squints.

           Barbara zooms in tighter with the camera. Stripe smokes.

                                 PETER
                        Tell me, Ted, have you done much 
                        traveling? Been outside the United 
                        States?

                                 TED
                        No.

                                 PETER
                        So you haven’t canvassed much of 
                        society... you were talking about 
                        Harvard.

                                 TED
                        Not directly, but --

                                 PETER
                        But they suffer from the same 
                        affliction?

                                 TED
                        Yes.

                                 PETER
                        Because you’re seventeen, and home 
                        and Harvard is all you know.

                                 TED
                        Dr. Murray also felt --
                                 PETER
                        Dr. Murray isn’t here, Mr. 
                        Kaczynski. You’re talking to me, 
                        defending your words. Because they 
                        are your words, aren’t they?

                                 TED
                        Yes.

                                 PETER
                        I asked you three times and that’s 
                        what you said.

                                 TED
                        Yes. They’re my words.

                                 PETER
                        And you believe the most 
                        prestigious university in the  
                        world, one that has sired five 
                        presidents, over three hundred 
                        congressmen, and the heads of 
                        nearly every fortune five-hundred 
                        company... isn’t elevating the 
                        right people? Are all those men 
                        idiots?

                                 TED
                        Obviously not. But --

                                 PETER
                        But according to you, the system is 
                        broken.

                                 TED
                        I never said “broken.”

                                 PETER
                        Yes, you did. You said it was 
                        broken but it had good intentions --

                                 TED
                        What I meant was --

                                 PETER
                        Choose your words carefully. 
                        Meaning is important here.

           Ted freezes. Looks around. For someone. For anything.

                                 TED
                        I -- I was told I was going to 
                        debate another student.

                        anything about this chair or any of 
                        this?

           Peter looks to Murray. The doctor gives a nod. 

                                 MURRAY
                        This was expected. Answer like we 
                        rehearsed.

           Peter turns back on the microphone.

                                 PETER
                        I’m the one who read your thesis. 
                        And I was not impressed. While 
                        others chose to ruminate on their 
                        feelings or muse over the road 
                        traveled, you made an explicit 
                        indictment. Young boy judges a 
                        man’s world. Extra, Extra! News at 
                        6! Well I have a followup: why do 
                        you hate this school so much?

                                 TED
                        I don’t hate this school.

                                 PETER
                        But you hate the students. The ones 
                        who have outperformed you.

                                 TED
                        I don’t think having wealthy 
                        parents is a calculable trait to 
                        base performance.

                                 PETER
                        You and you alone have decided they 
                        must not have any redeemable 
                        qualities, correct? Doesn’t matter 
                        what Harvard thinks.

                                 TED
                        No, I -- you twisted what I said --

                                 PETER
                        You brought up traits, I’m curious, 
                        which ones do you actually possess? 
                        Because in your two years here, you 
                        have no real friends. No romantic 
                        involvements. Your teachers 
                        overlook you. You simply... exist.

           Ted looks away. Ashamed. He’s sweating. Getting dizzy. The 
           heat and lights taking their toll.
           Ted’s eyes drupe. Head heavy. This is rough.

           Murray leans in, clicks off Peter’s microphone for a moment.

                                 MURRAY
                        Push him harder.

           Peter tightens, leans down. Firing up.

                                 PETER
                        You’re a child, Ted. A human 
                        calculator. The most special thing 
                        about you is how quickly you’re 
                        forgotten when you leave a room. 
                        You want to be important so badly, 
                        that you write this flippant, 
                        presumptuous manifesto that 
                        suggests Harvard must be decaying, 
                        because it has not ascended you to 
                        some great height.

                                 TED
                        I never said --

                                 PETER
                        You did. In a series of ignorant 
                        moves: First you committed it to 
                        paper and then you handed it in. 
                        Everything is broken because you’re 
                        not successful. Well, maybe 
                        Harvard’s exactly the way it’s 
                        supposed to be. And you’re not 
                        satisfied, because... you’re the 
                        one who is broken!

                                 TED
                        No. No, that’s not it.

           A tear travels down Ted’s cheek, he buries his head into his 
           shoulder and does his best to wipe it away.

           Murray reaches into the “Lawful” folder, flips it open. 
           Points to something. 

           Barbara looks up from the camera. The two share a look. She 
           pleads with her eyes. Don’t do that. 

           But Murray points again, and... Peter nods.

                                 PETER
                        Let that sink in. Sit and wallow in 
                        just how wrong you are.

                        bullshit and save yourself this 
                        embarrassment. 

                                 TED
                        I’m not wrong.

                                 PETER
                        Mistakes get made all the time. 
                        Your acceptance to this program. 
                        Your paper. Maybe you should have 
                        attended another school altogether. 
                        They could have incorrectly scored 
                        your IQ test. Maybe you weren’t 
                        supposed to skip those grades and 
                        you’re actually a senior in high 
                        school right now. Maybe Ma and Pa 
                        never planned to have a son. Life 
                        can be full of mistakes.

           Ted shuts down, looks down, breaks eye contact from whoever’s 
           behind there.

                        Isn’t it possible you’re simply 
                        wrong?

           But Ted doesn’t answer. His eyes tracing the ceiling. 

                                 PETER
                        Isn’t it possible?

           He tests the restraints, not going anywhere, so he tries to 
           distance himself from this moment in his head.

                                 PETER
                        Ted, I asked you a question.

           Ted tries to hold it together. But all the light. The straps. 
           The machine clicking away.

           Barbara and Murray share a look. Something is wrong.

           Murray checks Ted’s heart monitor. It’s spiking violently.

                                 PETER
                             (re: Murray)
                        What do you want me to do?

           Murray ponders the situation.

                                 MURRAY
                        Alright. Let’s get him --
                                 TED
                             (to himself)
                        I’m not a mistake.

           Murray refocuses his team. Peter clicks on the microphone.

                                 PETER
                        What was that? Speak up.

                                 TED
                        That the world does not allow 
                        people of a certain status to 
                        ascend --

                                 MURRAY
                             (re: Peter)
                        Go. Do it now.

                                 PETER
                        -- Yes. Your favorite refrain. Is 
                        this a theory you learned from 
                        observing your father?

           And Ted snaps awake. In shock.

                                 TED
                        What did you say?

                                 PETER
                        Your father. Average sausage maker. 
                        Master bowler. 

                                 TED
                        How did -- how did you know that?

                                 PETER
                        Grinding it together as it grounds 
                        him down. You must know those 
                        casings are made from intestines. 
                        Tell me... do you help your father 
                        clean the intestines? So he feels 
                        like less of a failure?

                                 TED
                        My father’s not a failure.

                                 PETER
                        Perhaps that is why you have such 
                        disdain for the wealthy? You and 
                        your father’s hands covered in the 
                        tissues, organs, fat and bloods of 
                        the least desirable scraps of meat.
                                 TED
                        That’s it. I’m done!

           Ted tugs at his straps, but they don’t budge.

                                 PETER
                        I mean, that’s why there has to be 
                        some grand conspiracy holding your 
                        family down, isn’t it?

                                 TED
                        Let me out!!

           Barbara, disgusted at this display, clocks Murray with a grin 
           he doesn’t attempt to hide.

           Ted yanks harder and harder, growing more frustrated.

                                 PETER
                        Otherwise you might have to 
                        actually face the fact--

                                 TED
                        --Stop. This is over!

                                 PETER
                        --that... you’re not “exceptional.”

                                 TED
                        I said, let me out!!!

           Sensing what’s coming, Barbara abandons the camera and exits 
           the Observation room. 

           Followed by two techs, they open the door just as -- 

           Ted wrenches his arm free from a strap.

                                 TED
                        Right now!

           They go to help, but he won’t let him.

                                 BARBARA
                        Ted, try to calm down. Ted --

                                 TED
                        LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!!!

           And with the lights buzzing, the techs struggling, and Ted 
           writhing in the chair like an animal, we --

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:
           EXT. ILLINOIS WOODS - DAY

           FADE UP ON -- The sun pushing down through the clouds. 
           Endless trees extending into forever. A moment of peace and 
           tranquility after what we just witnessed.

           As we come down through the foliage, we find --

           Ted WANDERING. Worn jeans. Faded t-shirt. Shades of a beard. 

           A shadow of the MOUNTAIN MAN he’ll one day become, but right 
           now, despite the serenity... 

           He’s lost in his own mind.

           He walks along, shoving a tree branch aside. Interrogated.

           He picks up a rock, barely inspects it, before chucking it 
           into a tree. Ambushed.

           He charges at a log, shoes kicking up dirt, and just before 
           they collide, he LEAPS over it. Deceived.

           He violently tears huckleberries from a bush. Hurt. Then --

           Ted DIGS his heel into the soil, dragging a line into the 
           ground with his leg.

           He REPEATS the process three times, creating four perfect 
           right angles, until...

           He takes a step back. 

           We discover that Ted is standing in the middle of A PERFECT 
           RECTANGLE, looking down into the peaceful valley below.

           It would make one hell of a view.

           EXT. KACZYNSKI ILLINOIS HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Ted and David play chess on a small table set half in the 
           shade of a tree. 

           David has to squint, Ted has the better seat.

           Ted has taken out more of David’s pieces, mostly pawns. 

           David isn’t that concerned, happy to spend time with his 
           brother.

                        have played anyway.

                                 TED
                        That’s true.

                                 DAVID

                                 TED
                        I don’t want to talk about school.

           David takes out one of Ted’s rooks. 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, then what is the best thing 
                        about being away from home?

                        Making your own schedule. Eat when

                        Spend as much time alone as you 
                        want.

           David captures Ted’s second bishop.

                                 DAVID
                        And do what you want?

                                 TED
                        To an extent.

           Ted makes another move, but his head’s not in the game.

                                 DAVID
                        Some friends were playing around 
                        with firecrackers. I never held one 
                        before, and they let me.

                                 DAVID
                        Right. Sulfur. We found some in my 
                        friend’s garage.

                                 TED

                                 TED
                        Bullshit.

           Ted confirms it.

                                 DAVID
                        I told you I’ve been practicing.

           Ted can’t believe it. He CLEARS the board with a backhand.

                                 TED
                        I was distracted.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know. You always kind of go 
                        with a sustained mating attack, so 
                        I tried to --

           Ted JABS David in the jaw.

                                 TED
                        -- Shut up.

           David is shocked. Doesn’t cry, but is stunned. He rubs it to 
           lessen the pain.

           Ted gets up, and storms inside. Game over. 

           David gets off his chair and picks chess pieces out of the 
           grass.

           EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Fallen leaves mix with snow on the pavement, as Barbara 
           crosses to -- A CAMBRIDGE BROWNSTONE. 

           Red-brick walls. Shuttered windows. Just one on a uniform 
           street of buildings.

           She ASCENDS the steps. KNOCKS. Waits. No sign of movement.

           She knocks AGAIN. Still nothing. Finally, she checks the 
           door. And... it’s UNLOCKED.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY WAY - CONTINUOUS

           Barbara SQUEAKS the door OPEN. Nothing but long dark 
           hallways. Seemingly EMPTY, but... a TV echoes from somewhere. 
                                 BARBARA
                        Dr. Murray?
                             (beat)
                        It’s Barbara.
                             (beat)
                        I’m going to come inside now.

           No response. A moment of hesitation. Barbara LEAVES THE DOOR 
           OPEN and... ventures INSIDE.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           She moves CAUTIOUSLY. CLICKS a light switch. Nothing. 

           Barbara steps forward and -- the remains of a lightbulb 
           CRACKLES under foot. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Henry?

           Along the hallway walls, she finds lines of freshly smeared 
           BLACK PAINT. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Your front door’s open. I tried 
                        calling, but no one answered.

           HOME OFFICE

           A television casts an eerie glow. The room’s in disarray. 
           Furniture turned over. Art clumsily REARRANGED on the walls. 
           Shoes organized in a pattern on the floor.

           Barbara is busy looking over the chaos, when -- 

           THE FRONT DOOR SLAMS.

           HALLWAY

           Barbara peaks out to find -- 

           MURRAY. Eyes wide. Hair a mess. Paint smeared on his 
           clothing.

                                 BARBARA
                        Jesus. Henry, are you al --

                                 MURRAY
                        Shhhhhhhhh.
                             (pointing up)
                        They’ll hear.

           She looks around. Who? And Murray wanders away into --
           LIVING ROOM

           He scoops a handful of paint out of the half-filled bucket. 
           Drags the glob along the wall, stretching it from heavy to 
           light.

                                 MURRAY
                        We should write more, don’t you 
                        think?

           Barbara watches Murray from the doorway. Perplexed.

                                 BARBARA
                        No, right now, we should talk about 
                        the debates. But did you... take 
                        something?

                                 MURRAY
                             (draws on the wall)
                        Oh, but the written word is so... 
                        personal. So simple. You can see 
                        it, and then suddenly --
                             (smears it away)
                        Gone. No prying eyes, spies, or 
                        lies. Momentary. Like you and me.

           Barbara sees that the phone cord has been pulled from the 
           wall. The device now sits in a bowl of water.

                                 MURRAY
                        Click, click! They think I don’t 
                        hear it, but I do. A click, click 
                        on the line. Someone’s always 
                        listening. Wheels and reels turn 
                        and twirl. And our words sent 
                        everywhere!
                             (beat)
                        They don’t trust me anymore.

           Barbara spots the likely culprit for this paint-soaked 
           soliloquy -- A RED VIAL sits open on a glass table. 

           She moves to it, examines the contents.

                                 BARBARA
                        What is this? How much did you 
                        take?

           Murray simply stares back, EXAMINING HER.

                                 MURRAY
                        I disappoint you. Holes in the 
                        walls reveal holes in my logic. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MURRAY (CONT'D)
                        And you question more than you 
                        experience.

                                 BARBARA
                        Can you... talk forward?

                                 MURRAY
                        You want to flip from input to 
                        output prematurely and it’s causing 
                        a logjam in your pathways. It’s so 
                        clear to me. Stuck like permanent 
                        glue and you need an elixir to come 
                        undone. Except you think if you let 
                        down your guard, everything will 
                        crumble. But no one asked you to 
                        mind the store. You only need to 
                        mind me. The soft tissue of the 
                        mind is malleable for a reason. 
                        Push just right and a sea change 
                        washes over you.

           Barbara stares. Losing faith in him with every sentence. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I think maybe you should lie down.

           He gets frustrated, pacing the room.

                                 MURRAY
                        I am talking about the ocean of the 
                        human mind... 

           He moves quickly to the table, picking up the red vial.

                                 MURRAY
                        ...And I have found our ship.
                             (beat)
                        One milliliter and you can smell 
                        the salt in the air, the wind at 
                        your back, and mysteries fall away 
                        before you like waves. It’s 
                        breathtaking.
                             (beat)
                        We should test its effects on a 
                        larger group. Make a note.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m gonna get you some water.

           But as she heads to the kitchen, Murray STUDIES HER. His 
           demeanor shifts. Brow narrows.
                                 MURRAY
                        Why are you here? Are you working 
                        for them?

           She returns with a glass, but Murray ignores it.

                                 MURRAY
                        Tell me the truth. They sent you to 
                        check up on me, didn’t they?

                                 BARBARA
                        Nobody sent me.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’ll know if you’re lying --

           Barbara puts down the glass.

                                 BARBARA
                        Clearly this is not the time or 
                        place to get anything done, so I’m 
                        gonna go and --

           But as she steps toward the door, Murray BLOCKS her path by 
           moving to a drink cart.

                                 MURRAY
                        Who have you spoken to about our 
                        study?

           He pours himself a scotch, but keeps THE BOTTLE in hand.

                                 BARBARA
                        No one. Henry, listen to me. You’re 
                        under the influence of something 
                        that’s causing paranoia and erratic 
                        mood --

           Murray advances and Barbara carefully RETREATS. Never 
           panicking, but keeping a nearby table between them.

                                 MURRAY
                        How am I supposed to ever trust you 
                        again?

                                 BARBARA
                        You need to calm --

                                 MURRAY
                        Don’t ever tell me what I need to 
                        do.

           And without meaning to -- SMASH! Murray breaks the bottom of 
           the bottle off on the table. Liquor falls on his feet, but --
           Gives the bottle AN EDGE. Barbara looks at the BROKEN BOTTLE. 
           Murray now holds a weapon and may not know it.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m with you. And I’ve done 
                        everything I can to get you 
                        results. Just help me understand.

           Barbara moves around the other side, and Murray slides again. 
           A game of cat and mouse.

                                 MURRAY
                        All I do is help.

                                 BARBARA
                        Are we helping these students? The 
                        truth. Please. Because I have 
                        reservations about this study, the 
                        parameters which you adjust almost 
                        daily. I think we’re wandering into 
                        some serious moral and ethical gray 
                        areas.

                                 MURRAY
                        Yes. The gray! You’re starting to 
                        understand.

                                 BARBARA
                        No. I’m really not. We are 
                        restraining children and berating 
                        them and we need to discuss 
                        changing our strategy.

                                 MURRAY
                        It is my strategy!! And you of all 
                        people will not shut me down.

           Suddenly Murray LUNGES for her. She maneuvers, narrowly 
           avoids him, and -- 

                                 BARBARA
                        Wait a --

           Murray’s foot hits a paint bucket, TUMBLES to the ground.

           He falls, LODGING the glass into his right palm.

           Barbara backtracks toward the door, but then...

           She sees: Murray sitting up, blood pours from his wound and 
           onto the floor.

                                 MURRAY
                        Oh God. I’ve sprung a leak.
           She stops, Murray suddenly no longer a threat. Just her 
           mentor in need.  

           INT. BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Barbara guides an injured Murray to the sink, runs water over 
           his injury. Blood pooling into the basin. 

                                 BARBARA
                        This is gonna hurt.

           Her fingers PINCH -- A LARGE PIECE OF GLASS --

                                 MURRAY
                             (wincing)
                        Goddamn it.

                                 BARBARA
                        I know, one, two -- there!

           She CATCHES the glass. It SLIDES out. Murray quickly wraps 
           his hand in a dish towel.

                                 MURRAY
                        Psychopharmacology can be... 
                        unpredictable.

           Barbara nods. And the two stand there awkwardly.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Murray solemnly escorts Barbara through the drug-induced mess 
           that is his home.

                                 BARBARA
                        Keep the pressure on until you get 
                        real first aid.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 BARBARA
                        It’s deep. You’ll probably need 
                        stitches.

           Murray IGNORES her. He’s coming down, pain spinning him into 
           sobriety. Embarrassment sinking in.

           Barbara picks the Red Vial up off the floor.
                                 BARBARA
                        Who got you these drugs? Is it the 
                        man who sat in on the debates?

                                 MURRAY
                        No.

                                 BARBARA
                        Who is he?

                                 MURRAY
                        You’d be happy if I stopped the 
                        program, wouldn’t you?

                                 BARBARA
                        No. I think you’re brilliant. You 
                        see the world in a way no one else 
                        can. And I want to work with you, 
                        but you can’t keep pushing me away. 
                        If we want out of this, you gotta 
                        let me in.

           Murray looks the girl over. He wants to trust her, but...

                                 MURRAY
                        As someone who often peers inside 
                        people’s minds, let me tell you... 
                        never let anybody know what you’re 
                        really thinking. They will always 
                        use it against you.  

           Barbara considers Murray against the madness and paranoia.

                                 BARBARA
                        Then I’m sorry. But I can’t be a 
                        part of this anymore. 

                                 MURRAY
                        And I accept your resignation.

           But as she heads for the door...

                                 MURRAY
                        I hate to admit this, but we’re 
                        both soldiers here. And out there? 
                        There are those far less trusting 
                        who will enforce your silence.

           She stares back at him. Was that a warning... or a threat?

           Murray places a finger over his lips.

                                 MURRAY
                        Be careful... getting home.
           And Barbara EXITS into the night with more questions than 
           when she arrived.

           INT. KACZYNSKI ILLINOIS HOUSE - TED’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cluttered with books, academic awards and accomplishments.

           Ted on the edge of his made bed. Wanda sits in a chair in 
           front of him. Hands him a razor.

                                 WANDA
                        For the whiskers. Your father can 
                        show you how to use it if you like.

           Ted takes it and places it on his nightstand.

                                 WANDA
                        So, you’re not talking to me, is 
                        that it? Can you at least look at 
                        me when I’m speaking with you?

           He doesn’t oblige her.

                                 WANDA
                        You owe your brother an apology. At 
                        the very least.

                                 TED
                        He was mouthing off.

                                 WANDA
                        So you sock him? That’s not how I 
                        raised the both of you.

                                 TED
                        Is it swollen?

                                 WANDA
                        David will be fine. It’s you I’m 
                        worried about. 

           He turns away from her.

                                 WANDA

           Ted and Theodore reach the summit of a gentle hill, largest

           Murray and Stripe in the corner booth, no parties seated at 
           the tables on either side of them. 

           Privacy by design as they halt their conversation, when the 
           serious mustached WAITER delivers them each a martini.

                        A position needs to be stated,

                        crying. The clown at my kid’s last

                        simply yelling at them to do what 
                        you want, you do it by finding 
                        something they believe in so 
                        strongly, it’s a part of who they 
                        are. Once you have that, you tear 
                        it down. Brick by brick. To reform 
                        an ideology, you strip away self-
                        confidence and ego, until they only 
                        have you to look to for guidance.

                        It will happen. I can do it. And 
                        when I’m done, they’ll even think

           Stripe considers. Murray watches him, but can’t read his 
           answer on his face. He’s good.

           Frustrated, Murray makes one last push. The big one.

                                 MURRAY
                        Nuclear power has kept the United

                        the next wave of influence lies in 
                        people and what they think. That’s 
                        real power... and that is what I 
                        can provide for you.

           Stripe takes the whole martini in one long sip and gets up. 

                                 STRIPE
                        Stay. Have a filet on us. Old 
                        time’s sake. I have a flight to 
                        catch.

           Murray gets up to respectfully say goodbye. Stripe urges him 
           to stay, hands over the menu, and guides him back down. 

                                 STRIPE
                        Sit. I insist.

           Stripe leaves Murray with little hope. 

           Murray pushes away the martini, it’s not what he came here 
           for, unsure of how convincing his performance was. 

           Time will tell.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Professor Graziano is at the board, shaping young minds with 
           his arsenal of equations and formulas.

                                 GRAZIANO
                        The tricky thing about M by M 
                        Matrixsi is the question of 
                        inversion. We say “A” is invertible 
                        if and only AB = BA, which leads us 
                        to “the Identity Matrix.”

           Through the confused but attentive students, Ted sits in the 
           back. But he isn’t taking notes, instead -- 
           He sketches A LARGE WOODEN CHAIR from multiple angles. A lot 
           weighing on his mind. But as he continues to draw --

                                 GRAZIANO (O.C.)
                        I didn’t hold your attention today.

           Ted looks up to find Graziano standing over him. And now -- 

           ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS ARE GONE.

                                 TED
                        Where is everyone?

                                 GRAZIANO
                        They moved on. Something about 
                        another class.

           Ted catches Graziano glancing down at his sketch. He quickly 
           stuffs it into his bag.

                                 GRAZIANO
                        Is everything alright?

                                 TED
                        I’m fine. Excuse me.

           Ted heads for the door, but --

                                 GRAZIANO
                        Know thyself, Mr. Kaczynski. It’s 
                        the answer to every problem. Know 
                        thyself.

           Ted returns the unsolicited advice with a look, and departs.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Ted marches along, head down. Selective with his eye contact. 

                                  WOMAN (O.C.)
                        Ted.

           A HAND HITS HIS SHOULDER. He recoils, surprised to see --

           BARBARA. Edgy. Nervous. She hasn’t been sleeping.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’ve been looking for you. Can we 
                        go somewhere and talk?

                                 TED
                        No.
                                 BARBARA
                        Please. It’s important.

           INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM - LATER

           Ted sits in an empty desk as Barbara waits at the closed 
           door, looking out. A little paranoid.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’ve spoken to the other students. 
                        I’ve quit the project and -- I 
                        think you should leave too.

                                 TED
                        Leave? Why?

                                 BARBARA
                        Because... it’s not safe for you.  
                        For anyone. It’s not what you think 
                        it is.

                                 TED
                        What is it then?

                                 BARBARA
                        I -- I honestly don’t know. I 
                        thought I did. But whatever it 
                        started as, it’s not that anymore. 
                        It’s changed into --
                             (beat)
                        Dr. Murray is not the man I thought 
                        he was. He’s deceptive. He records 
                        everything. He’s paranoid and 
                        manipulative and -- 

           Ted stares at her, processing what she’s saying.

                                 TED
                        He records everything. Did he 
                        record our sessions?

           Barbara doesn’t answer... which is an answer in itself.

                                 TED
                        And you listened to them?

                                 BARBARA
                        We all listened to them.

           Ted recoils. Feeling vulnerable. Violated.
                                 BARBARA
                        He lied to you, Ted. He wasn’t some 
                        poor kid sitting in his dorm, 
                        building model ships all day during 
                        college. He grew up on Fifth 
                        Avenue, playing football. 
                        Everything he told you was crafted 
                        to get you to trust him. To confide 
                        in him.

           He finally STANDS, anger swelling up inside of him.

                                 BARBARA
                        This is what he does. It’s not your 
                        fault. You’re young and --

                                 TED
                        But you called me one of the “Best 
                        of the best.” You said this study 
                        would help me understand myself 
                        better, remember?

                                 BARBARA
                        I honestly thought it would.

                                 TED
                        Did you think that when you were 
                        strapping me into that chair?

           Barbara hesitates. Choosing her words carefully.

                                 BARBARA
                        Ted, I’m sorry for the part I 
                        played in all this. I truly am.
                             (beat)
                        But if you go back in there, I 
                        promise, you’re not going to get 
                        what you want... and he’ll get 
                        exactly what he wants.

           Ted considers her warning. Unsure of which way he’ll go.

                                 TED
                        Or maybe this is just another lie. 
                        Another test. Either way, I don’t 
                        trust you. I don’t trust him. But I 
                        know myself: you may be able to 
                        forget about all of this and just 
                        go back to your regular life... but 
                        not me.

           And with that, Barbara watches as Ted DEPARTS, the door 
           closing behind him.
           INT. BASEMENT - SUBJECT ROOM “A” - DAY

           A 16mm reel is pulled from its case and loaded onto a 
           PROJECTOR. 

           HANDS open the gate, threading the film with precision.

           Once that’s done, the camera is wheeled in behind --

           THE CHAIR.

           Wired. Strapped. Ominous. Bolted seven and a half feet from 
           the one-way mirror. 

           Murray steps forward, INSPECTING the room. 

           The camera. The chair. The instruments. Everything.

           He’s ready to go.

           STRIPE sits in a folding chair in the corner. He made it 
           after all. He stubs out a cigarette into the wall.

           Ted is that many minutes late.

           Murray and Stripe share an uncomfortable look. Murray fakes a 
           smile. It’s not reciprocated.

           After a long awkward moment, the door FINALLY opens and --

           Ted ENTERS. Much to Murray’s visible delight. 

                                 MURRAY
                        There he is! The man of the hour.

           Ted’s dressed similarly to the way he was during the debate, 
           but now his clothes are wrinkled. No tie. The copy of Moby 
           Dick at his side.

                                 MURRAY
                        Good to see you, son.

           Murray extends for a handshake. Ted sticks the book in it.

                                 TED
                        I wanted to make sure I returned 
                        this. 

                                 MURRAY
                        What’d you think?

                                 TED
                        A crazy old man lies to everyone he 
                        knows and gets eaten for it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TED (CONT'D)
                        I don’t see what all the fuss is 
                        about.

                                 MURRAY
                        Well, you know what I think, and  
                        the scores of other literary 
                        authorities, but I respect you 
                        thinking for yourself. I’ve grown 
                        to expect nothing less.

           Murray puts the book aside, trying to lead Ted inside.

                                 MURRAY
                        Shall we get started?

           The room, the mirror, the chair. Ted’s not sure he can be 
           here.

                                 TED
                        I’m not staying. I just came to 
                        return that.

                                 MURRAY
                        Nonsense. You could have done that 
                        anytime, but chose to do so in your 
                        time slot. Which means I trust you 
                        saw what I saw in Barbara’s 
                        warning. 

           Ted stiffens. His posture tells Murray everything.

                                 MURRAY
                        Delusions, paranoia, in her parting 
                        rant to me I detected notes of 
                        envy. A shame. She will be missed. 
                        But we must remain focused.

           Ted gets right to why he really came:

                                 TED
                        Why did you set me up?

                                 MURRAY
                        I don’t follow.

                                 TED
                        At the debate. Whoever was on the 
                        other side of the glass knew things 
                        about me I only told you. The whole 
                        thing was rigged.
                                 MURRAY
                        Interesting. I didn’t realize we 
                        experienced the event so 
                        differently.

                                 TED
                        How was I supposed to defend 
                        myself? You set me up to fail.

                                 MURRAY
                        But you didn’t fail, Ted. That day 
                        went exactly how I intended. You 
                        were fantastic.

                                 TED
                        Bullshit!

                                 MURRAY
                        I mean, maybe there are some 
                        rhetorical techniques you could 
                        brush up on. We could go over those 
                        today if you like. But all and all, 
                        I thought it was a tremendous 
                        success.

           Murray acknowledges Stripe. 

                                 MURRAY
                        If it wasn’t, I doubt my associate 
                        in the study would travel such a 
                        great distance to meet you, and 
                        observe our work.

           Stripe NODS. Ted pays him very little attention.

                                 MURRAY
                        He’s impressed with the strength of 
                        your convictions, and even shares 
                        some of your beliefs.

           Ted takes another step into the room. He likes his ideas and 
           really likes when someone else does.

                                 MURRAY
                        Take a seat. We can discuss all of 
                        this and more. Clear up any 
                        misunderstandings.

           But he’s not about to lower his guard and sit down. In that 
           chair.

                                 TED
                        Who am I debating today? And what 
                        does he have? My dental records?
                                 MURRAY
                        No debate this session. Just you 
                        and I, talking. Like we always 
                        have.

                                 TED
                        Except I’ll be bound and blinded.

                                 MURRAY
                        You don’t like the lights? Here. We 
                        don’t need them.

           He shuts off the brighter ones angled at the chair.

                                 MURRAY
                        And since there’s no one on the 
                        other side, we can cover that too.

           Murray pulls A PROJECTING SCREEN down over the glass.

                                 MURRAY
                        Satisfied?

           But Ted just stares. Unsure what to do next.

                                 MURRAY
                        Ted, if you don’t want to sit down, 
                        don’t sit. I’m not going to force 
                        you. But you’re the one who said 
                        you didn’t get a chance to defend 
                        yourself. Now... no one’s stopping 
                        you. I’ve always been interested in 
                        what you have to say. You know 
                        that. And if you still believe 
                        everything you wrote in that paper, 
                        this is your chance to prove it. If 
                        not, I don’t want to waste your 
                        time. You’re free to go.

           Murray WAITS. Maybe it’s a bluff. Maybe he means it.

           Ted considers LEAVING. Not giving Murray what he wants. 
           Getting a small win. 

           But if he stays, he can beat him at his own game. 

           Murray swallows. Stripe smokes. Everyone waits, until --

           TED SITS DOWN IN THE CHAIR.

                                 MURRAY
                        Beautiful.

           And Murray wheels over the instrument cart. Ted flinches.
                                 TED
                        No. No machines.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m sorry, Ted. But I’ve collected 
                        this data from everyone in the 
                        program. It’s part of the process. 
                        If you’re not up for it, well... 

           Murray steps back. Waits again. Finally --

           Ted unbuttons some of his shirt. Rolls up his sleeve.

                                 MURRAY
                        This is a standard heart rate 
                        monitor. The readout lets me see 
                        how you’re physically responding to 
                        the event.

           Murray attaches the wires.

                                 MURRAY
                        These can be a little cold and the 
                        one on the finger pinches. Let me 
                        know if you need any adjustments.

           Ted goes along. More considerate treatment this time. 

           But as Murray steps away, the lights go off... 

           And THE PROJECTOR whirls to life. 

                                 TED
                        Wait, I thought we were going to 
                        talk? What are we watching? 

                                 MURRAY
                        You. This session is all about you.

           Ted stares up at THE SCREEN and finds -- HIMSELF.

           THE PROJECTOR: It’s the film Barbara shot of TED’S DEBATE.

           NOTE: This footage will be playing throughout the scene on 
           the screen behind Dr. Murray.

                                 MURRAY
                        We need to review your past 
                        performance before we can move 
                        forward.

           But Ted is uncomfortable staring at himself.
           Murray steps out from the projector, between two strapped-in 
           Ted’s. One on the screen, and one in front of him.

           Stripe has a view of it all: Ted in profile, Murray, and the 
           Ted on the screen.

                                 MURRAY
                        Your thesis was Harvard’s not 
                        working and it can be fixed.

                                 TED
                        Yes.

                                 MURRAY
                        Do you think you were able to get 
                        your point across? Were you pleased 
                        with how you conducted yourself? 
                        Because almost from the beginning, 
                        you seemed... rattled. 

                                 TED
                        Isn’t that what the chair and the 
                        lights and all this are for? To 
                        rattle me?

                                 MURRAY
                        I believe we made it clear this 
                        would be a difficult process. 
                        That’s why we gave you the time to 
                        prepare. Why we met to discuss your 
                        paper. So that you would be ready 
                        for anything...
                             (beat)
                        And yet your opponent employed 
                        repetition as a tool that left you, 
                        how can I put this nicely... 
                        agitated? 

           Murray gestures to the projected film. 

                                 TED
                        I found it frustrating. He wouldn’t 
                        let me speak. I don’t know what you 
                        expected me to do.

                                 MURRAY
                        If it was so powerful, maybe try 
                        some of your own. You didn’t 
                        consider forcing an issue. Fire 
                        with fire.

                                 TED
                        No...
           Murray crosses in front of the projector’s light, growing 
           more ominous by the moment.

                                 MURRAY
                        You could have used anaphora at the 
                        beginning of each sentence to 
                        create strength through patterns, 
                        like Churchill: We shall fight on 
                        the beaches, we shall fight on the 
                        landing grounds, we shall fight in 
                        the fields. Or maybe tricolon, 
                        short triplicate to establish 
                        focus, like Lincoln: Government of 
                        the people, for the people, by the 
                        people. Or diacope, reusing a word 
                        with a brief pause as Roosevelt 
                        did: The only thing we have to 
                        fear... is fear itself. Or 
                        antithesis, dual clause structures 
                        to juxtapose opposing ideas, you 
                        know this from Dickens: It was the 
                        best of times, it was the worst of 
                        times. Or, when all else fails. 
                        Epizeuxis. Repeating the same damn 
                        word over and over, like the 
                        realtor who probably sold your 
                        folks that quaint little home in 
                        Illinois: Location! Location! 
                        Location!
                             (beat)
                        You deployed none of these. You 
                        didn’t help yourself at all.  
                        Instead you simply fell apart.

           Ted is RATTLED. The heart monitor ticks wildly next to him.

                                 TED
                        I thought you said I didn’t fail.

                                 MURRAY
                        That doesn’t mean you succeeded.

           Murray gestures to the film again. Debate Ted looks lost. 
           Defeated. Sad even.

                                 MURRAY
                        Right here! That man called you 
                        broken. Said you were a mistake and 
                        an idiot. And all that comes out is 
                        an unpleasant squeal.

           Sweat beads form on Ted’s brow. But Murray doesn’t let up.
                                 TED
                        I don’t --

                                 MURRAY
                        -- Do you think you’re broken? Are 
                        you a mistake?

                                 TED
                        No!

                                 MURRAY
                        Wonderful! That’s fantastic. And 
                        what did you do to prove it?

           Murray and Ted look up as we see -- Debate Ted CRYING.

                                 MURRAY
                        A single tear. How sweet. That shut 
                        him the fuck up. And allowed you 
                        to... what?

           Murray paces as Ted watches himself cry. Stripe takes a drag 
           of his cigarette.

                                 MURRAY
                        Do nothing! Because that boy up 
                        there. Is weak. Is scared. And he 
                        thinks the world should be handed 
                        to him on a silver platter. Why? 
                        Because he’s good with numbers.

           Ted just stares at the ground.

                                 MURRAY
                        You know, I actually thought we 
                        broke you at this point. When you 
                        went quiet and wouldn’t answer. I 
                        thought... it’s over. We’ll send 
                        him back to general population with 
                        the rest of the simpletons he 
                        claims to loathe.

           Ted looks up. Debate Ted has his head down. The two are 
           mirrors of each other. 

           Murray kneels down next to Ted. Whispering.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m curious. What is he thinking? 
                        At that moment right there.

           But Ted doesn’t respond. He just stares. Unfazed. 
           Murray and Stripe share a look. Stripe puts out his 
           cigarette. Stiffens. Ready to leave.

                                 MURRAY
                        Ted, tell me what you were 
                        thinking. Where’s the confidence 
                        from my office? Ten pounds of piss 
                        and vinegar bursting from his 
                        bargain jacket. Who couldn’t be 
                        badgered into submission. Who was 
                        ready to shove his arrogance down 
                        anyone’s throat and yank out their 
                        undivided attention. What were you 
                        really thinking? I know he’s in 
                        there. Where is he? Make me see it 
                        his way-

                                 TED
                        He’s thinking... how much he hates 
                        you.

           Stripe stops moving. Murray freezes.

           Ted suddenly finds clarity in his exhaustion. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Good. What else?

                                 TED
                        He thought you were his friend. 
                        That you understood him and that he 
                        could trust you. 

                                 MURRAY
                        He can.

                                 TED
                        No, no he can’t. Because you’re 
                        just like everyone else here.

                                 MURRAY
                        Everyone at Harvard?

                                 TED
                        Yes. In it for yourself. Taking 
                        whatever you want from the people 
                        around you.

                                 MURRAY
                        But that’s okay, because the man on 
                        the screen thinks Harvard can be 
                        fixed. Right? And he’s here to set 
                        the record straight. For posterity.  
                        That all it takes is --
                                 TED
                        He’s wrong.

                                 MURRAY
                        That was you two weeks ago. You’re 
                        telling me your --

                                 TED
                        And he’s an imbecile. Harvard is a 
                        stinking system like everything 
                        else. And when it’s infected the 
                        only way forward is to blow it all 
                        up.

           He exorcised a darkness and finds relief.

           Murray exchanges a look with Stripe. A position stated was 
           reversed. 

           Rudimentary mind control achieved. IT WORKED.

                                 MURRAY
                        You really feel that way?

                                 TED
                        I’ve never been more sure about 
                        anything in my life.

           The reel ends, the screen is blank. Murray stands center, 
           backlit. 

                                 MURRAY
                        Good work, Ted.

           STRIPE gets up. Impressed. His nod to Murray says “we’ll be 
           in touch” and he departs.

                                 MURRAY
                        I think we’re getting somewhere.

           Murray turns on the lights. Begins to disconnect Ted from the 
           machine.

                                 MURRAY
                        How do you feel?

           But Ted doesn’t answer. Just buttons his shirt, processing.

           Murray rips the heart monitor paper free. 

           He studies it, smiling.
                                 MURRAY
                        This is the work. Right here. It’s 
                        an advanced process. Not for 
                        everyone.

           Ted finishes rolling down his sleeves. Stares at Murray. And 
           the doctor FEELS it. 

           Murray puts down the readout. Turns to Ted. He puts a hand on 
           Ted’s shoulder. Ted stares back, confused.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m proud of you, son. And the 
                        progress we made today.

           Murray HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. Ted stares. But will he take it?

                                 CAROL (PRE-LAP)
                        Gentlemen, welcome back, it’s so 
                        good to see all of you again... 

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           CAROL stands at the podium. The new Barbara in action. 
           Rebranding the next round.

                                 CAROL
                        ...As you can see, we’ve lost a few 
                        people along the way, but for those 
                        of you who remain....

           As she speaks, we pan across the remaining NINETEEN TEST 
           SUBJECTS. Seated. Some listen. Some don’t.

                                 CAROL
                        ...none of this would be possible 
                        if it weren’t for your trust and 
                        commitment to this process. The 
                        data we’ve collected from your 
                        essays, debates and private 
                        sessions is very promising. On 
                        behalf of the entire department, 
                        I’d like to extend our most sincere 
                        thank you.

           Down the line, PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS hand out new index-sized 
           documents. One holds a card out to --

           enthusiast Glenn Richardson.
                                 CAROL
                        We’ve talked a lot about personal 
                        beliefs, so for this next essay, 
                        we’d like to focus on scientific 
                        innovation and technology. 

           The psychology student reaches the end of a row where -- 

           TED sits, intensely taking notes. His eyes a little more 
           sunken. His beard a little fuller.

                                 CAROL
                        What do you see? Where are we 
                        going? And what effects might they 
                        have on the future of civilization?
                        Remember, there are no wrong 
                        answers... as long as you can 
                        defend them.

           But Ted is committed. There’s no question about that.

           INT. TAXI CAB - DAY

           Barbara sits in the backseat, as CLIFF keeps his hands on the 
           wheel at 10 and 2, driving them along.

           He takes an exit off the highway and the landscape changes 
           dramatically.

           She looks out the window, tries to get lost in the scenery, 
           but it’s not working.

                                 CLIFF
                        Coming or going?

                                 BARBARA
                        Returning.

           On a small town main street now, Cliff takes in the sights.

                                 CLIFF
                        Seems like a wonderful place to 
                        grow up.

                                 BARBARA
                        It has it’s charm.

                                 CLIFF
                        Would you look at that. Soft serve 
                        in a waffle bowl! I’ve only ever 
                        seen cone or paper.
                                 BARBARA
                        They’re very proud of their waffle 
                        bowl.

                                 CLIFF
                        I’ll have to tell my wife. She’d 
                        love that. Never has enough napkins 
                        with a cone.

           She did not miss the small talk...

                                 BARBARA
                        Two more lights, you’ll want to 
                        make a left.

           ...But chose ordinary over extraordinary.

                                 CHRISTOPHER (PRE-LAP)
                        My father likes that I’m here more 
                        than I do, I’m sure of that...

           INT. PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - MURRAY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Murray sits quietly. Listening. Another file folder in his 
           lap. This one marked “RELIANT.” 

           Christopher Tate chats away on the couch:

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        ...best day of his life placing the 
                        Harvard car decal on that bumper. 
                        He said it shut the neighbors up 
                        for good.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’ve heard suburbia brings out the 
                        ugliest competitions. 

           Murray closes the “Reliant” file. Lights a cigarette.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Say what’s the deal with those 
                        ships? You sail?

           Murray RISES, drops the psychologist act, to show them off.

                                 MURRAY
                        No. That’s the Essex and this one 
                        is the Pequod. They’re American 
                        whaling ships from “Moby Dick.” 
                        You’ve read it, I assume?
                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Yeah. In middle school.

                                 MURRAY
                        I was obsessed in high school, my 
                        mother gave me these as a 
                        graduation present.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Really?

                                 MURRAY
                        Actually the last gift she ever 
                        gave me. She passed away the next 
                        year.

           Christopher STANDS, following Murray to the models. As he 
           looks over them with a new respect...

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        My mother died last May. She never 
                        even got to see me graduate.

                                 MURRAY
                        I’m sorry, Christopher. Losing a 
                        mother, it makes a boy -- 

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Have to grow up pretty quickly.

                                 MURRAY
                        Exactly. More water?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Please.

           With a smile, Murray moves to the cart with the pitcher of 
           water. And as he refills the glass, we find -- 

           A FAMILIAR RED VIAL on the cart as well.

                                 MURRAY
                        So, tell me... what else is on your 
                        mind? You have my full attention.

           Murray hands him the water, and they take their respective 
           seats once again.

           INT. KACZYNSKI ILLINOIS HOUSE - DAY

           Wanda closes the oven and sets a timer. Theodore comes home 
           from work, sets down his lunch tin, and kisses his wife.
                                 THEODORE
                        Hear from Ted today?

           Wanda shakes her head no. Ted puts his arm on her shoulder.

           David RUNS in.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey Dad! Mom, what time is dinner?

           Wanda points to the timer.

                                 WANDA
                        When that goes off, we’ll be ready 
                        to eat.

           David checks the timer himself.

                                 DAVID
                        Great. Plenty of time.

                                 WANDA
                        For what?

                                 DAVID
                        To write Ted another letter.

                                 THEODORE
                        Did he respond to your last one and 
                        we missed it?

                                 DAVID
                        No. But here’s what I’m thinking. 
                        Yes, Ted’s a math genius and lots 
                        of subjects are easy for him. But 
                        it’s a new semester and maybe he is 
                        taking a class that he’s really 
                        struggling with and he just forgot.

           David heads out of the kitchen. Theodore and Wanda exchange a 
           look, haven’t heard from Ted in awhile. 

           Ted’s withdrawn; they don’t put much stock in David’s theory.

           INT. ELIOT HOUSE - DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Ted is hunched over his Smith-Corona.

           The room is dark. Lights off. Window open. The color-coded 
           text books piled in a corner.

           Dirty, discarded dishes fester on a bookshelf. 
           But Ted pays no mind, typing away, until --

           A KNOCK.

           He stops, looks up. More feral and fidgety than normal.

           Starts to type again, but --

           ANOTHER KNOCK.

           With a sigh, Ted stands. Screws in a lightbulb, illuminating 
           the disheveled room. 

           He unlocks and inches open the door to find --

           MICHAEL.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, Ted. How you doing?

           Ted looks the boy over. What the hell is he doing here?

                                 TED
                        Busy. What do you want?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I come in?
                             (beat)
                        It’ll only take a moment.

           Annoyed, Ted lets Michael enter. As he does, he CRINGES, 
           taking in the disgusting surroundings.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Everything okay man? You seriously 
                        need to crack a window in here.
                             (beat)
                        Jesus, was that milk?

                                 TED
                        What do you want, Michael?

           Michael reaches into his jacket and removes -- AN ENVELOPE.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Your last check. My parents owed 
                        you for three sessions. I told them 
                        you were adamant about not taking 
                        our money, but... they insisted.

           Ted reluctantly takes the envelope and tosses it next to the 
           collection of bowls.
                                 TED
                        Anything else?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I took your advice. Done with 
                        school, parents had enough. I fly 
                        off to London top of the year. 

                                 TED
                        I’m sure you’ll land on your feet.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s the thing, I already did. 
                        Dad wants me to learn the 
                        transatlantic routes. Then it’s off 
                        to New York, where, by my 
                        calculations, I’ll be the youngest 
                        executive in the history of 
                        American Airlines. 
                             (beat)
                        Hell, maybe I’ll pop over to France 
                        to The Louvre and see if Vicki’s 
                        ass deserves to be there. 

           Ted’s had enough. He moves to the door, gesturing for Michael 
           to leave.

                                 TED
                        Thanks for stopping by.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You know, when you’re finally out 
                        of here, if you ever need a job...

                                 TED
                        You’d do that for me? Dad’s just 
                        handing out jobs like peanuts. I 
                        guess I was lucky you were dumb 
                        enough to need my help. But 
                        honestly, there’s nothing left I 
                        can do for you. Society’s in decay. 
                        The world’s spinning into apathy 
                        and you’ll just be sitting there 
                        behind your big fancy desk with 
                        everything but a clue. No, the next 
                        time you hear from me, you might 
                        very well be the one asking for 
                        help. But considering the direction 
                        we’re all heading, by then, it’ll 
                        already be too late.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You always tell it like it is, Ted. 
                        Take care of yourself.
           Michael DEPARTS as Ted SLAMS the door behind him.

           He unscrews the bulb again, sits down at his desk and resumes 
           typing, like nothing even happened.

           EXT. CAMPUS POST OFFICE - DAY

           It’s RAINING. Students dodge puddles, taking cover under 
           awnings to smoke and chat.

           The entire campus looks DEPRESSING.

           INT. CAMPUS POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ted waits in line amongst a crop of drenched students. He’s 
           dressed in A SOAKED SWEATSHIRT. 

           In front, A MAN has a small transistor radio loudly playing a 
           baseball game. 

           The man SNEEZES so Ted tries to scoot back, but...

           Behind him, TWO GIRLS gossip, shooting him strange looks.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Next.

           The Radio Man moves along and Ted tightens. His eyes moving 
           across the room. 

           The lights above BUZZ. Puts him back in the debate chair, 
           under the brutal halogens.

           An engine from outside BACKFIRES. 

           The noisy world is YELLING at him.

           He grows more and more uncomfortable, until --

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Next.

           Ted walks up patient, polite, and particular. Postmaster Ruth 
           sits at her window as he holds out -- A LETTER.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Four cents.

           He hands it over with no discernible expression. Definition 
           of apathy.
                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        University in the Midwest. The way 
                        they route these campus addresses, 
                        you should really put a return 
                        address on this.

                        No thanks.

                                 POSTMASTER RUTH
                        Well okay then. Can’t make you do 
                        anything you don’t want.

                                 TED
                        I’d like it to be a surprise.

           Ruth STAMPS it and TOSSES it into an outbox. 

           Ted moves to the door, stopping. The rain is really coming 
           down. So, he reaches back and... 

           TED PULLS HIS HOOD UP OVER HIS HEAD.

           He takes a moment, foreshadowing A SKETCH the world will come 
           to remember him by, and then...

           Ted heads off through the rain. 

           And as he goes, the following burns onto the screen:

                Ted Kaczynski participated in the Harvard psychological study 
                 for approximately 200 hours, verbally abused and humiliated 
                                     week after week.

           Dr. Henry Murray retired in 1962. He is credited with the 
           creation of the Thematic Apperception Test, the most widely 
           used psychological profiling tool in the world today, as well as a 
           key contributor to the CIA research project MK-Ultra.

                In 1978, Ted Kaczynski sent his first mail bomb. He would go 
                on to kill three people and injure another twenty-three during 
                    his seventeen year reign of terror as the Unabomber.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
