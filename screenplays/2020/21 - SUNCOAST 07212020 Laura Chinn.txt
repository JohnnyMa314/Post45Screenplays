           CHYRON: JANUARY 2005

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA - NIGHT

           This town is mostly beaches and bridges. The time of year is 
           reflected in the bundled up LOCALS, even the seagulls look 
           cold. A few TOURISTS from somewhere actually cold, like 
           Michigan, wear shorts and head to the beach, but everyone 
           else is inside. 

           CHYRON: ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA

           EXT. DORIS’ HOUSE - SAME TIME

           This moldy house is jammed between other moldy houses that 
           are all equally small and unmemorable. The front lawn is in a 
           coma, not fully dead but definitely not alive. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           DORIS eats dinner in front of the TV. Dinner is grey food 
           that was frozen for years before it was microwaved. Doris is 
           seventeen, depressed, and hiding under matted curls. 

           ON TV: A Friends episode is coming to an end: Ross and Monica 
           link arms on the couch and reminisce about a dance routine 
           they did in high school. The ideal brother and sister duo. 
           After the credits roll, Doris changes the channel. 

           ON TV: 

                                 ANCHORWOMAN
                        ... in just a few short weeks, when 
                        President Bush will be sworn in for 
                        his second term--     

           GEORGE W. BUSH fills the screen as Doris changes the channel 
           and takes a bite of grey food. 

           ON TV: Images of FRIED CHICKEN slo-mo falling into a BUCKET.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Introducing KFC’s brand new build 
                        your own variety bucket--!

           Doris changes the channel again. And again. And again. Doris 
           hears a BEEP and turns away from the TV. REVEAL a YOUNG MAN 
           in a full-on hospital bed next to Doris. Doris gets up and 
           hits buttons on a MACHINE that is clearly monitoring this 
           young man’s life. Doris checks a tube in his arm and goes 
           back to her dinner and the TV.  
           ON TV: 

                                 REGINALD ROUNDTREE
                        ... ABC 10 o’clock news. I’m 
                        Reginald Roundtree. The debate 
                        continues over the life of Terri 
                        Schiavo who is right here in Tampa 
                        Bay surviving on a feeding tube, 
                        but for how long? 

           Images of a bed ridden TERRI SCHIAVO fill the screen.

                        Will Jeb Bush’s request to the 
                        Supreme Court effect the ongoing 
                        case? Lisa Chan is at Suncoast 
                        Hospice now. Lisa? 

           Outside a FLORIDA HOSPICE, an Asian reporter LISA CHAN holds 
           a microphone. Behind her, many EMOTIONAL PEOPLE hold signs 
           that say things like, “LET TERRI LIVE!” and “AUSCHWITZ , USA.” 

                                 LISA LING
                        That is the question on everyone’s 
                        mind, Reginald. I’m here with Paul 
                        Warren, who has become the 
                        unofficial spokesman for the 
                        protesters you see behind me.

           Lisa stands with a passionate PAUL WARREN. He holds a sign 
           that says “YOU MURDERERS ARE GOING TO HELL.” He is fifty and handsome 
           in a weathered way, too much Florida sun and American beer. 
           He has a raspy, slightly Southern lilt.  

                                 LISA LING (CONT'D)
                        Paul, what is the mood amongst the 
                        protesters knowing that the Supreme 
                        Court could remove Terri’s feeding 
                        tube yet again? 

                                 PAUL
                        Well, we’re talkin’ about a court 
                        of law murdering a young woman, so 
                        you tell me... I’d say the mood is 
                        pretty hopeful that we can-- 

           Paul lights a CIGARETTE. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        That they’ll do the right thing 
                        here, but we’re gonna be fightin’ 
                        everyday to-- to save her life, 
                        man.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        So-- yeah, I mean, we’re not goin’ 
                        anywhere. If that’s what you mean. 

           Doris seems slightly captivated by Paul. The front door 
           opens. KRISTINE enters wearing a stained HOPS BAR AND GRILL t-
           shirt. She is a genuine Florida forty-year-old which is like 
           a Los Angeles fifty-year-old. She carries a to-go box. Doris 
           does not look up from the TV. Kristine does not say hello. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Can you change the channel? I can’t 
                        stand looking at that poor woman. 

           Kristine motions to images of Terri Schiavo on life support 
           FLASHING on the screen. Kristine sits and pulls CHICKEN WINGS 
           out of her to-go box. Doris grabs a wing. They are mother and 
           daughter, but they seem like roommates. Kristine has very 
           little maternal instincts. Doris seems to not need them.  

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You know she was bulimic, right? 
                        That’s why she had the heart attack 
                        or whatever. Her family knows she 
                        cares about her looks, but they’re 
                        splashing her all over the news 
                        looking like that. I’d rather die.  

                                 DORIS
                        Noted.  

                                 KRISTINE
                        They’re forcing her to stay 
                        alive... 

           Kristine looks at the young man in the hospital bed next to 
           Doris.

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        I would never do that to him. How’s 
                        he doing? Did he eat?  

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, he ate a little. His thing 
                        beeped. I think it’s broken cause 
                        the morphine’s not low-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Did you give him his shot? 

           Doris nods distracted by the TV. 

           ON TV: 
                                 WEATHERMAN
                        ... which is rare this late in the 
                        season, but it looks like Tropical 
                        Storm Zeta keeps heading our way--

           Kristine takes the remote and turns it off. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I got you chicken fingers.

           She hands Doris another to-go box. Doris happily takes it.

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Did you do your list? Did you 
                        vacuum? 

           Kristine taps a LIST OF CHORES on the coffee table. Doris 
           nods and tries to take the remote back. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        It doesn’t look like it. This place 
                        is a mess, Doris. 

                                 DORIS
                        Cause it’s a shithole. A vacuum 
                        can’t magically make it a nice 
                        house. 

           Kristine has a nasty temper and seems like she could flip out 
           on her daughter at any second, but she shrugs it off. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        It is a fuckin’ dump isn’t it? 

           They share a small laugh. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for taking care of him.
                             (sniffing the air)
                        It smells like pee...?

                                 DORIS
                        He um-- I was changing him and he 
                        peed. I tried to clean it up...

           Kristine pats her son’s thigh. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I’ll need your help with him in the 
                        morning. 

                                 DORIS
                        What? I can’t-- I’ll miss the van. 
                                 KRISTINE
                        It’s a big day, Doris. You don’t 
                        have to go to school-- 

                                 DORIS
                        But I want to go-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        So you’ll go late. I’ll write you a 
                        note. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, please, Mom. I hate going late. 
                        I have to interrupt class and 
                        everyone looks at me. It’s so 
                        embarrassing-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Embarrassing? Oh, then I’ll just 
                        drop your brother off by myself 
                        cause God forbid you get 
                        embarrassed--

                                 DORIS
                        Okay, I’ll come. Forget it. 

           Kristine’s temper rises.

                                 KRISTINE
                        You sure? Cause I wouldn’t want you 
                        to blush in front of your friends. 

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t have any friends! And fine! 
                        I said forget it! 

                                 KRISTINE
                        You’re so selfish. I can’t believe 
                        you! 

           These two are on their feet now. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        I ask for one little thing and it 
                        becomes a whole--!

                                 DORIS
                        Did you not hear me say I’ll do 
                        it?! I’LL DO IT!

                                 KRISTINE
                        Never mind! I don’t even want you 
                        to come! I don’t need you! I’LL DO 
                        IT MYSELF! 
           Kristine heads to her bedroom and SLAMS the door.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. DORIS’ HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Doris helps her mom lift her brother into the front seat of a 
           1990 FORD PICK UP TRUCK. The young man’s eyes are open, but 
           he seems completely unaware of the world around him.

           Doris wears her school uniform, khaki pants and a white polo 
           shirt. As they lift her brother, a SMALL WHITE VAN, with “ST. 
           PETE CHRISTIAN” on the side, pulls up.  

                                 KRISTINE
                             (yelling to VAN DRIVER)
                        I’m driving her today! 
                             (beat)
                        You can go! I’m gonna take her 
                        later!
                             (beat, to Doris)
                        Is he fuckin’ deaf?

                                 DORIS
                        Mom, stop yelling. He obviously 
                        can’t hear you. 
                             (re: her brother)
                        Can you lift his legs higher? I 
                        can’t get him in. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I am lifting them. It’s his butt-- 
                        Get his butt higher. 

           The van idles. All the TEENS watch as Doris struggles to get 
           her vegetative brother into the truck. Kristine SCREAMS, 
           directing all her emotions at this faceless van driver. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?! She’s not going with you! 
                        I’m taking her later! What the fuck 
                        is wrong with you?! DRIVE AWAY! 

                                 DORIS
                        Mom, please-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        God dammit, Doris! Lift his butt! 

           The van finally drives away. Teen faces press against the 
           glass, watching Doris. She is humiliated, as always. They 
           finally get the young man into the front seat. They lift his 
           wheelchair into the truck bed. 
                                 DORIS
                        Can I drive? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        What? No, honey. We don’t have 
                        time. 

                                 DORIS
                        Come on, you never let me practice-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        So help me God, Doris. Get in the 
                        truck. 

           Doris groans and goes to slide into the middle seat, but 
           Kristine stops her. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Uh uh, the latch is broken you 
                        gotta make sure his chair doesn’t 
                        fall out.

                                 DORIS
                        What? My hair is gonna go nuts-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Your hair? 

           Kristine narrows her eyes. Doris climbs into the truck bed 
           with the wheelchair and Kristine backs down the driveway. 

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - LATER

           Doris gets whipped by the wind as the truck moves through the 
           swampy streets. Her curls are massive from the humidity. 

           A WHITE JEEP WRANGLER pulls up next to Doris. A tan blonde 
           TEEN GIRL drives. Doris watches her. If we could hear Doris’ 
           thoughts she would be wondering if this teen driver has ever 
           changed a twenty-year-old’s diaper. Probably not. The teen 
           driver looks carefree as she sings along to Gwen Stefani’s 
           Hollaback Girl. 

                                 TEEN GIRL
                        Let me hear you say, this shit is 
                        bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S! 

           She speeds away. Kristine drives over a POTHOLE and Doris 
           lurches forward in the truck bed.   
           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - LATER

           Kristine’s pick-up truck pulls into a MEDIA CIRCUS. A hundred 
           PROTESTERS hold SIGNS that represent their outrage about 
           Terri Schiavo. 

           From the truck bed, Doris sees Paul Warren, the emotional man 
           from the news. He wears an OLD HAWAIIAN SHIRT and carries a 
           NEW SIGN that says: “HER PARENTS LOVE HER AS SHE IS” Doris and Paul 
           lock eyes. Doris looks down shyly. He’s basically a 
           celebrity. 

           Kristine HONKS at some protesters forcing them to move out of 
           the way. Doris winces. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - MOMENTS LATER

           This place looks like a hospital gave up and became a nursing 
           home. Kristine and Doris wheel her brother through an 
           AUTOMATIC DOOR. Doris clocks OLD DYING PEOPLE everywhere. A 
           friendly nurse, IRIE, steps out from the nurse’s station. 

                                 NURSE IRIE 
                        Hi there! Welcome to Suncoast. I’m 
                        Irie.  

           She shakes Kristine’s hand. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Yeah, hi. Kristine. 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Hope you don’t mind he just has to 
                        check your bags...

           Nurse Irie motions to a tired SECURITY GUARD. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        For what? 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Weapons actually. We get a lot of 
                        threats since Ms. Schiavo got here. 
                        You understand...

                                 KRISTINE
                        So while I’m dropping my son off to 
                        die you think I’m gonna kill 
                        someone? Or maybe I’ll sneak in and 
                        feed Schiavo--? 
                                 DORIS
                        Mom--

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        It’s okay. Today is a hard day. I 
                        understand. 

           Nurse Irie waves the security guard away. 

                                 NURSE IRIE (CONT'D)
                        What’s your name, dear? 

                                 DORIS
                        Doris. 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Oh... what a pretty name. 

                                 DORIS
                        It was my Grandma’s name. 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Oh how nice. 

                                 DORIS
                        She died the day I was born. 

           Nurse Irie tries to keep smiling, taking in this sad crew.

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris’ brother is now in a bed. His machines are hooked up. 
           Doris sits on a chair reading a PEOPLE MAGAZINE. Kristine 
           scrubs the floor with a PAPER TOWEL. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Look at this.

           Kristine holds up the paper towel. It is covered in dust. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        This place is disgusting. 

                                 DORIS
                        Can we go soon? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        You’re not at all upset about 
                        leaving your brother? I mean, this 
                        is it, Doris. This filthy room is 
                        where he’s gonna die.  
                                 DORIS
                        Of course I’m upset.

                                 KRISTINE
                        Yeah, you seem real torn up. Do you 
                        ever think about anyone but 
                        yourself? 

           Doris goes back to her magazine. 

                                 DORIS
                        Bennifer just broke up, right now 
                        I’m thinking about them. 

           Kristine puts the paper towel down and sits close to Doris. 
           She looks over Doris’ shoulder at an image of BEN AFFLECK and 
           JENNIFER LOPEZ wearing dramatic expressions.   

                                 KRISTINE
                        I knew they would. What did I say? 

                                                        KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                           DORIS
           He’s too handsome.
                                              He’s too handsome.

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        The handsome ones never stay. 

           Kristine looks at Doris’ brother, lovingly. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Like your brother. Too handsome for 
                        this world.

                                 DORIS
                        Can we go now please? 

           Kristine glares at Doris. 

           INT. ST. PETE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - LATER

           As Doris enters, the WHOLE CLASS looks up. Doris blushes and 
           hands MR. LADD a note. 

                                 MR. LADD
                        Ah, welcome back, Doris. 

           He motions for her to sit. Doris sits behind a popular black 
           girl LACI and a popular white girl BRITTANY. They do not 
           acknowledge her presence. They whisper as Mr. Ladd lectures 
           in the background.  
                                 LACI
                        ... So basically Cody is like fully 
                        hooking up with Tiffany. And I’m 
                        like - good, she can keep his dirty 
                        dick.   

           An incredibly cute black surfer type, NATE laughs at this.  

                                 NATE
                        He is not hooking up with her. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Bullshit. Tiffany basically told me 
                        herself. 

                                 NATE
                        Well, she’s lying. 

           Doris watches this group like a TV show.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Ya’ll should come over later. We’re 
                        gonna grill by the pool. Cody will 
                        be there you can ask him yourself. 

           Doris listens longingly. The thought of grilling with friends 
           is like a faraway dream. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh you best believe my ass will be 
                        there. I’m done with these rumors.  

                                 BRITTANY
                             (whisper singing)
                        I'm tired of rumors starting
                        I'm sick of being followed
                        I'm tired of people lying--

                                 LACI
                             (whisper singing)
                        Saying what they want about me.

           The girls CRACK UP at their Lindsay Lohan impressions. Doris 
           LAUGHS too in spite of herself. Brittany and Laci turn and 
           look at her for a beat. Doris quickly looks toward Mr. Ladd. 

                                 MR. LADD
                        Being naked in public... is that an 
                        ethics question? 

           HUMPHREY raises his hand. 

                                 MR. LADD (CONT'D)
                        Yes, Humphrey. 
           Humphrey is chubby, has sleep apnea, and is always congested.

                                 HUMPHREY
                        That depends on the laws of the 
                        land. 

                                 MR. LADD 
                        Exactly. Banning nudity is a rule 
                        of a particular society. Our 
                        society. Especially this classroom. 

           The class laughs. They clearly like Mr. Ladd.  

                                 MR. LADD (CONT'D)
                        But, what about Christian ethics? 
                        How do they differ from the laws of 
                        the land? That is what we’re 
                        exploring this semester. So I hope 
                        you got everything out of your 
                        systems over the holiday cause now 
                        I’m going to teach you to be good 
                        Christian people. 

           The class laughs. The bell BEEPS. Students get up. Nate 
           brushes past Doris and she looks like she could faint. 

                                 NATE
                        Excuse me. 

                                 DORIS
                             (flustered)
                        Yeah, okay. 

           He walks away as Doris stares at the back of his neck. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - DAYS LATER

           Doris works on a homework assignment. Kristine stands on a 
           CHAIR with her head near the ceiling, listening. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Do you hear it? It’s like 
                        eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
                             (re: her son)
                        It must be driving him insane. 

                                 DORIS
                        I doubt he hears it. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I told that nightmare at the front 
                        desk, but they haven’t done 
                        anything. 
                                 DORIS
                        Irie? I like her. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Well, you’re wrong, everyone here 
                        is terrible. They just stuffed him 
                        in this disgusting room with this 
                        insane noise-- 

           Kristine removes a piece of ceiling tile. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Prop me up. I wanna poke my head 
                        in. See what’s going on...

                                 DORIS
                        Mom--

                                 KRISTINE
                        God dammit, Doris! Just do it! 

           Doris gets up and struggles to lift her mom up by the legs.

                                 DORIS
                        Can we please just let them handle 
                        it?! 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Stop wiggling me! 

           DUST and ASBESTOS falls onto Doris. She coughs. The door 
           opens. Nurse Irie enters and sees Doris lifting her mother by 
           her legs into the ceiling. 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Everything okay in here? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        No, it’s not okay! Put me down, 
                        Doris! 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m trying--

                                 KRISTINE
                        PUT ME DOWN!

           Doris finally does and wipes dust off her face. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        My son is a prisoner here and he’s 
                        being tortured by that noise! 
                                 DORIS
                        There’s barely a noise--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Eeeeeeeeeeeee! You don’t hear that? 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m sure she has more important 
                        things to do than--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Your brother is dying. What’s more 
                        important? 

                                 DORIS
                        Whatever. I’m going to McDonald’s.
                             (to Nurse Irie)
                        Sorry about her. She’s a lunatic. 

           Doris huffs out. Behind Doris’ back, Kristine FLIPS DORIS OFF 
           with both hands.  

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris weaves through the crowd of protesters towards her 
           mom’s pick-up truck. 

           INT. FORD PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Doris scrounges around the floor and seats for LOOSE CHANGE. 

           INT. MCDONALD’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris stands at a counter across from a MCDONALD’S EMPLOYEE. 

                                 MCDONALDS EMPLOYEE
                        ... a cheeseburger, small fries and 
                        a chocolate shake. That’s five-
                        sixty-eight. 

           Doris counts out her change and TWO CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILLS. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh... um. Forget the shake. 

           McDonald’s Employee goes to type in the register. 

                                 PAUL (O.S)
                        Nah nah, keep the shake. I got it. 

           Doris looks up at Paul the protester from TV. 
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Just add a filet-o-fish for me. 

           He hands McDonald’s employee CASH and slides Doris’ money 
           back to her. Doris is flustered around this pseudo-celebrity.  

                                 DORIS
                        ... thank you. That’s so nice of 
                        you. But--

                                 PAUL
                        No, buts. Take the food. You’re 
                        skinny as a rail. Bet you can’t 
                        even see your shadow.  

                                 DORIS
                        ...okay, thank you again. 

           Doris takes her TRAY of suspiciously fast food and heads to a 
           table. Paul follows. 

                                 PAUL
                        Mind if I join you? 

                                 DORIS
                        Um... yeah-- I mean, no I don’t 
                        mind-- You can sit here if you 
                        want. 

                                 PAUL
                        I saw you go in that, uh, execution 
                        chamber a few days ago. 

                                 DORIS
                        Suncoast? Yeah, my brother is 
                        living there-- dying there? I don’t 
                        know.  

                                 PAUL
                        Damn. I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll 
                        pray for his recovery. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, please don’t! 
                             (catches herself)
                        --I just mean. He has brain cancer. 
                        He’s blind and can’t walk and 
                        hasn’t talked in years. He still 
                        eats, but that’s about it. If he 
                        stayed alive much longer... I don’t 
                        think he’d be happy. 

                                 PAUL
                        Every life is precious. 
           Doris looks flustered by her own outburst. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, never mind. Pray if you want 
                        to. Sorry, I haven’t like, talked 
                        to another person in a long time.
                             (off his curious look)
                        I’ve just been taking care of my 
                        brother and haven’t had time to 
                        like, talk to anyone... 

                                 PAUL
                        I hear ya. And maybe you shouldn’t 
                        start now. You’re pretty bad at it.   

           Paul WINKS at her and Doris LAUGHS. Paul unwraps his filet-o-
           fish. Doris makes a face. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Not a fan? 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, sorry. Just the smell of 
                        seafood grosses me out. 

                                 PAUL
                        What? Nah, you just haven’t had the 
                        right seafood yet. 

                                 DORIS
                        Maybe not. 

                                 PAUL
                        Definitely not. You been to Cocoa 
                        Beach? 

                                 DORIS
                        No. 

                                 PAUL
                        Oooweee, you would like Cocoa 
                        Beach. Go to Sam’s Fish Shack. Best 
                        fish tacos in the world. Grouper. 
                        You’d love em’.

                                 DORIS
                        No offense, but I doubt it. 

                                 PAUL
                        My wife was obsessed with em’... 

           Paul smiles for the first time since we met him. He rubs his 
           graying stubble. 
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        She passed away. 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 PAUL
                        Me too. 

                                 DORIS
                        My dad died. He drowned when I was 
                        three. 

                                 PAUL
                        Well, Christ, it ain’t a 
                        competition. 

           Doris laughs. Then they sit in silence. Then Paul reaches out 
           to shake her hand. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Paul. 

                                 DORIS
                        Doris. 

                                 PAUL
                        Doris? That’s an old lady name. 

                                 DORIS
                        It was my Grandma’s name. She died 
                        the day I was born.
                             (laughs)
                        Basically everyone in my family is 
                        dead. Except my mom, but I 
                        sometimes wish she was.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t say that. 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m kidding.

                                 PAUL
                        Every life is precious. 

           Doris laughs. She laughs like a child. Paul can’t help but 
           smile. 

                                 DORIS
                        No one has ever called my mom 
                        precious--

           Kristine blows through the glass doors. 
                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Oop, here she comes. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Hey, let’s go. We’re leaving. 

                                 DORIS
                        Mom, this is Paul. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Yeah, hi-- I’m gonna be late for 
                        work, Doris. 

           Kristine heads for the door as Doris gathers her stuff. 

                                 DORIS
                        See? Isn’t she precious? Nice 
                        meeting you. 

           Doris hustles after her mom. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Can I drive? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        No, I just said I’m late--

           The door to the McDonald’s closes, sparing Paul the rest of 
           their argument. 

           EXT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LATER

           Doris wears old paint stained clothes. She is covered in 
           sweat as she finishes NAILING a board to the last uncovered 
           WINDOW. She stands back and takes in the boarded up windows. 
           She notices the wind picking up and heads inside. 

           INT. DORIS' LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Doris drinks BLUE KOOL AID in front of the TV. An old FAN 
           blows in her direction. 

           ON TV:

                                 ANCHORMAN 
                        ... while Hurricane Zeta continues 
                        through The Keys up the Gulf of 
                        Mexico.  

           Images of wind and rain tormenting a TOWN fill the screen. 
                                 ANCHORMAN (CONT'D)
                        ... Fill up those gas tanks and 
                        charge those generators, folks. 
                        This could be a long weekend. Let’s 
                        hope this weather clears up in time 
                        for the Super Bowl, as Jacksonville 
                        prepares for the crowds and Paul 
                        McCartney... 

           Doris looks at her brother’s empty hospital bed. Then back to 
           the TV. The front door opens. Kristine enters in her stained 
           HOPS BAR AND GRILL uniform. She carries a to-go box. Doris 
           doesn’t look up from the TV. Kristine does not say hello.

           Kristine sits next to her and eats MOZZARELLA STICKS out of 
           her to-go box. Doris takes a stick. 

                                 KRISTINE
                             (re: hurricane)
                        This Zeta could be a real bitch. 
                        I’m gonna start sleeping at 
                        Suncoast until your brother... 
                        goes. So he doesn’t get lonely. 

                                 DORIS
                        But... then I’ll be alone. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Well, someone’s gotta watch the 
                        house.

                                 DORIS
                        What if the storm gets really bad? 
                        What if there’s a black out? We 
                        don’t have a generator--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Jesus, Doris. Instead of feeling 
                        sorry for yourself, think about 
                        your brother, in hell, trapped 
                        inside his own body. He can’t move! 
                        He can’t see! God forbid you have 
                        to use a flashlight for one night! 

                                 DORIS
                        Okay, fine-- 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I’m gonna be sleeping on a God damn 
                        cot for weeks! 

                                 DORIS
                        I said fine! 
           Kristine calms down. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        I got you some chicken fingers. 

           She hands Doris another to-go box. Doris happily takes it. 
           The fight is over. They go back to watching the news.  

           INT. SCHOOL VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Doris sits by herself, as always. She looks out the window at 
           PEOPLE boarding up their windows. The van passes a long line 
           of CARS outside a GAS STATION. GROCERY STORE parking lots are 
           jammed. PEOPLE push CARTS FULL OF WATER AND CANNED GOODS. 

           Doris overhears GIRLS behind her. They are wannabe versions 
           of Brittany and Laci. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        ... Brittany said everyone’s going 
                        to Kyle’s hurricane party. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Laci told me! I really wanna roll 
                        tonight.  

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        And play in the rain! So amazing-- 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Yessss, where can we get ecstasy--? 

           They notice Doris is listening and lower their voices. 

           INT. ST. PETE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - LATER

           The word “ABORTION” is written on the whiteboard. Mr. Ladd 
           lectures.     

                                 MR. LADD
                        ... because it is legal in all 
                        fifty states, is it ethical? 
                        Because it is accepted by society, 
                        is it ethical? Do we blindly accept 
                        the ethics of our government as our 
                        own? 

           Humphrey raises his hand. 
                                 HUMPHREY
                        Abortion is wrong cause the bible 
                        says it is. 

                                 MR. LADD
                        That’s actually not true, Humphrey. 
                        There is no explicit prohibition of 
                        abortion in either the Old or New 
                         Testament. 

                                   HUMPHREY
                         So does that mean it’s not wrong? 

                                 MR. LADD
                        That’s up to you. There is no right 
                        or wrong answer. There is no pass 
                        or fail letter grade when it comes 
                        to human ethics. It is a deeply 
                        personal subject. 

                                 HUMPHREY
                        Well, I think it’s wrong. 

                                 LACI
                        Well, I think you’re an idiot. 

           The class laughs. 

                                 MR. LADD 
                        Oh, good. A debate! Why don’t you 
                        both come in on Monday with your 
                        prepared arguments. 

           Laci groans. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        You should’a kept your mouth shut. 

                                 LACI
                        I will not apologize for being an 
                        outspoken feminist. 

           Doris smiles at this. Nate whispers to Brittany and Laci. 

                                 NATE
                        Did you hear? Kyle’s dad found out 
                        about the hurricane party. He’s 
                        grounded. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        What? That friggin’ sucks. 

                                 LACI
                        Where are we gonna go? 
           Doris’s face lights up. She looks like she’s about to say 
           something, but she stops herself. 

                                 NATE
                        I don’t know. We could go see a 
                        movie? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yeah, right after I kill myself. 

           Doris takes a breath again, about to speak, then: nothing. 

                                 LACI
                        We could go under the Causeway? Mac 
                        might be getting a keg? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        The waves are gonna be so big. 
                        They’re gonna bail. I guarantee.  

           Doris takes another breath and then:  

                                 DORIS
                        You can come to my house. 

           Phew, she did it. They turn and look at her like a dog that 
           just spoke. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I mean, my mom’s not gonna be there 
                        and you can do whatever you want, 
                        but if not it’s cool. I just 
                        thought if you needed a place to 
                        party, you could totally come over 
                        or whatever you want... It’s chill. 

           Nate smiles. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, that’s super chill. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        There’s no adults? 

                                 LACI
                        Can we roll?

                                 DORIS
                        Roll? Um... Sure whatever you want. 

                                 NATE
                        Do you have a black light? 
                                 DORIS
                        I don’t think so...

                                 LACI
                        Wait, this is so dope. I’m gonna 
                        tell everyone. Wait, who are you?  

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, what’s your name? 

                                 DORIS
                        Doris. 

                                 NATE
                        Cool. Nate. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, cool. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Brittany. 

                                 LACI
                        Laci. 

                                 DORIS
                        Cool. Doris. Cool. 

           Doris lights up. She can’t believe this is happening. The 
           2005 hit Beverly Hills by Weezer takes us to: 

           A SUPER UPBEAT CLEANING MONTAGE: 

           INT. DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           - Doris cleans with passion. 

           - She shoves her brothers’ hospital bed into a closet. 

           - She scrubs stains off the walls. 

           - She shakes dust out of couch cushions. 

           - She throws away bottles of medication and bags of fluids. 

           - She puts scented candles everywhere.

           - She scrubs stains out of the carpet. 

           - She sprays Febreeze. 

           - She takes a brand new BLACK LIGHTBULB out of it’s package 
           and screws it into a lamp. 
                                 WEEZER
                        The truth is, I don’t stand a 
                        chance. It’s something that you’re 
                        born into. And I just don’t 
                        belong... 

           The music fades as Doris opens her front door. RAIN POURS 
           outside. Nate, Laci, Brittany, Wannabe Brittany, Wannabe Laci 
           and other TEENS, all carrying cases of BEER, hurry inside, 
           wet from the rain.  

           They sweep past Doris and check out the house, clearly 
           uncomfortable with it’s shittyness.  

                                 LACI
                        Awww, it’s cute. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Your house is super cute. 

                                 NATE
                        It sorta smells like piss in here. 

                                 DORIS
                        That’s probably from my... cat. Who 
                        is... running around here 
                        somewhere. Lucy! Come here, Lucy! 

           Doris goes off in search of a cat that doesn’t exist. Laci 
           and Brittany put WET WASHCLOTHS in the freezer.  

           A teen turns on a boombox. A 2004 Techno Remix of Everybody 
           Is Free blares. 

           QUICK CUTS of teens partying:

           - The teens crack open their beers. The girls all sexily put 
           PILLS on their tongues. Doris turns on the lamp with the 
           black lightbulb. Nate smiles. 

           - More TEENS enter from the rain. Teens crack open GLOW 
           STICKS. The girls dance ethereally with the glow sticks. They 
           put MINI GLOW STICKS in their mouthes.  

           - Doris watches this alien world, an outsider, an observer. 

           - Doris wipes some spilled beer off the floor. Nate takes out 
           a BAG OF PILLS. 

                                 NATE
                        You want one? 

           Doris awkwardly nods “no.” He shrugs and takes the pill. 
                                 DORIS
                        So... you have a pool? 

                                 NATE
                        Huh? 

                                 DORIS
                        No, just-- in class I heard you say 
                        you have a pool. 

                                 NATE
                        Oh, yeah. I do. 

           More silence. 

                                 DORIS
                        So, what do your parents do? 

                                 NATE
                        What you do mean?  

                                 DORIS
                        Never mind... 

                                 NATE
                        My mom has a parrot. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh really? 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, it talks. She taught it to 
                        say, 
                             (parrot impression)
                        “I love you, Nate.” 
                             (normal voice)
                        At first it was weird, but... now I 
                        sorta like, look forward to it. 

                                 DORIS
                        That’s... really sweet. 

                                 NATE
                             (beat)
                        Did you ever find your cat? 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, um, she’s around here somewhere...

           Doris looks around for an imaginary cat once again. 

           - Kids try to “blow each other up” by moving glow sticks in 
           front of each other’s faces. 
           - Teens run outside the front door and dance around in the 
           heavy rain. Doris watches, in awe of their lack of 
           inhibitions. 

           - Brittany and Laci take the frozen washcloths out of the 
           freezer and rub them on each other’s faces. Doris walks by 
           and Brittany grabs her hand.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Doris, your house is amaaaaazing. 
                        It’s so like... real! You know, 
                        like, this old couch is real life. 
                        Sit with me. 

           Doris does. Brittany takes in the living room.  

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        How is this place so small?! It’s 
                        like a dollhouse! IT’S INCREDIBLE!

           Brittany and Laci are blowing the fuck up. Laci touches 
           Doris’ face.  

                                 LACI
                        You’re so beautiful. You’re like 
                        beyond natural and your nose is so 
                        real. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Beyond real. You’re like this... 
                        lion. With your wild hair--  

                                 LACI
                        Oh my god, she’s a lion! 

           Laci ROARS. Brittany joins in, half chant and half roar. 

                                 LACI (CONT'D)
                        Roar with us! 

           Doris tries, she is barely audible, the girls don’t notice. 

           - Wannabe Laci blows a VICKS NASAL INHALER into Nate’s face 
           while Wannabe Brittany rubs his temples. Doris watches, 
           jealous. 

           - Doris picks up a CAN OF BEER and opens it. She sips it, 
           subtly winces at the new taste but keeps sipping. 

           - LIGHTNING thrashes the front yard. All the teens run back 
           inside laughing. All the LIGHTS GO OUT. The teens cheer! 
           Doris’ scented candles light the room.  
           - The lack of electricity has silenced the boom box, but the 
           dancing and festivities continue in an unselfconscious blur  
           that could not exist without drugs. Doris watches, 
           embarrassed by and envious of this display of pure freedom. 
           She bends her knees awkwardly and bobs up and down a few 
           times, nope, too self concious, she sits down on the couch.   

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - EARLY NEXT MORNING

           All the kids are gone. Doris has cleaned up all the 
           paraphernalia. She pulls the hospital bed back out of the 
           closet. She drags it towards its old spot. The front door 
           opens. Doris freezes. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        What are you doing with that? 

                                 DORIS
                             (covering)
                        I was just, uh, putting it in the 
                        closet. We don’t need it anymore, 
                        right? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Yeah, I guess not. 

           Doris pivots and drags it back toward the closet. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        How was the storm? 

                                 DORIS
                        Not bad. Sorta fun actually. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Fun? How was it fun? 

                                 DORIS
                        No-- I just lit some candles and 
                        candles are fun? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Well, glad you were having fun 
                        while I was sleeping on a cot. It 
                        destroyed my back.  

           Kristine heads to her bedroom. Doris mumbles.  

                                 DORIS
                        Well, soon he’ll be dead and you 
                        won’t have to sleep on a cot-- 
                                 KRISTINE
                        What’d you say? 

                                 DORIS
                        Nothing. 

           Kristine shuts her bedroom door. 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - LATER

           Kristine’s Ford truck pulls up. The amount of PROTESTERS has 
           doubled. Paul yells into a bullhorn holding a giant PAPIER-
           MÂCHÉ SPOON with “KEEP FEEDING TERRI OR I’LL SHOVE THIS UP YOUR ASS” written 
           on it. A MAN next to him is dressed up like Jesus and 
           crucified on a WOODEN CROSS. 

           INT. FORD PICK-UP TRUCK - SAME TIME

           Kristine wears her waitress uniform. Doris pouts. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        ... it won’t kill you to spend a 
                        few hours with your brother, Doris.

                                 DORIS
                        But I’ve spent ten years with him--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Get out of the car. Or I will throw 
                        you out and back over you. 

           A policeman OFFICER CHAUNCEY stands near the parking lot 
           entrance. He nervously approaches the truck window. He’s 
           young and seems like it’s his first day on the force.   

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        Sorry, ma’am. We need to check the 
                        back of your truck. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        For what? 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        Frankly, we received a bomb threat 
                        yesterday and we’re taking it very 
                        seriously. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Everyone in there is about to die 
                        anyway. Who would waste a bomb on 
                        that place? 
           Officer Chauncey stares at her, unsure. Doris leans over 
           Kristine. 

                                 DORIS
                        Sorry, officer. Please do whatever 
                        you need to do. 

           Officer Chauncey heads to the back and lifts up the tarp. He 
           heads back over to their window. 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        What is that, uh, device in the 
                        back there, ma’am? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Well, officer, that is a 
                        defibrillator. In case my son goes 
                        into cardiac arrest from his 
                        chemotherapy. Is that illegal? 
                             (to Doris)
                        Get out of the car.
                             (to Officer Chauncey)
                        I’m not staying here anyway. I have 
                        to go to work. At the bomb factory 
                        where I make bombs! 

           Doris gets out of the car and Kristine backs out angrily. 
           Kristine HONKS at some protesters in her way. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                             (yelling at protesters)
                        Let it go! Schiavo’s already dead! 

           Officer Chauncey watches Kristine speed away. 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        I’m just doing my job. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, I get it. Good luck with 
                        that.  

           Doris sees Paul smoking a CIGARETTE under a tree. She 
           approaches. She pauses, thinking of something to say, then:  

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Can I have one? 

                                 PAUL
                        How old are you? 

                                 DORIS
                        Fine, I’ll just go buy some. 
                                 PAUL
                        You’re so fulla’ shit, your eyes 
                        are turnin’ brown. 

           Paul hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. She inhales 
           and coughs, pretending like this isn’t her first cigarette.  

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You go to St. Pete Christian? 

                                 DORIS
                        How’d you know that? 

                                 PAUL 
                        It’s on your shirt. 

           Doris looks at her polo shirt with her school’s logo on it 
           and smiles, oh yeah, duh. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        That’s a good school. Private. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, but my mom thinks religion is 
                        bullshit-- no offense. 

           She gestures to the CROSS on his NECKLACE. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        She just didn’t want me going to 
                        the public school after some girl 
                        got stabbed. So she has to work all 
                        the time to pay my tuition.   

                                 PAUL
                        She’s a good mom.  

                                 DORIS 
                        Um, no, not to me.  

                                 PAUL
                        I mean, she seems like hell on 
                        wheels. But all good moms have to 
                        raise hell sometimes... 

           Paul looks at the protesters holding “Terri Schiavo” signs. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Ya know, Terri went to Catholic 
                        school?

                                 DORIS
                        How do you know? 
                                 PAUL
                        I just do. 

                                 DORIS
                        Did you know her? 

                                 PAUL
                        ... No, not personally.  

                                 DORIS
                        What do you mean? 

                                 PAUL
                             (defensive)
                        No, I don’t know her. But when I 
                        found out her sociopath husband was 
                        trying to murder her I had to come 
                        here and do somethin’. 

                                 DORIS
                        Murder her? But they say she’s 
                        basically already dead.

                                 PAUL
                        She’s as alive as you are. What if 
                        it was you in there instead of her? 

                                 DORIS
                        Well... they say she was bulimic 
                        and I’m not so I wouldn’t end up 
                        like that. 

                                 PAUL
                        That’s what we tell ourselves 
                        whenever somethin’ bad happens. We 
                        try to make the victim responsible 
                        for their own demise so we can 
                        sleep all snuggly in our jammies 
                        knowing it’ll never happen to us... 

           Doris smokes and coughs and thinks about those words. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Bottom line is, her husband didn’t 
                        want to take care of her anymore. 

                                 DORIS
                        Honestly... I get that. It’s really 
                        hard taking care of sick people and 
                        sometimes... you need a break.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you enjoyin’ your break? 
                                 DORIS
                        I mean, this is gonna sound 
                        horrible but yeah, it’s, uh, kinda 
                        nice not having to take care of 
                        him. I just had friends-- or people 
                        or whatever over, for the first 
                        time. I felt like... a teenager.

                                 PAUL
                        Once your brother’s gone, he’s 
                        gone. He ain’t never comin’ back. 
                        You’ll miss takin’ care of him. 

                                 DORIS
                        I doubt it. I mean, I’ll miss him, 
                        sure. But I will not miss taking 
                        care of him.

                                 PAUL
                        You will. You’ll miss everything. 
                        All the good. All the bad. Hell, 
                        especially the bad. I’d give 
                        anything to hear my wife bitch n’ 
                        moan again. Or just to talk to her. 
                        Just once. One sentence. One word. 

                                 DORIS
                        Well, I haven’t talked to my 
                        brother in years. He’s not really 
                        aware. 

                                 PAUL
                        You should talk to him before it’s 
                        too late. Cause when they go, 
                        suddenly you got all this important 
                        shit to say to em’, even not 
                        important shit. You just wanna tell 
                        em’ stuff. Anything.  

                                 DORIS
                        Well, yeah, like I said, he can’t 
                        hear me so... it’s pretty much 
                        already too late-- 

           ANGRY PROTESTER heads over with a head of steam. 

                                 ANGRY PROTESTER
                        Paul! They’re trying to say we 
                        can’t sit on the sidewalk!

                                 PAUL
                        It’s public! 
                                 ANGRY PROTESTER
                        That’s what I told em’! 

                                 PAUL
                        Dammit, fine, just do what they 
                        say. 
                             (to Doris)
                        Come on. I want you to meet some 
                        folks. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, that’s okay, I have to go sit 
                        with my brother or my mom will kill 
                        me. 

                                 PAUL
                        These people could be good for you, 
                        Doris. They’re God’s people. 

                                 DORIS
                        Aren’t we all God’s people? Isn’t 
                        that the whole thing? 

                                 PAUL 
                        Just come on. 

           Doris gets up and follows Paul. He leads her over to the 
           protesters. Everyone holds SIGNS or LARGE WHITE SPOONS. 
           Standing amongst them is overwhelming. 

           Paul brings her to several WOMEN who sit on a curb with RED 
           TAPE on their mouthes. Written on the tape is one word: LIFE. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Wendy, this is my friend Doris. 

           WENDY pulls the red tape off her mouth and smiles at Doris. 

                                 WENDY
                        Hi, there! 

           Doris shakes Wendy’s hand. Another woman, SARAH, pulls “LIFE” 
           tape off her mouth. 

                                 SARAH
                        Hi, I’m Sarah. 

           Doris shakes her hand. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        I saw you go in there. 
                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah my brother’s in there. He 
                        only has a couple months left... 

           Sarah looks like she might cry. She forces Doris to hug her. 

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

           Sarah reaches into her bag and gets a BOTTLE OF WATER. 

                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        They wanna cut off Terri’s food. 
                        They wanna starve her. Can you, at 
                        least, bring her this water? 

           Doris doesn’t take the bottle of water. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, um... no. No thank you. 

                                 PAUL
                        Sarah, you’re scaring her. Come on. 

           Paul keeps walking, Doris follows. Doris notices a WOMAN 
           playing dead on the ground with fake blood all over her 
           shirt, next to a sign that says: “SAVE TERRI FROM MURDER.”

           They pass a VAN with an image of a BLOODY FETUS RIPPED INTO  
           PIECES and “A CHILD IS NOT A CHOICE” printed beneath it. 

                                 DORIS
                        Why is abortion part of all this? 

                                 PAUL
                        A life is a life. 

           GUS leans against the van and nods “hello” to Paul.  

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Gus, meet Doris. She’s got a loved 
                        one in Suncoast.  

                                 GUS
                        I’m sorry to hear that, little 
                        lady. Hope he recovers soon. We’ll 
                        be praying for him. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, please don’t, he-- nevermind. 
                        Nice meeting you. I, uh, I gotta 
                        go. Bye, Paul. Thanks for the... 
                        tour. 
           A flustered Doris heads inside. Paul looks disappointed, as 
           if he just lost a convert. Doris puts her arms up, by rote, 
           as SECURITY scans her with a METAL DETECTING WAND at the 
           entrance. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris sits and does homework. Her brother’s machines BEEP. 
           Doris goes over and makes some adjustments. For the first 
           time, we are CLOSE UP on his face. He is, in fact, too 
           handsome for this world. Doris takes him in.  

                                 DORIS
                        Hi...

           Off his unresponsive face. Doris goes back to her homework 
           for a beat, then she turns back to her brother.

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I, uh, know you can’t hear me... 
                        but I guess it’s good for me to... 
                        talk to you or whatever. 

           She looks around, embarrassed. Then back to her brother. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I, just...
                             (beat, to herself)
                        Ugh, what am I doing? 

           She goes back to her homework. Nurse Irie and some MALE 
           ORDERLIES enter. Nurse Irie smiles at Doris. 

                                 NURSE IRIE
                        Hi there! Don’t mind us. It’s time 
                        for his bath. 

           They begin lifting her brother up to give him a sponge bath.

                                 NURSE IRIE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, young man. You’re going to 
                        feel much better when you’re all 
                        clean. 

           Doris doodles “god’s people” in her notebook as she watches Nurse 
           Irie and the orderlies do their difficult job with smiles on. 
           INT. SCHOOL VAN - NEXT MORNING

           From the van window, Doris watches PEOPLE clean Hurricane 
           Zeta DEBRIS out of their YARDS. Wannabe Brittany and Wannabe 
           Laci chatter behind her. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        ... Jake’s going to fuckin’ teen 
                        night at Storman’s Palace. I said 
                        ‘later, skater’. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Really? Laci went once and said it 
                        was tight. She said you can sneak 
                         in vodka in a water bottle. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        That’s actually genius. 

           They notice Doris is listening, instead of lowering their 
           voices, this time they smile at her. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        Your party was off the chain. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        So dope. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah? Thanks. I had fun too. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Hey, my birthday is this weekend... 
                        Could we have another party at your 
                        house? 

           Doris is taken off guard and thinks for a beat. 

                                 DORIS
                        Well, my mom won’t be home... so 
                        yeah, definitely. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Amazing! Do you smoke weed? 

                                 DORIS
                        Not-- right now, but I am-- 
                        thinking about starting... 

           They look at her, what? 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Yes, I do. 
                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Awesome! I’ll bring a fat ass blunt 
                        with your name on it, girl. 

                                 DORIS
                        Thank you. That sounds really 
                        great. 

           Doris smiles as the 2003 birthday anthem In Da Club by 50 
           Cent kicks in.

                                 50 CENT
                        Go, go, go, go, go, go, go shorty. 
                        It’s your birthday. We gon’ party 
                        like it’s your birthday... 

           EXT. DORIS’ HOUSE - DAYS LATER

           Wearing old stained clothes, Doris removes the wood planks 
           from the windows. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LATER

           A freshly showered Doris quickly cleans the house again. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LATER

           Doris, Brittany, Laci, Wannabe Brittany, and Wannabe Laci 
           decorate the house with BALLOONS AND STREAMERS. TONS OF TEENS 
           arrive with a KEG for Wannabe Laci’s birthday. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LATER

           The party is in full swing. Doris sips a beer. The girls sit 
           in a circle and Wannabe Laci passes Doris a BLUNT. She smokes 
           it and coughs. 

                                 DORIS
                        Hoh my god--

           Doris coughs more. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Whoa, are you a weed virgin?

           Doris tries to answer but just coughs more.
                                 BRITTANY
                        You gotta be careful, girl. That’s 
                        really strong, we got it from Aaron 
                        Miller...

           She says this like Doris is supposed to be impressed. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        Do you know him? He’s twenty-two, 
                        tattoos, he’s smokin’ ass hot. He 
                        sells only the dankest buds. 

           Brittany leans into Doris. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        We dated for almost a year, but he 
                        broke it off last month cause he 
                        said I’m like... immature. 

           Brittany looks at Doris with eyes full of insecurity. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh god, I’m sorry. I feel like only 
                        a really immature person would be 
                        callous enough to call someone else 
                        immature. 

           Brittany looks like Doris just solved the unsolvable problem. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Holy shit. You’re so right. Wow, 
                        I’ve never like, thought about 
                        that.

                                 LACI
                        That was some deep shit, Doris. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY 
                        Oooo, Deep Doris. 

           The girls laugh. Doris laughs too. Laci passes the blunt to 
           Doris again. She hits it and coughs even harder. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh oh! Doris, come on, let’s do a 
                        keg stand! 

                                 DORIS
                        What? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        It’s so fun! I’ll do one after you! 
           Brittany drags her over to the keg. Before Doris can figure 
           out what a keg stand is, some GUYS lift her upside down and 
           shove the keg nozzle into her mouth. Doris starts to chug. 

                                 PARTY
                        1... 2--

           Doris spits beer all over her couch. The teens CHEER. 

           When the teens put her down she has beer all over her face. 
           She stumbles and backs into Nate. He grins at her.

                                 NATE
                        Two? That’s like, a record. 

                                 DORIS
                        Really? 

                                 NATE
                        No. 

           Doris laughs. Nate wipes beer off Doris’ upper lip. As Doris’ 
           depression lifts, her beauty is amplified. Nate is clearly 
           taken with her. Is he going to kiss her? 

           We’ll never know cause Brittany falls out of her keg stand 
           onto them. They all fall on the floor, laughing.

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - EARLY NEXT MORNING

           All the teens are gone. Doris holds a BLOW DRYER to the couch 
           to dry all the beer spit. Kristine enters. Doris quickly 
           pivots the blow drier so it looks like she’s drying her hair. 
           Kristine doesn’t notice and heads to her bedroom. Doris goes 
           back to drying the couch. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - DAYS LATER

           A blissful Doris, the girls, and the Wannabe girls are having 
           a sleep over. They drink beer and pass a joint around, while 
           watching a HORROR MOVIE. Brittany yells at the movie. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Don’t just stand there! Run, you 
                        dumb bitch! 

           The girls laugh. Laci plays with Doris’ hair. 

                                 LACI
                        Man, I can’t stand how dumb people 
                        are when real shit’s goin’ down. 
                                 DORIS
                        It’s called the freeze response. 
                        It’s a survival instinct and your 
                        brain just like, shuts down. 
                             (off their looks)
                        ... or whatever. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Of course you would know that. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh, guess what I heard? 

           Everyone looks at her, hungry for gossip. 

                                 LACI (CONT'D)
                        Nate has a crush on Doris. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                             (jealous but covering)
                        What? Where’d you hear that? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Ahhh! That’s so cute. You guys 
                        would be so cute. 

           Doris blushes.

                                 WANNABE LACI 
                        So cute. 

                                 DORIS
                        Who told you that? 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Do you like him? 

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t know. 

                                 LACI
                        If you do, I can totally make that 
                        happen. I’m all about sisterhood. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        He’s not like, deep and quiet or 
                        whatever like you are. But he’s 
                        super cute, right? 

           All the girls look at Doris, expectantly. Doris tries to play 
           it cool.  

                                 DORIS
                        Um, I mean, he’s sorta cute...
                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh my God. You love him. She loves 
                        him. 

           The girls all laugh as Doris turns beet red.  

                                 LACI
                        You should go to prom with him! 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh well, now you have to! Too bad 
                        it’s already out there. You’re 
                        going with him. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Well, don’t get her hopes up he 
                        might not be into her.

                                 LACI
                        Ew, you sound really jealous and 
                        it’s boring. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        So boring. 

                                 LACI
                             (re: Doris’ hair)
                        Why don’t you use gel? You got 
                        great hair. 

                                 DORIS
                        Ugh, I hate it. I don’t know what 
                        to do with it. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        You should just straighten that 
                        shit. I would kill myself if I had 
                        curly hair. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Well then I wish you had curly 
                        hair. 

           Brittany and Laci keep standing up for Doris and Doris 
           notices.

                                 LACI
                        You got gel? I wanna mess with it.  

                                 DORIS
                        My mom might have some in the 
                        bathroom closet. 

           Laci gets up and opens a closet. 
                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh-- not that one-- 

           Doris hurries over to the closet. 

                                 LACI
                        Why you got a hospital in here? 

           Laci gestures to the hospital bed and all the medical 
           supplies. All the girls gather around it. Doris feels caught. 

                                 DORIS
                        It’s for my brother. He was sick 
                        for a long time. 

           The girls look at each other. They have no idea what to say. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        That’s... so heavy. Is he, like, 
                        dead now? 

                                 DORIS
                        No, he’s at Suncoast Hospice-- 

                                 LACI
                        Shut the fuck up! With Terri 
                        Schiavo? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        That’s so cool. Have you seen her? 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        You have to get on the news! 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Holy shit! Can you get us on the 
                        news?

           Brittany roots around the shelves filled with pills. She 
           holds up a BOTTLE OF OXYCONTIN.  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Can I have these? 

                                 DORIS
                        Sure. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Tiiiight!

           Doris seems relieved. 
           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Doris finishes cleaning up the last of the sleep over mess. 
           Kristine enters. Kristine holds an ICE PACK on her back.  

                                 KRISTINE
                        That fuckin’ cot is killing me.

           Kristine notices the sleeping bags Doris just folded. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You slept out here? 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah... 

           Kristine then notices that Doris’ hair is gelled. Her curls 
           are sharply defined and shiny. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        What’d you do to your hair? 

                                 DORIS
                        Just put some gel in it.

           Kristine checks it out. Doris looks nervous. Then: 

                                 KRISTINE
                        It’s beautiful. Seriously, honey. 
                        You look like me when I was your 
                        age. I used to use so much gel.  

           Kristine smiles, touches Doris’ hair and cups her face. It’s 
           a nice moment until: 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Get dressed. I’m dropping you off 
                        at Suncoast. 

                                 DORIS
                        What? I just saw him. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Last week! What’s the matter with 
                        you? What’re you doing that’s so 
                        important?

                                 DORIS
                        Just school work and stuff. 
                                 KRISTINE
                        You’re home alone too much. And he 
                        shouldn’t be left with that psycho 
                        Irie. He needs visitors. He needs 
                        family. And I gotta go to work. 

                                 DORIS
                        Fine. Can I drive? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        No. 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - LATER

           Paul is being interviewed by Lisa Chan from ABC 10 o’clock 
           news. He smokes a cigarette and rants. His stubble is longer. 
           He’s beginning to look unkempt, wild. 

                                 PAUL
                        ... If the Supreme Court refuses to 
                        hear the case, then we’re talkin’ 
                        about a young woman bein’ murdered 
                        by the highest court in the land. 
                        And those sons a bitches better 
                        give their heart to Jesus, 'cause 
                        their ass is mine.

           Kristine pulls up, HONKING at protestors to move. Doris gets 
           out. She watches Paul for a beat then heads inside. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris does homework. She looks at her brother. She goes back 
           to her homework. Then she takes a deep breath.

                                 DORIS
                        Hi...

           Doris hesitates. She feels like she’s talking to a corpse. 
           Her FLIP PHONE rings. She flips it open. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Hello? 

           INT. BRITTANY’S HOUSE - BRITTANY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Brittany sits on her canopy bed with her FLIP PHONE to her 
           ear.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yo! Laci’s here too. 
           INT. LACI’S HOUSE - LACI’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Laci lies on her plush white carpet talking into her FLIP 
           PHONE’S SPEAKERPHONE. 

                                 LACI
                        What up?

           INTERCUT DORIS/BRITTANY/LACI

                                 BRITTANY
                        We were just talking and we were 
                        like - I wonder what that hoebag is 
                        up to. So now we’re calling. 

                                 LACI
                        Soooo what are you up to, hoebag? 

           The girls laugh. 

                                 DORIS
                        Nothing. Just doing homework. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Ugh, my mom keeps threatening to 
                        get me a tutor and I’d honestly 
                        rather die. But I just like can’t 
                        motivate to do homework on my own. 

                                 LACI
                        Same. You’re such a good girl, 
                        Doris. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, not-- really. 

                                 LACI
                        We’re gonna seriously make this 
                        Nate thing happen. He absolutely 
                        has to take you to prom. Cause his 
                        last girlfriend, you know Anika 
                        Onagain? She was just such a bitch 
                        but we really like you. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, really? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Duh, you’re like, this super good 
                        person with like, this sick brother 
                        and stuff... 
                                 LACI
                        And you let us party at your house, 
                        and you give super good advice. 
                        We’re like, friends. We have your 
                        back now. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, that’s so cool to hear. I mean, 
                        I have your back too obviously. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Dope dope dope. Okay, so will you 
                        please help me talk Laci out of 
                        getting back together with Dirty 
                        Cody.

                                 DORIS
                        Oh no, Laci, you can’t. He sounds 
                        like the worst. 

                                 LACI
                        You guys, he took my virginity. 
                        I’ll love him forever, it’s like a 
                        fact. I just will love him forever. 

                                 DORIS
                        Okay, but you can love him and not 
                        be with him, right? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Wow, such a good point. 

           Doris smiles, beaming. She walks away from her homework and 
           her brother, elated to be talking to her new friends.

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Doris, the girls, the Wannabe girls, Nate and a few guys sit 
           around playing DRUNK JENGA and smoking weed. Nate carefully 
           pulls a JENGA BLOCK from the TOWER. Handwritten on it is: 
           “Never have I eveR.” 

                                 NATE
                        Okay, never have I ever...

           He looks at the girls devilishly. 

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Waxed my pubes. 

           The girls all laugh. They have to drink because they have, of 
           course, all waxed their pubes. 
           They all drink their beers, except Doris. Doris realizes the 
           implication of not drinking her beer and quickly drinks 
           before anyone notices. Brittany gently pulls a Jenga block, 
           written on it is: “DARE.” 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Okay, Dare. Hmmm, I dare... all the 
                        boys-- 

                                 SOME DUDE
                        You can’t do that! It’s gotta be 
                        one person-- 

                                 NATE
                        Dude, shut up. It’s fine. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        I dare all the boys to... take off 
                        their clothes. 

           Doris looks embarrassed. Everyone else laughs playfully. 
           After some protesting, the guys strip down to their briefs. 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - SAME TIME

           A brightly lit Lisa Chan speaks directly into a NEWS CAMERA. 

                                 LISA CHAN
                        ... And the U.S. Supreme Court has 
                        officially refused to hear an 
                        appeal from her parents...

           Behind her, protestors are fired up, CHANTING and WAVING 
           signs. Kristine’s truck pulls into the chaotic parking lot. 
           Kristine is stopped by Officer Chauncey. 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        Hi, there, ma’am. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Look who it is. My hero. You wanna 
                        cavity search me? Make sure I’m not 
                        hiding any bombs back there.  

           He looks nervous because Kristine is terrifying.  

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        I’m sorry, ma’am. But-- no visitors 
                        are allowed tonight. The Supreme 
                        Court just--
                                 KRISTINE
                        I don’t give a shit what the 
                        Supreme Court did. I’m going to 
                        sleep next to my son. 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY
                        I can’t let you do that. No one is 
                        allowed in until morning. 

           Kristine makes a motion to drive forward. 

                                 OFFICER CHAUNCEY (CONT'D)
                        Ma’am, I will have to place you 
                        under arrest--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Are you kidding me?!

           Kristine thinks for a beat. She throws her truck in reverse. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You should be real proud of 
                        yourself, buddy! You kept a 
                        grieving mother from her dying son 
                        tonight! Congratulations! I hope 
                        you get the medal of honor! 

           She peels away. Officer Chauncey takes a deep breath. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The guys are still in their briefs. The girl’s shirts are 
           off. Doris’ bra is by far the least cute bra anyone has ever 
           seen. Doris pulls a block: “waterfalls.” She holds it up and 
           everyone reacts. 

                                 DORIS
                        What does ‘waterfalls’ mean? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        You gotta chug a whole beer. 

           Before Brittany finishes her sentence, Laci pops the cap of a 
           beer and hands it to Doris. Doris nervously starts to chug. 

                                 EVERYONE 
                        Chug it... chug it.... chug it... 
                        Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

           Doris’ eyes water as she struggles to finish it. She finally 
           does and holds it upside down. Everyone CHEERS. 
           Doris smiles, wiping beer off her mouth and trying not to 
           burp. Laci pulls a block: “DARE.” 

                                 LACI
                        I dare... Nate to kiss Doris. 

           Everyone “Ooo’s” and teases them. Nate grins at Doris for an 
           awkward beat then he leans forward... Doris’ first kiss 
           happens over a Jenga tower. 

           Nate pulls Doris close to him, knocking over the Jenga tower. 
           Everyone LAUGHS. This is the best moment of Doris’ young life-- 

                                 KRISTINE (O.S.)
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?! 

           This is the worst moment of Doris’ young life. Doris rips 
           away from Nate to see her mom standing in the open doorway. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        WHAT IS THIS?! Put your God damn 
                        clothes on now! 

           The kids are scrambling to get dressed. Doris can’t find her 
           shirt. She looks like she’s going to have a heart attack. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! 

           Kristine throws their purses and shit out the front door. 

                                 DORIS
                        Mom, please--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Don’t you talk to me! You’re dead! 
                        You’re having orgies while I’m 
                        sleeping on a FUCKING COT!

           Kristine is shaking with anger. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You know what?! I’m calling the 
                        police! 

           The kids look terrified. Kristine grabs a nearby PHONE. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Underage drinking! Having God damn 
                        orgies! In my house?! 
                                 DORIS
                        No, Mom! Please! Be mad at me, 
                        ground me, whatever you want-- But 
                        let them go! PLEASE!  

                                 KRISTINE
                        You have two minutes.

           The kids race out the door grabbing whatever they can. 

           EXT. DORIS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The teens run and get dressed at the same time. They pile in 
           their cars and peel away. Kristine SLAMS THE FRONT DOOR. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Doris looks at her mom with shame filled eyes. Kristine just 
           goes into her bedroom and SLAMS THE DOOR. 

           INT./ EXT. FORD PICK-UP TRUCK - NEXT DAY

           Kristine is in her waitress uniform driving in an enraged 
           silence. Doris sits next to her.

                                 DORIS
                        Mom, I--

                                 KRISTINE
                        Nah! Don’t. I don’t want to hear 
                        it. I trusted you-- I left you in 
                        charge of the house-- And you-- 
                        Well those days are over! You’re 
                        not allowed to be home alone ever 
                        again. After school you go straight 
                        to Suncoast and wait for me-- 

                                 DORIS
                        Mom--

           Kristine throws her hand up, silencing her. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Ah! Not one word! 

           Kristine pulls into Suncoast and HONKS at PROTESTERS in her 
           path. 
                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        This is our home until your brother 
                        dies! I hope you like cots! Cause 
                        that’s all they have! 

           Officer Chauncey approaches Kristine’s truck window. Kristine 
           blows past him. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Go fuck yourself, Barney Fife! 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - CONTINUOUS

           Kristine reaches over Doris and flings the passenger door 
           open. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Get out of the car. 

           Doris angrily gets out of the car. Kristine drives away. 

           Paul sits under a tree next to a sign that says: “HITLER MURDERED 
           THE DISABLED TOO.” Doris notices Paul has been watching her. 
           Doris heads over to Paul. Wordlessly, he hands her a 
           cigarette and a lighter. They smoke in silence, then: 

                                 PAUL
                        Wanna go watch the Superbowl? 

           Doris looks at him and almost smiles. She nods. 

                                 DORIS
                        I do. I really do. 

           INT. NEARBY BAR - LATER

           Doris and Paul sit at the PACKED bar. Doris wolfs down 
           CHICKEN FINGERS. Paul sips a beer. THE PATRIOTS and THE 
           EAGLES are on the TV. People BOO and CHEER respectively. 

                                 DORIS
                        ... so now they’ll probably never 
                        talk to me again. 

                                 PAUL
                        If they’re your friends, they’ll 
                        talk to you. 

                                 DORIS
                        My mom freaked out on them! 
                                 PAUL
                        So? 

                                 DORIS
                        So... I don’t know. I was having 
                        fun for the first time in my life 
                        and she ruined it. She ruins 
                        everything. 

                                 PAUL
                        Look, I get it, you want to be a 
                        “normal” teenager. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yes! Exactly. Why can’t she get 
                        that? 

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I got news for you. You’re 
                        not normal, Doris, you’re 
                        different. You’re going through 
                        something real here. And this whole 
                        thing is a gift. It might not seem 
                        like it, but it is.

                                 DORIS
                        No, it’s definitely not. 

                                 PAUL
                        It definitely is God dammit! 

           Paul SMACKS the bar, Doris jumps a little. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You’re learning what’s truly 
                        important in this fucked up world 
                        and those friends of yours sound 
                        like the most important part of 
                        their day is getting a tan.  

                                 DORIS
                        I wish I could go get a tan...

                                 PAUL
                        And your mom is... in pain. She 
                        wants to do the right thing but she 
                        doesn’t know what that is.  

                                 DORIS
                        I just wish he would freakin’ die 
                        already and then she would leave me 
                        alone. 

           Paul looks stung by this. He goes back to nursing his beer. 
                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I-- I obviously don’t mean that. 
                        I’m just... ugh, never mind.  

           Doris and Paul watch the Superbowl in silence. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        ... How did your wife die? 

                                 PAUL
                        Wow, you’re a real fun person to 
                        watch the game with. 

           Doris laughs. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Brain aneurysm. In her sleep. She 
                        was perfectly healthy. I woke up 
                        and... she was gone. There was 
                        nothin’ I could do. 

           Paul cradles his beer with both hands. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Then there’s Michael Schiavo. His 
                        wife is still alive and he wants to 
                        let her go... I mean, shit, now he 
                        is fightin’ to watch her starve... 
                        If I ever saw that piece of shit on 
                        the street I would--

           A BARTENDER puts FISH N’ CHIPS down in front of Paul.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fish n’ chips. 

           The bartender walks away. 

                                 PAUL
                        -- Let’s just say it wouldn’t be a 
                        good day for dear ol’ Michael. 

           Paul picks up a piece of FRIED FISH. Doris makes a grossed 
           out face. Paul waves it in front of Doris’ face. She laughs. 
           Doris takes one of his fries, playfully. 

                                 DORIS
                        I’ll just stick with these, thanks. 

                                 PAUL
                        So what would you really be doin’ 
                        right now if you were a “normal” 
                        teenager? Seriously just laying on 
                        the beach gettin’ tan?   
           Doris thinks. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, I don’t know... I-- I really 
                        wanna drive. 

           Paul looks at her confused. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I’m seventeen, and I only have a 
                        learners permit, my mom never lets 
                        me drive. But-- I’ve always wanted 
                        to... Since I was five years old, 
                        I’ve dreamed about driving. So I 
                        could go anywhere, anytime I 
                        wanted, on my own, and be like... 
                        completely free. 

           Paul looks moved. Paul lifts up his beer. 

                                 PAUL
                        Then a-fuckin’-men to that. 

           Doris lifts her soda and they clink glasses. The Eagles score 
           a touchdown and the whole bar is on their feet SCREAMING. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        YES! COME ON! 
                             (to Doris)
                        Between you and me, I gotta lotta 
                        money ridin’ on this game. 

           Doris takes in this oddly handsome and slightly decaying man 
           then she joins in with the bar CHEERING and CLAPPING. 

           INT. TAMPA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MONDAY MORNING

           Doris sits at her desk as other students trickle in. Brittany 
           and Laci enter. Doris looks nervous. Do they hate her?  

                                 DORIS
                        So, um, I’m really sorry about my 
                        mom--

           Brittany looks at her, then:  

                                 BRITTANY
                        That was so funny. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh my God. Bro, she was trippin’. 
                        And I thought my mom was a maniac.
                                 BRITTANY
                        That was some straight up Jerry 
                        Springer shit. Too funny.    

           The girls seem completely over it. Doris relaxes. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        So, we’re gonna skip tomorrow and 
                        get fake IDs.

                                 LACI
                        We figured if we can’t hang at your 
                        place anymore we should try to go 
                        to Ybor. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Good 
                        luck. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Good luck? You’re coming with us.

                                 DORIS
                        I am? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        I mean, are you? 

                                 DORIS
                        Yes! Definitely. I’m coming. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Don’t tell the other girls about 
                        it. 

                                 LACI
                        Dear God no. I’m so sick of them. 
                        We’re all about like lifting girls 
                        up and they’re like total tear 
                        downs. So boring. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah, totally boring. 

           Doris is thrilled. They still want to be her friend! Nate 
           enters.  

                                 NATE
                        There she is. Glad your mom didn’t 
                        kill you. Thanks for taking all 
                        that heat. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah, no problem. 
                                 NATE
                        So we’re getting fakes tomorrow-- 

                                 BRITTANY
                        We told her. She’s coming. 

           Nate smiles. Doris looks thrilled. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        I’ll come scoop you in the morning. 

                                 DORIS
                        Can you actually pick me up at 
                        Suncoast... I kind of live there 
                        now. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh, wow. Bummer. Sure. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris watches TV. Her brother is asleep in his bed. 

           Kristine enters, in her waitressing uniform. She sits down, 
           opens her TO-GO BOX and eats. Doris does not eat out of the 
           to-go box. They don’t even look at each other. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Kristine pulls her COT out of the closet and opens it up. 
           Doris watches her and does the same. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - BATHROOM - LATER

           Doris brushes her teeth. Kristine washes her face.  

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris lays on her cot, wide awake. Kristine lightly SNORES on 
           the cot next to her. Her brothers’s machines make light 
           BEEPING noises. Doris looks up at the ceiling. The HUMMING 
           NOISE is back.  

           Doris sits with these sounds as long as she can. Then she 
           gets up. She looks out the window. The night shift of 
           protesters have less energy than the day shift.  
           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Doris quietly steps out into the hallway. It’s empty. 

           She walks toward a SNACK machine. She puts some QUARTERS in 
           and gets a BAG OF COOKIES. Her mother didn’t bring her 
           dinner, so this is it. She opens the cookies and munches on 
           them. She continues down a different hallway. 

           She notices A DOOR CRACKED OPEN. Unlike the other rooms, 
           there’s a chair in the hallway as if someone usually sits 
           outside the door. Doris looks at the chair and then into the 
           open door... and holy shit! It’s TERRI FUCKING SCHIAVO. 

           Doris holds her breath. Terri’s dark hair is short and she is 
           overweight. Her arms are unnaturally curled up by her neck. 
           Doris steps closer to the doorway. 

           Doris takes in this woman. This woman with closed eyes and an 
           open mouth. This woman who has the whole country in a frenzy. 
           This woman who is trapped in this room, trapped in this bed. 

           Tears fall out of Doris’ eyes. Maybe for Schiavo. Maybe for 
           her brother. Maybe for herself. Probably for herself. 

           Doris hears somebody WALKING and hurries away. A SECURITY 
           GUARD rounds the corner. He eyes Doris as he quickly shuts 
           Terri’s door and sits on the empty chair in the hallway. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris pulls the blankets up around her. She lays awake in her 
           cot listening to the sounds of the living and the dying. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - NEXT MORNING

           Kristine drinks COFFEE. Doris, wearing her school uniform, 
           grabs her SCHOOL STUFF and heads for the door. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Whoa, where are you going? I’m not 
                        ready to take you yet.  

                                 DORIS
                        I have a ride. 

           Doris motions out the window. Brittany’s 2004 WHITE MUSTANG 
           CONVERTIBLE is outside. Brittany, Laci, and Nate are visible. 
                                 KRISTINE
                        Oh, your new friends are taking you 
                        to school? I barely recognized them 
                        with their clothes on. 

           Kristine watches out the window as Officer Chauncey heads 
           over to the Mustang to talk to Brittany.

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Oop, looks like Deputy Dipshit is 
                        on the case.

           Doris heads for the door. Kristine notices Doris’ gelled hair 
           and lipstick.  

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Are you wearing make-up? 

                                 DORIS
                        What? No.  

           Doris rushes out. Kristine calls after her. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        You’re coming straight here after 
                        school! 

           Kristine watches through the window as Doris happily runs out 
           of the building toward her friends. 

           Laci snaps pictures of the protestors, Officer Chauncey, and 
           the news vans with her DISPOSABLE CAMERA. Kristine shakes her 
           head at them. 

           INT. BRITTANY’S MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris is in the backseat with Nate. Doris clocks that the 
           others aren’t wearing their school uniforms. She takes off 
           her polo shirt and wears a tank top underneath.

           Brittany blares Britney Spears’ Toxic. The girls animatedly 
           sing every word while doing a choreographed hand-dance. Doris 
           mumbles along, holding her hair down from the wind. 

                                 DORIS
                             (yelling)
                        Your car is amazing.

                                 BRITTANY
                        What?

                                 DORIS
                        Your car! 
                                 BRITTANY
                        Cool!

           Brittany can’t hear her. Doris’ school shirt blows out the 
           back. Doris yells. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh shit! Stop! 

           Brittany slams on her BRAKES. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        What the fuck, Doris?!

                                 DORIS
                        Sorry, my shirt just blew out. 

           Doris looks back as CARS speed by. Her shirt is gone. 

                                 LACI
                        Your shirt? 

                                 DORIS
                        My school shirt. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh my god. Who cares? 

                                 NATE
                        Just buy a new one. 

                                 DORIS
                        I can’t afford--
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, yeah. It’s fine. I’ll just 
                        buy a new one. 

           Doris tries to seem like she fits into this carefree group. 

           EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           Brittany’s car looks out of place in front of this RUN-DOWN 
           HOUSE with an even more RUN DOWN COUCH in the front yard. 

           EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SAME TIME

           A sketchy older white dude, SUGAR BEAR, sits on the couch, 
           smoking a blunt and going through a SHOE BOX FULL OF WALLETS. 

           The teens approach him. He notices Doris. 
                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        Who’s she? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        This is Doris. Doris this is Sugar 
                        Bear. 

           Doris reaches her hand out. 

                                 DORIS
                        Nice to meet you... 

           He ignores this. Doris puts her hand down.   

                                 BRITTANY
                             (sweetly, aside to Doris)
                        Wow, you like, shake hands? That’s 
                        so cute. 

           He takes an ID out of a wallet and hands it to Brittany. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        What about this one? She’s twenty-
                        two. 

           Brittany and Laci look at it the BLONDE LADY in the photo.  

                                 LACI
                        She looks just like you. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yeah, she’s hot. I’ll take it. 

           She hands him a WAD OF CASH. Sugar Bear hands Nate an ID. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        He’s twenty-eight. But you can 
                        pass, dog. 

           Nate looks at it. 

                                 NATE
                        He’s white. 

           Sugar Bear looks annoyed and goes back to the box. He hands 
           Nate another ID. 

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, that’ll work. 

           He hands Sugar Bear some CASH. Sugar Bear looks at Laci. 
                                 LACI
                        Oh, I don’t need one I got my 
                        sister’s. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                             (to Doris)
                        You? 

                                 DORIS
                        Um, how much are they? 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        A hundred. 

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t have that right now, but 
                        thank you anyway. 

           Sugar Bear looks through the box. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        How bout’ this one? It’s gonna 
                        expire soon. You can just have it. 

           He hands Doris an ID with a photo of FEMALE WEIRD AL YANKOVIC 
           on it. 

                                 LACI
                        That’s perfect. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        That’ll totally work. 

                                 DORIS
                        Okay, yeah, thank you so much. 

           Doris pockets it. Sugar Bear puts the shoe box down. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR
                        Hey, ya’ll like puppies? 

           He motions to a large CARDBOARD BOX in the corner. The teens 
           look inside, it is full of PIT-BULL PUPPIES. 

                                 SUGAR BEAR (CONT'D)
                        Three hundred bucks each. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, no... thank you. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        We’re good. 
           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - LATER

           Brittany’s Mustang pulls up blaring Britney Spear’s I’m a 
           Slave 4 U. They drop Doris off and speed away. 

           Doris waves to Officer Chauncey as Paul pulls along side of 
           her in his OLDSMOBILE. Paul gets out of the car.   

                                 PAUL
                        Get in. You’re driving. 

           Doris lights up. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh my God. Seriously? 

           Doris gets in the driver’s seat as Paul gets in the passenger 
           seat. 

           INT. PAUL’S OLDSMOBILE - CONTINUOUS

           Doris sits behind the wheel, taking it all in. She looks 
           around the car and notices a lot of CLOTHES in the backseat 
           and a TOOTHBRUSH. Does this dude live in his car?  

                                 PAUL 
                        Okay, normal girl, show me what you 
                        got. 

           Paul lights a CIGARETTE. 

                                 DORIS
                        Um, don’t get freaked out cause I 
                        like, know the answer to this but, 
                        which pedal is go and which is 
                        stop? 

                                 PAUL
                        Are you serious? 

           Doris nods, afraid so. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Get the hell outta my car. 

           INT./ EXT. PAUL’S OLDSMOBLE - MOMENTS LATER

           They have relocated to a safer location. This PARKING LOT is 
           completely empty. Paul gets out of the driver’s side and 
           Doris gets in it again. Paul fills his lip with a wad of DIP 
           and spits out the window.  
                                 PAUL
                        Okay, first, you gotta make sure 
                        that your mirrors are in the right 
                        place. Can you see out the back 
                        window in this? 

           He points to the REARVIEW MIRROR. Doris wiggles it. 

                                 DORIS
                        Now I can. 

                                 PAUL
                        What about the side mirrors can you 
                        see what’s on either side of you? 

                                 DORIS
                        Sorta. 

           Paul reaches over her and adjusts the MIRROR BUTTONS. It’s an 
           intimate act, but Doris seems at ease. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Okay, there now I can. 

                                 PAUL
                        Alright, now press the right pedal-- 
                        wait, no the left. Now you got me 
                        fuckin’ confused. Press the left 
                        pedal with your right foot, the big 
                        one, and hold it down. Now slide 
                        this fella’ into “D.” 

           Paul guides her hand to shift the car into DRIVE. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Now take your foot off the big 
                        pedal. And hit the gas. 

           The car lurches forward. Doris giggles. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Now steer! You gotta steer! 

           The car veers toward a pole. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Steer! Steer! 

           Doris sharply turns the wheel away from the pole. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God, she’s gonna kill us. 

           This begins a MONTAGE: 
           - Doris drives around the parking lot in circles while Paul 
           white-knuckles in his seat. 

           - Doris pulls into a parking spot and backs out. 

           - Paul SCREAMS something we can’t hear while Doris almost 
           backs into a pole. 

           - Doris drives around the parking lot more comfortably and 
           Paul looks slightly more relaxed. 

           - Doris drives down a residential street. She veers into a 
           curb but pulls out at the last second. 

           - Paul SCREAMS pointing to a STOP SIGN and Doris slams on the 
           breaks. 

           - Doris pulls into a driveway and backs out smoothly. Paul 
           looks proud, he pats Doris on the back and pumps his fist. 
           Doris smiles.

           EXT. PAUL’S OLDSMOBILE - LATER

           Paul drives them back to Suncoast. Doris sits shotgun. Paul 
           occasionally spits dip out the window. 

                                 PAUL
                        ... and you wanna always be 
                        checkin’ all your mirrors, you 
                        cannot mess around with that shit-- 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh! Can you pull over?

                                 PAUL
                        Huh? 

                                 DORIS
                        Right there, can you stop?

           Paul pulls over, confused. Doris gets out of the car. She 
           runs fifty feet back and digs around in the BUSHES. Paul 
           watches her in his rearview mirror. 

           Doris looks around for several beats and then, bingo. She 
           runs back to the car holding her SCHOOL SHIRT. She gets back 
           in the car. Paul thinks, then: 

                                 PAUL
                        You know what, it’s none of my 
                        fuckin’ business. 

           Doris laughs. 
           INT. ST. PETE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - MS. BURNS’ OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           A middle-aged woman in ill fitting business attire, MS. 
           BURNS, reads a FILE at her desk. The AC is on, but Ms. Burns 
           is sweating. Doris pops her head in the door.  

                                 DORIS
                        You wanted to see me, Ms. Burns? 

                                 MS. BURNS
                        Ah, yes, hi, Doris. Have a seat. 

           Doris does. 

                                 MS. BURNS (CONT'D)
                        How well do you know Brittany 
                        Douglas, Laci Green, and Nate 
                        Gregor? 

                                 DORIS
                        Um... I don’t know. 

                                 MS. BURNS
                        Well, this is very unlike you. But 
                        all four of you were absent 
                        yesterday, without a note, so am I 
                        right to assume you were skipping 
                        school? 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, no, I mean, I know them-- but I 
                        wasn’t skipping... I was... 
                             (feigning somber)
                        I was at hospice. 

                                 MS. BURNS
                        Oh? 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, my brother is there. He’s 
                        dying. He only has a few weeks 
                        left. 

                                 MS. BURNS
                        My goodness, I’m so sorry, Doris. I 
                        knew he was sick-- but I didn’t 
                        realize... 

                                 DORIS
                             (feigning martyrdom)
                        Yeah... I’m trying to spend every 
                        second I can with him. 
                                 MS. BURNS
                        Of course. Of course. Forget I said 
                        anything. Next time just get your 
                        mom to write a note-- Or you know 
                        what, she has enough on her plate. 
                        Why don’t you just give me a heads 
                        up next time?  

                                 DORIS
                        Absolutely. Will do.

                                 MS. BURNS
                        You are very brave, Doris.

           Doris nods, trying to look brave and not like a shitty liar. 

           INT. ST. PETE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY

           Mr. Ladd stands at the front TALKING. Brittany, Laci, Nate 
           and Doris whisper. 

                                 DORIS
                        ... But don’t worry I didn’t tell 
                        her anything about you guys. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Ha, I couldn’t be less worried. 
                        That dinosaur can eat my ass. 

                                 NATE
                        Sweaty Burns, at it again. 

                                 LACI
                        On to actual important stuff, Ybor 
                        City is a go for tonight, yeah? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Mos def, oh Doris, you will live 
                        for Prana. 

                                 NATE
                        It has five different floors and 
                        each one has a different DJ. 

                                 DORIS
                        I just pray my mom goes to sleep so 
                        I can sneak out...

                                 BRITTANY
                        She will. You gotta think positive--

                                 MR. LADD
                        And what’s your opinion, Brittany? 
                                 BRITTANY
                        About what? 

                                 MR. LADD
                        The Terri Schiavo case? The case 
                        that we’ve been discussing all 
                        morning... 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Full disclosure, I haven’t been 
                        listening. 

           The whole class giggles. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        But I will say, I think the whole 
                        Schiavo thing is wrong. 

                                 MR. LADD
                        Why is that? 

                                 LACI
                        Because people should be allowed to 
                        die. Like, she told her husband to 
                        let her die, if she ever ended up 
                        like that, and all those white 
                        Republican dudes just need to honor 
                        her wishes. 

                                 MR. LADD
                        I wasn’t asking you, but thank you, 
                        Laci. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        I mean, you really should be asking 
                        Doris. She like, basically knows 
                        Terri Schiavo. 

                                 LACI
                        Her brother is in hospice with 
                        Schiavo right now.

                                 HUMPHREY
                        Who’s Doris? 

           Everyone looks confused. 

                                 DORIS
                        Um, I am. 

           The whole class looks at Doris, that girl talks? 
                                 MR. LADD
                        Doris, you don’t have to talk about 
                        this if you don’t want to. I didn’t 
                        realize...

                                 DORIS
                        No, it’s okay... it’s just sorta 
                        hard to talk about it like this-- 
                        Like, the way we talk about stuff 
                        in this class...

                                 MR. LADD
                        What do you mean? 

                                 DORIS
                        Just like, I don’t know. We sit 
                        here and we talk about hypothetical 
                        situations and what the right or 
                        wrong action is... but you can’t 
                        really answer those questions cause 
                        you don’t know. You don’t know 
                        what’s right or wrong until it’s 
                        happening to you.

           Doris looks at Humphrey. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        You can say abortion is wrong but 
                        if you were in a situation where 
                        you really needed one, suddenly 
                        it’s not wrong. We can say Terri’s 
                        husband is a monster for wanting 
                        her to die or her parents are 
                        monsters for wanting her to live 
                        but we don’t know, do we? Cause 
                        we’re not them. I guess you don’t 
                        know what’s “ethical” until... you 
                        know.  

           Mr. Ladd is about to speak when the bell BEEPS. Every kid 
           immediately gets up and heads out. 

                                 LACI
                        So smart, Doris. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        See you tonight, beebee. 

           Brittany, Laci and Nate head out, leaving Doris looking a 
           little shell-shocked at her own self-expression.

           Lisa Chan talks directly into a NEWS CAMERA.

                        ... And her feeding tube was

                        are running out of time and running 
                        out of courts...

           Doris walks past Lisa Chan as Paul riles up the crowd.

                                 PAUL
                        ... This ain’t over! We have been 
                        here before! But God will not let 
                        this happen! God has not forsaken 
                        her! God has not forsaken us!  

           Sarah, the protester, removes the red tape from her mouth. 

                                 SARAH
                        God has not forsaken us! 

           The protesters all cheer and shout different things about God 
           and forsaking as Doris walks through the automatic doors. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Doris steps inside and lifts up her arms as a female SECURITY 
           GUARD wands her. The security guard notices Doris watching 
           Paul yell at the crowd. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        All the crazies are gettin’ 
                        crazier. Seems like this 
                        nightmare’ll be over soon.

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah... 

           Doris unzips her backpack so the security guard can peek 
           inside. The security guard pulls out a DISPOSABLE CAMERA. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        No more cameras allowed inside. 

                                 DORIS
                        Seriously...? What if I want to 
                        take a picture with my brother? 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I know. It’s a damn shame. 
           The security guard takes the camera. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Doris and Kristine brush their teeth in silence. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           The room is dark except for the LIGHT from a NEWS VAN shining 
           in through the window and the soft glow of Doris’ brother’s 
           machines. Kristine lays in her cot. Doris gets in her cot and 
           immediately closes her eyes. After a long beat:  

                                 KRISTINE
                        Doris? 

                                 DORIS
                        Hmmm?

                                 KRISTINE
                        I, uh, just wanna say... I know 
                        this is hard, sleeping here every 
                        night... and I know you’re a good 
                        kid so let’s forget about the 
                        whole... party at our house thing.  

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, okay, thanks. 

           Doris keeps her eyes shut. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        ... I do think we’ll be very 
                        grateful when we look back on all 
                        this. Grateful that we got to sleep 
                        next to him every night. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah, maybe...

           Doris looks at a new TEXT on her phone from Brittany: “C U 
           soon bb.” Doris fakes a YAWN. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Man, I’m so tired. Goodnight, Mom. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        If you forget about how awful this 
                        place is, it’s almost like we’re 
                        having a sleep over. 

           Kristine chuckles. 
                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        The world’s saddest sleep over. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah... Mom, you should really get 
                        some sleep, you’ve been working so 
                        hard. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Okay, okay, jeez. Goodnight, 
                        Dory... I love you.    

           Kristine closes her eyes, she seems more at ease after making 
           peace with her daughter. Doris lies with her eyes wide open, 
           so guilty.

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris is obviously wide awake, listening to Kristine SNORING 
           next to her. Doris gets up, watching her mother carefully. 
           Doris enters the bathroom and closes the door. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - HALLWAY - LATER

           Doris, now wearing very gaudy make-up and a hoodie and 
           sweatpants, nods at TERRI’S GUARD as she passes Terri’s door. 
           Behind that door, a woman is beginning to starve, but Doris 
           isn’t thinking about that right now.  

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Brittany and Laci sit in the idling Mustang. They notice 
           Doris approaching and do a silent dance, celebrating that she 
           made it out. Doris gets in and Brittany slowly drives away. 

           INT./ EXT. BRITTANY'S MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE - MOMENTS LATER

           As soon as Brittany rounds the corner, she TURNS ON Beyonce. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Holy crap! I’m legit scared of your 
                        mom I was like, that bitch is gonna 
                        wake up and murder us! 

                                 LACI
                        Whoa, your make-up looks so good! I 
                        brought you an outfit! 

           Laci throws Doris a SKIMPY BLACK OUTFIT and Doris changes in 
           the backseat.  
                                 LACI (CONT'D)
                        And these are my old fuck-me boots, 
                        but they’re still cute! 

           Laci tosses some THIGH HIGH BLACK BOOTS to Doris. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Okay, Nate and the other girls are 
                        meeting us there... with Dirty 
                        Cody. Ugh, have you met him yet? 
                        He’s the worst. 

                                 LACI
                        He’s in college, that’s why you 
                        haven’t met him. And we’re back 
                        together. 

                                 DORIS
                        Well, I hope it works out this 
                        time. I honestly do. I support you. 

                                 LACI
                        This! See, Britt, this is what a 
                        real friend looks like! 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Whatever, easy for you to say, 
                        Doris. You haven’t been dealing 
                        with this shit for four years. 
                             (beat)
                        Ybor here we come, motha fuckas!

           Brittany CRANKS Beyonce and the girls SCREAM with their hands 
           in the air as they fly over the bridge to Tampa. 

           INT. PRANA NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           The girls are at the front of a LINE. A DOORMAN checks 
           Brittany’s ID and then lets her in. Doris wears an outfit 
           made for a leather loving stripper and whispers to Laci. 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m so nervous.

                                 LACI
                        No, dude, you’re fine. But 
                        definitely stop whispering. 

           The doorman checks Laci’s ID and lets her through. Then Doris 
           hands him her Weird Al Yankovich ID. He inspects it. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        Um, hold up... 
           Doris gulps. Brittany and Laci low-key watch from inside.

                                 DOORMAN (CONT'D)
                        You know your ID is gonna expire 
                        soon? 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, yeah, duh, I gotta go to the 
                        DMV and get a new one. Cause that’s 
                        where I got that one... I mean, you 
                        knew that. Obviously. 

           The doorman looks at her curiously. Then he nods her in. 
           Doris looks like she almost crapped her tiny leather shorts. 

           INT. PRANA NIGHTCLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls are in full celebration mode! They’re in! Doris 
           takes in this crowd of UNDERAGE GIRLS dressed like 
           prostitutes and OVERAGE GIRLS dressed in jeans and t-shirts. 

           The music PUMPS louder than anything Doris has ever heard. 
           CLUB-TYPE MEN check our girls out. Brittany and Laci love it. 
           Doris has not been desensitized to it yet.  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Come on, I’m buying drinks! 

                                 NATE (O.S.)
                        Nope, I got Doris. 

           Nate appears and puts his arm around Doris’ waist. 

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        You look amazing. What can I get 
                        you? 

           Doris looks nauseous and delighted. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh-- um, I’ll get-- or you can get 
                        me a...
                             (to Laci)
                        What are you having? 

                                 LACI
                        Captain and coke, bitch! 

                                 DORIS
                        Captain and coke please!  

           Nate smiles and disappears into the crowd.  
                                 BRITTANY
                        Don’t look now but Dirty Cody is 
                        being... 
                             (newscaster voice)
                        that’s right folks, he’s being 
                        dirty as hell! 

           Brittany gestures to a tall guy with a goatee as he grinds on 
           the dance floor with a GIRL who is probably fourteen. This is 
           classic DIRTY CODY. 

                                 LACI
                        Excuse me, ladies. Sisterhood and 
                        all that, but I’m about to snatch a 
                        bitch. 

           Laci heads off. Nate appears with Doris’ DRINK. She sips it. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh my God. Why is this so good?! 

           Nate laughs. 

                                 NATE
                        You wanna come up on the roof with 
                        me? There’s a bar up there and it’s 
                        quieter.

           Before Doris can answer, her PHONE RINGS. She looks at the 
           screen: MOM. Oh shit.  

                                 DORIS
                        Um, I gotta-- I’ll be back.

           Doris runs outside... 

           EXT. PRANA NIGHTCLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris answers the phone. 

                                 DORIS
                        Hello? 

                                 KRISTINE (V.O.)
                        Doris. You better get back here 
                        right now. The nurses are all here 
                        and... it’s time. Your brother is 
                        going to go... he’s gonna die 
                        tonight.  

           Kristine hangs up. Doris looks horrified. 
           INT. PRANA NIGHTCLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris looks around, but she can’t find anyone. She scans 
           faces on the dance floor, still nothing. Dudes try to grind 
           on her ass as she searches frantically. She runs to a flight 
           of stairs and climbs up so she can look down and get a better 
           view of the crowd, but her friends are gone...  

           INT. PRANA NIGHTCLUB - STAIRWELL - LATER

           Doris sprints upstairs in her six-inch-high heels. She’s 
           sweating and frantic. She opens a door marked: “Roof.” 

           She runs out onto a chic rooftop bar. String lights hang over 
           DRUNK PEOPLE as they relax on lounge chairs. She scans this 
           crowd and spots her friends. She runs to them.  

                                 NATE
                        There she is. 

                                 DORIS 
                        Oh-- Um, Brittany, I’m so sorry, 
                        but can you take me back to 
                        Suncoast? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Haha, very funny, bitch. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, I’m serious, my brother is-- 
                        he’s about to die. 

           The energy of this carefree crowd changes immediately. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Whoa, that’s so heavy. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh God, of course. Yeah. 

                                 LACI
                        Yeah, let’s go. 

                                 NATE
                        I’ll come.

                                 DIRTY CODY
                        I’ll come too. I’m Cody, by the 
                        way. 

           Doris runs out and these young, ill-prepared kids follow. The 
           Wannabe girls stay behind and immediately change the subject.   
                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Did you hear what happened to 
                        Charlotte Yang? 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Shut up! Yes! I literally died...

           Brittany pulls up and Doris hops over the side before the car 
           is fully stopped. She runs past whatever COP is on duty. 

           Paul stands in a group of NIGHT PROTESTERS and watches Doris 
           curiously.  

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris bursts in to find her mother sitting on the couch and 
           her brother lying peacefully in bed. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Are you kidding me? This is how 
                        you’re dressed? 

                                 DORIS
                             (out of breath)
                        What...? Did he...? Is he still...?

           Doris runs to her brother, but he looks the same as always. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        What’s going on? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Relax, he’s not about to die, but 
                        he could be. You never know, he’s 
                        in hospice... 

                                 DORIS
                        What? You lied? 

                                 KRISTINE
                        It wasn’t a lie! He could’ve died 
                        tonight and you weren’t here! After 
                        I tell you what a good kid you are, 
                        you sneak out dressed like a 
                        hooker? Well, joke’s on me, I 
                        guess.  

                                 DORIS
                        You made me think--? What the fuck 
                        is wrong with you?!
                                 KRISTINE
                        What is wrong with me? Oh that’s 
                        really rich, Doris. You break all 
                        the rules and I’m the bad guy. 

                                 DORIS 
                        You’re worse than the bad guy, 
                        you’re a fuckin’ monster! You just 
                        don’t tell someone that! You don’t 
                        lie about that. 

           Doris starts to cry. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Oh good the water works.  

                                 DORIS
                        Yes, okay, I snuck out but that 
                        doesn’t mean you can-- I’ve always 
                        done everything you ask me to. My 
                        entire childhood was wasted taking 
                        care of him so you didn’t have to! 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Didn’t have to?! You think I liked 
                        leaving my sick child to go serve 
                        food to tourists?! You think I 
                        wanted to work instead of be with 
                        my boy? I had to work so we could 
                        eat! So we could pay rent! So you 
                        could go to your private school 
                        with your perverted friends! 

                                 DORIS
                        I’m done. I’m done with this. I’m 
                        not coming back here. You can live 
                        here with your precious son. He’s 
                        basically dead anyway. You can both 
                        fuck off.  

           Doris walks out. 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris bursts outside, wiping away tears. She walks toward the 
           main road. Paul catches up to her. 

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t wanna talk right now. 

                                 PAUL
                        We don’t have to talk. 
           Paul walks with her in silence. 

                                 DORIS
                        I just want to be alone.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m so sorry, Doris. Did... your 
                        brother pass away? 

                                 DORIS
                        No! No! She told me he was about 
                        to! She lied to me. My mom is a 
                        psycho! I really don’t wanna talk 
                        about it. 

           Doris wipes away tears and keeps walking. Her boot heel 
           breaks. She tries to walk with the broken heel for a few 
           steps, then she sits on the ground and pulls the ridiculous 
           boots off. She walks barefoot. 

                                 PAUL
                        Do you want me to drive you 
                        somewhere? 

           Doris ignores him. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I-- I know you don’t want to hear 
                        this right now, but your mom just 
                        did you a huge favor. I saw you run 
                        in that building. You thought he 
                        was goin’ and you ran to him. 
                        You’re not ready for him to go. You 
                        think you are, but you’re not. You 
                        need to make peace with him while 
                        you got the chance-- 

                                 DORIS
                        Shut up! Please just shut the fuck 
                        up! Who even are you? You’re like 
                        some old guy who’s obsessed with 
                        Terri Schiavo cause you can’t get 
                        over your dead wife? Do I look like 
                        her or something? Is that why 
                        you’re always bothering me? Well, 
                        I’m not her! So just leave me the 
                        fuck alone. 

           Doris walks faster. Paul stops walking, hurt. 

                                 PAUL
                        No... that ain’t it at all. You’re 
                        just a... kid. You seemed like you 
                        needed--
                                 DORIS
                        I don’t need anything from you. 
                        Just get the hell away from me! 

           Doris runs out into the street narrowly missing a CAR. 

                                 PAUL
                        Doris!

           Doris keeps running. Her bare feet slap the concrete as Paul 
           watches her disappear into the night. 

           INT. DORIS' HOUSE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NEXT DAY

           QUICK CUTS:

           - Doris lies on her bed, wide awake, still wearing the 
           leather outfit. Mascara is smeared all over her face. Her 
           bare feet are black from running for miles.  

           - Doris looks at her alarm clock: 6:25 AM

           - Doris walks around her empty house. 

           - Doris takes a shower. 

           - Doris brushes her teeth, wearing a TOWEL.

           - Doris gets dressed in her school uniform. 

           INT./EXT. SCHOOL VAN - LATER

           The van is parked in front of Doris’ house. Doris gets in. 
           Doris sits in front of Wannabe Laci and Wannabe Brittany. 
           They fall into an awkward silence when they see her. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY 
                        ... Um, I’m so sorry for your loss--

                                 DORIS
                        He didn’t die. It was a... false 
                        alarm. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                             (huge relief)
                        Oh thank God. Cause I had zero idea 
                        what to say to you just now. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Me too. Do people like when you 
                        say, “sorry for your loss?” 
                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        I always feel so generic when I say 
                        it...

           They wait for Doris to speak for all grieving people. 

                                 DORIS
                        Um, yeah it’s fine. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Sweet. Okay, so you missed an epic 
                        night, after you left we all met up 
                        at Nate’s house, Laci got so 
                        wasted, she jumped in the pool 
                        naked and Cody was beyond pissed...

           Doris listens to these girls prattle on about nothing. 

           EXT. TAMPA CHRISTIAN SCHOOL - LATER

           Brittany, Laci, Nate and other cool kids hang out in a group. 
           Laci sees Doris and runs to her. She pulls her into a 
           dramatic hug. She holds her as the other kids crowd around. 

                                 LACI
                        Back off! She needs her space! 
                             (to Doris)
                        Shhhh. It’s okay, girl. We’re here 
                        for you. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Forever. We’ll always be here. 

                                 DORIS
                             (muffled, into Laci’s 
                              chest)
                        He didn’t die. 

                                 NATE
                        Wow, really? Okay, that’s amazing. 

                                 LACI
                        Yeah, I’m so happy to hear that! 

           Laci finally lets go of Doris. 

                                 LACI (CONT'D)
                        Well, now Nate has something to ask 
                        you-- 

                                 NATE
                        Stop--
                                 BRITTANY
                        He wasn’t going to do it today 
                        cause if your brother had died he 
                        felt weird asking but--

                                 NATE
                        Shut up, both of you. I don’t need 
                        you to speak for me. 

                                 LACI
                        He so does. 

           Nate approaches Doris. He’s nervous but trying to be cool. 

                                 NATE
                        Um, nah, I was just wondering if 
                        like, you wanted to go to prom with 
                        me? 

           Doris looks stunned. She didn’t realize it until now, but 
           she’s been waiting for this moment her entire life. 

                                 DORIS
                        I--

           But her emotions are completely fucked right now so she just 
           says:

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Sure. 

           Nate looks concerned. Doris smiles to ease his concern. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I mean, yes, of course. Yes. 

                                 NATE
                        Good. Good. 

                                 LACI
                        Kiss her! 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Finger her! 

           Laci and Brittany laugh, but Nate does pull Doris into a 
           kiss, it’s weird and nice. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Doris watches her TV DINNER move in circles inside the 
           microwave. 
           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Doris searches the back of a cupboard and pulls out a half 
           empty bottle of CAPTAIN MORGAN from Kristine’s stash. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Doris pours COCA COLA into a glass and mixes it with Captain 
           Morgan. Doris fills the Captain Morgan bottle with tap water 
           to replace what she stole.

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Doris sits in front of the TV with her drink and her dinner. 
           She flips through the channels. She stops when she sees Paul 
           being interviewed by Lisa Chan.  

           ON TV: 

                                 PAUL
                        ... and we’re going to fight this 
                        thing all the way to city hall. 
                        These folks behind me are prepared 
                        to march--

           Doris changes the channel. 

           ON TV: 

                                 CNN NEWS ANCHOR
                        And three of Florida’s top 
                        neurologists viewed Schiavo's CT 
                        scans. Saying it is quote, "the 
                        most severe brain damage I've 
                        seen." And quote, "The chance that 
                        this person is going to recover is 
                        about zero...” She has now been 
                        without nutrition or hydration for 
                        several days and it looks like the 
                        long battle over this young woman’s 
                        life is coming to an end--

           Doris turns off the TV. She sips her drink and eats in 
           silence.   

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Doris has all the PHOTO ALBUMS out. She skims through photos 
           of her brother at all different stages in his life. 

           INSERT: PHOTOS

           camera, the definition of a trooper. 

           INT. DORIS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Photo albums are everywhere, but Doris is glued to the TV. 

           ON TV: An old home movie, Young Doris and her brother are 
           running around the backyard. Kristine films them. Kristine 
           sounds a hundred years younger and unrecognizably happy. 

                                 KRISTINE (O.S.)
                        Okay, guys, do the Muscle Beach! 

           Doris and her brother both flex their muscles and growl, 
           trying to look tough. Kristine LAUGHS.  

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Now do the Moonwalk. 

           Doris does a terrible Moonwalk across the lawn, basically 
           just walking backwards. She watches her brother.  

                                 YOUNG DORIS
                        Wait, how do you do it--? 

                                 DORIS’ BROTHER
                        No, Dory, you gotta slide your 
                        foot. 

           Doris mimics his foot movement.

                                 DORIS’ BROTHER (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, sliiiiiide and sliiiiiiide. 

                                 YOUNG DORIS
                             (singing)
                        And sliiiiiiiide and sliiiiiiide! 
           They both start singing this nonsensical song and cracking 
           each other up. Kristine laughs too. 

           Doris turns off the TV. She sits in this pile of memories, 
           trying not to implode. 

           EXT. INTERNATIONAL PLAZA - TAMPA - DAYS LATER

           Brittany whips her Mustang into the parking lot, narrowly 
           dodging OLD PEOPLE and TEENS. Somehow Florida’s entire 
           population seems like it is made up of old people and teens. 
           Doris, Laci and the wannabe girls get out of the Mustang. 

           A black RANGE ROVER parks nearby. TWO WHITE WOMEN and TWO 
           BLACK WOMEN get out. The women are all in their 50’s. They 
           are well dressed, Florida chic. Their hair is coiffed, 
           Florida classy. The two white women’s skin is deeply tanned, 
           Florida crispy.   

                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Jesus, Britt you almost hit someone-- 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh God, Mom, give it a rest. 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        I think we should go to Neiman’s 
                        first-- 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Yeah, they have the classiest 
                        formal wear. 

           This group of teens and their future-selves head toward the 
           mall. Wannabe Laci’s mom notices Doris. 

                                 WANNABE LACI’S MOM
                        Oh, hello. I’m Carol.  

                                 DORIS
                        Doris, hi. 

                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Oh, Doris! I’m Brittany’s mom, 
                        Susan. I’ve heard so much about 
                        you. 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        Maureen. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Debbie! Hi!
                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Is your mom meeting us or--?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Mom, I literally told you not to 
                        ask her that. 

                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Oh, sorry. 

                                 DORIS
                        No, it’s okay, she’s busy. 

                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        Oh, okay, well, no problem. 
                        Neiman’s, here we come! 

           The women all start chattering, excited, as Doris tries not 
           to feel like a ninth wheel.

           INT. NEIMAN MARCUS - LATER

           The moms are piling a SALES ASSOCIATE’S arms full of all the 
           PROM DRESSES they want to see their daughters in/they wish 
           they could still wear. 

           At the other end of the FORMAL WEAR SECTION, the teens are 
           looking at extremely skimpy DRESSES. Doris, however, is more 
           focused on the PRICE TAGS.  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Check out this slutty little 
                        number. 

           Brittany holds a GOLD STRAPPY DRESS up to her body. 

                                 LACI
                        Horny. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        So hawt. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Ooo, love. 

                                 DORIS
                        Are they all like, five hundred 
                        dollars? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yeah, I know right? It’s nuts. 

           Brittany and Laci walk ahead. 
                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        You’re like my Grandma. She’s 
                        always talking about price. She’s 
                        like, obsessed with coupons.  

                                 WANNABE LACI
                             (playfully)
                        Aw, Grandma Doris. 

           The Wannabe girls laugh. Doris tries to laugh too, but it 
           stings. Brittany calls out: 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Ooo, Doris, come here, this burnt 
                        orange would look dope on you!

           Doris catches up to her and looks at the price tag. 

                                 DORIS
                        Um, I don’t think it’s-- exactly 
                        right.  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yeah, it’s a little like - hey, 
                        look at me. Next! 

           Doris looks at more price tags in disbelief. 

           INT. NEIMAN MARCUS - DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           The moms sit on couches, waiting for their daughters. Doris 
           sits with the moms, weirdly not trying anything on. Laci 
           steps out of a dressing room and the moms CHEER! 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        Shut the front door! That’s the 
                        one! 

                                 WANNABE LACI’S MOM
                        Oh, yep! That’s the one! 
                        Definitely!

           Laci does a little spin. 

                                 LACI
                        I like it, but I’m not sure if I 
                        love...

           She steps back in the dressing room and the moms GASP at 
           Brittany who steps out in her gold slutty little number.  
                                 BRITTANY’S MOM
                        You are stunning. Oh my goodness. 
                        You are buying that dress, young 
                        lady. 

           Doris watches this alien display of mother’s living 
           vicariously through their daughters.

           INT. LACI’S HOUSE - LACI’S BEDROOM - DAYS LATER

           Brittany, Wannabe Laci, and Wannabe Brittany are decked out 
           in their prom dresses with their hair professionally done. 
           They fuss over their perfect images in the mirror. 

           Laci, also dolled up to perfection, stands in front of her 
           closet carelessly tossing DRESSES on her bed. 

                                 LACI
                        Hmmmm... I know it’s in here. 

           Doris stands awkwardly nearby, in her bra and underwear, her 
           hair is not professionally done.  

                                 DORIS
                        They’re all so pretty. Honestly, 
                        I’ll wear whatever-- 

                                 LACI
                        Oooo! Here it is! 

           Laci holds up an AQUA DRESS covered in sequins. Doris 
           gratefully takes it. 

                                 DORIS
                        Thank you so much. 

           Doris puts it on and Laci zips her up. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh my God, it’s perfect. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Stun-ning. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        The straps are a little long... 

                                 LACI
                        My mom can fix that.
                             (screaming)
                        MOM! I NEED YOUR SEWING KIT!  
                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        I think it’s so cool that you’re 
                        comfortable wearing Laci’s old 
                        dress. 

           Brittany glares at her. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        What are you doing? Like, what are 
                        you actually doing right now? 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Sorry. I meant it like a good 
                        thing. 

           Laci looks at her phone and GASPS. 

                                 LACI
                        Cody’s not taking me to prom. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        What?!

                                 LACI
                        He said he’ll meet me at the bon 
                        fire before but...
                             (reading)
                        ‘I’ve already been to prom. It was 
                        super lame and I don’t feel like 
                        going again.’

           Laci runs to her bed and throws herself down face first. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh, I hate him, I ab-sol-utely hate 
                        him. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Me too. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        He’s the worst. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, Laci, I know this hurts, but I 
                        promise this is a good thing. Isn’t 
                        it better that you really see his 
                        true colors now than in four more 
                        years? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        I mean, for him to do this to you 
                        on the holiest of nights. I can’t 
                        even. 
           Laci looks up, she’s not crying, but she wishes she was. 

                                 LACI
                        Ugh, it’s my fault. I keep going 
                        back to him. 

                                 DORIS
                        Not anymore. You’re done. You’re 
                        strong enough to be done now. 

                                 LACI
                        Yeah? 

                                 DORIS
                        You’re so strong, dude. You’re such 
                        a good person and such a good 
                        friend. You like-- I mean, you all 
                        have like-- saved me. You’re a 
                        shining star and you’re way too 
                        good for that loser. 

           Laci sits up, looking touched. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Doris with the truth bombs! Group 
                        hug, beebees. 

           They all pile on top of Laci. Then Laci sits up. 

                                 LACI
                        You know what? I’m breaking up with 
                        him right now. 

           She pulls out her phone and sends him a text, then:

                                 LACI (CONT'D)
                        Wow, I’m going to prom alone... 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Uh, no, you’re going with me. Now I 
                        have a date! 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        God, I can’t imagine going to prom 
                        alone... 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Are you kidding me? Do you ever 
                        like, flip it over once in your 
                        brain before speaking? 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Sorry. 
           Laci stands up and wipes her eyes, again, she was not crying. 

                                 LACI
                        Thanks, guys, I love you so much. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Aw, I love you guys so much. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Alright, let me whip my curling 
                        iron through that gorgeous hair and 
                        we are. On. Our. Way, bitches! 

           Brittany motions for Doris to sit. Laci’s mom knocks and then 
           enters. 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        Oh my goodness. Did I just walk 
                        onto a runway? You are all so 
                        beautiful! 

                                 LACI
                        Can you shorten the straps on her 
                        dress? 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        Is that from your Junior Prom? Oh, 
                        it looks so good on you!  

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, thank you. You’re so nice...
                             (to Laci)
                        Your mom’s so nice. 

                                 LACI’S MOM
                        Well, isn’t she sweet? I’ll tell 
                        you what, it’s nice to be 
                        appreciated around here... 

           Laci’s mom pulls out her sewing kit and gets to work. Doris 
           looks in the mirror as Brittany curls her hair and Laci’s mom 
           fixes her straps. Doris wells up with tears. Even without a 
           dime, and without a mom, she still gets to go to prom. 

                                 DORIS 
                        I-- I feel like a princess. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Dude, stop you’re gonna ruin your 
                        make-up. 

           Doris’ phone rings. It says: MOM. She hesitates, then:
                                 DORIS
                        Hello? 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - SAME TIME

           Kristine sits near her son’s bed while NURSES tend to him. 

           INTERCUT KRISTINE/DORIS

                                 KRISTINE
                        I just, uh, I wanted to tell you 
                        that it looks like he might go 
                        tonight or tomorrow. They say-- 
                        cause, uh, his fingers are pretty 
                        yellow. And his breath is getting 
                        kinda labored, so...

           Doris doesn’t say anything for a long beat. 

                                 KRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Look, I’m sorry, okay? I should’a 
                        never done that-- lied to you. I 
                        just-- there’s no excuse. It was 
                        cruel and I understand if you can’t 
                        forgive me. But don’t punish him, 
                        okay? He didn’t-- I mean, you do 
                        what you want. But I just wanted to 
                        let you know... 

           After a long beat: 

                                 DORIS
                        Thanks for letting me know. 

           Doris hangs up the phone. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Everything cool? 

                                 DORIS
                        Umm hmm. 

           Doris forces a smile as they continue to doll her up. 

           INT. WHITE STRETCH LIMO - LATER

           This fourteen person limo is filled to capacity. TEENS are 
           flaunting at least $10,000 worth of DRESSES and SUITS. The 
           MUSIC blares and everyone SCREAMS over it.  

           Doris sits with Nate, Brittany and Laci. 
                                 BRITTANY
                        ... then you threw her off the jet 
                        ski! You were like, take that, hoe! 

                                 LACI
                        She fell! I didn’t “throw her!” 

                                 NATE
                        Oh, you threw her! I saw ya’ll! 

           The kids LAUGH. Doris checks her phone and tries to laugh.  

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Remind me to never get on a ski 
                        with your punk ass! 

                                 LACI
                        Whatever! How ‘bout when you hit 
                        Michael Rieger with a brick!  

           Brittany spits out her beer, laughing. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Holy shit! Nate! You can’t lie, 
                        that was some psycho shit! 

                                 NATE
                        He came at me with a bat! Yo! What 
                        was I supposed to do?! 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Do you know Mike Rieger? 

           Doris is lost in thought and realizes Brittany is talking to 
           her.  

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, um, no, but that’s so funny! 

           Doris fakes a laugh and this satisfies everyone. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh shit! Wait, turn it up! This is 
                        my song! 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Shots! Shots! Shots! 

           Brittany swigs from a bottle of GRAY GOOSE VODKA and passes 
           it around for everyone to swig from. 

           Someone turns up Don’t Cha by The Pussy Cat Dolls and every 
           girl screams the lyrics.
                                 TEEN GIRLS
                        Don’t you wish your girlfriend was 
                        hot like me? 
                        Don’t you wish your girlfriend was 
                        a freak like me? 
                        Don’t cha? 
                        Don’t cha? 

           Doris obviously doesn’t know the lyrics. She checks her phone 
           again. Nate notices. 

                                 NATE
                        You look amazing tonight, by the 
                        way.  

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, thank you. 

           They sit in silence because they have literally nothing to 
           talk about. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        How’s your mom’s parrot? 

                                 NATE
                        What? Oh, yeah, it’s good. I taught 
                        it to say, 
                             (parrot impression)
                        “Suck my dick” 
                             (normal voice)
                        It was super funny. But now it 
                        won’t stop saying it so... my mom’s 
                        kinda pissed. 

           Nate chuckles. Doris forces a smile. 

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        I’m, uh, really stoked you came 
                        with me tonight...

           Nate pulls Doris’ face toward his and they make-out. After a 
           few beats, the whole limo notices and the kids CHEER. Doris 
           pulls away, embarrassed but smiling. 

           EXT. SHELL KEY BEACH - NIGHT

           Our teens are in a crowd of a HUNDRED TEENS, all well dressed 
           and gathered in small groups around a large BON FIRE. Wannabe 
           Brittany holds an empty bottle of DASANI WATER and Brittany 
           fills it up with her giant bottle of Gray Goose. 
                                 BRITTANY
                        Make sure to stay hydrated at the 
                        dance, ladies! 

           The girls laugh. Brittany swigs from her Grey Goose bottle, 
           she’s pretty hammered.  

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Um, excuse me, young lady, is that 
                        vodka? No, it’s Dasani, bitch!

           Wannabe Brittany waves her Dasani bottle around, victorious. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Seriously, don’t be an idiot about 
                        it, be cool. 

                                 WANNABE BRITTANY
                        Oh, yeah, no, I will. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Your turn, Doris. 

           Doris stops checking her phone and holds her Dasani bottle up 
           for Brittany to fill. 

                                 LACI
                        Oh, shit. 

           Everyone looks up and sees what she’s looking at. It’s Dirty 
           Cody. 

                                 WANNABE LACI
                        Ugh, here we go...

                                 DIRTY CODY
                        Laci, can I talk to you for a 
                        second? 

           Doris takes Laci’s hand and Brittany takes her other hand. 
           Everyone waits for Laci to respond... 

                                 LACI
                        No. Cody, we’re done. I erased you 
                        from my phone. I mean it this time. 

                                 DIRTY CODY
                        Lace, come on, babe, I’m gonna come 
                        with you to the dance, okay? My 
                        bad, okay? Gimme a break.   
                                 LACI
                        No. Seriously. We are done. 
                        Forever. I never want to see your 
                        face again. 

           Dirty Cody looks at her, what the fuck are you doing? Laci 
           doesn’t budge. He sighs and leaves. After he walks away, the 
           girls all SCREAM and jump and down!  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh my God! I’m so proud of you!  

                     WANNABE BRITTANY
                                                      WANNABE LACI
           Genius!
                                              So gangster!

           The girls all hug Laci. Laci looks very proud of herself. 

                                 DORIS 
                        I knew you could do it.

                                 BRITTANY
                        OH MY GOD! THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT 
                        OF MY LIIIIIIFE! 

           Brittany swigs vodka and calls to the kids nearby, including 
           Nate. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        GUYS! Ya’ll, oh my God, I just 
                        realized something. This is it. 

           Everyone LAUGHS at her. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        No, I’m serioush, shhhhh, this is 
                        going to be the most important 
                        night of our lives. This is 
                        everything. We’ll remember this 
                        forever... 

           Doris looks at her, weirdly taking this drunken ramble in.

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        We’re all together. And that’s all 
                        that matters. Like, this really 
                        will be the most important night of 
                        our lives, sheriously. You guys are 
                        my-- my family and we’re all here 
                        for each other and we’re always 
                        gonna be here for each other and 
                        I’m never gonna forget tonight. 
                        Never ever ever. 

           Doris’ looks like the clouds have been lifted from her eyes. 
                                 DORIS
                        I have to go. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        What? 

                                 DORIS
                        I have to go right now-- 

                                 BRITTANY
                        What the fuck, Doris? Did you not 
                        listen to what I just said?

                                 DORIS
                        No-- This isn’t important-- This 
                        isn’t-- I have to go see my 
                        brother. I-- I need to be with my 
                        mom. Oh my God. I have to go. I 
                        need to talk to him! I have to go! 

           Doris runs off the beach, toward the street. 

                                 NATE
                        Doris?! 

                                 LACI
                        What are you doing?! 

           Doris ignores them and keeps running. 

           EXT. SHELL KEY - STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris runs up to a WHITE LIMO and knocks on the window. 

                                 DORIS
                        Excuse me?! Can you help me? Can 
                        you drop me off somewhere real 
                        quick? It’s an emergency! 

           INT. WHITE STRETCH LIMO - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris sits all alone in the back of this ridiculous display 
           of wealth on wheels. The BALLOONS and CONFETTI make it look 
           like she’s celebrating. Her face makes it look like she’s 
           mourning. She rolls down the PRIVACY SCREEN and addresses the 
           limo driver, trying not to cry.   

                                 DORIS
                        If there is anything you can do to 
                        go faster, I’d... really appreciate 
                        it. 
           Doris CALLS her mom, over and over again but no answer. Doris 
           winces at every RED LIGHT, willing the car to move.  

           INT./EXT. WHITE STRETCH LIMO - LATER

           The limo is cruising along and suddenly stops. The driver 
           HONKS. Doris looks out the window and sees a hundred 
           protesters all holding CANDLES. They are silently marching. 

                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        I can’t get through-- 

                                 DORIS
                        That’s okay! We’re close enough!

           Doris opens her door and runs out. She is immediately 
           swallowed up by a sea of candles. She tries to weave through 
           the crowd. 

           Paul, holding a candle and marching in front of the crowd, 
           spots Doris running down the street toward Suncoast...

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Doris flies down the hall, a sparkling object in a somber 
           place. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris bursts through the door. 

                                 DORIS
                        Mom! Max, I’m so sorry! 

           Doris is blown back by the sight of her brother’s body with a 
           sheet over his face, she is too late. Oh, and his name was 
           MAX. 

           Kristine stands near his corpse, her eyes red from sobbing. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        No. He? No... 

           Doris looks around in shock. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Max, no. I’m so-- I’m sorry-- I 
                        wasn’t--

                                 KRISTINE
                        It’s okay, Doris. 
           Kristine steps toward her daughter. Doris lurches away from 
           her mom.

                                 DORIS
                        No-- no-- please!

           Doris flings herself on her brother’s covered body. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Please don’t be gone, Max? I’m 
                        sorry. I wasn’t here... You can’t 
                        leave me here by myself... Please? 
                        I need-- I need to talk to you--

                                 KRISTINE
                        It’s okay, baby, he can still hear 
                        you. He’ll always be with us.  

                                 DORIS
                        NO! Not like this! I love you. I 
                        love you so much! I don’t know why 
                        I wasn’t here. I’M SORRY! DON’T 
                        FUCKING LEAVE ME! PLEASE?!  

           Doris SCREAMS into Max’s chest. Kristine watches, crumbling. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        You shouldn’t’a been here. You 
                        shouldn’t’a been sick. You didn’t 
                        deserve this. You didn’t deserve 
                        any of this. I’m sorry. I’m so 
                        sorry. I was so awful to you-- I 
                        was so--  

           Doris pulls the sheet back and immediately regrets it. There 
           is no lonelier sight in this world than a body without its 
           soul.  

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God. No-- Please-- please 
                        come back. 

           Doris wraps her arms around his stiff neck and sobs into him. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        I love you. I promise I’ll be nice 
                        to you. I’ll make you brownies, I 
                        know you love them and I never make 
                        them for you, but I will-- I will-- 
                        And you can watch skateboarding 
                        videos all day. You can hold the 
                        remote. Please.  
           Kristine slowly approaches Doris and puts her hand on her 
           daughter’s back. Doris cries for a while, deep heaving sobs. 
           Eventually, she softens, her breath slows down. She pets 
           Max’s hardening face.    

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        We can climb the tangerine tree. 
                        Remember? You said the sweetest 
                        ones were at the top. But I was too 
                        scared to climb all the way up, so 
                        you did and you brought me the 
                        sweetest ones... There was white 
                        paint on the trunk. Remember? You 
                        told me it was turning white cause 
                        it was an old tree... 

           Doris laughs through tears. 

                                 DORIS (CONT’D (CONT'D)
                        And I believed you... I always 
                        believed you. I wish I could-- 
                        climb trees with you. I’m sorry, 
                        Max. I’m so sorry. 

           Doris stays glued to this body. Kristine stays glued to her 
           daughter. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris sits near Max’s body holding his cold hand as a MEDICAL 
           PROFESSIONAL talks to Kristine in a hushed, respectful voice. 
           Doris tunes in and out. 

                                 MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL
                        ... organ donation isn’t 
                        possible... the level that his 
                        cancer spread... some more 
                        paperwork to fill out... we’re all 
                        here for you...

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris and Kristine sit on the couch watching helplessly while 
           TWO SKETCHY MEN enter the room with a gurney. They lift Max 
           onto the gurney and begin zipping him into a BODY BAG. 

           Doris and Kristine clearly want to fight these men to the 
           death, instead they sit on the couch and watch their boy go 
           away forever.  
           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104  - LATER

           Doris and Kristine sit on the couch in a trance while Nurse 
           Irie and another ORDERLY strip the sheets on the bed and 
           remove Max’s medical equipment. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - ROOM 104 - LATER

           Doris and Kristine sit on the couch in a room that is now 
           prepped and ready for another deeply loved person to die in. 

           INT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - LOBBY - SUNRISE

           Kristine signs paperwork at the front desk while Doris hovers 
           nearby. She wears her mom’s hoodie over her gown. Doris looks 
           out the glass doors and sees Paul sitting on a curb. 

                                 DORIS
                        I’ll be outside, Mom.

                                 KRISTINE
                        Okay, sweetie. 

           Any ice between these two is officially thawed. Doris heads 
           outside. 

           EXT. SUNCOAST HOSPICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Doris approaches Paul. She sits on the curb next to him. 

                                 DORIS
                        Hey... 

                                 PAUL
                        Hey... 

           Paul lights a cigarette and offers one to Doris. Doris waves 
           it away, no, thank you. 

                                 DORIS
                        Where was everyone going? 

           Doris motions to the parking lot, empty for the first time.

                                 PAUL
                        City hall... They’re gonna sit 
                        outside until that piece of shit 
                        judge agrees to start feeding her 
                        again. 

           Doris knows the answer but asks anyway:
                                 DORIS
                        Why aren’t you with them? 

                                 PAUL
                        ... I wanted to make sure you were 
                        alright. 

                                 DORIS
                        He died. 

           Paul nods. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        And it feels just like you said. 

           Paul nods again. 

                                 DORIS (CONT'D)
                        But... no-- never mind. 

                                 PAUL
                        No, go on, what is it? 

                                 DORIS
                        ... It’s all about me, ya know? 
                        This pain I’m feeling. This like, 
                        sharp brutal pain. It’s all about 
                        me. I want him here. Selfishly. I-- 
                        I don’t want to be without him. But 
                        I think-- no-- I know he’s in a 
                        better place now. I know he’s 
                        happier. He’s free. I can feel it. 
                        And if Terri goes... she’ll be free 
                        too. And isn’t heaven like, what 
                        you guys believe in? Isn’t heaven 
                        supposed to be a lot better than 
                        this place? Better than being stuck 
                        in a bed anyway. It’s just-- life 
                        is meant for the living and death 
                        is meant for the dying and I don’t 
                        know, I can just feel it. I know 
                        it. I miss him. I hate this, but... 
                        he’s free.  

           Doris lets tears spill from her eyes. Paul wipes tears from 
           his own eyes. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’m very glad I met you, Doris... 
                        And thank fuckin’ God you’re not 
                        normal. 

           Doris laughs. Kristine approaches. 
                                 DORIS
                        Mom, this is Paul. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Hi. 

           Paul stands up and shakes her hand, meaningfully. 

                                 PAUL
                        It is truly an honor to meet you, 
                        ma’am. 

           Kristine looks confused, like she missed something, because 
           she did. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Um, thank you? 
                             (beat)
                        Okay, kiddo, you ready to go? 

           Doris stands up. 

                                 DORIS
                        Yeah. Goodbye, Paul. 

                                 PAUL
                        So long, my dear. 

           Doris and Paul hug for a long beat. Kristine looks so 
           confused. Doris and Kristine head toward Kristine’s truck. 

                                 KRISTINE
                        Who the hell was that? 

                                 DORIS
                        It’s a long story. 

           They reach the pick-up and look at each other for a beat.  

                                 KRISTINE
                        Well, what do we do now? 

           It is hard to tell if she means in the short term or the long 
           term. 

                                 DORIS
                        Can I drive? 

           Kristine smiles at her daughter for the first time in months.  

                                 KRISTINE
                        Yes. Yes, you can.  
           Doris flies into the driver’s seat and expertly arranges the 
           mirrors. Kristine gets in the passenger seat. We PULL OUT 
           WIDE as Doris backs out and Paul watches her drive away. 

                                 KRISTINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        When did you learn how to drive? 

           Doris pulls out of the parking lot and flies down the main 
           road as we FADE TO BLACK... 

           CHYRON: Dedicated to the memory of Max Kenneth Chinn.
