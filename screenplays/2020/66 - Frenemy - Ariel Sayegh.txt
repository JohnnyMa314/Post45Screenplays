         A lot of this shit happened.

         Most of it is on tape.
           FADE IN:

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - DAY, 2006

           An inferno of paparazzi. Cameras flash haphazardly.

           Under the strobing lights is LINDSAY LOHAN (20, clearly past 
           her Mean Girls glow and desperate for a friend.) She dodges 
           past the crowd to her car.

           INTERCUT WITH ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF THIS EVENT.

           SUPER: HOLLYWOOD, 2006

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Hey, Lindsay! You wearing underwear 
                        tonight, Lindsay?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        Partying with Paris tonight?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris is a cunt.

           Gasps. Lindsay casually slides into her BMW. As she stares 
           back at the cameras, a wicked grin overtakes her face.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        I’m sorry-- What did you say?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Just kidding!

           Lindsay hangs her greasy head out the tinted window. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I love Paris Hilton!

           Paparazzi thrust their hands into the car. Lindsay giggles. 
           Then panic floods over her face.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Why’s Paris a cunt?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (convincingly)
                        I never said that.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        We got it on tape.
                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Like when you wore the see-through 
                        top to the homeless shelter!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris is my friend.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Do you normally show up 5am and 
                        hide in your friends’ bushes?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        She’s my friend. I love her.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Sure, Lindsay. 

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        We’re your friends, too. 

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        Why won’t you smile for your 
                        friends?

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Just show us you love us, like you 
                        love Paris!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris is my friend. You’ll see.

           Lindsay drives away. Determination pierces her hangover.

                              INSERT TITLE CARD: FRENEMY

           INT. NICOLE RICHIE’S MANSION - NIGHT, 2004 

           SUPER: NICOLE RICHIE’S MANSION, TWO YEARS EARLIER

           A party. Everything is French-themed: there are balloon 
           Eiffel towers, macaroons, even drunk socialites wear berets. 

           Guests head into an elaborate:

           MOVIE THEATER

           A packed audience watches PARIS HILTON on all fours. A 
           dirtbag penetrates her in HD. The rich kids snicker. 
                                 RICH BITCH
                        Well, it is a French-themed party. 
                        And that’s definitely the most 
                        famous film about Paris.

                                 SLUT SHAMER
                        Skinny bitch’s got a wiiide pussy.

           A STILETTO FLYS over their heads and pierces the screen. It 
           hits the dirtbag’s groin. Dangles in front of his dick.

           All eyes turn to the real PARIS HILTON, (23, the cold, 
           calculated, 2000s style-icon.) 

           You’d think she’s too calm to be the culprit. If she weren’t 
           missing a pink Louboutin.

           Whispers ripple through the crowd. NICOLE RICHIE (22, the 
           Microsoft to Paris’ Apple) stands. The color drains from her 
           face. Paris shoots her a grin.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Nicki! I was wondering why I didn’t 
                        get an invite to your big party.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        It’s...not a big party.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Well, thought it’d be empty. Who’d 
                        show up to your shitty condo unless 
                        I was there?

           This house could make Gatsby feel poor.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Wait--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        As usual, everyone came to see me.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Paris, come back--

           Paris storms out to the:

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The pool is lined with gold and littered with alcohol. Rich 
           skanks give each other head under cabanas. 

           Nicole chases Paris outside.
                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                           (saccharine)
                        I just didn’t think you’d mind! Who 
                        makes a sex tape for no one to see?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I didn’t make it.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Don’t be humble. The title “One 
                        Night in Paris?” Brilliant. You’re 
                        the only one smart enough to come 
                        up with something so on-brand.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        We’re the same brand, Nicki. 

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        No, you’re waaaay more famous now. 
                        You don’t even need me.

           Realization strikes Paris.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s why you did this.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        What?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You want me to kick you off The 
                        Simple Life, don’t you? 

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        I would never--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Why? So you can play a hooker on 
                        CSI, maybe – if you’re lucky – 
                        overdose on SVU?

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        OMG, it was just a joke, Paris.

           Paris grabs a cocktail off a ledge and gulps it. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Why didn’t you just ask? You’re my 
                        friend.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                           (rolling her eyes)
                        Friend? You only have pets! 
           On cue, Paris’ Chihuahua, TINKERBELL, pops out of her Hermes 
           purse and Laps up booze.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE (CONT’D)
                        And, your pets...look at that 
                        thing, it’s a fucking accessory!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Tinkerbell is a her, not an it.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        It’s greasier than a slice of pizza 
                        before someone dabs it with a 
                        napkin.

           Paris is VERY insulted.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Well it’s a good thing I don’t need 
                        to be your friend to play her on 
                        TV. Unlike you, I actually can act.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Then act like you don’t know me. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Nicki--

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        I’m really sorry, Paris. I just 
                        don’t hang out with sluts.

           Tinkerbell vomits on Nicole, who screeches.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE (CONT’D)
                        My Juicy velour!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You were going to get vomit on it 
                        anyway, Nicki. Next time, I won’t 
                        be there to hold your hair back.

           She throws her glass into the pool and marches away.

                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        To recast you, bulimia for brains.
           EXT. CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT, 2004

           Lindsay (now, 17 and perfectly PG) finishes up a red carpet 
           interview. She glows in a knee-length dress and pearls.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I am so happy being able to play 
                        roles for people my age. Once you 
                        do something really mature there is 
                        no turning back. I’m just glad to 
                        be I’m so close with the rest of 
                        the cast...

           Behind her are the posters for 2004’s MEAN GIRLS plus RACHEL 
           McADAMS and AMANDA SEYFRIED, who no one cares about. Gosh, 
           why did they even get their names capitalized? 

                                 RACHEL MCADAMS
                           (whispering)
                        I’m just glad Lindsay’s people were 
                        freaked that playing the "mean 
                        girl" would screw her reputation.

                                 AMANDA SEYFRIED
                        Isn’t that Mommy and Daddy’s job?

           They snicker. Lindsay overhears. She speed-walks to a 
           HANDLER, embarrassed. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m ready, if that’s okay.

                                 HANDLER
                        Of course, Ms. Lohan.

           The HANDLER walks her to a row of roped off seats.

                                 HANDLER (CONT’D)
                        I hope this is enough for all of 
                        your friends!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        My mom’s only 5 minutes away!

           Lindsay grimaces.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           Lindsay grimaces on-screen. The audience is half-way through 
           MEAN GIRLS.
                                 GRETCHEN WEINERS
                           (onscreen)
                        Make sure you check out her mom's 
                        boob job. They're hard as rocks.

           The real Lindsay sits in an aisle of empty seats. Her real 
           eyes dart around the room, ashamed.

           Lacey Chabert (who plays Gretchen) mouths every line. The guy 
           who played hottie Aaron Samuels is getting handsy with 
           Damion, who played the fat gay kid with the pink shirt.

           Alone, Lindsay holds back tears. 

           I/E. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Surrounded by bodyguards, Paris ugly-cries. Her DRIVER lowers 
           the partition. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Do you need anything, Ms. Hilton?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        My best friend not to be a 
                        backstabbing bitch!

                                 DRIVER
                        Um...anything else?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        For you to fucking drive, Derek.

           The partition shoots up. Tinkerbell licks the heiress’ tears. 
           Paris cradles the pup as she snorts cocaine. 

           INT. BATHROOM, CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Lindsay walks in. Inside, a BRUNETTE snorts also cocaine. 

                                 BRUNETTE 
                        OMG! You’re like, I-- Freaky Friday 
                        fixed my relationship with my mom! 

                                 LINDSAY
                        Wow! That’s amazing.

           Lindsay pulls out her pink razor phone. There’s a text from 
           Wilmer <3. She calls him.

                                 BRUNETTE
                        OMG! I’m so rude. You want a line?
           Lindsay politely shakes her head no.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA (V.O.)
                        Hey Lindz.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Hey baby...

           She shuffles into a stall.

           I/E. CAR - NIGHT

           Lindsay’s boyfriend WILMER VALDERRAMA (24, the foreign 
           exchange student from THAT 70S SHOW) ALSO snorts cocaine. He 
           speaks in a breathy Venezuelan accent. 

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        When are you coming home, babe?

                                 LINDSAY
                        I don’t know how long the premiere 
                        will be. Your ticket’s in the glove 
                        box, in case you change your mind--

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        I’m not into chick flicks.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Totally, I get that.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        I can’t stop thinking about you.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Well, just come here and I will--

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        You come here.

                                 LINDSAY
                        What? 

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        You’re on the phone during the 
                        movie. It clearly bombed. Ashlee 
                        keeps texting me--

                                 LINDSAY
                        You said you hated the Simpsons.
                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        I meant the show. I’m giving up a 
                        lot for you Linz. You can’t spend 
                        an evening with me?

                                 LINDSAY
                        ...See you soon.

           She leaves the stall. The brunette gives her a pitying look. 

           EXT. LOBBY, CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT, 2004

           Lindsay leaves the bathroom. Movie’s over. It’s a smash.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER ONE
                        We wear pink on Wednesdays!

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER TWO
                        That’s so fetch!

           Reporters crowd Rachel, who stands beside her glowing mom.

                                 RACHEL MCADAMS
                        I’m just so glad to have such a 
                        supportive family that came out--

           This sight stabs Lindsay. She ducks through the theater. 
           Opens up a side door to the:

           EXT. RED CARPET, CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Devoted fans wait outside. The second the crowd spots 
           Lindsay, they hurl into a frenzy.

           Relieved Lindsay signs autographs. Crazed fans at grab her 
           hair, hands, dress, anything they can. 

           I/E. PARIS' LIMO - NIGHT

           Paris drives by the red carpet. The car slows in traffic. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What’s taking so long?

           She pulls down her window. Spots Lindsay in the clutches of 
           rabid fans.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Guys, not all at once!
                           (fans yank her hair)
                        OW! Thank you--
           The out of control admirers have all the control. Fans 
           trample down the protective guards and invade the red carpet.

           Watching how easily Lindsay is bossed around, a twinkle 
           swells in Paris’ heavily made-up eye. 

           EXT. RED CARPET, CHINESE THEATER - NIGHT

           Paris’ bodyguards charge through the crowd. One snatches 
           Lindsay. He carries her to a LIMO at the curb. 

           Tinkerbell trots on the ground. Another armed guard picks up 
           her shits with a Louis Vuitton pooper-scooper. 

           Paris rolls down her window. 

           Lindsay’s POV: A manicured finger beckons her to the car.

           I/E. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT, 2004

           Lindsay gets in. Paris extends a hand to her.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m Paris--

                                 LINDSAY
                        I know who you are.

           The car speeds away.

           in 2004) sits for an interview around her elaborately groomed 
           dogs. She knows her angles perfectly. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        It was my mistake. Not even Oprah 
                        could save Lindsay Lohan.

           also sits for an interview.

                        I wish I watched the movie. Then I 
                        would’ve recognized Regina George’s 
                        backseat.

                        I figured Paris could be like a big 
                        sister who taught me how to party. 
                        But I already had one. My mom.

           Oh yes, we’re interviewing DINA LOHAN (56, Long Island trash

                        Oh my god. You’re-- why are you 
                        here?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I was asking myself that. That’s 
                        why we’re leaving. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Wait, can you make a stop? My 
                        boyfriend is at the--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m not picking up the old dude 
                        from That 70s Show.

                        He’s only 24.

           Paris hands Lindsay a drink. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You legal?

                           (turning it down)

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Look at you, Disney kid. I remember 
                        when Britney was like that. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You know Britney Spears?!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Who doesn’t know Britney Spears?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        No-- I mean-- Are you guys friends?

                           (defensive)
                        Um, are you kidding? Of course! How 
                        could I not be? I thought you knew 
                        who I was.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        That’s so cool!

                        No, that’s hot.

                        Who else are you friends with?

           EXT. PARIS HILTON’S MANSION - NIGHT

           KIM KARDASHIAN (23, with significantly less plastic surgeries  
           and followers) carries shoe boxes to the limo.
           Lindsay gets out. A Gatsby-level party is raging.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN 
                        Paris, you didn’t tell me you were 
                        going out! I totally would’ve came 
                        to make sure the Olsens weren’t--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Shoes.

           Paris extends her feet (she’s still missing a stiletto from 
           the screening.) Kim gets on her knees and changes Paris’ 
           heels like a handmaid.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Those were your, uh, Manolos, 
                        right? I can call Jerry to go--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        You’re right. We can’t trust Jerry. 
                        I can go to the party and get them 
                        myself, so they’re in the hands of 
                        someone you trust, because everyone 
                        knows you trust me.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I need a car at Wilmer Diorama’s--

                                 LINDSAY
                        Valderrama--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        --house. Bring him here.
                           (to Lindsay)
                        Happy? 

           Lindsay nods in shock.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        That’s hot.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What did I say?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Sorry. That’s cool.

           There’s a moment of silence. Kim rushes back into the house. 
           Lindsay stares at her enormous butt.
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I asked my contractor to make my 
                        doorways smaller so her fat ass 
                        can’t fit through.

           INT. PARIS’ BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Paris leads Lindsay through the real life Barbie dream house. 
           An Olympic-size pool overlooks the beach. Teen queens in low-
           cut jeans and graphic tank-tops crowd the patio. 

           They pass by ASHLEE SIMPSON (21, emo for a rich pop star), 
           who fixes the eyeliner on Fall Out Boy’s PETE WENTZ (27, 
           every scene kid’s crush.)

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You know Ashlee, right?

           Lindsay nods, tense. 

                                 ASHLEE SIMPSON
                        Paris, we’re so hungry.

                                 PETE WENTZ
                        We have hunger. Can you hear it?

           He puts his ear to Ashlee’s stomach.

                                 ASHLEE SIMPSON
                        I want to be hearing Toxic. You 
                        said Britney was coming!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        She said she was coming.

                                 PETE WENTZ
                        Aren’t we all coming and going or 
                        going to be coming? 

                                 ASHLEE SIMPSON
                        We’re gonna dip.

                                 PETE WENTZ
                        Heh. Cumming.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Wait one second. It’ll be so hot. 
                           (to Lindsay)
                        Tell Kim we want Pizza. 

           Kim appears practically out of the bushes. 
                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I already called it, Paris. I’m 
                        always thinking about you, Paris. 
                        You know, Paris?

           Lindsay shifts her weight, uncomfortable. Paris rolls her 
           eyes. Suddenly, a gust of wind hits them.

                                 PETE WENTZ
                        MY BANGS! 

           A HELICOPTER flies in and airdrops pizza on parachutes. The 
           crowd chases the goods like kids after a broken piñata.

           Lindsay holds back with Kim.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Hey Kim, what’s the deal with Paris 
                        and Britney?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Paris really needs a BFF and she 
                        really wants it to be Britney. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        It doesn’t sound like Britney is 
                        all that reliable a friend.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        You don’t have to be when you’re a 
                        superstar.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Isn’t Paris one?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Well, Paris is famous.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        There’s a difference? 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Cause Britney’s a star, she can 
                        fuck up without being a fuck-up...I 
                        guess Paris is like that. Sort of. 
                        But not really.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        She’s famous because she fucked up. 

           Jolted by Kim’s assessment, Lindsay heads back to Paris.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Thank you so much for saving me.

           Paris taps haphazardly on her Blackberry.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what I’d have done 
                        without you!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Shhh...I gotta get a hold of 
                        Britney.

           Paris calls. She’s sent to voicemail. She calls again, 
           helpless. Desperate. Consumed. 

           Ignored, Lindsay goes into a silent panic. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You want me to get you some pizza?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do I look like I eat pizza?

           Lindsay grabs Paris’ phone.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a death wish?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You aren’t going to get Britney’s 
                        attention this way.

           Paris snatches back her Blackberry.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Shut up. You don’t know her.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Of course I know her. I am her. You 
                        said it yourself.

           Paris looks up.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m a traumatized Disney star cut 
                        from the same sequin cloth.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Yeah right.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Right? With Disney, you’re never 
                        right.

                        Mickey Mouse wouldn’t let me get a 
                        cat because I’m “a hamster person!”

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Britney went through that?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Worse, I’m sure.  

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Okay. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Okay?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Spill. What do I need to know?

           Lindsay glows.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Brit never chose her clothes 
                        growing up. The thought of getting 
                        dressed alone probably gives her 
                        the runs. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you dress yourself?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You think I picked this out?

           Paris takes in Lindsay’s dress. It’s so sweet...the last 
           thing a horny 17-year-old starlet wants to look like.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Perfect. I’ll get her the best  
                        stylist in North America!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What? No. You’re Paris Hilton. 
                        Everyone wants to be styled by you. 

           Paris likes hearing this. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You hear that Nicole?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        My god, is she here too?!
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No. She’s never coming here again. 
                        Unless she sneaks in with the dogs. 
                        Think Britney likes dogs?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I dunno. Dogs are a luxury. Like 
                        vacations. Halloween, Christmas, 
                        Amusement Parks, camping...that’s 
                        for unemployed kids. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Wait, you’ve never been camping?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’ve been on 9-5 since I was three.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        If I’m going to be seen with you, 
                        you need to be able to act normal.
                           (calling out to the pilot)
                        Ravi, how much gas is left?

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - DAWN

           In a helicopter, Lindsay and Paris fly through the trees. 

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Rustic nature views are in every direction. Lindsay sits with 
           a live BABY BEAR crawling in her lap. 

           Paris roasts a marshmallow in the fire place.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Look, you don’t need to make up for 
                        my non-existent childhood.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No, your parents do. What do they 
                        do, anyway?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Well, my dad’s in finance. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. JAIL - NIGHT

           Lindsay’s dad, MICHAEL LOHAN (40, douchebag) masturbates to a 
           Calvin Klein ad. His CELL MATE peers over.
           Title Card: Michael Lohan, Lindsay’s (Alleged) Father

                                 CELL MATE
                        Isn’t that your daughter?

                                 MICHAEL LOHAN
                        I’m looking at the other one!

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

           INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        So, are you like your Dad? Break 
                        any laws lately?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...Well, not...lately. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I knew you were no Britney. She 
                        snorts her coffee because it takes 
                        less time than drinking it. 

           Paris loses interest. She turns on the TV. Lindsay squirms, 
           desperate to keep Paris interested.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Well, actually...I broke into a 
                        sound stage once after hours with 
                        this producer--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        KINKY! What did he look like?

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay’s eyes are bloodshot.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        He wasn’t cute but he told me I was 
                        and that was enough.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        What did you guys do?
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Listen, Vice ranked every famous 
                        dick I’ve sucked. This didn’t even 
                        make the list.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Is that what happened?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        No. I-- I didn’t-- It was my first 
                        time.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        How old were you?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        How about him?

           Lindsay sips her water.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What am I supposed to say? Some old 
                        rich guy did something shitty to me 
                        and it’s fucked me up for life? 
                        Congrats, you’ve met an actress.

           BACK TO THE CABIN:

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s not funny, Lindsay.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        It’s not like it was rape or 
                        anything.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s almost worse.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Not worse, but, like, there’s no 
                        word for it-- Sometimes I wish that 
                        stuff had a gross name like rape. 
                        That way people would know how 
                        fucked up it is.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris can we--
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You know what happens instead? 
                        Everyone blames you for “letting 
                        some asshole take advantage of you” 
                        like you were supposed to fucking 
                        know! And then...and THEN--

           Paris catches her breath. A baby bear swats at Tinkerbell. 
           She growls back. The bear scuttles away.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...I’ve never seen the sex tape.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Quit sucking up. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t like liars. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I don’t lie to my friends.

           The air is tender. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (wiping her mascara)
                        Well, you also don’t make a sex 
                        tape for nobody to see, right?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m nobody. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No...You’re not nobody anymore. Not 
                        with me.
                           (looking at a clock)
                        Shit, we’re late!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        For what?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Your bat mitzvah.

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT 

           The cast of Fiddler on the Roof does an elaborate dance 
           routine at the entrance of the temple. A bald, irritated old 
           man sits at the podium by the Torah.
           Paris hands Lindsay a prayer book.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Paris, I’m not Jewish.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Aren’t you from New York?

           The two are lifted onto chairs, encircled by the hora. 
           Everyone raises glasses.

                                                    CUT TO MONTAGE:

           - THEY DRINK ON A PRIVATE PLANE
           - THEY CRY IN A CLUB
           - THEY VOMIT IN A VIP SECTION, EACH HOLDING EACH OTHER’S HAIR

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (sobbing and puking)
                        Paris, you’re the best friend I’ve 
                        ever had!

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - NIGHT

           Lindsay lays her head in Paris’ lap. Tinkerbell sleeps in 
           hers. She’s on the phone with Wilmer.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m sorry, Wilmer-- I told you we 
                        were having a girl’s night.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA (O.S.)
                        Well, I love girls.

           Lindsay gets another call from her AGENT. She hesitates. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Baby, I need you to hang up.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA (O.S.)
                        Why?
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Because you told me that it’s 
                        disrespectful to your manhood when 
                        I hang up first.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA (O.S.)
                        No, I said that Ashlee wouldn’t 
                        disrespect my manhood by--

           Paris grabs the phone, hangs up on him, and answers the call. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Have fun at the senior citizen

                           (taking the call)
                        Yeah, she’s right here!

           Lindsay takes her hot pink razor.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Hello?

                                 AGENT (O.S.)
                        Your co-star Meryl Streep’s gonna 
                        need more enthusiasm.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What? WHAT!

                                 AGENT (O.S.)
                        Rob Altman called. You’re his Lola! 

           Looking at her phone, Paris SQUEALS.

                                 AGENT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        How could he not cast you? You’re 
                        on the cover of the New York Post 
                        every three days. Whatever you do, 
                        keep doing it in public and as 
                        drunk as possible, you hear me?

           The call ends. Lindsay presses the phone to her chest, in 
           bliss. Paris is beaming.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Can you believe it?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No, I can’t.
           She holds up HER phone. On it is a text from Britney-- 
           Hey bitch. Need help picking a dress 4 Grammys. U down?

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        You, Lindsay Lohan, are a fucking 
                        genius. Britney hasn’t picked out a 
                        dress since she was seven, just 
                        like you said. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Oh...that’s amazing, Paris. I’m so 
                        happy for you. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Me too!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’ll miss you so much when I’m 
                        shooting in Atlanta--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        OMG, what if we wear matching 
                        snakeskin? US Weekly will--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Mom, I don’t need a drink. I need a 
                        break. It’s been months since I’ve 
                        seen someone my age and if I have 
                        to learn another script I’ll--

                                 DINA LOHAN
                        If ya don’t want the part, I’ll 
                        call Fox. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re kidding. 

                                 DINA LOHAN
                        Of course not. There’s nothing I 
                        won’t do for ya, Linz. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        OMG, thank you so much mom--

                                 DINA LOHAN
                        I’ve already given up my career, 
                        not just an ordinary one, but as a 
                        Radio City Hall Rockette. I’ve 
                        neglected my husband and other 
                        children, who don’t even know who I 
                        am. So, what’s another 7 million 
                        dollars?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (pleading)
                        Mama...I love you.

                                 DINA LOHAN
                        I love ya, too. Would I give ya all 
                        this attention if I didn’t?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...I need some alone time to 
                        rehearse.

                        TOMMY! Whatever my baby needs, ya 
                        get.

           TOMMY (21, and the only assistant fucked up enough for this 
           gig) stands at attention as Dina leaves.

                        her sober.

           INT. LINDSAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Tommy lays out a line for Lindsay, who lays out her scripts.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You really think this will work?

                                 TOMMY
                        Bitch, with enough of this, you’ll 
                        memorize scripts that haven’t even 
                        been written yet.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Trust me, this part isn’t even 
                        written. I’ve done Disney Channel 
                        originals with more mature themes.

           She hovers over the cocaine. Could she really?

                                 TOMMY
                        Paris does it all the time.

           Lindsay recovers in bed. There are no cards or signs of 
           visitors. Her face is puffy from crying.

           YAP! YAP! Like a tiny deity, Tinkerbell appears. Paris

           Paris climbs into the hospital bed. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN

                        is suing her for $3 million in

           even a shot) of vodka, which she downs. 

           Paris gets drunk Lindsay to skinny-dip.

           Back at the pier, trashed Lindsay climbs out of the boat. 
           PAPARAZZI snap photos of her crotch. Where’s her undies?

                        back-up dancer?

           Britney ignores Paris. Instead she flirts with her new 
           boyfriend KEVIN FEDERLINE (30, white trash, durag-included.) 

           Paris tries to get Britney’s attention. Kevin blows 
           raspberries on her exposed belly button.

           When it’s time to go on stage, Dina is passed out cold. 

           Paris gives Lindsay a hug. Fixes her hair. Pushes up her 
           boobs. Sends her off to perform.

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           After the show, Dina dances in a stripper cage. She motions 
           for Lindsay to join in. Wilmer dances too closely to Paris.

                        All I was saying is that I think a 
                        threesome would bring us closer 
                        together...

           To get away from Wilmer, Paris dances up on:
           Title: STAVROS NIARCHOS (20s, the preppy asshole grandson of 
           a Greek shipping tycoon.) 

           They make out. Meanwhile, one of Dina’s breasts falls out of 
           her shirt. Lindsay tries to help Dina, who shoves her. Hard. 

           Everyone stares. Then sneers.

           Holding back tears, Lindsay downs every drink she can find.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           Lindsay shows up to set. She’s obviously beyond late. 
           Producers scowl. 

                                 PRODUCER (VOICEMAIL)
                        Since the commencement of principal 
                        photography of Georgia Rule, you’ve 
                        failed to arrive on time to set. 

           However, JANE FONDA and FELICITY HUFFMAN, who are ready to 
           go, look at Lindsay with kind eyes.

           EXT. PROTEST - DAY, 2020

           JANE FONDA (now, 81 and mid-protest) talks to camera while 
           getting arrested. 
           Title: Jane Fonda, Lindsay’s GEORGIA RULE Co-Star
                                 JANE FONDA
                        When Lindsay was there, she was 
                        fully there.

           She gives a cop the finger. 

                                 JANE FONDA (CONT’D)
                        She draws on her emotions like no 
                        actress I’ve ever seen.

           Subtitle: This is a real quote.

           INT. JAIL CELL - DAY, 2020

           FELICITY HUFFMAN (56, grim) gets her mushy prison lunch in 
           her fresh yellow jumpsuit. 
           Title: Felicity Huffman, Another Co-Star

                                 FELICITY HUFFMAN 
                        I think she’s phenomenally 
                        talented. She’s fantastic in the 
                        movie, and she’s a complete delight 
                        to be with. So I love her.

           INT. LINDSAY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT, 2006

           Lindsay sits on the toilet and listens to her voicemail. 
           She’s dressed for the red carpet.

                                 AGENT (VOICEMAIL)
                        Sorry, Lindz. It’s just not about 
                        talent.

           She takes a swig of a vodka bottle.

                                 AGENT (VOICEMAIL) (CONT’D)
                        Georgia Rule and Just My Luck just 
                        didn’t do well enough for 
                        Universal. They’re going with 
                        Hilary Du--

           Lindsay cuts off the message. She calls her mom. No answer. 
           She calls Paris. None either. 

           She looks hard in the mirror. Tries to fix up her smeared 
           makeup. Pins back a few of her stray hairs.

           Then, Lindsay PULLS OFF HER PANTIES. 

           She gags a little in the sink.
           EXT. RED CARPET - NIGHT

           Lindsay clumsily gets out of her limo backseat. Everyone can 
           see her bare crotch.

           The paparazzi squeal and shower her in photographs. 

           Lindsay inhales the attention like a line of cocaine. She 
           blows her friends a kiss. 

           INT. WEALTHY HILLBILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Britney and Kevin smooch at a last-minute altar.

                        Lindsay, she didn’t even invite me 
                        to her wedding. This is the second 
                        time this happened this year and--

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - NIGHT

           Paris sobs. She watches TMZ, which airs Britney’s wedding 
           party leave the affair. 

           They wear Juicy sweatsuits that read “MAIDS” and “PIMPS.”

           INTERCUT WITH ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF THIS SHIT.

           Lindsay comes over with ice cream. Paris sobs in her arms. 
           Lindsay is more consoled by this than Paris. 

           They eat the ice cream and snort a snowman of cocaine. 

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY

           The next morning. Lindsay wakes up with her head inside the 
           empty ice cream tub. She’s a mess. Paris is gone. 

           Deflated, Lindsay pulls on one of Paris’ microscopic dresses.

           INT. STAGE - DAY

           Lindsay goes up to accept a Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award. 
           Her borrowed dress hikes up. She moons a crowd of children.

           INSERT FOOTAGE OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, TOO.

                        Me. It’s not you. It’s me.

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - NIGHT

           Lindsay barges in. She’s lost 15 lbs and aged 5 years. 
           Tinkerbell YELPS at her.

           Paris grooms her new pet pig. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What the hell?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Wilmer...he--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Smells like cheap axe? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris...he left me!

           She bursts into tears.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Oh... 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Oh?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Oh...sorry?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris, he’s the love of my life. 
                        You gotta help me get him back 
                        before Ashlee-- 

           Paris puts down the pig and grabs Lindsay’s shoulders.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay, that creep is 
                        embarrassing.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Maybe for you. But no one else 
                        would be seen with me.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I will. Eventually, maybe Britney 
                        will too.

           Lindsay sniffles, hopeful.
                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        As soon as I get back from my book 
                        tour we can--

           Lindsay’s face drops.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        That’s not enough.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I need...love. You don’t know what 
                        it’s like to be in a relationship. 
                        If you did, you’d understand.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’ve dated more guys than you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Sure, dated. But you’ve never had 
                        something as serious as Wilmer and 
                        I do.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        At least I can afford underwear.

           Lindsay storms off. She then comes back and steals the pig.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Do not get back with him!

           EXT. WILMER VALDERAMMA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wilmer leaves his mansion. Bodyguards barricade his car.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        I didn’t hire you.

           He unlocks his Mercedes. The bodyguard shakes his head.

                                 BODYGUARD
                        If you’re going to contact Ms. 
                        Lohan, I suggest getting back into 
                        your home.

                                 WILMER VALDERRAMA
                        Okay, prank’s over.

           He reaches for the door and the Bodyguard SNAPS off the 
           handle. Wilmer backs away.
           INT. WILMER’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT, 2020

           The walls are lined with snapshots of Wilmer with Demi 
           Lovato, Mandy Moore, and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Wilmer, in a 
           recliner, takes a sip of his drink.

                        No one said taking Disney stars’ 
                        virginities was an easy calling.

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - NIGHT, 2005

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (on the phone)
                        Thanks, Diego. I don’t think you 
                        need to slash his tires, but do it 
                        just for fun.

           I/E. LINDSAY’S CAR/SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

           CU on Lindsay’s tires, which move at a glacial speed. 

           Paparazzi cars blockade her path. Some get out to take 
           photos. She smiles and theatrically HONKS. 

           It...works.

           The car in front of her moves. Just as she’s about to drive 
           away, she sees it pull up in front of and block another 
           clearly famous person’s car. 

           Not any famous person. The most famous person.

           It’s Britney, bitch.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                           (rolling down her window)
                        Guys-- guys-- I have to pee like a 
                        pregnant horse. 

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Pee on me, Britney!!

           The cameramen swarm like teenage girls to their first push-up 
           bra. Britney glows under camera light.

           Entranced, Lindsay lets go of her brake.

           BUMP! She smacks her car into the van blocking Britney. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        SHIT!

           Stunned, the cameramen snap photos of Lindsay again, who 
           basks in the flashing lights. 

           Britney sprints into Lindsay’s passenger seat. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)

                        I’ll get another one. Just get me 
                        to a can!

           They speed away. 

           INT. LINDSAY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lindsay paces back and forth. We hear the WHIZZZZZ of a pop 
           princess urinating. 

           IN THE BATHROOM 

           Britney sighs with relief. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Thanks for saving my bladder! I 
                        can’t believe you’d do that for 
                        someone you don’t even know.

                        You know that feeling when you hold 
                        your pee in so long that when you 
                        finally go, it feels better than 
                        being fucked?

                        How does K-Fed feel about that?

           Britney rolls her eyes.

                        He feels weird about having sex

           Britney pulls up her pants.

                        I wish. Speaking of motherfuckers, 
                        I can’t believe Wilmer hasn’t 
                        begged for you to come back.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I get it. You have a baby--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Meh. Olga has a baby. It’s 
                        just...I’ve done the whole power 
                        couple thing. Every time I got 
                        something shiny he didn’t, he 
                        pissed himself and cried. Talk 
                        about an a infant.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but 
                        you peed a little on my car seat.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        So? I’m sure that’s not a first for 
                        your BMW. I’ve seen you party. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Not up close. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        OMG! Let’s fix that. 

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Britney sips a shot glass out of Lindsay’s cleavage. They’re 
           so drunk they don’t see people filming them on their phones.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Where have you been all my life?!?

                        LONG ISLAND, MOSTLY!

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Now, Lindsay’s breasts are faker yet somehow saggier.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        That’s when she asked me to be her 
                        date at the Grammys. 

           She takes a drag of a cigarette.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        Cunt. 
           INT. CLUB - NIGHT 

           Lindsay and Britney flop in drunken bliss. 

           But all eyes are on Brit. Everyone’s desperate to dance with 
           or at least near her. 

           Lindsay is acutely aware of this. She drinks. And drinks. And 
           snorts. Until she pathetically grinds against a chair.

           Then, a man notices her. Finally. 

           Flip phones remain up as Lindsay makes out with STAVROS. 

           INT. NAIL SALON - DAY

           The next day. Paris reads a story about herself and Stavros 
           in a tabloid while getting a pedicure. 

           BUZZ. A Text:

           You won’t believe who Lindsay was with last night.

           Paris gets a VIDEO MESSAGE.

           She slams the phone down and shoves off the manicurist. 

           She glances back down at her phone, outraged.

           ONSCREEN: It’s Lindsay & Britney dancing like BFFs. 

           Paris stands. This is war.

           INT. STAVROS’ BED - DAY

           Lindsay wakes up undressed and next to Stavros. Her eyes make 
           it clear she has no clue how she got there. Stavros reaches 
           for her chest.

                                 STAVROS
                        I can’t believe these are real--

           Lindsay jolts away.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Get the fuck off me.

                                 STAVROS
                        Sorry, the fuck already happened 
                        inside you. BOOM, ROASTED!

           Trembling, Lindsay shoves him off. Throws on her party dress. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (peering out the window)
                        I don’t see any paparazzi.

                                 STAVROS
                        You want me to call some?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You kidding? You’re Paris’ 
                        boyfriend!

                                 STAVROS
                        She’s friends with a lot a boys.

           He gets up and kisses her neckline from behind. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Shit. SHIT! This never happened, 
                        you hear me?

                                 STAVROS
                        What’s your problem? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You! Obviously.

                                 STAVROS
                        Well, you’re a bitch in morning. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        And you’re a mistake.

           She hightails out of there.

           EXT. SNOOTY STREET - DAY

           Lindsay hobbles to the curb, whining into her phone.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Yeah, okay. I get that you quit. 
                        But could you just grab me--

           The phone cuts off. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)

           INT. THE POLO LOUNGE - DAY

           A restaurant with tables reserved just to make sure non-
           famous people don’t sit there. 

           Tommy (the drug-delivering assistant from before) brushes 
           Tinkerbell while talking on the phone.

                                 TOMMY
                        I don’t work for you anymore,

                        Apparently no one works for me 
                        anymore. What the hell is going on?

                        Why? 

           EXT. THE POLO LOUNGE - DAY

           Lindsay, after wobbling there on foot, walks inside. The HOST 
           (40s, beefy but very flamboyant) pulls her back.

                        I think “Lindsay Lohan thrown out

                        headline. Honestly, the monkey that

                        Oh. Tinkerbell, right?

           The bouncer considers and then lets Lindsay pass.

           INT. THE POLO LOUNGE - DAY

           Lindsay shuffles to the Paris’ heavily guarded table. Paris 
           spots her and nods. Her bodyguard blockades Lindsay. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris, just let me explain.

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Miss Hilton requests that you leave 
                        the premises.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Please. 

           He stares back at her, dead eyed.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                           (whimpering)
                        Can you just tell her I was blacked 
                        out and had no idea it was Stavros? 

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Miss Hilton is not looking for an 
                        explanation, she would like you...
                           (checks notes)
                        To have a painful cyst seal your 
                        freckled ass cheeks together.

           Lindsay’s face cracks like a plate. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris! Please, Britney just invited 
                        me to the Grammys and I need you--

           Paris sits up straight. She glides over to Lindsay.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I misheard you. What did you say? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I ran into Britney. We really hit 
                        it off so now she wants to take me 
                        to the Grammys as a fuck you to 
                        Kevin. I’m going to put in a good 
                        word for you so--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t need the praise of a 22-
                        year-old has-been.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I deserve that. You’re my best 
                        friend and what I did was...I 
                        didn’t even know I was doing it. 

           Paris rolls her eyes.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        Stavros found me so wasted--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I always felt bad for you. But my 
                        pity is reserved for cute animals. 
                        Skunks, not skanks.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I-- I didn’t-- fuck you.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Actually, you fucked my boyfriend 
                        instead.

           She walks off.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris, please. You... you said-- I 
                        can’t be nobody again--

           Paris looks back at Lindsay, incensed. The bodyguard drags 
           Lindsay away.

                                 TOMMY
                        Didn’t you dump Stavros because his 
                        dick smelled like shakshuka?
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m just giving her enough rope to 
                        hang herself.

           EXT. THE POLO LOUNGE - DAY

           Lindsay walks to the curb. She holds her stomach. Gags. 

           INT. HYDE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Paris cozies up next to BRANDON DAVIS (26, has enough oil in 
           his hair to join OPEC, which is ironic because he is the 
           grandson of an oil tycoon.) 

           She looks up at him through her fake eyelashes. Brandon 
           laughs. Presses a finger to her lips.

           INT. YACHT - DAY, 2020

           Brandon Davis (now 40 and still wearing Ed Hardy) has an 
           Instagram model on his lap.

                        I’m not some misogynist. Lindsay 
                        Lohan is just a bitch who can’t 
                        take a joke!

           EXT. HYDE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT, 2005

           THIS IS REAL FUCKING FOOTAGE. INTERCUT IT AS NEEDED.

           A swarm of PAPARAZZI stampede after Brandon. He’s sandwiched 
           between Paris and her sister.  

           Hiding behind her Blackberry, Paris whispers to Brandon and 
           giggles. He takes a drag of his cigarette. 

                                 BRANDON DAVIS
                        Lindsay Lohan has the stinkiest, 
                        fucking sweaty, orange vagina 
                        anyone has ever seen. 

           Paris doubles over in laughter.

                        I haven’t seen it. She wants me to 
                        see it, but it shits out freckles.
           A HONK of a laugh escapes from Paris. She skips forward. 
           Hysterically cackles as security guards rush her ahead.

           Paris’ PR man, ELLIOTT MINTZ (40s, would be a personal injury 
           lawyer if not doing this) hovers ahead.

                        It is unfair to characterize 
                        Brandon's statements as being 
                        reflective of Paris' feelings about 
                        Lindsay.

           INTERCUT HIM INTO THIS MESS, TOO.

           EXT. HYDE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT, 2005

           We jump cut between insults, excuses, and Paris snickering.

                                 BRANDON DAVIS
                        Lindsay tastes like my Turkish 
                        father’s ass. 

           Snicker.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        We're dealing with two different 
                        people.

                                 BRANDON DAVIS
                        Lindsay Lohan’s clitoris is 7-feet 
                        long!

           Snicker.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        I’m sure it’s nothing personal.

                                 BRANDON DAVIS
                        I hear she’s worth about 7 million, 
                        which means she’s really poor. It’s 
                        disgusting.

           Snicker.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        It was BRANDON who was speaking.
           Snicker.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ (CONT’D)
                        Of course there are moments when 
                        Paris was laughing, but she never 
                        said anything.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Paris, are you and Lindsay still 
                        friends?

                                 BRANDON DAVIS
                        Yeah, really good friends.

           Snicker.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Would you like to say anything 
                        about Lindsay, Paris?

           Brandon leans over and kisses Paris on the cheek. 

           INT. LINDSAY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

                                 PARIS HILTON (O.S.)
                        I love you, Brandon.

           Lindsay wipes her tears as she watches the paparazzi tape. 

           She wets her razor and takes it to her crotch.

           INT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE - DAY

           The next morning. The paparazzi swarm like never before.

           Lindsay peers out of the curtains. She’s blinded by flashes. 

           Buzzzzzz. Lindsay picks up her phone.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (O.S.)
                        I’d love to see you, but I can’t 
                        wait any longer!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        They won’t let me leave! Any chance 
                        you could come here?

           I/E. BRITNEY’S CAR - DAY

           Britney drives with her baby in her lap. He’s dressed like a 
           pimp who isn’t making a lot of money.
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You don’t fly in a giraffe to get 
                        people out of your petting zoo.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (O.S.)
                        I’ve had this on my calendar for 
                        weeks! Just go to the cafe. I’ll 
                        find a way to get there. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Fiiiine. 

           She hangs up. Feeds gummy worms to herself and the baby.

           I/E. PARIS’ LIMO - DAY

           Paris sits next to Tommy, dressed to kill.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Are you sure this is the place?

           Tommy examines LINDSAY’S CALENDAR, which is loaded on his 
           bedazzled hot pink razor.

                                 TOMMY
                        It says so right here in her 
                        calendar. Unless this is part of a 
                        plot. What if our plot is part of 
                        her plot? DRAMA!

           Paris gets out of the car to a cafe. She spots Britney 
           waiting for Lindsay, and smirks.

           INT. LINDSAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lindsay needs a shower, badly. It’s clear she hasn’t left the 
           house in days. She’s on the phone.

                                 DINA (V.O.)
                        Sorry Lindsay, Ali’s working on her 
                        Christmas album. I just don’t have 
                        time for ya drama. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Just come by for an hour? Please?

                                 DINA (V.O.)
                        Call ya Dad. He’s got time.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You can’t call an inmate. They have 
                        to call you!
                                 DINA (V.O.)
                        It’s like showbiz! Ya can figure it 
                        out, kiddo.

           Lindsay dials Paris. The number is disconnected. Shit.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay continues her confessional.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I needed to reach Paris somehow.

           INT. DA SILVANO RESTAURANT - DAY

           Upscale, unlike Lindsay, who sits in front of a ELLE REPORTER 
           (30s, a stylish vulture) in a wife-beater and a microscopic 
           pair of Limited Too denim shorts. 

           INT. ELLE MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY, 2020

           The Elle Reporter has pictures of the Kardashians plastered 
           all over her desk.

                                 ELLE REPORTER 
                        Lindsay needed a good manicure and 
                        an even better therapist.

           INT. DA SILVANO RESTURANT - DAY, 2006

           Lindsay eats a cucumber. That’s it.

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        It seems that when somebody famous 
                        starts dating someone unknown, 
                        there's an immediate feeding frenzy 
                        among young Hollywood girls.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Um yeah, they’re like vultures!

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        Those Greek shipping heirs, for 
                        example, seem to be popular now. I 
                        wonder....

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You mean Stavros?

           The reporter shrugs. Of course that’s who she means.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        He's not being fought over. I would 
                        never fight with a girl over a guy. 

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        Then why did Paris--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        They say I date all these people, 
                        that I’m a slut. But I would never 
                        steal anyone's boyfriend.

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        Can you really deny that men who 
                        are dating are more appealing than 
                        available guys? Don't you think....

           Lohan glances outside and notices that the paparazzi are 
           shoving mammoth lenses on the windows.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Sorry, they’re so distracting.

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        Wanna move to a table in the back? 
                        They can’t photograph you there.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (adjusting her shirt)
                        No...I can handle it.

           CUT TO ELLE MAGAZINE OFFICE:

                                 ELLE REPORTER
                        She fucking needed it.

           BACK TO RESTURANT:

                                 ELLE REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        This Brandon Davis video....

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I still have not seen it. I will 
                        never see it. 

           She sips her wine.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        But obviously, Paris' very 
                        comfortable making videos.
           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

           Paris rolls her eyes.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay wanted me to call up and 
                        yell at her.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Did you?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I was too busy getting ready for 
                        the Grammys with Britney to care. 

           She smirks, proud of her answer. We wait a beat too long, and 
           see doubt crawl onto her face.

           EXT. SET OF BOBBY (2006) - DAY

           Lindsay radiates in her 1960s costume. She’s in the middle of 
           a scene. ELIJAH WOOD (25 and not a leading man yet) co-stars 
           but all are eyes on Lindsay, who dazzles.

                                 ELIJAH WOOD
                        I can’t help but think I’m taking 
                        something away from you. Something 
                        sacred...

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Look, I’m okay with this.
                           (darting to his arms)
                        I’m okay with it. In my heart and 
                        in my head. And you’re not talking 
                        anything away from me. This is my 
                        choice--

                                 DIRECTOR
                        CUT!

           Lindsay drops, deflated.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Is something wrong?

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Yes. Elijah, you need to keep up. 

           Lindsay glows.

                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Linz, you go grab some food. You 
                        look like you can use a sandwich.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Oh, thank you.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        No. Thank you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (whispering)
                        ...I can’t wait for people to see 
                        what we’re making.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Oh, honey. If you wanted people to 
                        see you on screen, you shoulda kept 
                        workin’ with talking cars.

           Lindsay grimaces and flutters away. She dips into the:

           CRAFTY TENT

           Lindsay doesn’t eat. Instead, she sips a wine too expensive 
           for a screenwriter to know off the top of her head. 

           A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT gives her a phone. 

                                 PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
                        You have a text, Ms. Lohan. 

           Lindsay reads.

           This is an automated message from Chase Bank to let you know 
           your balance is below your designated $75.

           The PA holds back laughter.Lindsay downs her drink. She peers 
           at the TV. E! News is on.

           A picture of Paris and Nicole pops up on the screen. Lindsay 
           turns up the volume.

                                 E! NEWS
                        While Paris and Nicole feud, 
                        producers are scrambling to save 
                        the new season of The Simple Life. 
                        The girls refuse to shoot together. 
                        Sources close to Hilton say she’s 
                        on the search for a new cast-mate 
                        who will make her life more simple.

           INT. NICOLE RICHIE'S KITCHEN - DAY, 2020

           Nicole Richie (now 37 and a mom) packs gluten-free lunches.
           Title: Nicole Richie, Paris’ Former Best Friend
                                 NICOLE RICHIE
                        Lindsay and I used to be on this no 
                        solid food diet together, so she 
                        gave me a call. She asked me to do 
                        the show with her instead of Paris.

           INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT, 2006

           Lindsay waits. Chews on ice. In the darkness, she spots a 
           blonde starlet strut to the table. 

           Nicole--no, prettier-- taller-- PARIS.

           Lindsay freezes as Paris sits down. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (ordering)
                        One Cosmo. She’ll have water.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris...I--how are you?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Aren’t you waiting for someone very 
                        important?

           Lindsay quivers.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        I have to thank you, Nicole and I 
                        haven’t spoken in so long. Who knew 
                        you’d bring us back together?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What do you want?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I have what I want. This is about 
                        what you want. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I was just throwing around an idea.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        It’s a brilliant one. You, replace 
                        me on my show? Genius. The new 
                        blood would really amp up the 
                        viewers. Plus, you’d have no 
                        problem shooting with Nicole.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...I could use a new friend, okay? 
                        Nicole could be--
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You think Nicole could be anyone’s 
                        friend? Look what she did to--
                           (collecting herself)
                        Nicole didn’t tell me about your 
                        little scheme because she likes me. 
                        It’s because she hates poor bitches 
                        like you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You use that word like you know 
                        what it means.
                           (off Paris’ look)
                        I can barely pay people to hang out 
                        with me anymore. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Who’s fault is that? Try showing up 
                        to set instead of partying.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You party all the time.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Because it’s my job. Apparently 
                        yours is stealing people who don’t 
                        belong to you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...You’re right. What I did with 
                        Stavros was so fucked up, but I was 
                        FUCKED UP. I don’t even remember 
                        what happened, I just woke up the 
                        next morning and got the hell out. 
                        You-- you-- I--

           Lindsay whimpers. Paris spritzes her with branded perfume.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Don’t do that.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What do you want me to do? 

           Paris doesn’t have an answer.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I at least apologize? I’m 
                        sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m everything 
                        they write about me. I’m a whore--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t need that.
           She hands Lindsay a napkin.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Stavros is a whore, not you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What do you mean? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I can’t stand that idiot. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        But all of this--

           She motions between the two of them.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You’re the one who said a boy 
                        wasn’t worth being fought over.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...Then why are we fighting?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Come on. 
                           (off Lindsay’s shock)
                        You know what Britney means to me. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You just swooped in and charmed--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        No, what? As in, are you serious? 
                        You ruined my life cause I hung out 
                        with Britney Spears without you?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You got in close so you could take 
                        your best shot at me. Like everyone 
                        else in this fucked up town.

           The waiter delivers Paris’ Cosmo. She takes a long sip. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Too bad you missed.

           Lindsay stares in disbelief. Paris pets Tinkerbell. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Just so you know, I’m doing Season 

                                 (MORE)
                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Then Britney is taking me to the 
                        Grammys. We’re better friends than 
                        you and I ever were.

           Lindsay sneers.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Because she knows SO much about 
                        you.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        And you do?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Now who’s playing dumb? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        This was an arrangement. I 
                        got...too generous. Your job was to 
                        get me close to Britney. Now I am, 
                        just like you promised.

           Lindsay stands.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Promise me something?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Like what?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Remember when you told me that the 
                        second it hurts when I pee, I need 
                        to see a doctor? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        God, you’ve had so many UTIs. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Promise me you’ll stop hiding 
                        what’s really wrong until it can’t 
                        be treated.

           INT. FOX STUDIOS - DAY

           Paris sits in front of an EXECUTIVE. The Simple Life’s poster 
           hangs behind him.
                                 EXECUTIVE
                           (chewing gum)
                        Okay, so we’re thinking that you 
                        and Nicole will strap on 35-pound 
                        pregnancy suits and then help each 
                        other give birth. We have the 
                        electric shock and--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I can’t.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        We could do without the shock.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No, I can’t shoot with her. 

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        Whatever check I need to write for 
                        you to get over your girl drama--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        Paris--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m not just a perfume line, okay? 
                        I have boundaries!

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        ...Okay.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        The mom thing, that’s hot. We can 
                        rotate being mother figures for the 
                        same families. See who’s a better 
                        housewife.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        Wait. That’s actually a really good 
                        pitch. You’re pretty smart when 
                        you’re emotional.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You’re not.

           INT. BATHROOM, LINDSAY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lindsay’s new assistant JEROME (20s, chubby and not in a cute 
           way) piles box dye on her head. She sits on the toilet. 
                                 JEROME
                        I don’t think this is smart. Sure 
                        you don’t want to go to the salon? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN 
                        The bleach is seeping in to my 
                        brain cells and killing them.

           She grabs the bottle and dumps all the dye on her head.

           Lindsay washes her hair out. Brown dye splashes down. 

           Brown-haired Lindsay puts on her robe. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        Jerome, get me my ceviche!

           It’s oddly quiet. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        JEROME? JEROME!

           Lindsay trots downstairs. Jerome throws on his jacket.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        Are we out of ceviche?

                                 JEROME
                        I can’t stay overtime tonight. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        But it’s Sunday! I need you too--

                                 JEROME
                        I told you last week, I have my 
                        grandpa’s funeral. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Do you think he is going to further 
                        your career?

                                 JEROME
                           (opening the door)
                        See you tomorrow.

           Beat. Terror overcomes Lindsay. She lowers her robe.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You won’t see this tomorrow...

                                 JEROME
                        I think you missed some dye.
           He leaves. Lindsay watches him walk down her driveway. A 
           BORED PHOTOGRAPHER ignores Jerome. Plays a game on his phone. 

           EXT. LINDSAY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Lindsay gallops over to the photographer.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (overdramatic)
                        Get off my lawn, pervert, I’m 
                        practically naked!! 

                                 BORED PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Oh, yeah.

           He snaps a quick photo and returns to his game. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        How dare you! I hope those hundreds 
                        of dollars are worth my dignity!

                                 BORED PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Eh, this will be like $50 if my 
                        editor’s feeling generous. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What, you need full frontal to make 
                        a buck?

                                 BORED PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Well, we’ve already got that so 
                        unless you have a pee-pee tape--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Where is everyone?

           EXT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY

           Paparazzi swarm the deck, which has been transformed to a 
           lush cherry blossom garden. Stuffed animals line carefully 
           curated spreads of gourmet food (that no one will eat.)

           Paris grins next to Britney, who waves her baby’s hand to the 
           flashing cameras.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I don’t get it. Why have a baby 
                        shower if you’re not having a baby?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Well, I’m going to have lots of 
                        other people’s babies on the show.

                        ...it’s fun.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Seems expensive.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s the point.

           Britney’s baby sobs. She gives it a bottle. Meanwhile Paris 
           steals Brit’s phone and blocks Lindsay’s number.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I spend my money on fancy cheese.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Aren’t you lactose intolerant? 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I’m in an abusive relationship with 
                        dairy! It was like totally my whole 
                        inspiration for Toxic. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I thought it was about drinking or 
                        dick or drinking dick...

           Britney snatches her baby’s bottle.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Speaking of, I need some tequila.

           Brit suckles on the bottle. Weirded-out, the heiress shoots 
           the cameras a cringing smile.

           INT. BACKSTAGE BRITNEY'S LAS VEGAS SHOW - NIGHT, 2020

           Dancers stretch out-of-shape Britney (now 37, went through 
           some bad shock therapy and even worse botox.)
           Title: Britney Spears, Not A Girl - Not Yet A Woman

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Paris is like Parisian Paris. You 
                        can drink fancy wine there, but you 
                        get like tired stepping in dog 
                        doodies, you know? 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        And Lindsay?

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I haven’t heard from Linz in ages. 
                        Like, I see my kids more than her!
           INT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT, 2006

           Lindsay snorts coke off a tabloid with a picture of Britney 
           dropping her baby.  

           Looking at articles of ultra-thin Olsen Twins, Lindsay tosses 
           out all the food in her fridge. 

           Linz highlights the names of the clubs and bars that Nicole 
           Richie has been seen vomiting in.  

           Lindsay studies a picture of Ashlee Simpson and Wilmer. She 
           puts on nearly the same slinky dress as Ashlee.

           Finally, Lindsay spritzes on some Paris Hilton-brand perfume. 

           INT. PARIS' TRAILER - NIGHT

           Paris sprays on Chanel perfume and goes onto set.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay reminisces.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        So what if Paris was ignoring me? 
                        Everyone else wasn’t.

           MONTAGE: PARIS ON SET / LINDZ SETTING UP PHOTO-OPS

           In each scene, reality cameras trail Paris. Lindsay attracts 
           more paparazzi with each of her escapades.

           - Paris straps on a 35-pound pregnancy suit
           - Lindsay straps on a push-up bra

                           (eating a wing)
                        Why would I worry if Lindsay goes 
                        out late? The girl is photographed 
                        everywhere she goes! She gets more 
                        supervision than most kids. 
           - Paris learns about the marvels of breastfeeding
           - A guy tries to honk Lindsay’s breast 
           - Paris changes a diaper
           - Lindsay craps her pants
           - Paris takes kids camping, bestowing them with baby bears
           - Lindsay falls asleep in someone’s backyard

                        Ya know that ad, “It's 10 P.M. Do 
                        you know where ya children are?” 
                        Well, I know where my daughter is!

           - Paris mows the lawn in her heels
           - Lindsay wakes up on a lawn as paparazzi grab at her shoes.

                                                    CUT TO: HOOTERS

           Dina chokes a little.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Alone, Lindsay is choked up.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN 
                        The paparazzi loved it.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        I don’t know if they loved it but 
                        it certainly got their attention.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN 
                        Is there a difference?

           INT. PARIS’ TRAILER - NIGHT

           Paris sits in her trailer, done for the day. She checks her 
           phone. Texts Britney, who hasn’t responded to her last text 
           from two days ago. 

           EXT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE - DAY

           A pack of wild photographers wait for Lindsay, who parades in 
           her front yard in a neon bikini. 

           They furiously squeal her name.
                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        How are you Lindsay?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        When are you doing another movie 
                        Lindsay?

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT 
                        We need to see you on screen!

           Self-assured Lindsay prances to a lawn chair. She pulls out a 
           a tanning reflector board.

           Basking in the sun, she watches the crowd of paparazzi in the 
           reflection like a TV show. She’s in bliss.

           EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

           Lindsay browses through the tabloids. Her face graces every 
           one. A swarm of paparazzi capture her every move. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (on the phone)
                        I swear Ma, they can’t ignore me 
                        now. No producer would toss up the 
                        publicity. I’ll need you back in LA 
                        as soon as I get cast again...Love 
                        you too.

           Just above, Lindsay spots Elle Magazine with her on the 
           cover. She grabs it, thrilled. 

           INT. SLEEK OFFICE - NIGHT

           Stavros sits with the magazine open in front of him. He 
           grunts into his Blackberry.

                                 STAVROS
                        You think I wouldn’t find out that 
                        you lied, Lohan? 

           EXT. BATHROOM, CLUB - DAY

           Timbaland roars in the background. Lindsay sits on the toilet 
           in a barely-there dress. Someone tries to take a photo of her 
           from under the stall. She kicks it away.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Lied about what? 

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED.
                                 STAVROS
                        You told them nothing happened 
                        between us. What, am I not good 
                        enough for your fuck of the week?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        This isn’t about you, Stavros.

                                 STAVROS
                        It’s about my name in this town! I 
                        told everyone I banged Firecrotch. 
                        Now I’m a poser. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You have the same name as every man 
                        in your family. 

                                 STAVROS
                        You screamed out all of our names 
                        when I fucked your brains out. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Well, you must have fucked my 
                        brains out of my head, because I 
                        can’t even remember any of it.

                                 STAVROS
                        This jog your memory?

           BEEP. A text. Lindsay opens it. It’s a video. 

           ONSCREEN: Lindsay lays sprawled across the bed, her dress 
           pulled up. She slips in and out of consciousness as Stavros 
           (who records) pulls her breasts out and flicks her nipples. 

           Wherever this is going, it’s going to get worse.

           Lindsay slams her phone shut. She straightens, composed.

           It’s okay. She’s okay. It’s going to be--

           Lindsay vomits, barely making the toilet.

           RING! She declines the call. BLOOP. 

           1 new voicemail.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay smokes a cigarette. She’s distracted.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Why didn’t you go to the police?
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        It wasn’t a crime.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        How about your mom?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        She told me there’s a lot of money 
                        in porn. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        There had to be someone--

           EXT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY, 2006

           It’s 5am. Lindsay huddles by the doorway in her backless 
           dress from the night before. 

           INSERT ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF THIS HAPPENING.

           Paparazzi snap photos as Lindsay grabs the knob.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        We tried, it’s locked!

           Lindsay bangs on the bell haphazardly. She then retreats into 
           the shrubs. Underneath the leaves, Lindsay blinks out tears. 

           INT. PARIS’ BEDROOM - DAY

           Paris peers down at Lindsay from her Rapunzel-worthy view. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (V.O.)
                        Lindsay was a total mess.

           A BUTLER walks up to her. 

                                 BUTLER
                        Shall I send her off? 

           Paris locks her eyes with Lindsay. 

           The former-redhead looks like a stray dog - mangy, tangled, 
           and desperate...and slightly cute. 

           Paris’ eyes soften. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (V.O.)
                        But she was a mess I made. 
           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

           Paris clings onto one of her dogs.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Guess that’s why I kept trying to 
                        clean her up.

           EXT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY, 2006

           Lindsay gets ready to leave when-- CREAK. 

           A stone-faced bodyguard opens the door. Lindsay wobbles in.

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY

           Tinkerbell licks Lindsay’s face as Paris plays the voicemail. 

                                 STAVROS (VOICEMAIL)
                        ...Everyone will know I fucked 
                        Lindsay Lohan just like every other 
                        guy in this town. I’m not special!

           Paris is genuinely disgusted.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        They’re going to think I wanted it.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What? You saw it, I couldn’t even--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        No, the tape. Do you want it out?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        How could you even ask that? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        The girl in that tape isn’t 
                        someone’s wife. She isn’t a movie 
                        star. She’s alone. My dad already 
                        told TMZ he thinks I’m a slut--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay, you won’t be alone.
           Paris stretches out her hand. Lindsay takes it.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        If it comes out people will follow 
                        you everywhere you go, care about 
                        everything you do--

           Lindsay’s eyes light up. 

           Kim eavesdrops from the shadows of the doorway. Her pupils 
           sparkle even brighter.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        People will want to know what 
                        you’ll do next. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You really think so? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I know so. You don’t need a hit at 
                        the box office for your sex tape to 
                        be one.

           Lindsay’s face cracks like a plate at the word sex. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        But...that wasn’t... 
                           (whispering)
                        It wasn’t sex...it wasn’t--

           Her voice cracks. Paris takes her into her arms. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        ...I’m sorry.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Me too. But there’s nothing I can 
                        do. I’m just screwed, right?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I sued. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Did it work?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I got some of the tape’s sales.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        So they’ll pay me for my work like 
                        I’m a cheap whore.

           Paris stands.
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Well, if you don’t want to be a 
                        cheap whore like me, stop copying 
                        my clothes, stealing my friends 
                        then showing up at 5 AM begging for 
                        my help--

           Lindsay also stands.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        That’s not what--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        So you know, I’m an expensive 
                        whore. My dog’s house has marble 
                        countertops!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I know. I know. Please. I-- I don’t 
                        have anyone, Paris.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Will you shut up? I let you in, 
                        didn’t I? I let paparazzi see I let 
                        you in.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Why?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Because I’m a good friend.

           Lindsay blinks. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...Would you let them see me here 
                        after the tape comes out?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        The tape’s not gonna come out.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        OMG, Paris. Thank you. I knew it. I 
                        knew you could stop it. You think 
                        he’ll ask for a huge bribe?

           Paris takes Tinkerbell back, uncomfortable.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Stavros doesn’t need a bribe. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Well, no one needs a bribe.
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay, he has more money than I 
                        do...For now, at least.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Are you serious? Now is all that 
                        matters. 

           Kim Kardashian barges in. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Paris...the Tease Fragrance launch 
                        is in like four hours. The makeup 
                        artist is on site--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I have to go.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You can be late. It’s your perfume.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s exactly why I can’t be late. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        So you’re going to leave me?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m going to leave.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What if he posts it while you’re 
                        gone?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Stavros is going to sleep until 
                        1pm. You should get some too.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        How? Everyone thinks I’m a 
                        friendless skank and I’m about to 
                        prove them right. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s not true.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You told everyone so!

           Silence. Uncomfortable, Paris grabs her purse. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m such an idiot. You’re not a 
                        good friend. There are no good 
                        friends. Just friends and enemies.

           Lindsay pulls up her falling neckline, frazzled. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to help me. The 
                        only reason you’d help anyone is if 
                        they can help you. And this tape-- 
                        it helps you and Brandon...

           Paris takes a long, irritated exhale.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Get over it, Lindsay.

           A vindictive laugh bursts out of Lindsay.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Maybe you can live a life with no 
                        one who really cares about you, but 
                        I can’t.

           Paris rings a bell. The butler enters to escort Lindsay out. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Oh, Lindsay...you already do. 

           EXT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY

           Lindsay stumbles outside. Cameras shutter. 

           INSERT ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF THIS.

           She reaches into a trash bin. Presses a dirty pizza box to 
           her face. Uses it as cardboard shield. 

           Paparazzi trot after her.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        You’re looking so pretty tonight, 
                        come on!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        IT’S FUCKING DAYTIME!

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        The sun is good for ya face!

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        Just a couple of shots, baby!
           The photographers circle Lindsay.

           FLASHES bombard her.

           She scrambles to her car. Tosses the box. Pizza oozes out. 

           FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.

           Exposed, Lindsay jams her keys into an SUV. Her hands shake.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Are you okay to drive Lindsay?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        You should stay here with us.

           Lindsay opens the door. He keeps recording.

           FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        We’ll take care of you.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Shhhh. Let her drive. THE SHOTS!

           FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.

           Lindsay grabs an energy drink and hurls it at the camera men.

           She slams the door. Roars her engine.

           They crowd in front of her car. 

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Be careful, Lindsay!

           She speeds away.

           INT. MIDDLE AMERICA MALL - DAY

           Paris Hilton grins at the helm of a massive mob. At her pixie 
           pink station, she gives chubby teens her autograph. 

           Tommy presses Tinkerbell’s paw into ink so they can get the 
           Chihuahua’s autograph too.

           A SUPER FAN (15, juicy sweatsuit) trots up to the counter.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What’s your name?
                                 SUPER FAN
                        Annabelle. But I want people to 
                        call me Venice. Like the city. Like 
                        you. Because you’re like the city.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s hot.

           The fan squeals. Paris signs a perfume box. 

                                 SUPER FAN
                        Omigod, Paris, I loveyousomuch!!!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Aw, I love you too!

           The fan cackles.

                                 SUPER FAN
                        No you don’t. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I just said I did!

                                 SUPER FAN
                        You don’t have to fake it with me. 
                        I get it.  

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Get what?

                                 SUPER FAN
                        That you’re a bad bitch. And bad 
                        bitches can’t waste their time on 
                        poor hoes. 

           She snatches Paris’ perfume and spritzes it on herself. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t think your parents would 
                        appreciate that kind of language, 
                        Annabelle.

                                 SUPER FAN
                        It’s Venice. And if my parents 
                        cared about my language, they 
                        wouldn’t be me buying a perfume 
                        called Tease. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Oh, well...I...
                                 SUPER FAN
                        It’s no biggie. One day I’ll be as 
                        rich as you and I won’t have to 
                        care about them or anyone else. 

           The fan moves ahead in the line. PISSED, Paris follows her.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You know, if you don’t care about 
                        anyone, they don’t have to care 
                        about you either. 

           The Super fan stares back at Paris, defiant. Paris takes in 
           her own words.

           Paris grabs Tinkerbell from Tommy.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to make a call. 

                                 TOMMY
                        There are a gazillion people here!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        They can wait. This can’t.

           She pulls away, dialing a number in her phone...

           I/E. LINDSAY’S CAR - DAY

           RING. Lindsay drinks boxed wine in her parked car. Her 
           neighbors pass by and shoot her judgmental looks.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (calling out)
                        I’m not drinking and driving. I’m 
                        drinking and parking, okay?

           RING! RING!

           Lindsay sloppily answers her phone.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        WHAT, SLUT?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        OMG, Lindsay? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Who is this?
           INT. KIM’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Kim, in her underwear, tests out her angles with a camcorder. 
           She’s in preproduction for her sex tape.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        It’s Kimberly.

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Who?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Paris’ friend.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m sorry...

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I’m her stylist. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        How did you get this number? Paris 
                        only hires gays.

           Kim poses in the mirror, scrunching up her cleavage. Sighs.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I clean -- organize -- her closet.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Oh! You’re--

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Kim Kardashian.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Kim...

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I’m calling because there’s 
                        something else you might not know.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - IN THE SKY - DAY

           Paris hands Stavros champagne. 

                                 STAVROS
                        I would have sent you the tape 
                        directly if I knew it would make 
                        you so jealous.
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You know I don’t like to share. 

                                 STAVROS
                        Then why’d you stop answering my 
                        calls?

           Paris leans over him, her breath on his neck.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (seductive)
                        It was a break, not a break up.

                                 STAVROS
                        Oh? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’m thinking about buying a 
                        tropical island and I need you to 
                        help me decide which beach looks 
                        the best with my eyes. 

                                 STAVROS
                        Sounds a little lonely.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        We can keep each other company.

           She sits in his lap. Stavros wraps his arm around her. Gropes 
           up and down her torso.

           Paris gyrates on him as he grunts. 

           She carefully grinds on Stavros, clearly trying to GET HIS 
           PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET. 

           Just as she grabs for it he shoves her off.

                                 STAVROS
                        What are you doing? 

           Paris stands up straight. Sigh.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Um, I just need your phone for a 
                        sec. 

                                 STAVROS
                        Chill. You never sent me any nudes. 
                           (off her telling look)
                        Unless you’re looking for someone 
                        else’s nudes. 

           He sips his champagne. Paris sips hers.
                                 STAVROS (CONT’D)
                        Why do you want Firecrotch’s tape?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you really care?

                                 STAVROS
                        Don’t you two hate each other? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Yes. Of course-- I just don’t want 
                        anyone to go through what I 
                        did...not even a skank like her. 
                        Gimme the phone.

                                 STAVROS
                        No.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Are you serious?

                                 STAVROS
                        It’s mine.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Yeah, makes total sense.

           Paris lunges at him. He pulls the phone out of her reach.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Are you seriously not going to give 
                        it to me?

                                 STAVROS
                        What am I getting in return?

           Paris rolls her eyes. She unzips her Juicy sweatsuit.

                                 STAVROS (CONT’D)
                        Ugh, no. Been there, done that.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        If you don’t want to fuck me, why 
                        are you even here?

           He smirks.

                                 STAVROS
                        I want the world to think I fucked 
                        you. 
           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

           Paris sits in front of camera. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        The nicest thing I ever did for 
                        Lohan was make her hate me. 

           I/E. LINDSAY'S CAR - NIGHT

           Lindsay and Kim rip through a tabloid prominently featuring 
           snapshots of Paris and Stavros canoodling in a club. 

           Headline: Paris and Stavros Get Hot In Miami Beach

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Now do you believe me? 

           Lindsay grabs the tabloid. Crumples it. Screams. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        Lindsay--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        AHHHHHH!

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Lindsay, you need to stop--PLEASE--

           Lindsay’s eyes water over. She bangs her head on the 
           dashboard, furious. Kim watches in horror. Then irritation.

           She grabs Lindsay and straightens her up. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        Stop it! 

           Lindsay wrestles her. They jerk around, until SLAP! Lindsay 
           stops. Kim slaps her again. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen you crazy bitch, get your 
                        shit together. Britney Spears does 
                        not hang out with maniacs.

           FLASH TO BRITNEY LAUGHING MANIACALLY WHILE SHAVING HER HEAD.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You don’t know what I’m going 
                        through. 
                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        OJ Simpson is my fucking godfather.  
                        Try me.

           Lindsay pauses. Kim has a point.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen, all we have to do is walk 
                        into Britney’s hotel, get a few 
                        photos coming in and out, and 
                        everyone will think she’s hanging 
                        out with us. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Even Paris?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Most importantly Paris. She’s never 
                        going to take you seriously if you 
                        don’t even try to get back at her. 

           Lindsay nods. Kim hands her a tissue.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        So hurry up, fix your mascara. 
                        Unless you want them to misidentify 
                        you as a raccoon or Avril Lavigne.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        We have to go now?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        It’s 7. We want them to think she 
                        had us for dinner, not drinks. 
                        Drinks are for BFs. Dinner is for 
                        BFFLs.  

           Lindsay nods. Kim grins. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT’D)
                        You and I can be Brit’s BFFLS! 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You really think so?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        You totally got this.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Could you...hit me again?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        What?
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I don’t know. It centered me.

           Kim gets out of the car. 

           EXT. LOBBY, ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Camera lights strobe. Cheering fans hold up Britney Spears 
           regalia. Lindsay and Kim strut through paparazzi.

           Kim works it. Lindsay does too. 

           INT. LOBBY, ROOSEVELT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is classy and elegant and relevant. Lindsay and Kim 
           don’t fit in at all.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What floor is Britney on?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Who cares?

           IN A PHONE BOOTH

           It’s secluded. Lindsay and Kim camp out.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m tired.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Fine, go back out. They’ll think 
                        Britney Spears got bored of you and 
                        she’s alone with me eating 
                        tiramisu.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re being ridiculous.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        You’re right. Brit doesn’t eat 
                        things she can’t pronounce.   

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Do you even like Britney?

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I like being seen with her.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re diabolical. 
                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        I’m a businesswoman.

           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

           Paris reapplies a Kim Kardashian brand lipstick.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t have regrets, but saying 
                        Kim’s ass looks like cottage cheese 
                        stuffed in a trash bag...was a bad 
                        business decision.

           I/E. LOBBY, ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT, 2006

           Lindsay looks at Kim, disgusted. This...she is not who she 
           wants to be.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You know what? I’m not a 
                        businesswoman. Hell, I’m not even a 
                        celebrity. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        What are you then?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        A star.

           Lindsay rushes out of the phone booth, leaving Kim behind.

           She skids to THE ELEVATOR. Slams the penthouse button.

           INT. PENTHOUSE, ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Lindsay charges out of the elevator to the entrance of the 
           presidential suite. Just as she’s about to knock on the door, 
           Britney, in a ratty bra and basketball shorts, opens it.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        BRITNEY!

           She bear hugs the pop star.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You’re not Popeye’s.

           Lindsay follows Britney in. This is the nicest hotel room 
           she’s ever seen. RIIIIING! Britney answers her cell. 
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        How’d it go? --Uh-huh. I don’t care 
                        what it takes, Meredith, I’m not 
                        splitting the kids.

           She puts her hand on the phone and turns to Lindsay--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        Get comfortable.
                           (in terrible Spanish)
                        Mi caca es tu caca.

           Lindsay pours herself vodka. Peers out the window. A mob of 
           photographers hold up telephoto lenses like telescopes. She 
           does a sexy pout.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        This is my first divorce and we’re 
                        going to do it right!

           Britney hangs up. Lindsay remains entranced by the crowd.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        Hun, can you close the blinds?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Come on, they love you, Britney!

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        That’s what you call chasing me 
                        into Rite-aid?

           Britney shuts the blinds herself.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Seriously, how many hours did they 
                        camp out to take your picture?

           Britney rolls her eyes. Grabs a tabloid from a coffee table.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        For a rag that says I dip flamin’ 
                        hot Cheetos in dog food?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Haha, real good one.

           Linz grabs it. Reads through. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        First of all, it was cat food and 
                        it was only one time!
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Wait...you’re not kidding?

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You only read when they trash you?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        They’re trashing me?

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        STAR said that you slept with a 
                        bouncer for a bag of Tostidos...Do 
                        these guys have a deal with Frito-
                        Lay or something?

           Lindsay flips through the magazine. The BOUNCER FROM EARLIER 
           (who was mad that THE PARENT TRAP got his parents back 
           together) grins with his thumbs up.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m so confused.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Oh sweet pea...you can’t read, can 
                        you? I have trouble since my Disney 
                        tutor replaced English with exotic 
                        animal jazz-- 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        No, I can read! 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You don’t have to lie. Like I said, 
                        mi caca es--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I am fully literate, Britney! I 
                        just-- I only bother to see if I 
                        look hot in the photos.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        While they destroy your life?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Don’t be melodramatic.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Aw, honeycakes, you’ll read the 
                        damn article after CPS uses it to 
                        try to take your kids away.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Maybe they’re just worried. Didn’t 
                        you almost drop Jayden? 
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I didn’t want my almond latte to 
                        spill, sue me.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        That’s not exactly great 
                        parenting...

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        It’s great Mississippi parenting. 
                        I’m country. We drop our kids. Bush 
                        got dropped plenty and now he’s 
                        President!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Britney, they’re just looking out 
                        for you and their safety--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Just cause Dina sold your baby 
                        teeth on E-bay doesn’t mean that I--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I wasn’t saying--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You just want to think I’m just as 
                        shitty as your parents so you feel 
                        less fucked up. Everyone does.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Please stop making this about me?

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Sorry, Lindsay. I’m just starving. 
                        I miss my boys. I just don’t have 
                        it in me today to be America’s 
                        goddamn sweetheart!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You can be real with me, Britney! 
                        Let’s be real! I can tell you about 
                        my problems and--

           Britney laughs, pulls on a t-shirt, and grabs her purse.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        What problems?

           Now Lindsay laughs, in disbelief.
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        Girl, I’d kill a Backstreet Boy to 
                        go back to the days when I could 
                        just go out the back alley without 
                        being tailed by TMZ. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paparazzi follow me too.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Because you want them to.

           Britney puts on her sunglasses.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        I just want to get my Popeyes 
                        delivered while I watch the OC. 
                        Have a fucking family, maybe? Keep 
                        the one I have?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        My butterfly shrimp’s gotta be 
                        somewhere down there.

           Britney leaves.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           The back stairwell - secluded and empty. A window reveals the 
           crowd waiting in the front of the hotel.

           Defeated, Lindsay walks down to the back alley. Then, she 
           passes the window. Stops. Takes a longing look.

           The mob ripples.

           Britney breaks into it. A WHIRLPOOL OF CHAOS ERUPTS.

           From Lindsay’s view, it’s violent. A tsunami collapsing 
           inside itself, screeching--

           CU: hundreds of HANDS reach for Britney, exposed by flashes. 

           They blow kisses. 
           Grab her hair. 
           Rip at her shirt. 
           Steal her sunglasses. 
           Prop up adoring signs.

           The war zone flashes in Lindsay’s pupils. Then jealousy.
           Lindsay sprints back up the staircase.

           INT. LOBBY, ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Lindsay darts out of the elevator. Her eyes go straight to 
           the crowd waiting outside, which Britney just escaped. 

           She races into the mob.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - NIGHT, 2006

           As soon as they spot Lindsay, the paparazzi loses it.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Lindsay! How are you Lindsay?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        How’s Britney?

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        You look beautiful, Lindsay.

           Lindsay shoots a smile at the cameras.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        What about Paris?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        Partying with Paris tonight?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris is a cunt.

           The second the words leave her mouth, the mob metasizes. 
           Invigorated, Lindsay slides in the car. 

           For the first time in this movie, she feels powerful.

           We rewatch the 1st scene of this film through Lindsay’s eyes. 

           Her words are a blur. Their faces, a blur. The car, the 
           noise...are background music. 

           But the hands -- they’re clear, vivid, vibrant-- reaching 
           out. They’re reaching for her.

           I/E. PARIS’ MANSION - DAY

           Paris grabs a shoe box from a shelf and lays it on a stack 
           that Kim struggles to balance. 
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You got the coffee suede and the 
                        black patent? 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        It’s like Lindsay knew you had a 
                        shoe launch coming up, Paris. Or 
                        someone--no some genius knew to 
                        manufacture drama to help you 
                        promote it. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Your voice is like really grating 
                        when you talk in complete 
                        sentences.

           Paris trots to the paparazzi outside. 

           Bitter, Kim lugs the shoes.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Paris, why did Lindsay call you a 
                        cunt?

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        Are you a cunt?

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        How are you feeling?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Well, I feel totally amazing. 

           Kim starts handing out shoes.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m wearing my new Joy Black 
                        Leather ballet flats and I feel 
                        like I could stand up to anything! 

           A paparazzi inspects the shoes. They look pretty damn nice.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        What about Lindsay? You gonna stand 
                        up to her?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I know you all have been out here 
                        for a long time, so I just wanted 
                        to make sure you had the absolute 
                        best shoes...

           A little star struck, people start putting them on.
                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        ...which will be available this 
                        Thursday at Macy’s! 

           FLASH. FLASH. FLASH. FLASH.

           Paris poses with her shoes and struts back inside. Kim bats 
           her eyelashes then follows Paris back into the house. 

           The men take a second look at Kim’s ass. DAMN.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        She should get that insured.

                                                           CUT TO:

           A BANKER HOLDS UP AN INSURANCE DOCUMENT.

                                 BANKER
                        Kris Jenner ensured Kim’s backside 
                        for $21 million. That’s double the 
                        amount of followers Paris has on 
                        Instagram. 

           INT. LINDSAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lindsay waves at the paparazzi outside and slowly closes her 
           door. She snorts coke out of her locket. 

                                 DINA
                        Ya gonna share?

           Lindsay finds Dina, drinking in a chair.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Mom?

                                 DINA
                        Dahling!

           Dina gives her a bear hug. Lindsay doesn’t embrace her back.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DINA
                        What are you talking about? I’m ya 
                        manager!

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I don’t have anything to manage. 
                                 DINA
                        Lindsay, ya gotta release the tape.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        WHAT?

                                 DINA
                        I wasn’t finished. Ya gotta release 
                        the tape first. Get ahead of it. 
                        Own it.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Own what?

                                 DINA
                        That you’re a sex symbol!

           Dina sits down, self-satisfied.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Mom--

                                 DINA
                        It’s my fault. I listened to Disney 
                        and tried to keep ya girls too 
                        young too long. You’re a beautiful, 
                        grown 19-year-old woman and--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What about Ali’s Christmas album?

                                 DINA
                        Producers don’t think Lohan is a 
                        wholesome name for the Christian 
                        demo. Like those Jews know 
                        anything. But honey, I’ve been 
                        talking to Playboy and--

           Dina trails on. She doesn’t notice that Lindsay is quivering.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What do you want, Mom?

                                 DINA
                        Well...if ya gotta be so direct...I 
                        think 30 percent. I know it’s a 
                        little bigger than standard yet--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I need you to leave. 

                                 DINA
                        What, ya don’t want my help?
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Can you just go? I have things to 
                        do and I need to be alone so--

                                 DINA
                        Lindsay, why are ya pushing me 
                        away? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Because I fucking hate you! 

                                 DINA
                        That’s not how ya talk to your 
                        mother. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re not my mother.

                                 DINA
                        You’re high.

           Lindsay paces, rabid.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re NOT MY MOTHER! You’re just 
                        my-- my manager. And you’re-- 
                        you’re fired.

                                 DINA
                        I flew across the country to clean 
                        up ya mess, and this is how ya 
                        repay me?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’ve already paid you. I’ve been 
                        paying you since I was three.

                                 DINA
                        That’s some big talk coming from 
                        the girl who managed to throw away 
                        the career I built for her. 

           Lindsay grabs Dina’s cigarette and puts it out. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Get up. 

                                 DINA
                        Where did my beautiful, talented 
                        girl go?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Get up.
                                 DINA
                        Have ya seen my little Lindsay?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        GET UP!

           Lindsay pulls Dina to her feet.

                                 DINA
                        I tried to come by her house but 
                        all I see is this lonely, ugly 
                        tramp--

           Lindsay shoves Dina, who stumbles on a beer bottle and 
           crashes into the glass coffee table. It shatters around her. 

           Lindsay lunges onto the ground to help Dina. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        Ma! Mama--

           Dina stirs.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Mommy, I’m so sorry Mommy, I just--

           Dina SLAPS Lindsay. 

                                 DINA
                        Ya wanna be a whore? Fine. I’ll 
                        treat you like a pimp!

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay shoots the camera a plastered on smile. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m glad I’m so close to my mom. 
                        She’s the only person I really can 
                        be myself in front of.

           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        The thing is...I was the closest 
                        thing Lindsay had to a mom. And her 
                        mom was like the closest thing she 
                        had to a friend. And we both 
                        fucking hated her.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        You think her wires got crossed? 
                        That she lashed out at you when her 
                        mom--

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        It doesn’t matter what I think. 
                        Lindsay Lohan is a pathological 
                        liar. And she was making me rich.

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY

           Paris beams in front of the suits behind her empire. 

           They watch the sales number projected on screen. 

           The shoes are flying off the shelves and the Dollars Sold are 
           well into the millions. 

           The crowd cheers as SOLD OUT overtakes the screen.

           Paris holds up a glass.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        To Lindsay Lohan!

                                 CORPORATE STAFF
                        TO LINDSAY!

           EXT. GARAGE, SECOND RATE CLUB - NIGHT

           Lindsay wanders on foot past cars. Cameramen call out to her.

           INSERT REAL FOOTAGE OF THIS HAPPENING.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Lindsay, can I just get one 
                        picture? Please? 

           Lindsay stares into the faceless flashes. She paces towards 
           them like a moth to light.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        JUST VIDEO!

           She weaves through incoming cars.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        VIDEO!

           Lindsay holds up her elbow, too close to the camera. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        This is a video that Paris Hilton-- 
                        and I’m saying this on tape. She 
                        hit me last night, for no reason 
                        apparently at my friends house and 
                        I didn’t know she would be there--

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Are you upset? How do you feel--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        And she hit me. She hit me with a 
                        drink and poured it all over me and 
                        it hurts it’s not okay--

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Not cool.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        And I’m sorry for everyone that 
                        thinks I’m crazy. I’m not.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        I’m so sorry to hear that.

           Lindsay savors the sympathy. She moves a little closer. She 
           can see the paparazzi now. Bright eyed, she stares at him 
           with true affection.

           Then she realizes he’s not looking at her. Just her image on 
           his viewfinder. 

           Lindsay backs away.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I’m just trying to act...

           She turns and darts into the distance.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                           (to herself)
                        I was just trying to act--

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay sobs.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I was the supporting actress to a 
                        car.
                           (blowing her nose)
                        Not even a good car. A 
                        Volkswagen...
           I/E.  PARIS’ MERCEDES, BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           Paris pulls up in her very good car. Britney’s face is puffy 
           from crying.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        $20,000. What kind of kid needs 20 
                        Gs in child support a month?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Um, I need $23,000 for my morning 
                        routine. 

           Britney gives Paris a judgmental look. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                           (backtracking)
                        I was like, totally kidding.
                           (beat)
                        Listen, you’re going to write some 
                        killer break up songs and when we 
                        go to the Grammy’s you’re going to 
                        clean that shit up. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        I don’t fucking clean! I just want 
                        to get drunk.

           Pissed, Britney gets out of the car. Paris trails behind her.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Wait-- I didn’t mean--

           DOWN THE STREET 

           Lindsay watches the paparazzi mob Paris and Britney on their 
           way into the bungalows. She follows them.

           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        When are you going to ask me about 
                        the Holy Trinity?

           INT. BUNGALOWS - NIGHT, 2006

           Lindsay watches Paris and Britney from the shadows. To her, 
           they look like true friends. 

           Paparazzi hold their cameras up behind a hedge just to get a 
           blurry snapshot.
           We see Britney through Lindsay’s eyes: serene, soft, and in 
           perfectly flattering slo-mo. She’s a goddess.  

           INT. REHAB - DAY, 2020

                                 TOMMY
                        The Holy Trinity was only the most 
                        homosexual moment of 2006-- no the 
                        entire 2000s. 

           I/E. BUNGALOWS - NIGHT, 2006

           Paris and Britney get up to leave. Lindsay follows them 
           outside to the mob of photographers.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Britney--

           Her voice is drowned out by the mob. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        BRITNEY!

           Paris turns around. She shoots Lindsay a menacing look.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...Spending time with my friends.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        We both know you don’t have 
                        friends.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        OMG! Lindsay, why didn’t you say 
                        hi? 

           The color leaves Paris’ face.  

                     LINDSAY LOHAN
                                                  PARIS HILTON
           That’s what I’m doing now!
                                          She was just leaving--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                           (to the valet)
                        Where’s the Mercedes?

           It pulls up. Paris bolts for the car. Lindsay grabs her 
           shirt. Still clinging to Paris, she forces herself into the 
           middle of the two-seat sports car.
           I/E. PARIS' MERCEDES - NIGHT, 2006

           Now it’s as if the paparazzi are the ones on cocaine. The mob 
           is wilder than ever before. 

                                 TOMMY (V.O.)
                        You had the world’s biggest pop 
                        star, next to the world’s most 
                        famous actress, in the car of the 
                        world’s skinniest socialite.

           They shove their cameras in front of the windshield. Some 
           even climb on the hood of the car. 

           The three bask in the attention. They smile with each other 
           like lifelong friends.

                                 TOMMY (V.O.)
                        It was the most important moment in 
                        American history. The War of 1812 
                        could never.

           Paris puts on her windshield wipers and spritzes the 
           cameramen who fall off the car. 

           They chase her as she drives into the night.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Can we go to Wendy’s?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        As soon as Lindsay gets out. 

           Lindsay doesn’t say anything. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        So, Britney-- how’s the new album? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you want me to actually hit you?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Beat the shit out of me. It’d feel 
                        better than this, Paris.

           Britney’s eyes go wide. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I asked you-- no fucking begged you 
                        to stop Stavros from releasing the 
                        tape and you went out and fucked--
                                 PARIS HILTON
                        The only one who’s fucked anyone is 
                        you! You fucked your career, fucked 
                        your hair, and now you’re in here 
                        trying to fuck me!

           Paris makes a turn.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Are you guys having sex? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (saccharine)
                        No. Lindsay’s just mad I stopped 
                        her sex tape from getting released.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        You got a sex tape? 
                           (off Lindsay’s look)
                        Why haven’t I seen it?
                           (to Paris)
                        I’ve seen like the seven re-makes 
                        of yours. 

           Paris tries to hide her heart.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                           (under her breath)
                        Because I pretended to be screwing 
                        Stavros so he’d sell it to me.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Don’t you ever get tired of lying? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you ever get tired of being a 
                        fat freckled freak? 

           Paris pulls over. Lindsay lunges for her. 

           Paris claws back. Grabs her hair. 

           Lindsay bites Paris’ hand. Paris bitch-slaps her. 

           Britney sits between them, struggling in middle of their 
           catfight.

           INT. BACKSTAGE BRITNEY'S LAS VEGAS SHOW - NIGHT, 2020

           Britney slurps a big gulp.
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        As Vanity Fair’s Lily Anolik wrote, 
                        When stars collide one of two 
                        things happens. They form a larger 
                        star or they fall into a black 
                        hole.

           Silence. Did-- CAN Britney read?

           Britney belches.

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS (CONT’D)
                        Why do my burps always smell like 
                        farts?

           I/E. PARIS’ MERCEDES - SIDE STREET - NIGHT, 2006

           Paris gets out of the car. She makes a call. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Elliot, I’m on Robertson and 
                        Burton. Get here now...um, of 
                        course it’s Lohan related!

           In the car, Lindsay sobs under her shaggy hair. 

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Darling, are you okay? 

           Lindsay sniffles and sits up. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I don’t know what okay feels like.

           Elliot Minz’s car pulls up. He darts out and to Lindsay’s 
           side of the car. He knocks on the window.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        Don’t make me drag you out.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           Elliot and Lindsay walk down the block from the car. 

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        That was a cute stunt you pulled 
                        last night. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 
                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                           (in a bitchy voice)
                        Oh no! Paris Hilton hit me!! Am I 
                        relevant again? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I was upset. 

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        You know why Paris Hilton is my 
                        favorite client?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Because she’s rich?

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        Because every time she fucks up she 
                        gets richer. It doesn’t matter what 
                        the news is, as long as she’s in 
                        it, more people want to buy her 
                        crap. So thanks for your little 
                        trip to crazy town. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Why are you here then?

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        Paris wanted me to show you this. 

           He pulls out a laptop and plays Lindsay’s sex tape. She goes 
           pale and shuts it. 

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ (CONT’D)
                        Now don’t get freaked out. Although 
                        Paris bought the complete rights to 
                        your porno, she would never release 
                        it to harm you.

           The SHUTTER of cameras crescendoes. 

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ (CONT’D)
                        But I would.

           Lindsay turns around. 

           The paparazzi have caught up. They pull up around Paris’ car. 
           Paris and Britney get out of the car and pose.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...What do you want me to do?
           EXT. PARIS’ MERCEDES - NIGHT - 2006

           THIS IS ALL REAL FOOTAGE.

           Paris and Britney continue to pose for the photos when she 
           spots Lindsay walking back to the car with Elliot.

           Paris guides Britney back to the car.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        Paris, Lindsay says you hit her 
                        last night. Is that true? 

           Paris opens the car door and lets Britney inside. She makes 
           her way to the driver’s seat. 

                                 ANOTHER PAPARAZZI
                        So Paris, did you hit Lindsay?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Ask her! She’s right there!

           She points to Lindsay who, head hung low, walks arm in arm 
           with Elliot.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Lindsay! Tell them the truth.

                                 BITCHY PAPARAZZI
                        Lindsay, what’s going on?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (monotone)
                        Paris never hit me. She’s my 
                        friend. Everybody lies about 
                        everything. She’s a nice person--

           Elliot stares down at her, ice cold.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                           (getting into the car)
                        Please leave us alone. We’re 
                        friends.

                                 PAPARAZZI RAT
                        So that video statement before--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        I made it all up. We’re all 
                        friends. She never did that.

           Elliot looks at Paris, who grimaces. It hurts her to watch 
           Lindsay like this. 
           He whispers into Lindsay’s ear.

                                 ELLIOT MINTZ
                        So you know, Paris doesn’t give 
                        warning shots. She must really like 
                        your wasted ass. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (to the cameras)
                        ...She’s a good girl. I’ve known 
                        her since I was fifteen.
                           (voice cracking)
                        Please. Stop trying to make us hate 
                        each other.

           She slides into the car. Stares at Paris. Paris looks back 
           with real, sincere pity. She helps Lindsay into her seat.

           The paparazzi snap more photos, gasping in awe until Paris 
           drives off.

           INT. PARIS' PATIO - DAY, 2020

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        So what happened next?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        We went back to Britney’s place and   
                        I slept over.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        And Lindsay?

           Paris smirks. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I wouldn’t know.

           I/E. PARIS' MERCEDES - NIGHT, 2006

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Do you still want Wendy’s?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        A frosty would be nice, right 
                        Britney?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’ve always wondered what a chicken 
                        nugget tastes like!
                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Y’all bitches are batshit. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Britney, we just needed to settle 
                        something. We’re moving on now.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Are you ready for the Grammy’s? 

           Britney unbuckles.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Why would it matter to you? It’s 
                        not like you were invited--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        You’re only invited because I got 
                        uninvited!

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        Stop the car!

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Britney, don’t let this psycho--

                                 BRITNEY SPEARS
                        STOP BEFORE I CRACK A WINDOW OPEN 
                        YOU CRAZY CUNTS!

           Paris obeys. Britney climbs over Lindsay and out of the car.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I’ll see you tomorrow?

           Britney slams the door shut and wobbles off in her miniskirt. 

           Paris and Lindsay sit in silence. They stare at each other. 
           Then burst out in laughter. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        Someone forgot to give that bitch 
                        her medicine! 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Well, she did marry a guy in her 
                        living room.

           The girls laugh more. There’s a warmth in the air.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m really fucking sorry, Paris. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I know.

           Lindsay pauses, waiting.

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        What? I don’t need to say I’m 
                        sorry! 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Are you serious?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Hanging out with Stavros was 
                        punishment enough. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        What did he want? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        A weekend in the press with yours 
                        truly. I almost died.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris...

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Of alcohol poisoning! You know how 
                        drunk you need to be to put up with 
                        that sleaze-ball for 48 hours?

           Lindsay takes Paris’ hand. She squeezes it back. 

                                 PARIS HILTON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll never forgive him for what he 
                        did to you. 

           Tears glaze Lindsay’s eyes. There’s a silent thank you.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        ...How do we start over?

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I don’t think we can. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris, I need somebody. One fucking 
                        person.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I know. But I can’t be her. 
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Why not? 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        Lindsay, after all of this--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        This feud has been the best thing 
                        to happen to your career. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        What, you want to keep fighting?

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Hear me out. Every time I’m having 
                        trouble getting a movie or you need 
                        ratings on your show, we’ll just 
                        trash each other. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        You’re insane.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Exactly. You want to keep being the 
                        hero? You need a crazy villain. 

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        That’s really what you want? 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                           (shrugs)
                        Any actress would kill for a role 
                        like this.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

           Lindsay pleads with the camera.

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Okay, so that’s the story of Paris 
                        and me. That’s it. We can end it 
                        there.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.

                                                       OVER BLACK:

                                 PARIS HILTON (O.S.)
                        Lindsay was arrested six times and--

           Cut back to Lindsay.
                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Paris was arrested twice! After her 
                        DUI they kept pulling her over for 
                        continuing to drive without a 
                        license until--

           INTERCUT LINDSAY & PARIS’ INTERVIEWS.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        They sent her to jail and then--

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN
                        Rehab. 

           EXT. CELEBRITY REHAB - DAY, 2006

           Establishing shot. It’s more glamorous than most hotels.

           INT. CELEBRITY REHAB  - DAY, 2006

           Paris sits in her posh room crying.

                                 PARIS HILTON
                        I just...when I drink, I feel like 
                        no one can hurt me anymore. 

           Paris’ mom pats her on the back and holds her as she sobs.

           EXT. AVERAGE REHAB - DAY, 2006

           Establishing shot. This place is a lot worse.

           INT. AVERAGE REHAB - DAY

           Lindsay (who is the one in rehab) sits stone-faced while Dina 
           dramatically cries. 

                                 DINA
                        I just...when I don’t drink I feel 
                        like I’m gonna hurt people.

           LATER 

           Lindsay spills no tears. She just lays on her bed, empty. 

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN (PRELAP)
                        Just so you know, this story isn’t 
                        some campy tragedy.

           She’s haunted.
           INT. STUDIO - DAY, 2020

                                 LINDSAY LOHAN 
                        I’m not the tragic Lindsay Lohan. I 
                        booked two TV shows this year. One 
                        of them got a second season, and my 
                        new song Xanax gets played. I’ve 
                        heard it at the club and people 
                        danced. Hard. The way I used to and 
                        they weren’t even that drunk. That 
                        might not be a lot to you, but I 
                        did that. I did that completely 
                        alone, like I’ve done everything.
                           (beat)
                        And without a sex tape.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY, 2020

           Surrounded by sisters, KIM KARDASHIAN (39, if you need a 
           description for her, you live under a rock and should stop 
           reading this movie) sits as her glam squad gets her ready.

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN
                        Paris had the money. Lindsay had 
                        the talent. But I had the one thing 
                        they didn’t... 

           INT. PARIS HILTON'S MANSION - DAY, 2006

           KIM’S ENORMOUS ASS appears in her sex tape. Paris watches, 
           her eyes bulging out of her head. She’s on the phone.

                                 EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
                        Paris, The Simple Life was so fresh 
                        when it came out. But it’s been 
                        seven seasons and--

           Outraged, Paris just hangs up on him. Dials another number. 

                                 KIM KARDASHIAN (VOICEMAIL)
                        Hi there, it’s Kim. Sorry I can’t 
                        come to the phone right now, I’m 
                        busy filming my new reality show 
                        about my family and--

           The color leaves Paris’ face. 

           CU on the computer to the title of the sex tape:

           Kim Kardashian, Superstar.

                                                         FADE OUT.
