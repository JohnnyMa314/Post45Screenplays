          In 1980’s NYC murder was king.

          The cover sheet on the clipboard hanging in the station house of 
          Brooklyn’s blood-soaked 75th precinct said it all: ‘You give us 22 
          minutes, we’ll give you a homicide’. 

          Gunfire erupted so frequently that the cops didn’t even bother 
          responding to the sound until they knew a body had dropped. 

          Sex markets and drug trade thrived, homeless encampments dotted 
          the streets. 

          Criminals painted the city in blood while corrupt politicians cut 
          the police force by 1/3 and dirty cops moonlighted as muscle.

          In ’83 a young hotshot named Rudy Giuliani came in and was 
          publicly credited as the catalyst for cleaning up the city, but 
          that’s not the true story… the true story is much bloodier, much 
          dirtier, a ghost tale that they’ve been trying to hush for years… 

          Known as The Seven Days of Death.

          This is that story.  

                                    ‘a cop, a killer, a priest & a bell…’
           OVERHEAD OF A CITY--

           Night. 

           Half lit skyscrapers pepper the blackness, bullying for 
           position... everything in this city is a fucking fight. 

           Cut concrete and hard steel give the impression that it has 
           an iron jaw... it doesn’t. 

           A deck of cards sitting on gunpowder dusted pavement with 
           gasoline shitting from it’s sewers... always one spark away 
           from burning to the fucking ground. 

           Rain pounds hard, relentless, but what else is new. Trying to 
           cleanse the city, ain’t working... what else is new. 

           If there’s a God above us, these aren’t his tears...  

           NEW YORK CITY - ‘82

           The CLAP of thunder. Then another CLAP. Then TWO MORE in 
           rapid fire until we realize... 

           ..that ain’t thunder--

                                                           SMASH IN ON:

           A PACKED NIGHTCLUB--

           Lights, gold, grease, tits, and chest hair... sweaty bodies 
           bangin’ to the beat... you can almost smell the cocaine on 
           the page here... NYC in the 80’s baby!

           The Bee Gees ‘stayin’ alive’ pumps from the club’s speakers: 

           you’re stayin’ alive
           stayin’ alive

           As...

           A BULLET--

           ...exits the back of a skull, painting the wall RED with a 
           sickening splat... 

           feel the city breakin’ and everybody shakin’
           and we’re stayin’ alive

           BANG! Another shot-- more blood.
           Another-- sends a GUNMAN back like he’s moonwalking, upends a 
           table, champagne glasses fly.

           Another-- to the dome, head explodes - splat! Brains color in a 
           fat club goer nearby’s lack of chest hair...

           Fat club goer with the new chest hair screams! 

           Barry Gibbs screams:

           ah, ha, ha ha, stayin’ alive
           ah, ha, ha, ha, STAYN’ ALIVE!

           It’s a fucking party, man!

           The artist creating the masterpiece, a WOMAN (40s) - a .45 
           Caliber ‘brush’ in each hand - plying her trade like a 
           perverted Jackson Pollock as MEN WITH GUNS rush her from all 
           angles...

           BLUE, PINK, GREEN & PURPLE lights slice through the blood 
           drenched dance floor as she moves like a singular killing 
           machine, dropping bodies to Robin Gibbs wailing at us that 
           he’s got ‘the wings of heaven on his shoes’ (whatever the 
           fuck that means)...

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES! 

           ............................a bang banger of a Friday night!

           Coked out, half naked, disco rats - not sure if this is 
           actually happening or if that last rip of snow hit the head 
           too hard - mad dash for the exits...

           STAYIN’ ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!

               CLICK! CLICK! Dry fire as our girl re-clips and more men with 
           guns pour out of the woodwork like cockroaches...

           ...she puts ‘em down like she’s wearing a size 50 boot!

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES! 

           Taking fire to her vest, but moving like a toy train being 
           whipped around by an enraged pre-schooler... 

           Violent.

           Savage.

           Uncontrollable.

           ......but with absolute purpose..............................
           Finds cover, re-clips, catches her breathe then her distorted 
           reflection off the hard chrome of the .45... a smile, then...

           Back to the party--

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!

           Takes one to the shoulder, a graze, bleeding, doesn’t give a 
           shit, let’s it gush... no stopping it... just like her.

           They come, they drop, music pumps, party’s in full swing!

           A few more seconds of killing before the place is dead... 

           Just our girl - on the dance floor over dozens of partners 
           who couldn’t keep up - waiting on someone else to tango 
           with... Anyone? No-one?! ANYONE?! LET’S GO, MOTHERFUCKERS 
           THE NIGHT IS STILL YOUNG!! 

           Spots a wounded gunman trying to do the worm off the dance 
           floor... smiles, walks over, kicks the fucker onto his back.

           ANGLE UP ON:

           Our girl standing over him, covered in everyone else’s blood, 
           dripping off her like sweat, staring down at him as--

           Barry Gibbs pleads:

           somebody help me
           somebody help me, yeah!

           Cocks her head to the side for a split second... Considering? 
           Maybe? Nah...

           Puts a bullet through the iced out crucifix around the fat 
           fucker’s neck as the song finally ends....................... 

           ...nobody ‘stayed alive’.  

           ...........................silence...........................

           Heavy breathing over a sea of dead bodies, when our girl DIGS 
           INTO HER POCKET and pulls a SHINY QUARTER.

           Tosses it across the room...

           ...the blood stained quarter glints off the reflective mirror 
           disco ball as it soars through the air and punches into-- 

           A JUKEBOX

           Our girl pulls her piece with a perverted grin and... BAM!
           ...puts a bullet through G7.

           The record pulls--

           The needle drops--

           Jessie’s Girl comes on:

           jessie is a friend

           Our girl smiles a wicked smile, starts to move a little on 
           the dance floor, shoulders shimmy, hips sway... she came to 
           party and she ain’t done yet... 

           Sings along with Rick Springfield:

                                 OUR GIRL
                        I know he’s been a good friend of 
                        mine... 

           Moves to the Ricker singing like the 80’s rock god that he 
           was:

                                 OUR GIRL (CONT’D)
                        But lately something’s changed that 
                        ain’t hard to define, Jessie’s got 
                        himself a girl and I want to make 
                        her mine...

           Just her, covered in blood, a gun in each hand, standing on 
           the dance floor over dozens of dead bodies singing and 
           swaying to RS like she’s front row center at his concert...

           Really getting into it now...

                                 OUR GIRL (CONT’D)
                        AND SHE’S WATCHING HIM WITH THOSE 
                        EYES!!

           Shoots a look to an OFFICE upstairs as we--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           THE OFFICE

           A dozen men with guns at the ready... waiting... 

           NO MUSIC HERE... just....

           ...........................Silence........................... 

           ..................................................too long...
           The guy they’re protecting - the kind of guy who needs 
           protecting - signals a few to check things out... 

           The men creep to the door as--

           BULLETS RIP THROUGH IT...

           ...then through the poor fuckers standing behind it. Hot 
           metal pierces their bones and organs, bullets filling the 
           room, bodies jumping like they’re doing the jig. 

           Then the door rips off the hinges and:

           Knives slice through necks--

           Bullets rip through brains--

           Bones crunch and guts spew-- 

           An absolute symphony of death as OUR GIRL VICIOUSLY SHREDS 
           EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM, painting the room with their 
           blood before they even know what hit ‘em. 

           The only one left alive... the guy who needed protecting, the 
           one she’s really there for... 

           A fresh coat of everyone else's blood on her as she slowly 
           walks towards the man... 

                                 OUR GIRL
                        Who put the hit out on the cop?

           No answer, his eyes darting around the room, looking for an 
           out...

           She stands in front of him, blood dripping from her face and 
           hair as she stares at him... asks again...

                                 OUR GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Who. Put. The. Hit. Out. On. The. 
                        Cop?!

           Looks to her--

                                 MAN
                        Who the fuck are you?!

           Wrong answer--

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! 
           Keeps firing...

           On the wall behind him, splattered in his own brains and 
           blood as he dies ten times over:
                         BELLA 

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           One less building bullying for position as the nightclub 
           burns to the fucking ground...

           In the distance, the smokey silhouette of Bella walking 
           through the steam spitting manhole covers, disappearing into 
           the black New York City night.  

           INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - NYC - DAY

           A hospital in 80’s NYC... gunshot victims, overdoses, hooked 
           out hookers and the occasional drunk cabbie who wrecked his 
           ride... and it’s not even fucking noon yet.  

           IN A PRIVATE ROOM--

           A different soundtrack today:

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....

           As--

           Bella sits over an OLDER MAN (60’s) wired up to every type of 
           machine you can imagine... All necessary, all pumping life 
           into him. His chest bandaged up, a patchwork of gauze 
           covering the worked on bullet holes decorating it... 

           She’s cleaned up from her night on the town last night... she 
           cleans up well. 

           Sits over him, uneasy, unsure, emotional, vulnerable... not 
           the same Bella we saw demolishing the disco-tech...

           A tear comes, she let’s it fall, doesn’t give a shit. Rubs 
           the man’s hand as he lies there... still, silent, but for:

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....

           Lovingly brushes some of his hair into place with her hand, a 
           bit of blood from last night still caked under her 
           fingernails... 

           Bella on the brink... when a MATRONLY NURSE (60’s) enters and 
           breaks the moment. She sees Bella and--
                                 NURSE
                        Sorry, I-- 

           Bella quickly screws it together and stands.

                                 BELLA
                        I can leave if-- 

                                 NURSE
                        No, it’s okay. 

           She walks over to the man.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Just making my rounds.

           She checks his vitals and jots a few things down in his 
           chart, HUMMING BEAUTIFULLY the whole way through...

           ...............30 seconds of much needed solace..............

           Then, with a smile, she turns to the man and softly...

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Doing great, Jacob. Everything is 
                        looking really positive so you keep 
                        on fighting here fella. 

           Bella looks at her... a beat, then--

                                 BELLA
                        He, uh... 
                             (pained, struggling)
                        You think he can hear you like 
                        that?

           She nods as she puts the chart back. 

                                 NURSE
                        I know he can.

           She smiles...

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll put the TV on...
                             (a wink)
                        He likes the news.

           She puts the TV on and continues humming as she leaves.

           On the screen, a HELMET HAIRED NEWS REPORTER straight out of 
           80’s central casting stands in front of the torched 
           nightclub, running down last night’s party... 
                                 HELMET HAIRED REPORTER
                        Club goers at the popular nightspot 
                        B’Zar got more than they bargained 
                        for last night when a lone gunman 
                        crashed the party... 

           Bella just stares at the TV as a CRUDE COMPOSITE SKETCH of 
           her hits the screen... it’s fucking offensive, looks like a 
           drunk on the Atlantic City boardwalk scribbled it up between 
           pops.   

           Bella shakes her head, disgusted - and frankly a little 
           insulted... 

           A second later a grid full of mug shots hits the screen, 
           dozens of goombah’s... we know these cats - Bella’s dance 
           partners who couldn’t keep up...   

                                 HELMET HAIRED REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Among the victims, notorious mob 
                        boss Salvatore ‘Chooch’ Castrovano 
                        and his army of-- 

           Bella grabs the brick sized remote chained to the hospital 
           bed and clicks the power button, silencing the sloppy recap. 

           A few moments pass before Bella looks back to the man (Jacob, 
           as we now know him to be)... 

           A long contemplative moment, a nervous half step forward, 
           then--

                                 BELLA
                        So, yeah, about that... I, uh... I 
                        know that’s not your way, but...    

           Looks away - having a really hard time with this - then back 
           to Jacob; eyes full of pain, fear... guilt... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        What they did to you, dad... 
                             (can barely keep it 
                              together)
                        ...look what they did to you.  

           A long beat - trying so hard not to break as she stares at 
           her father; helpless, hooked up to all the machines, full of 
           bullet holes... 

           Leans into him like a lost child...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I wasn’t here, I’m 
                        sorry... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        If I was here to protect you... I 
                        should have been here...    
                             (exhales; gathering 
                              strength)
                        I am now. I’m here now, dad, and I 
                        promise... I promise... 

           Bella inches closer... a tear falls onto her father as she 
           leans into him with a WHISPER--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m handling this. Every thing. 
                        Every one. Until it’s done. When 
                        you wake up, it’ll be gone... like 
                        it never existed. Eradicated. I 
                        promise you that...
                             (in a whisper)
                        So don’t worry okay. Nothing to 
                        worry about...

           Is that worry on Bella’s face? The first chink in her armor 
           maybe? Who’s she really talking to here..?

           A moment passes before a PRIEST, making his rounds in the 
           ICU, gently raps at the door...

                                 PRIEST
                        Would you like me to pray with you 
                        my child?

           Bella just stares at him for a long moment... He’s older, 
           60’s, kind eyes that look absolutely exhausted... 

           She considers, then--

                                 BELLA
                        You look tired. 

                                 PRIEST
                        So do you.

                                 BELLA
                        Both doing God’s work...

                                 PRIEST
                        And which God do you serve? 

                                 BELLA
                        The old school fucker... Mr. Fire & 
                        Brimstone.

                                 PRIEST
                        Was that your ‘work’ last night?
           Bella smiles then leans over and kisses Jacob on the 
           forehead. 

                                 BELLA
                        I’m here... I’m here...

           She gives him a long look... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        See you soon, dad.

           Another moment then turns and walks over to the priest. 

           They just stare at each other for a long beat... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe just read to him? Talk to 
                        him? Tell him it’ll be okay and 
                        that God’s not a motherfucker 
                        enough to let the one decent man in 
                        this rat infested city die. Can you 
                        do that? 

           Priest cracks the slightest of smiles...

                                 PRIEST
                        Good to see you, Bella.

           Bella smiles back...

                                 BELLA
                        You too, Father. 

           They hug, it’s genuine, familiar, history there... 

                                 PRIEST
                        You find peace last night?

                                 BELLA
                        Not what I’m after...

                                 PRIEST
                        You get what you were after?

                                 BELLA
                        Yes and no...  

                                 PRIEST
                        Mmmm...

           They just stare at each other for a long moment... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        It’s all going to be okay.
                                 BELLA
                        Oh, I’m going to make sure of 
                        that...

           So loaded... 

           A beat, then-- 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        What’re you driving these days? 

           Priest smiles a sly grin...

                                 PRIEST
                        ‘79 Camaro Z28.

           Bella just looks at him... a few moments before he 
           begrudgingly pulls out the keys and tosses them to her. 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Be gentle, huh? 

                                 BELLA
                        When am I not?

           Another look at each other with a smile... Bella heads for 
           the door, but turns before leaving--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        The dead still buried?

           He hesitates for a moment, then--

                                 PRIEST
                        And should stay buried...

           Off Bella’s wicked look we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CHURCH CEMETERY - NIGHT

           ...and Bella deep into a grave, digging it out, filthy.  

           Lighter burned crack pipes and used heroin needles litter the 
           area like discarded candy wrappers. 

           Another deep thrust of the shovel when--

           WHACK! 

           ...the buried treasure... 
           Bella digs around the coffin then lifts it up and uses the 
           hard metal of the shovel to pry it open...

           A body bag inside... opens it...

           A FUCKING ARSENAL OF WEAPONS--

           Grabs the bag and lifts it out of the coffin. Dusts herself 
           off as she notices flowers resting next to the headstone...

           Smiles.

           Steps from the grave, throws the bag of goodies over her 
           shoulder and disappears into the black night as we get our 
           first look at the name on the headstone: ISABELLA DOBBS

           The glint of the moonlight almost highlighting BELLA... 

                                                     BORN AGAIN!

           INT/EXT. PRIEST’S 79 CAMARO Z28 - LATER

           ...and Bella at the wheel, teeth gritted, screaming through 
           the feculent NYC streets of ‘82: nickel peep show joints, 
           flashy porno houses, diamond dusted pimps putting the smack 
           on fishnet clad hookers, pushers pushin’, hustlers hustlin’ 
           and all the bad boogiemen going BOO! in the night....

           ...and the baddest of ‘em all - Bella - weaving in and out of 
           cars, dodging oncoming traffic, pushing the Camaro like a 
           gunslinger would a horse... a Jesus Fish on the back fender, 
           GDS-CHLD hammered across the license plate, one thing on her 
           mind...

                                                             ...REVENGE!

           INT. $.05 PEEP SHOW JOINT - NIGHT

           The joint doesn’t have a name, doesn’t have to, we know what 
           it is... 

           Follow a LOVER-BOY taking a break from mom’s basement for his 
           Saturday night date... a pocket full of nickels and a dream. 

           Walks the neon dusted hallway to his--

           CORNER ROOM

           ...enters, shuts the door, sits, gets comfy, pulls a handful 
           of nickel’s and his dick.
           Scans the songs when...

           Daryl Hall & John Oates ‘you make my dreams’ kicks in 
           seemingly on it’s own... 

           The funky falsetto of jerry curl wearing John Oates screams 
           from the half working speaker:

           what i want, you’ve got
           and it might be hard to handle

           Lover-Boy stares at the rusted out wall mounted juke-box, 
           trying to figure how the fuck the music magically started 
           playing, when-- 

           The divider pulls and... 

           SMACK!

           A GUY WITH HIS HEAD HALF HANGING OFF SLAMS AGAINST THE GLASS

           Behind him, Bella, a blood soaked grin, kills another dude, 
           then another, then another... catches Lover-Boy ‘peepin’, 
           blows him a kiss... 

           Dick goes limp, slot closes...

           Lover-Boy pulls a nickel, jams it into the machine, slot 
           opens, another body hits the glass... then another, then 
           another... 

           Bella putting on a fucking show!

           She locks eyes with Lover-Boy and gives him a little ass 
           shake... just a nickel’s worth though :)

           oh yeah, well well you
           you make my dreams come true

           Lover-Boy, chin nearly hitting his dick at this point, lowers 
           his head to watch as much as he can until the slot closes... 
           bangs another nickel in--

           Another body, then another, then another...

           In the background, neon lights flash: BELLA, BELLA, BELLA 
           like they’re cheering her on. 

           A blood soaked Bella puts the gun’s SILENCER to her mouth 
           like she’s blowing it, does a little perverted dance of death 
           then gives Lover-Boy a wink... does she flash a tit? Nah, not 
           for a nickel...
           ...the slot closes. 

           Another nickel, but this time Bella is gone... leaving a pile 
           of bloodied bodies, and Lover-Boy dateless with a limp dick. 

           MEANWHILE UPSTAIRS...

           A DOOR busts open and a NICKEL SOARS ACROSS THE AIR IN SLO- 
           MOTION landing in front of a PIMP counting stacks and stacks 
           of dirty money... 

           He jumps up...

           A WHISPER from the darkness:

                                 BELLA (O.S.)
                        Dance for me motherfucker... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PIMP STRUNG UP--

           Naked, beaten, bloodied and terrified as Bella sits in his 
           chair, his dirty money all around her...

                                 PIMP
                        I swear I don’t know who tried to 
                        do the cop! I swear!

           Bella shakes her head, puts a bullet into his leg, he 
           screams, no-one gives a shit... 

                                 BELLA
                        Classy guy like you, your finger on 
                        the pulse, you trying to tell me 
                        that you don’t know who put the 
                        contract out?  

           Between sobs-

                                 PIMP
                        I swear! I don’t, I swear! Baby, at 
                        this point I would tell you... 

           Bella just looks at him...

                                 BELLA
                        We know each other?

                                 PIMP
                        What?
                                 BELLA
                        We know each other?

                                 PIMP
                        What?!

                                 BELLA
                        Disrespecting me with that ‘baby’ 
                        shit like maybe you owe me one...

                                 PIMP
                        I call everybody baby...

           Bella shakes her head in disgust... 

                                 BELLA
                        Baby, baby, baby...

           She levels the gun at his dick...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Gimme something, baby...

                                 PIMP
                        Bones! Bones, baby... Bones! 

           Bella just looks at him, waves the gun to tell her more...

                                 PIMP (CONT’D)
                        Cat up in Harlem. Creole from New 
                        Orleans by way of Jamaica or some 
                        shit. Psycho, man... rolls bones 
                        and cuts the heads off live 
                        chickens and shit. That voodoo. 
                        Been beefin’ wit the cops ‘bout 
                        some fleecin’ they doing on his 
                        spots... squeezin’ him and shit. 
                        Could be him sending a message, but 
                        I don’t know, I swear!

                                 BELLA
                        Harlem Bones with the chickens, 
                        huh?

                                 PIMP
                        Dudes a witch! 

           Bella smiles, gets up, and starts walking out...

                                 BELLA
                        Well I’m a ghost...

           As she passes--
                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        BOO!

           He jumps. She laughs, continues past him, letting him live... 

           Exits the office, walks down the stairs and into the--

           CHANGING ROOM

           ...and sea of half naked girls prepping for the night.

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        100k upstairs. Take what you want 
                        and get everyone out of the 
                        building. Leave the pimp. You have 
                        5 minutes...

           The girls look at Bella, gun in hand, covered in blood, 
           serious as a fucking heart attack. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        4 minutes and 55 seconds... 

           They all mad dash for the stairs as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. $.05 PEEP SHOW JOINT - FIVE AND A HALF MINUTES LATER

           One less building bullying for position as the nameless peep 
           show joint burns to the fucking ground...

           The half naked girls scurrying away with armfuls of cash 
           while Bella just looks on, blood covered and satisfied...  

           Catches eyes with Lover-Boy sipping on a root beer and eating 
           a slice of $.25 pizza... grabs a stack of cash from a fleeing 
           girl and tosses it to him with a smile before getting into 
           the Camaro and peeling off down the road. 

           EXT. $.05 PEEP SHOW JOINT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Cop cars circle what’s left of the peep joint... it ain’t 
           much. 

           Firetrucks just leaving the scene, Boys in blue still 
           everywhere... big mustaches and even bigger guts, twirling 
           batons with a million skull dented notches on them... 

           An UNMARKED comes screaming up, stopping inches away from 
           barreling through the crime scene... 
           the king of all 80’s cops steps out from it... 40s, cowboy 
           boots and a coke stained nose... Meet DETECTIVE ADLER DEETS.   

           Walks through the crime scene tape like he’s finishing a 
           marathon... zero fucks!

           Looks around, pulls a Kool menthol from his crushed soft 
           pack, lights it... a long drag, then a smile at a lady of the 
           evening watching the festivities nearby-- 

                                 DEETS
                             (smoke billowing from his 
                              mouth and nose)
                        Hot night in the city, huh? 

           She throws him the bird, he fawns looking insulted...

           The officer in charge - some eager tool who doesn’t deserve a 
           name - hurries over with the stats...

                                 UNNAMED OFFICER TOOL
                        Looks like someone may have torched 
                        the place...

           Deets looks at him, then at the obviously torched building, 
           then back at unnamed officer tool and shakes his head...

                                 DEETS
                        Tip of the spear detective work, 
                        kid... 

           A long hull from his smoke...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        What else you got?

                                 UNNAMED OFFICER TOOL
                        Body inside, looks to be one 
                        Reginald Goodwin... pimp, snitch, 
                        hustler, etc... etc... still 
                        working on the positive though... 
                             (with a shrug)
                        Cooked to a crisp. 

           Deets nods. 

                                 DEETS
                        Eyes?

                                 UNNAMED OFFICER TOOL
                        Coupla whores, coupla homeless, 
                        creepy guy eating pizza...
                                 DEETS
                        Indoor whores?

                                 UNNAMED OFFICER TOOL
                        Outdoor whores.

           Deets exhales... looks around...

                                 DEETS
                        Where’s creepy guy?

           Unnamed Officer Tool points to a guy in the corner being 
           questioned... we know him, it’s Lover-Boy. 

           Walks over, nods to Lover-Boy, then to the OFFICER 
           questioning him who steps aside to brief him...

           Referencing the small white note-pad that you see in every 
           80’s cop movie... thumbs through...  

                                 OFFICER
                        Apparently he was inside when it 
                        went down - standing Saturday night 
                        date...

           They both instinctually cringe as the officer pushes on...

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Caught a room, paid the fare, up 
                        went the slot, not the show he 
                        bargained for... 

           Deets just gives the officer a look...

                                 DEETS
                        What kind of show we talking?

                                 OFFICER
                        The kind where some crazy woman 
                        kills a dozen men while dancing to 
                        Hall & Oates...

           Deets thinks for a second, sniffs hard, the coke drip, 
           swallows it, eyes pin for the second round high off his 
           bump... it’s good shit... lifted from the evidence room, it 
           better be. 

                                 DEETS
                        What song?

           The officer references his notes then turns to Lover-Boy...

                                 OFFICER
                        What song?
           Lover-Boy just stares at him... huh?

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        When you were watching the lady 
                        kill all the bad guys... what Hall 
                        & Oates song?

                                 LOVER-BOY
                        You Make My Dreams...

                          DEETS 
                                                         OFFICER
                 (singing)
                                                (singing)
           You make my dreams come 
           true...
                                              You make my dreams come 
                                              true...

           Both nod, good tune, catchy... 

                                 DEETS
                        Can he ID her?

                                 OFFICER
                        She was drenched in blood, so...

           Officer shrugs... 

                                 DEETS
                        Get me a composite of our girl who 
                        torched that club last night...

           Officer nods. Starts off then turns back--

                                 OFFICER
                        Oh, and get this... apparently 
                        crazy killer lady warned everyone 
                        to get out before she burned the 
                        place down... 

                                 DEETS
                        Hmmm... interesting... 

           Deets flick his smoke then pulls another, lights it, a long 
           hull as he thinks for a second, wheels turning...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Good work, officer... 

           Gives the Officer a slap on the arm and walks over to Lover-
           Boy...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        My guy tells me you got more than 
                        your nickels worth tonight...
           The stack of cash hidden in Lover-Boys drawers, he definitely 
           got more than his nickel’s worth... 

                                 LOVER-BOY
                        It was a show...

                                 DEETS
                        Can you ID the star?

                                 LOVER-BOY
                        Maybe?

           Deets yells to the officer...

                                 DEETS
                        Where’s my mark-up?

           The officer hustles over with a photographed copy of the 
           composite sketch we saw on the TV earlier... that was bad, 
           this photocopied version is worse. 

           Deets grabs it and shows it to Lover-Boy.

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        This her?

           Lover-Boy looks at the joke of a composite sketch... uh... 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                             (a slight nod)
                        Nod yes.

           Lover-Boy slowly nods yes.

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Boom. Positive ID, good. 

           Throws the composite sketch to nobody in-particular, it falls 
           to the ground, doesn’t matter...

           Then he yells to nobody in-particular...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Got a fire-starter with a bloodlust 
                        for baddies out there, gents... 

           Deets walks past the officer on his way back to his car...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Run a check on crispy the pimp’s 
                        known associates and cross them 
                        with Castrovano and the wops that 
                        got greased last night. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Gimme the matches... got a feeling 
                        this is personal for her. 

           The officer nods.

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                             (over his shoulder as he 
                              heads for his car)
                        And lemme know if you find anything 
                        else in the peep joint might get me 
                        hard... Im’a go knock on some 
                        doors. 

                                 LOVER-BOY
                        Hey! Don’t I get a reward or 
                        something for this?

           Deets digs into his pocket, pulls a quarter and thumbs it to 
           Lover-Boy...

                                 DEETS
                        Grab yourself another slice. 

           Gets into his car and peels away. 

           INT. CHURCH OF HEAVENLY REST - ATTIC - NIGHT

           The place is empty but for broken church pews, busted 
           candelabras, rusted offering trays and a few religious 
           statues that look worse than Bella’s composite sketch... 

           A tattered mattress on the floor, the who’s who of NYC 
           baddies tacked to the wall... photos and mug shots from end 
           to end... 

           ...and Bella, wet hair from having just showered, standing 
           over them in an oversized STEVIE WONDER concert T.

           A massive X over Salvatore ‘Chooch’ Castrovano’s mug shot. 
           She picks up a marker and adds an X over Reginald ‘Crispy 
           Pimp’ Goodwin’s mug... NEXT!!!!!! 

           Stares at the rest of the shots, studying them, when--

           THE TIP OF A GUN’S SILENCER slowly creeps towards the back of 
           her head from the darkness...

           Before it kisses her skull she turns and, moving like 
           lightning, punches it out of the hitter’s hand. 

           The dude steps from the darkness, 40’s, a hard looking 
           motherfucker with purpose in his eyes... 
           a savage grin, ready, pulls a blade, slashes at Bella who 
           lunges back and rips off her T in stride... 

           Just a bra and panties on now as she wraps Stevie Wonder 
           around her arm and blocks the next knife thrust, then 
           another, then another...    

           Dives onto one of the pews then flips over it to gain some 
           distance...

           ...but this hard motherfucker keeps coming:

           SLASHING!

           KICKING!

           MOVING LIKE A RUNAWAY TRAIN!

           Jesus fucking Christ this guy’s good! 

           Even the busted up religious statues look impressed... 

           Bella on the defensive, on her back, monkey rolling to get 
           distance while the hitter stands over her, stomping as he 
           follows, trying to crush her skull with his boot...

           She grabs a rusted offering tray and holds it up as a shield, 
           just in time to deflect his size 12 steel toed shit kicker 
           from caving in her face... 

           Pushes him back enough to fling the tray like a frisbee... 

           OOOF!

           Hits him in the neck, he falls back choking. 

           Bella moves to a busted pew where a SHOTGUN hides underneath, 
           grabs it, pulls it, points it...

           He was able to grab his gun too...

           They both lie on the floor, bloodied, busted, breathing 
           heavy, gun barrels pointing at each other...  

                                 HARD LOOKING MOTHERFUCKER
                        I had you to the dome while you 
                        were stargazing at America’s most 
                        wanted.

           Bella rolls her eyes...

                                 BELLA
                        Fuck you, I smelled your cheap 
                        cologne while I was in the shower. 
           The man puts his gun down.  

                                 HARD LOOKING MOTHERFUCKER
                        Getting soft, baby doll...

                                 BELLA
                        Save that macho ‘baby doll’ shit 
                        for the cheap seats...  

           He gets to his feet and tries to help her up. She swats his 
           hand away. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need your help.
                             (to herself)
                        Fucking jackass...

           He smiles as she gets up on her own, slowly... 

           Gives him a hard look as she goes to grab her T to put back 
           on... every kind of tension you can think of between these 
           two.

           The guy pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket as Bella 
           tosses the T back on... shredded to threads, might as well 
           still be shirtless... 

           Stares at the guy as he lights his smoke--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Fucking prick, I loved this T!

           A long hull as he smiles and blows the smoke out his nose and 
           mouth...

                                 HARD LOOKING MOTHERFUCKER
                        You had better. I paid $20 for it 
                        when I took you to the show. 

           Bella walks over and grabs the smoke from his mouth... a drag 
           then puts it out on his jacket. 

           Looks around at the Church...

                                 BELLA
                        Have a little respect for once, 
                        would ya?!

           The guy laughs and nods to Bella’s murder list on the wall...

           FREEZE FRAME 

           On his wicked grin... 
           JERICHO ‘so bad ass he deserves the one fucking freeze frame 
           in the movie’ DEK, ladies and gentleman. 

           ACTION RESUMES

           On Jericho walking to the door...

                                 JERICHO
                        Let’s go...

                                 BELLA
                        Where?!

                                 JERICHO
                             (over his shoulder as he 
                              leaves)
                        To get pie...

           Off Bella’s annoyed look we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DINER

           Apple pie, coffee and the two of them sitting across from 
           each other, silent...

           Jericho pours the 18th creamer into his coffee...

           Bella looks at his stomach then back at him--

                                 BELLA
                        Still with all that cream, huh? 

           He smiles, adds another for good measure...

                                 JERICHO
                        Why didn’t you invite me clubbing 
                        last night?

                                 BELLA
                        Didn’t need a dance partner. 

                                 JERICHO
                        And tossin’ the peep joint? That 
                        some kind of woman’s empowerment 
                        statement you’re making?

                                 BELLA
                        I look like I need to make a 
                        statement to feel empowered?
           Is she going to dive over the table and strangle him? Maybe? 
           That would be a statement... 

           Jericho smiles, a bite of his pie...

           A long beat as he looks at her, heavy eyes--

                                 JERICHO
                        I’m sorry about your dad. 

           It’s genuine. 

           Bella nods, swallowing the pain, as Jericho drills down 
           another bite...

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                             (a mouthful of pie)
                        What’s the plan? 

                                 BELLA
                        Kill ‘em all. 

                                 JERICHO
                        Simple plan.

                                 BELLA
                        Simple gal. 

                                 JERICHO
                        Any ideas?

                                 BELLA
                        Not yet, but I’m working on it...

           Jericho smiles. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Harlem Bones with the chickens... 
                        ring any bells?

                                 JERICHO
                        Yep. 

           A long beat, then--

                                 BELLA
                        And..?

                                 JERICHO
                        It’s a serious bell, Bell. 

                                 BELLA
                             (shaking her head)
                        Lame... 
                                 JERICHO
                        You asking me for help?

                                 BELLA
                        Fuck you. 

           Jericho smiles, shovels more pie into his trap...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about him... 

           A beat as Jericho considers, then... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Why’d you leave?

                                 BELLA
                        Now? Really?!

           Jericho just stares at her, hurt plain on his face... she 
           sees it, relents, owes him an explanation, exhales as she 
           looks away...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Protect my dad. 

           She laughs to herself - the irony - as she pushes the emotion 
           back... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        They weren’t gonna stop coming for 
                        me. Sure as shit weren’t gonna get 
                        me...

           Jericho laughs.

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I kept busting up their operations 
                        and... matter of time before the 
                        money was too much and they came 
                        for him to get to me... the badge 
                        would only protect him for so long. 

           Beat.

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        So I killed myself and 
                        disappeared... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Killed me too. 

           Fucking loaded! 
           Bella nods... what can she even say to that? 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        How’s life after death?

           Bella takes a sip of her coffee, forks at her pie.

                                 BELLA
                        Apple pie. 

                                 JERICHO
                        Got a regular job type job?

                                 BELLA
                        What’s a regular job type job?

                                 JERICHO
                        Something where you’re punchin’ a 
                        clock and not someone’s ticket... 

           Bella smiles, nods.

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Customer service or some shit like 
                        that? Real estate? You peddling 
                        real estate?!

                                 BELLA
                        You looking to relocate?

                                 JERICHO
                        And leave all this?

           Across the street a working girl flashes her ass at a 
           potential John driving by as her pimp yells out ‘it’s good 
           shit’...  

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Never.

           They smile... 

           An uncomfortable beat while Jericho screws it up to ask...

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Anyone... husband? 

           Almost chokes on the word.

           Bella just stares at him... Jericho nods, different life, 
           gets it. 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry you had to come back...
                                 BELLA
                        Yeah...

                                 JERICHO
                        Can you at least say it’s not all 
                        bad? I’m right fucking here, can 
                        you at least stroke my ego a bit 
                        and humor me for a goddamn second? 

           Bella smiles, it’s genuine. 

                                 BELLA
                        Nah... 

           Jericho shakes his head. 

                                 JERICHO
                        How’s the priest?

                                 BELLA
                        Biblical. 

                                 JERICHO
                        He coming outta retirement? Maybe 
                        shed the collar for one more lap?

           Bella shakes her head. 

                                 BELLA
                        Those days are over for him, I 
                        wouldn’t ask him for that. He’s 
                        helping where he can though, with 
                        dad daily, things like that...

           Jericho nods.

                                 JERICHO
                        You know it’s only a matter of time 
                        before they realize it’s you... I 
                        went to the grave, Bella, you 
                        fucking dug it up and left it 
                        open... 

           Bella nods, grits her teeth.

                                 BELLA
                        I want ‘em to know who’s coming. 

                                 JERICHO
                        They find out it’s you, every 
                        hitter in New York City’s gonna be 
                        shining their gun for that 
                        trophy... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JERICHO (CONT'D)
                        Bella’s head on their mantle... 
                        they’re gonna tear out your fucking 
                        heart.  

                                 BELLA
                        They already did. 

           Bella slugs her coffee then gets up and goes into her pocket. 

                                 JERICHO
                        Hey...

           Jericho shakes his head, no. Bella smiles.

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Lemme help you. 

           Bella just looks at him, Jericho nods, gets it.... 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        I had you. You know it, I had 
                        you...

           Bella nods and leans down as she walks by, kisses him softly 
           on the lips...

                                 BELLA
                             (a whisper)
                        Yeah you did... 

           They just look at each other for a long loaded moment...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the pie, stud. Lay off 
                        the cream... 

           Bella smiles and exits the diner.

           Jericho watches her through the window as she disappears..... 

           .......................................................again.

           His face grows hard as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           THAT SAME HARD LOOK --

           But now instead of staring out at Bella we--

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           ...he’s staring across a table at HARLEM BONES. 
           6’3”, 320 pounds with a face like an elephants ass from two-a-
           days at the tanning salon. His head lumpy and misshapen, his 
           skin covered with faded basement tats... dudes about as ugly 
           as a man can be before you’re forced to look away...

           Sitting across from Jericho, staring at him, a half dozen 
           sycophant soldiers on each hip, foaming at the fucking 
           mouth... welcome to the psychopath factory!

           Bones speaks with that Jamaica meets Creole meets NYC spit-- 

                                 HARLEM BONES
                        And why should I believe you, I’m 
                        next? Ain’t have nuttin’ to do wit 
                        that cop gettin’ hit... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Don’t matter you did or not. She 
                        thinks you might have, you did...

           Bones smiles, gold teeth before they were even fashionable... 

           Shakes his hand, lets it go, CHICKEN BONES roll onto the 
           table... he studies them, smells them, looks back at Jericho--

                                 HARLEM BONES
                        We believe you...

           We..?

                                 HARLEM BONES (CONT’D)
                        Why you here though, what it do for 
                        you?

                                 JERICHO
                        Two reasons... she turned her back 
                        on me, so fuck her. And money... 

           Bones gives him a look... in the b.g a SQUAWKING CHICKEN runs 
           by... in a brownstone... in Harlem... no one seems to think 
           that’s strange. 

                                 HARLEM BONES
                        Mmmmhmmm...

                                 JERICHO
                        500k, I’ll kill her when she 
                        comes...

           Bones laughs, looks around at his soldiers...

                                 HARLEM BONES
                        I have killers... 
           Jericho looks at the soldiers, laughs out loud...

                                 JERICHO
                        No you don’t.

           The dozen men all pulls guns... JERICHO POUNCES!

           It doesn’t last but 30 seconds, but it’s vicious, it’s 
           savage, and it’s a fucking statement... broken bodies 
           everywhere, Jericho covered in everyone’s blood but his own, 
           standing behind Bones, a blade to his neck...

           Leans in with a whisper... 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        You need to roll them bones again 
                        or we good?

           Bones rolls them bones again, the blade to his neck... 
           studies them, leans in to smell them, the blade cuts his neck 
           a bit, blood trickles, a slow grin--

                                 HARLEM BONES
                        We good. 

           Jericho smiles. 

           MEANWHILE, SOMEWHERE ACROSS TOWN... 

           A size 12 cowboy boot stomps on some poor bastards skull... 
           we follow the boot-----> the leg ^ the body-----> DEETS, 
           possessed, working the fucker’s skull like a foot-pump. 

                                 DEETS
                        GIMME WHAT YOU GOT! GIMME WHAT YOU 
                        GOT! 

                                 POOR FUCKER
                        Ain’t got nothin’, man! Ain’t know 
                        nothin’ ‘bout no lady killin--

           STOMP!

           A TOOTH flies from his mouth as we FOLLOW IT off the balcony 
           to--

           DEETS SOARING THROUGH THE AIR, crashing down on ANOTHER GUY 
           from having jumped off the balcony three floors up... SAVAGE!  

           They land on the ultimate 80’s shagin’ wagon with a--

           THUD!
           Bones break, blood sprays, DOLLY PARTON’S ‘9 to 5’ starts 
           playing from the pancaked wagon’s tape-deck as Deets beats 
           the bag outta this dude in synch with the opening piano key 
           licks: 

           doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

           QUICK CUTS of:

           Deets beating on VARIOUS GUYS to Dolly singing--

           tumble outta bed
           and stumble to the kitchen

           ANOTHER GUY flying face first from his bedroom, half naked, 
           half asleep, stumbling into his kitchen as Deets, gun raised, 
           charges after him...

           pour myself a cup of ambition

           Deets smashing a full coffee pot over ANOTHER POOR SAP’s 
           head, scolding hot coffee nearly melts the dudes face off...

           yawn and stretch and try to come to life

           Deets yawns, stretches, rips another key bump of coke...

           jump in the shower
           and the blood starts pumping

           Deets, in a shit-stained bathroom, choking ANOTHER GUY with a 
           shower curtain while blood pours from every orifice of the 
           poor fuckers body 

           out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin’

           Deets chasing ANOTHER GUY across a busy NYC street, dodging 
           cars when a BUS comes flying in and BOOM! runs the poor 
           fucker over... Deets barely even flinches cause he’s--

           WORKING 9-5!
           .................................what a way to make a livin’!

           We keep on Deets at work as Dolly serenades us those blue 
           collar troubles:

           - beats some guy with a yellow pages!
           - beats some guy with a stolen hub cap at a chop shop!
           - chokes some guy out with the dudes own fucking belt, his 
           drawers around his ankles, guy pisses his underwear... 

           Deets going berserk as Dolly proclaims:
           I SWEAR SOMETIMES THE MAN IS OUT TO GET ME!

           End montage of cuts on:

           Deets on top of ANOTHER SCUMBAG, his .45 jammed into the guys 
           mouth...

                                 DEETS
                        Huh? What?!

           Struggling to speak...

                                 THE SCUMBAG
                             (muffled)
                        Bella!

           Deets pushes the gun farther down the dudes throat...

                                 DEETS
                        Fuck you just say?!

                                 THE SCUMBAG
                             (choking on the gun)
                        Bella, man! Hear it’s some chick 
                        named Bella!

           Deets looks like he just saw a ghost...

                                 DEETS
                             (to himself, horrified)
                        No...

           Off Deets’s fallen face we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           BELLA...

           ...in the CHURCH ATTIC--

           Smacking a fully loaded clip into a bad ass looking gun with 
           a grenade launcher attached to it. 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           ...the arsenal of weapons laid out around her... prepping for 
           the fucking war! 

           She picks up an EXPLOSIVE DEVICE as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE...

           ...being rigged to a doorway.

           PULL BACK to reveal:

           JERICHO booby trapping Harlem Bones’s brownstone...

           PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal:

           BOMBS everywhere...  

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM as we-- 

           FAST FORWARD through both Bella and Jericho readying for war:

           -Bella loads her arsenal, checks her explosives, pours over 
           schematics of Harlem Bones’s brownstone 

           -Jericho continues to rig Harlem Bones’s entire brownstone 
           with explosives, throws guns to dozens of soldiers, positions 
           men all over the compound 

           ACTION RESUMES TO NORMAL SPEED AS:

           THE SCREEN DIVIDES INTO TWO HALVES--

           HALF LEFT: Bella, stunningly savage, wearing a tight black 
           body suit, slicked back hair with a rouge lip and a bullet 
           proof vest with all the trimmings... dressed to kill 
           (literally) loading her arsenal into the Camaro Z28

           HALF RIGHT: Jericho, a bullet proof vest on, strapped with 
           guns, knives and grenades checks his watch as he readies his 
           men and activates the bombs

           A THIRD BOX RISES UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN... 

           It keeps rising, slowly erasing both Bella and Jericho, 
           eventually revealing DEETS - in full frame - standing over 
           Bella’s dug up grave...

           He stares straight into the camera:

                                 DEETS
                        Fuck!

           Suddenly the sky opens and it starts to pour... 

           The CLAP of thunder. Then another CLAP. Then TWO MORE in 
           rapid fire until we realize... 
           ..that ain’t thunder--

                                                           SMASH IN ON:

           4 DEAD GUYS WHO USED TO BE GUARDING THE FRONT DOOR--

           ...bullet shots to the head. 

           And Bella with a MASSIVE BOOM-BOX out on the roof of the 
           Camaro, scanning a little container full of CASSETTE TAPES:

           Stevie Wonder
           Chicago
           John Mellencamp
           Toto

           ...what’s she feeling, what’s she feeling..? 

           A smile as she keys in on the one she knows she can groove 
           to: pulls it, stuffs it into the boom-box’s tape-deck... 

           Hits play and CRANKS THE VOLUME as a RASPY VOICE rings out:

           AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!

           ...and the funky base lick of JAMES BROWN’S ‘get up offa that 
           thing’ kicks in: 

           boom, yeah, boom, yeah, say it now...  

           ...and JB screaming at the top of his lungs as we-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           JERICHO

           Smiling... he knows what this is: BELLA’S WAR CRY!

           QUICK CLIPS OF:

           I’m back! - a bullet through the window takes another guy out

           I’m back! - another bullet whistles in, another body drops

           I’m back! - splat! A head explodes

           I’m back! - a guy with a third eye dances back, flips ass 
           over end down a flight of stairs 

           The sound of BULLET SHOTS duet with the funky song as JB 
           urges us to:
           get up offa that thing
           and dance ‘till you feel better

           BACK TO:

           Jericho turning to Harlem Bones--

                                 JERICHO
                        Stay here. Don’t move. 

           Slaps the clip to ready in his .50 Cal killer, smiles and 
           goes out to join the party--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PARTY

           ...full fucking throttle as James Brown continues to provide 
           the dance music and Bella eviscerates dozens of soldiers...

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!

           They come, they drop, she moves like nothing we’ve ever seen 
           before...

           A soldier flies out of the darkness like a wolverine, a knife 
           in hand. Bella spin kicks him, catching him in mid air and 
           sending him back into a wall, landing on one of the bombs 
           Jericho set--

           KABOOM! 

           The guy explodes into dozens of pieces, his body absorbing 
           the impact of the bomb.  

           Brains and guts hit Bella as her face drops, takes cover, 
           quickly looks around... 

           QUICK CUTS OF HER POV AS SHE SCANS THE ROOM:

           Bomb
           Bomb
           Bomb
           Bomb
           Bomb
           Bomb

           The whole fucking place is rigged... they knew she was 
           coming...but how?!

           All the sudden Jericho emerges from the darkness, storming at 
           her, gun raised, has her dead to rights... BANG!
           THE WORLD AROUND US SLOWS AS WE--

           Follow a BULLET in SLO-MOTION screaming towards Bella’s 
           head... 

           She’s got no chance, the bullet whistling towards her, 
           centimeters from her head, when...

           ...it dusts her hair and buries itself into the forehead of a 
           soldier behind her!

           She looks at Jericho who just winks at her and mouths ‘you’re 
           welcome’... 

           She rolls her eyes, stands and gets back to back with him... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Place is wired!

                                 BELLA
                        Yeah, no shit!

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

           They both take two more out. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck are you doing?!

           BANG! BANG!

           Jericho drops two more--

                                 JERICHO
                        Saving your ass! 

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

           Bella drops three more then turns and BANG! shoots the hand 
           off a soldier with a knife charging towards Jericho... hand 
           drops, knife drops, soldier drops... 

                                 BELLA
                        You were saying?!

           A shit eating grin on Jericho’s face--

                                 JERICHO
                        Hot damn, I missed this!

           They disengage as they continue to put on the most 
           spectacular killing display we’ve ever seen... 
           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!

           A surgical presentation of death and destruction as James 
           Brown yells at us to ‘get on up’ and they storm the 
           brownstone, turning it into their personal funhouse of death!   

           Every time it looks like they might be fucked, Jericho sets 
           off a bomb he’s hidden or a booby trap he’s rigged - killing 
           dozens of men - and opening it all back up for them... it’s 
           an incredible display!

           A sea of broken bodies, Jericho and Bella standing over them, 
           James Brown still yelling, the brownstone moaning... 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Gonna crumble any second, we need 
                        to go!

                                 BELLA
                        Where’s Bones?!

                                                                CUT TO:

           HARLEM BONES

           Standing in front of a door, gun in hand...

           The door busts open! 

           He fires, they fire, bullets scream pass each other, everyone 
           is hit!

           Bella and Jericho to the vests, Bones to the head... two 
           bullets, one center forehead the other through his mouth...

           They just stare at him... a beat then...

                                 JERICHO
                        I was the forehead. 

           Bella shakes her head as the building GROWLS again, louder! 

           Jericho looks at her--

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Gotta move!

                                 BELLA
                        Not yet, not yet!

           Jericho just gives her a look...
                                 JERICHO
                        What?!

           As we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HARLEM BONES’S BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

           ...and Bella and Jericho fumbling out the door, holding and 
           trying to coral A DOZEN LIVE CHICKENS...

                                 BELLA
                        I didn’t need your goddam help!

                                 JERICHO
                        Yes ya did!

           A chicken’s wing flaps up and whacks Jericho in the mouth...

                                 BELLA
                        Nope!

           Jericho spitting feathers--

                                 JERICHO
                        A thank-you would be nice...

                                 BELLA
                        Never!

           Bella looks over to find the priests Z-28 Camaro pancaked in 
           with 6 dead bodies on top of it... 

           The WAIL OF POLICE SIRENS in the b.g.

           Bella turns to Jericho--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I need your help...

                                 JERICHO
                        What the fuck do we do with these 
                        chickens?

           Off Bella’s look we--

                                                                CUT TO:
           JERICHO’S ‘71 BOSS 442 

           Screaming down the NYC street, a DOZEN CHICKENS frantically 
           pin-balling around inside as Jericho aggressively takes 
           corners...

           Feathers flying...

           Chickens shitting...

           Jericho, clearly pissed, white knuckling the wheel.

           A long moment of silence before--

                                 BELLA
                        What were we supposed to--

                                 JERICHO
                        DON’T! Just...

           Jericho exhales deeply as he takes his aggression out on the 
           mighty 442’s gas peddle...

           Bella just stares ahead as a CHICKEN turns to Jericho, stares 
           at him, then ANGRILY SQUAWKS in his face.

           Bella looks at the chicken--

                                 BELLA
                        You and me both... 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           Jericho’s horse pulls up outside of the hospital, engine 
           sweating, breathing heavy... 

           INSIDE THE CAR--

           Bella looks to the hospital then to Jericho; vulnerable, self-
           conscious...

                                 BELLA
                        Got a towel or something? Don’t 
                        want to be around dad like this...

           Jericho looks at her; she’s pained, scared... he nods. 

           Shoo’s a couple chickens off a shirt in the back seat, hands 
           it to her. 

           She wipes the blood off her face, neck and hands...
                                 JERICHO
                        It wasn’t Bones, by the way... 
                        Talked to him about it, probed him 
                        while I was playing the set-up, 
                        wasn’t him. 

                                 BELLA
                        He was due.

           Bella finishes wiping down then gives the blood stained shirt 
           back to him...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        How do I look?

           He looks at her, reaches over, wipes some blood from her 
           face... she’s beautiful... wants to say it, but nods 
           instead... it’s his way and it’s enough.  

           They stare at each other for a long moment, then--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

                                 JERICHO
                        Fuck you.

           She smiles as she opens the car door...

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Front?

                                 BELLA
                        Nah. Cops are everywhere inside. 
                        Whoever else too... maybe they know 
                        it’s me by now... 

           Jericho nods. 

           As she gets out--

                                 JERICHO
                        What the fuck do I do with all 
                        these chickens?!

                                 BELLA
                             (over her shoulder)
                        You’ll figure it out...

           He just smiles to himself as he watches her creep up to the 
           side of the hospital, scales the wall, and sneaks into--

           JACOB’S HOSPITAL ROOM
           The dim lights of the life-support machines illuminating the 
           darkness as she crawls in from the window. 

           A small army of cops guarding the door, bullshitting too 
           loudly, and-- 

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....

           Bella quietly locks the door then pulls up a chair next to 
           her father’s bed. She grabs his hand--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Hey dad... 

           But he doesn’t answer... just--

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....

           She rests her head on his shoulder, shuts her eyes... 

           Silence but for the sound of Jacob hanging on for dear life 
           and Bella crying herself to sleep... 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           ..................TEN SECONDS OF BLACKNESS...................

           As the SOUND OF RAIN assaulting the city GROWS LOUDER and we--

                                                            FADE IN ON:

           AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF--

           HARLEM BONES’S BROWNSTONE (what’s left of it) as we-- 

           CRANE DOWN WITH THE RAIN, following it...

           ...through the roof that’s no longer there, past a wall half 
           blown to shit, to meet-- 

           DEETS, standing in the middle of it all, studying the scene, 
           stepping all over the chalk outlined bodies (what’s left of 
           them) as the hard rain tries to rip right through him...  

                                 DEETS
                             (to himself, looking 
                              around)
                        Bella, Bella, Bella...

           A chalked up arm here, a leg missing it’s foot there, a 
           bleeding torso fucking up it’s chalk outline over there... 
           is that... is that some dudes blown off head on the mantle 
           there?! 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        ...beautiful.

           Deets walks over and stares at the head-- 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me, pal...

           He waits... nope. 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, so what else is new. 

           An OFFICER approaches...

                                 OFFICER
                        So, from what I can tell, it looks 
                        like-- 

                                 DEETS
                        Save it. 

           Deets looks around... 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Gotta be something... gimme, 
                        something here, Bella... 

           Shakes his head...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        No way this was just one hitter... 

                                 OFFICER
                        One hitter?!

           The officer looks at the sea of dead bodies...

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking twenty, twenty-five 
                        maybe... rival gang, probably...

           He fades off as Deets just ignores him and walks on by...

           Heads outside, studies the area, looks around for something, 
           anything that stands out, when he spots the PRIEST’S CAMERO Z-
           28... out of place in a neighborhood like this... 
           Pancaked in, dead bodies bleeding all over it... leans down 
           to get a look at the license plate, moves a dead guys draped 
           hand from shielding it... GDS-CHLD.

           A smile...

                                 DEETS
                        ...ask and you shall receive.  

           INT. CHURCH OF HEAVENLY REST - LATER THAT NIGHT

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

           Four loud raps on the door as Priest hurries to open it...

           DEETS stands outside with a smile, rain still pouring hard.  

                                 PRIEST
                        Church is closed for the night, 
                        son... 

                                 DEETS
                        Of course it is, this is a personal 
                        matter...

           Flashes his badge, looks inside...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        May I?

                                 PRIEST
                        Of course, of course...
                             (opening the door to allow 
                              him inside)
                        Please. 

           Deets enters, semi-uneasy - last time he was in a church some 
           whiskey breathed priest was dunking him in a basin...

           Priest looks to the pews...

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Sit, sit. 

           Deets dusts the rain from his hair, sits, Priest follows - a 
           worried look on his face he’s trying to mask... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you, officer?

           Deets looks around...
                                 DEETS
                        You, uh...

           Looks back to Priest. 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        You own a ‘79 Camaro Z-28 license 
                        plate GDS-CHLD.

                                 PRIEST
                        I do... 

           Deets just nods... 

                                 DEETS
                        Can I see it?

                                 PRIEST
                        It was, uh... it was actually 
                        stolen recently...  
                             (beat...)
                        Is that why you’re here? Did you 
                        find it?

                                 DEETS
                        Did you report it stolen?

                                 PRIEST
                        I didn’t...

                                 DEETS
                        Then why would you assume I found 
                        it?

           They’re dancin’, Priest decides to lead for a second... 

                                 PRIEST
                        A police officer knocks on my door 
                        at 11pm asking about my car that 
                        was recently stolen, I assume the 
                        connection... 

           Deets nods...

                                 DEETS
                        Why didn’t you report it stolen? 

                                 PRIEST
                        I’m a benefit of the doubt kind of 
                        guy... figured maybe they’d return 
                        it...
                                 DEETS
                        That a ‘turn the other cheek’ 
                        thing?

                                 PRIEST
                        Called faith. 

           Deets laughs out loud. 

                                 DEETS
                        Found it pancaked in with six dead 
                        bodies on it outside a murder 
                        mansion up in Harlem tonight. 

           Priest just looks at him...

                                 PRIEST
                        Well that’s upsetting.

                                 DEETS
                             (with a shrug)
                        They were drug dealers and killers, 
                        so...

           He flicks the comment out like stale bread to a pigeon, 
           Priest doesn’t bite...  

                                 PRIEST
                        All God’s children.

           Deets laughs.

                                 DEETS
                        He needs to make some cuts... 

           A moment of silence before--

                                 PRIEST
                        Can I--

                                 DEETS
                        Where were you tonight, Father?

                                 PRIEST
                        Here. At the church...

                                 DEETS
                        All night?

                                 PRIEST
                        Yes. 

                                 DEETS
                        Anyone corroborate that?
           Priest looks to the sky...

                                 PRIEST
                        Just me and God.

                                 DEETS
                        Yeah, he ain’t been helpful in 
                        years... 

           A moment then--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Lemme ask you something, how hard 
                        was it for you to change your ways?

           Priest just looks at him, smiles through gritted teeth...

                                 PRIEST
                        You need to confess, officer.

                                 DEETS
                        Nope. 

           Deets pulls a folder he’s been hiding inside his overcoat, 
           opens it... MUG SHOTS of a much younger Priest with a RAP 
           SHEET a mile long... 

           Priest doesn’t even fucking glance at it...

                                 PRIEST
                        Born again...

           Enough dancin’...

                                 DEETS
                        Speaking of born again... where is 
                        she?

           Priest just looks at Deets...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Look, your car was found at the 
                        scene of a massacre, you have no 
                        alibi and a rap sheet a mile 
                        long... I put this on you and take 
                        you in for questioning or you tell 
                        me where she is. I went to the 
                        grave, I know it’s her. I know you 
                        know... help me. She can’t keep 
                        killing like this without a bullet 
                        eventually kissing her back and I 
                        know you don’t want that. 

           Silence.
                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        I know her father. I like him. A 
                        lot. Great cop, better man-- 

                                 PRIEST
                        Are you a great cop, better man?

                                 DEETS
                        I’m effective.

           They lock eyes...no one’s fucking blinking...................

           Another moment before Deets cocks a smile--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        I want to get whoever tried to 
                        punch his ticket as badly as 
                        anyone, but killing through the 
                        city of New York to do it ain’t the 
                        way... 

                                 PRIEST
                        I agree.

                                 DEETS
                        But you won’t help me...

                                 PRIEST
                        If I could... 

           As if on cue A SQUAWKING CHICKEN comes steaming by... then 
           another... then another... 

           The men just stare at each other...

                                 DEETS
                        Building The Ark?

                                 PRIEST
                        Something like that... 

                                 DEETS
                        Okay, okay, okay, okay... 

           Deets nods, smiles, looks to Priest with hard eyes...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        You like the Police, Father?

                                 PRIEST
                        I do... 

           As Deets gets up, over his shoulder as he leaves...
           Singing the lyrics to The Police’s ‘every breath you take’:

                                 DEETS
                        I’ll be watching you... 

           He exits as Priest’s face hardens. 

           INT. CHURCH OF HEAVENLY REST - ATTIC

           Priest stands in front of the wall Bella put together with 
           all the mug shots on it... 3 down, a lot to go... he exhales 
           deeply.

           EXT. CHURCH OF HEAVENLY REST - MOMENTS LATER

           Priest exits the church, locks up, looks around as he pulls 
           his jacket collar tight against the driving wind and rain and 
           heads off up the street...

           In the distance, HEADLIGHTS blink on and a CAR slowly creeps 
           to follow as we-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Three light taps at the door wakes Bella from her sleep... 
           another tap then the sound of something being sent in under 
           the door.

           Bella cautiously walks over, a note, opens it, reads it:

           it’s me, we need to talk 

           Bella quietly unlocks the door as Priest enters and shuts it 
           right behind him. 

                                 BELLA
                        How bad?

                                 PRIEST
                        Bad enough that the police paid me 
                        a visit... 

           Bella nods.

                                 BELLA
                        The car?

           Priest nods. Bella shakes her head...  
                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Got out of hand and... 

                                 PRIEST
                        It’s okay, but we have to talk...

           Bella looks at her father then back at Priest--

                                 BELLA
                        Not here.

                                 PRIEST
                        Can’t leave just yet, the cop 
                        followed me here... 

           Priest exhales, thinks...

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        The hospital rectory. Two floors 
                        up, can you get to it?

           Bella nods.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Meet me there...

           Bella makes her way to the window. Priest waits until she’s 
           gone then walks over to Jacob... exhales... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        I know. I know. I’ll protect her, 
                        whatever it takes. Whatever it 
                        takes, you have my word... 

           Kisses Jacob on the forehead then leaves the room as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE HOSPITAL RECTORY

           ...and Bella and Priest mid convo--  

                                 PRIEST
                        This is not the way, Bella. 

                                 BELLA
                        Then how?

                                 PRIEST
                        Let the police handle it... 
                                 BELLA
                        You mean the idiots laughing and 
                        grab assin’ outside of dad’s 
                        hospital room all day and night?
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        They couldn’t help mom, they won’t 
                        help dad... it’s me. 

                                 PRIEST
                        This one that visited me today is 
                        different... he’s complicated, but 
                        I saw it in his eyes, he wants 
                        it...  

           Bella just looks away, shakes her head, can’t hear it...  

           Priest just stares at her, smiles... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        You were eight when we started? You 
                        remember?

           Bella smiles and nods... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Came home crying that some boy was 
                        picking on you and embarrassing 
                        you, lifting your dress. 

                                 BELLA
                        Toby Muskowitz. 

                                 PRIEST
                        You told your parents and, well, 
                        your mom was too sweet and dad... 
                        you know Jacob; be the bigger 
                        person, ignore them...

                                 BELLA
                        Some things in this world you just 
                        can’t ignore...

           Loaded! They look at each other as Priest exhales, nods...

                                 PRIEST
                        I was more of an Old Testament guy 
                        at the time and, well...

                                                                CUT TO:
           FLASHBACK OF:

           a YOUNGER PRIEST - rough looking, hard, not yet a man of the 
           cloth - a MARINE SPECIAL FORCES HAT on, teaching an 8 YEAR 
           OLD cute as a button BELLA to throw a punch...

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 PRIEST
                        You picked it up quickly... 

           Bella laughs to herself. 

                                 BELLA
                        Toby Muskowitz never picked on me 
                        again, that’s for sure...

           They both smile...

                                 PRIEST
                        Then the next week you come home 
                        with blood all over your dress and 
                        your parents get a call from the 
                        principal saying that you beat 
                        three boys up for calling a couple 
                        of the poorer, less fortunate girls 
                        in class names...  

           A beat...

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        I knew what was living inside of 
                        you, I had the same animal living 
                        inside of me, could see it in your 
                        eyes... so I taught you...

           FLASHBACK CLIPS OF:

           PRIEST - a little older now - teaching a 10 YR OLD BELLA how 
           to fight with a knife, showing her kill points on one of her 
           DOLLS... she spins the blade in her hand, stabbing the doll, 
           working the knife like a fucking surgeon. 

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        How to use it. Channel it--

           PRIEST - a little older now - meditating with a 13 YEAR OLD 
           BELLA... she fidgets, he calms her, pushing her to focus...

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Direct it--
           PRIEST - a little older now - dropping a 16 YEAR OLD BELLA 
           off in a filthy NYC alley... dealers, crackhead, pimps, 
           etc... 

           He watches from the car, his MARINE SPECIAL FORCES HAT pulled 
           low, as Bella calls to a few PIMPS and DEALERS... FOUR 
           approach, pull switchblades, she smiles, makes quick work of 
           each of them in vicious fashion, leaving them broken and 
           bloodied on the street...   

           Priest smiles proudly.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           ...and Priest just sitting there, starts to tear up... 

                                 PRIEST
                        And then when your mom was 
                        attacked...

           DISTORTED CLIPS OF--

           Three men assaulting a woman, she fights back, the glint of a 
           knife against a street light, the sickening wet curdle of 
           splitting flesh, screams, blood... 

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        And, well... 

           A COURTROOM 

           The three men getting off on a technicality, Bella - NOW LATE 
           TEENS - stone cold, emotionless, as the courtroom erupts, her 
           father screaming, trying to attack the men as the bailiffs 
           hold him back. 

           Bella looks to Younger Priest - a look we know all too well - 
           they lock eyes, he just looks away... 

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        It was at that moment that I knew I 
                        had lost you to... it.

           -Bella climbing into an apartment window with a knife
           -Bella seducing a man at a bar (we recognize him from the 
           courtroom). They walk outside to the alley, a deranged look 
           on her face as she discretely pulls a blade from her garter

           -Bella covered in blood, smiling, as she walks away from a 
           car... a second later the car explodes into a massive ball of 
           flame

           BACK TO SCENE:

           ...and Bella with tears streaming down her cheeks.

                                 PRIEST
                        She was my sister, I get it. I 
                        understood it, I felt it too, I 
                        felt it so deeply, I... 

           Priest is at a momentary loss for words...

                                 BELLA
                        You didn’t lose me, you taught 
                        me...

           Shaking his head, ashamed... 

                                 PRIEST
                        I tried to control you so I created 
                        you. And in doing so, I failed 
                        you...  

           The rage... 

                                 BELLA
                        You didn't create me. You prepared 
                        me. It’s a hard world, you prepared 
                        me. They created me! They created 
                        me! And now they resurrected me... 
                        And I’m gonna kill every single one 
                        of ‘em, every one of ‘em. Yeah, I 
                        wanna know who put the lead in dad, 
                        but does it fucking matter who it 
                        was?! They’re all gonna die ‘cause 
                        they’re all fucking guilty. Just 
                        like those three that took mom, 
                        doesn’t matter who put the knife in 
                        her... they all fucking did it! And 
                        they all paid...

                        Until they come for you. Until they 
                        come for you. And they will come 
                        for you, they will come... all of 
                        them, they will come. If the cops 
                        know, they know...

                        What am I supposed to do here, 
                        Bella?

           Bella just stares at him, dead panned--

                                 BELLA
                        Shed the collar and let’s go to 
                        fucking work!

           A long moment before Priest looks to the heavens... what 
           choice does he have?! To save her he’s gotta help her.... 

                                 PRIEST
                        God help us...

           INT. CHURCH OF HEAVENLY REST - NIGHT

           The CRASH of a stained glass window SHATTERING, the hard rain 
           semi masking the sound as a man wearing a ski mask creeps 
           inside, pulls his gun... 

           The BLUE DIN of a tiny FLASHLIGHT slashing through the 
           darkness as the masked gunman prowls about:  

           Rows of thickly lacquered pews, religious icons staring at 
           us, silently judging us from every possible angle, candles 
           for the dead melted to the ass end of the wick...  

           ...a church being a church... 

           Sees stairs, walks up them...

           THE ATTIC

           ...sleeping chickens everywhere and THE MURDER WALL... 

           The flashlight hits the mugshots on the wall as the masked 
           gunman studies it when-- 
           A DOOR OPENS... VOICES FROM DOWNSTAIRS... FOOTSTEPS... 

           The gunman readies his gun, turns off the flashlight, 
           punching the room into total blackness... 

           The creek of stairs as someone walks up them, louder with 
           each step taken... closer... CLOSER... CLOSER...  

           Blackness.

           The CREAK of a door...

           Lights...

           ...empty, but for the sleeping chickens and the hum of the 
           wind through an OPEN WINDOW... 

           Bella walks over to the window, looks outside... nothing... 

           Shuts it as we--  

                                                                CUT TO:

           BELLA, JERICHO AND PRIEST

           Sitting in the attic, an hour later...

                                 JERICHO
                        And you’re sure it wasn’t a hitter?

                                 BELLA
                        You see a dead body?

                                 JERICHO
                        Alright, don’t be so freaking 
                        cocky...

           Pulls a smoke from his pack, goes to light it as Bella 
           snatches it from his mouth, takes a hull, puts it out... 

           Bella turns to Priest--

                                 BELLA
                        This cop that fucking nuts that 
                        he’d break into a church, risking 
                        us coming back on him?

                                 PRIEST
                        Assume yes. Assume he saw the wall, 
                        assume he knows the targets, assume 
                        he’s ten times out of his mind, 
                        assume it all... 
           Bella thinking... 

                                 BELLA
                        Can’t arrest me, not enough 
                        evidence.

                                 PRIEST
                        He can pull you in for questioning.

           Bella turns to Jericho...

                                 BELLA
                        You know this cop? He a ‘pull you 
                        in for questioning’ kind of guy?

           Jericho shakes his head no... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Dude’s a straight heart attack man. 
                        We arm wrestled a few times, hell 
                        of a grip... 
                             (with a serious look)
                        He shoots first, asks questions 
                        never. This... this is his warning 
                        shot. Next one comes with a toe 
                        tag.   

                                 BELLA
                        You know where he lives?

           The room goes silent for a long beat, then...

                                 JERICHO
                        I can get it. 

           Bella nods...

                                 BELLA
                        Get it. 

           INT. DEETS’S HOUSE - ASTORIA QUEENS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Deets enters, pitch black. 

           Flicks on the light, tosses his jacket and starts to take off 
           his guns when-- 

                                 BELLA (O.S.)
                        Might wanna leave them on...

           He pulls both and whips around to find--

           BELLA
           ...at the kitchen table, a glass of whiskey in one hand, a 
           compact Uzi pointing at him in the other...

           A stand off... eyes are locked... a slow sip of her whiskey 
           as she casually places her gun on the table... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Grab a glass. 

           Deets doesn’t move, guns bearing down on Bella. She smiles, 
           slowly puts her finger to the DEVICE IN HER EAR. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Lights... 

           A moment later TWO RED DOTS start dancing over Deets face and 
           chest as we--

                                                        QUICK FLASH TO:

           Both JERICHO and PRIEST on separate rooftops, devices in 
           their ears too, SNIPER RIFLES at the ready, fingers on the 
           triggers, Deets in the crosshairs of both scopes...

                                                               BACK TO:

           BELLA

           ...smiling at Deets, nodding to the bottle of whiskey on the 
           table next to the Uzi...

                                 DEETS
                             (smiling, shaking his 
                              head)
                        Priest. Who’s the other?

                                 BELLA
                        Another. 

           She kicks the chair out from under the tale.

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Sit. 

           He does, guns still pointing, red dots still dancing on 
           him... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Gonna want to put those guns down 
                        in three... two...

           The red dots steady...
           Deets puts the guns down on the table, pours himself a 
           drink... the red dots suddenly disappear. 

           Bella nods to the ski mask and replicas of the mug shots on 
           her wall spilling out from a folder on the table...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Could have just asked...

           Deets nods to the Uzi with a grin--

                                 DEETS
                        Where’s the fun in that?

           Bella smiles--

                                 BELLA
                        True. 

           They just stare at each other, sipping whiskey, sizing each 
           other up... each visibly impressed with the other’s moxie.  

           Deets slugs his drink, pours another, reaches over the guns 
           and tops Bella off, too... 

                                 DEETS
                        Use it to sleep. Can’t sleep, 
                        haven’t slept in fucking years...

           Downs half the glass in one gulp--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        You have problems sleeping at all?

                                 BELLA
                        Used to. 

                                 DEETS
                        How’d you get around it?

                                 BELLA
                        Just went right through it... 

                                 DEETS
                        Where does it end though?

           Another slug, another pour, another slug...

                                 BELLA
                        Dad never drank, you believe that? 
                        A cop who didn’t drown himself... 

           Deets smiles as he lifts his glass in toast then takes a 
           camel-sized slug. 
                                 DEETS
                        How’d he get by?

           Bella smiles as we-- 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           YOUNGER JACOB holding a YOUNG BELLA (5) over his massive 
           record collection... shows her how to drop the needle on a 
           spinning record... she does...eyes go wide with excitement as 
           Doris Day’s ‘it’s magic’ plays - Bella’s first needle drop!

           Day’s ‘it’s magic’ continues to play over CLIPS OF:  

           -YOUNGER JACOB and YOUNG BELLA (6) dancing in the kitchen... 
           Younger Jacob in his police blues, Young Bella in her best 
           dress... she stands on his patent leather stompers as he 
           holds her tiny hands and glides her across the linoleum 
           floor...

           the stars desert the skies
           and rush to nestle in your eyes

           Both smiling, laughing... she looks up at her dad, adores 
           him... he spins her... 

           it’s magic

           And now it’s--

           -YOUNGER JACOB steaming after YOUNG BELLA (7) riding her bike 
           for the first time without training wheels... wobbly, but 
           determined... she grits her teeth and tries to keep her 
           balance as Jacob runs by her side, protecting her... 

           without a golden wand
           or mystic charms
           fantastic things begin

                                 YOUNGER JACOB
                        Go Bella! Go!! You’re doing it! 
                        You’re doing it!

           She looks at him with the widest of smiles...

           it’s magic

           And now it’s--

           -YOUNGER JACOB and YOUNG BELLA (8) walking hand in hand 
           eating ice cream cones at the NYC fair... people approach 
           Jacob and say hello, wave, nod, etc... he’s clearly very well 
           respected within the community... 
           Young Bella sees this and looks up at her dad like he’s a 
           superhero...

           when we walk hand in hand
           the world becomes a wonderland

           Younger Jacob looks down at Young bella and winks............

           .........................IT’S MAGIC..........................

                                                               BACK TO:

           DEETS’ HOUSE... and Bella still smiling, still semi lost in 
           her memories...

                                 BELLA
                        Magic... 

           A long beat then looks to Deets--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        You have kids?

                                 DEETS
                        I have a job to do. 

           Bella nods, gets it... back to business as Deets looks to the 
           stack of mug shots...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Any ideas?

                                 BELLA
                        Nah, not yet, but I’m working on 
                        it... You?

                                 DEETS
                        Working on it...

           The adversarial intensity is eye-to-eye.

                                 BELLA
                        You gonna let me work?

           Deets grabs the bottle...

                                 DEETS
                        No. 

           Reaches over to top Bella off--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        You gonna wait for me to?
           Bella pulls her glass before he finishes pouring, the whiskey 
           spilling all over the table.

                                 BELLA
                        No. 

           Both swig with a smile, the mile long stare... 

                                 DEETS
                        So I’ll see you on the job, then...

           Bella smiles. 

                                 BELLA
                        Yeah. 

           Slams the rest of her drink, gets up... the TWO RED DOTS back 
           dancing on Deets’s forehead and chest. 

                                 DEETS
                        Hey...

           Bella stops, looks at him, a beat then--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about your dad. 

           It’s sincere... 

           Bella nods, grits her teeth - pushing the emotion down. 

           She screws it back together then gives the loaded Uzi a look 
           as she leaves it on the table...

                                 BELLA
                        You’re gonna need that. 

           Silently glimpses a FRAMED PHOTO of Deets and a young girl - 
           HIS DAUGHTER - smiling on the beach as she exits.

           Deets thinks hard, pours himself another drink, as we--  

                                                                CUT TO:

           JERICHO’S '71 BOSS 442

           Jericho at the wheel, lights off, Priest in the back, window 
           down, gun at the ready covering Bella as she gets in... 

                                 BELLA
                        He’s going to be a problem. 
                                 PRIEST
                        Can we turn him?

                                 BELLA
                        No. 

                                 JERICHO
                        Should we touch him?

                                 BELLA
                        No. No... He fired a warning shot, 
                        we fired one back. Now it is what 
                        it is... 

           Bella looks at the house one last time, shaking her head...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go. 

           Jericho punches the gas, the car jumping from the curb, 
           disappearing into the black night as...

           THE SCREEN DIVIDES INTO TWO HALVES--

           HALF LEFT:                              HALF RIGHT: 

           BLURRY IMAGES framed in each shot SLOWLY COMING INTO FOCUS 
           revealing:

           HALF LEFT: BELLA

           HALF RIGHT: DEETS

           ...both staring straight into camera.

           PULL BACK

           ...to reveal they’re both staring at the MURDER WALL.  

           Both crews readying their weapons... 

           HALF LEFT: Bella and Jericho sliding knives into their vests

           HALF RIGHT: Deets sliding two guns into side holsters 

           -Priest walks over to Bella and Jericho, he’s wearing his 
           long priestly cassock. 

           Jericho gives him a look...

                                 JERICHO
                        You gonna wear that?!
           Priest smiles and opens the robe to reveal it’s laced neck to 
           ankle with knives, 50 at least...  

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Fair enough. 

           HALF LEFT: Bella slams a clip into her .45

           HALF RIGHT: Deets slams a clip into his new Uzi

           Both stare at the screen... 

           Bella cocks a grin as she pulls a CASSETTE TAPE and TOSSES IT 
           over into Deets’s frame... 

           He catches it, looks at it: Patty Smyth ‘Warrior’ 

                                 DEETS
                        What’s this?

                                 BELLA
                        Chase music...

           Her eyes narrow <----------------------------> His teeth grit

                      -let’s go to fucking work-

           Hard pounding drum and guitar licks kick in as-- 

           80’s rock goddess Patty Smyth screams at us:

           OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

           And--

           THE ACTION ON THE SCREEN TURNS VIOLENT as Smyth’s ‘warrior’ 
           provides the heart pounding soundtrack: 

           you run, run, run away

           HALF LEFT: Bella, Jericho and Priest (who’s doling knives 
           from his cloak like Bill the fucking Butcher) busting into a 
           Russian drug spot, absolutely eviscerating everyone inside as 
           they all try to run, run, run away...  

           HALF RIGHT: Deets, guns drawn, flanked by a dozen cops, busts 
           into the church... it’s empty, like they were never there... 
           not even the chickens... he screams as the cops curse him out 
           and openly snicker.  

           THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO FOUR SECTIONS, twice as much 
           violence, Patty still yelling at us:
           shooting at the walls of heartache, bang! bang!

           CLOSE ON

           -BULLET CASINGS soaring through the air IN SLO MOTION 
           traveling FROM ONE SECTION TO ANOTHER as bodies drop and we--

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           A bloodied gun toting Bella, both arms extended, spinning 
           like a carousel as she empties her clip into a dozen men... 

           We FOLLOW A GUNMAN catching lead, stumbling back into:

           -ANOTHER SECTION where knives slice through two Jamaican 
           gangsters throats as Priest lets his hardware fly... 

           FOLLOW A KNIFE coming out the other end of a neck into:

           -ANOTHER SECTION where Deets is at one of the crime scenes... 
           he walks from ONE SECTION TO ANOTHER where he’s now in A 
           COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CRIME SCENE...  

           Patty still yelling:

           oh, who’s the hunter, who’s the game

           ...as Deets stares at a mountain of bloodied baddies who 
           didn’t stand a fucking chance and--

           THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO EIGHT SECTIONS

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!

           As Bella, Priest and Jericho do the dance of death, THE 
           ACTION SEAMLESSLY JUMPING FROM ONE SECTION TO THE NEXT, as 
           they viciously kill their way through every gangster in 
           Manhattan, Deets in pursuit, possessed, not far behind, 
           closer with each crime scene...  

           THE SCREEN NOW DIVIDES INTO SIXTEEN SECTIONS and...

           ...well you get the idea.  

           INTERCUT the MURDER WALL where MUG SHOTS FALL in synch with 
           Patty Smyth yelling: 

           Bang! Bang! 

           Then BACK TO DEETS in the bottom left hand section of the 
           framed sixteen boxes, driving his car through the streets of 
           lower Manhattan like a man possessed (because he is)... 
           The CACKLE of RADIO CHATTER:

                                 FROM THE POLICE RADIO
                        Shots fired. Shots fired. 
                        Chinatown, corner of Mott and 
                        Canal... 

           Deets, white knuckling the wheel, punches the gas peddle, 
           PLOWING THROUGH EACH SECTION FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, UP, DOWN AND 
           ALL AROUND, destroying them as he barrels through lower 
           Manhattan, chasing after Bella, Priest and Jericho like Pac 
           Man trying to gobble that blue ghost.     

           Eventually it’s just TWO HALVES again:

           HALF LEFT: Deets screaming into Chinatown like a bat outta 
           hell

           HALF RIGHT: Bella and the crew mid massacre

           Deets pulls up, screeches to a stop, looks up, sees Bella 
           chasing a gangster from rooftop to rooftop. 

           He’s finally caught up, the image on the screen now one...

           Jumps from his car and gives chase...

           Kicks a door in, rushes up the stairs to the roof, kicks 
           another door in, spots Bella steaming after the gangster in 
           the distance. 

           He’s got ground to cover, but he’s closer than he’s ever been 
           and he can fucking taste it... 

           HAULS ASS!

           No music here.. just the soundtrack of Deets’s heavy 
           breathing against his boots hitting gravel as he jumps from 
           one rooftop to the next... 

           Relentless, moving after Bella like a runaway train...

           FROM ANOTHER ROOFTOP

           Jericho spots the pursuit...

           Raises his gun, gets a bead on Deets, finger on the trigger, 
           timing the next jump...

                                 JERICHO
                             (to himself)
                        Three, two...

           Exhales... pulls the trigger!
           BANG!

           The BULLET soars through the air as DEETS JUMPS ROOFTOPS and 
           the bullet RIPS INTO HIS BODY... 

           He spins sideways, just barely getting his arms on the next 
           landing...

           Hearing the shot, Bella looks back:

           Sees Deets hanging from the building, blood pouring from the 
           hole in his shoulder, trying desperately not to fall. 

           Bella stops, looks at the gangster she’s chasing then back at 
           Deets... slip, slippin’... he falls, he’s dead! 

           She turns and steam rolls towards Deets who’s trying to hang 
           on for dear life, literally. 

           JERICHO FROM THE OTHER ROOFTOP sees this... what the hell is 
           she doing?! 

           He grits his teeth, sees the gangster about to get away, 
           lines up a shot on him... exhales... BANG!

           The bullet screams past Bella’s head then past the gangster’s 
           head as he disappears off another rooftop, narrowly escaping 
           death...

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Jericho turns back to Deets who’s trying to pull himself up 
           with his one working arm, blood pouring from his other 
           shoulder, grip slipping...  

           Steadies his gun, gets a bead on him when-- SIRENS! 

           CLOSER....................CLOSER.................CLOSER!

           Priest barrels through the door, his ear chewed off by a 
           bullet, gushing blood... 

                                 PRIEST
                        We need to move! Where’s Bella?!

           Jericho nods to her rushing towards Deets... 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s name is she doing?!

           Jericho just shakes his head...
                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Get the car, let’s go... we need to 
                        get to her before the cops do!

           They leave... we--

                                                               JUMP TO:

           BELLA

           ...hauling ass, leaping rooftops in stride, chasing after 
           Deets... what the fuck IS she doing?! 

           The WAIL OF SIRENS getting CLOSER as Bella pumps harder...

           CLOSER....................CLOSER.................CLOSER!

           Bella leaps the last building...

                      ...Deets is slipping...

                              ...Bella is running...

                                    ...his five finger grip to--

                                             ...four...three...two...

           ...Bella DIVES FORWARD, grabs Deets’s arm, her shoulder 
           SLAMMING INTO THE HARD ROOF with a sickening POP!  

           Blood slicked hands, pulling hard, trying to pull him up, her 
           other shoulder hanging from its socket... screams as she 
           tries not to tumble over the building with him... 

           COPS PULL UP ON THE SCENE, SCATTER FROM THEIR CARS, GUNS 
           DRAWN... 

           ...just in time to see what looks to them like Bella and 
           Deets wrestling as Deets disappears... 

           ON THE ROOFTOP

           Deets pulls a gun!

           Bella pulls a gun!

           Both on their backs, guns pointed at each other, beaten down, 
           breathing hard... 

           THE CACKLE OF POLICE RADIO AND OFFICERS can be heard in the 
           b.g. as more cruisers pull up--
                                 OFFICERS SHOUTING (O.S.)
                        Get on the roof! The roof! The 
                        roof! Go! Go! Go!  

           Deets eyes Bella then the door then back to Bella... 

                                 DEETS
                        That door opens, they’re coming in 
                        heavy, kill shots... go!

           Bella just looks at him...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        This is to be continued, believe 
                        you me, but for now... go! 

           Bella gets to her feet and bolts for the next 
           rooftop...jumps, lands, runs...

           The DOOR busts open to a HALF DOZEN OFFICERS barreling 
           through it, rolling heavy - guns drawn, hammers cocked...

           ...no Bella. 

           In the b.g. the familiar GROWL of Jericho’s 442 and the 
           SQUEEL of rubber burning pavement. 

           PRE-LAP: a YELL! Then ANOTHER YELL! as we--

                                                           SMASH IN ON:

           A WAREHOUSE

           ...and Bella slamming her shoulder against the wall, popping 
           it back into place, breathing heavy as she slinks down the 
           wall, bloodied, beaten, exhausted...  

           Priest in the corner, teeth wrapped around a Bible, biting 
           down hard, trying not to scream out as he cleans and treats 
           his bullet chewed ear. 

           Jericho fuming, staring at Bella--

                                 JERICHO
                        What the fuck was that?!

           Bella ignores him, lifts herself off the ground to her 
           feet...slow going... 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Hey!
                                 BELLA
                        I made the call... 

           Jericho just stares at her...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        He’s got a daughter, I’m not taking 
                        him from her... 

                                 JERICHO
                        That ain’t what this is about! 

                                 BELLA
                        Yes it is! It’s exactly what this 
                        is about. He’s a cop, just like 
                        dad, trying to do the right thing, 
                        just like dad! 

           Priest looks to Bella, they catch eyes, he nods proudly...

                                 JERICHO
                        We’re doing the right thing!

                                 BELLA
                        Are we? Are we?! 

           She looks around the room at the bloodied and fractured 
           team... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not quite sure anymore... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Well you had better get right with 
                        it, kiddo, because that banger you 
                        let get away saw your face...
                             (nodding)
                        He saw your face, he saw my face 
                        and he saw Priest’s face and none 
                        of us are new to the scene... No 
                        more ghost stories about Bella ‘the 
                        boogieman’ maybe being back, it is 
                        fact; Bella lives and we are all 
                        dead! 

           Shaking his head...

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        I give it an hour before there’s a 
                        million dollar price-tag on our 
                        heads... 
                             (looks to Bella)
                        Two mill on you ‘cause you’re such 
                        a fucking superstar... 
           Bella storms out of the room as Jericho looks to Priest. 

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        You know I’m right. You know it. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Bella on the roof staring at the sky... Priest walks over, 
           sits...

           Silence for a long moment...

                                 BELLA
                        How’s the ear?

                                 PRIEST
                        What?

           Bella cracks a smile. Priest playfully nudges her.  

                                 BELLA
                        You think I should have saved that 
                        cop?

                                 PRIEST
                        Do you think you should have saved 
                        that cop?

           Bella nods. So does Priest. 

                                 BELLA
                        He’s right though. Gigantic 
                        asshole, but he’s right... we’ve 
                        got an hour, maybe two, until every 
                        killer in NYC is after us.  

           Priest nods. 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        What now?

                                 PRIEST
                        ‘Chose for yourselves this day whom 
                        you will serve’... 

                                 BELLA
                             (softly, as if to herself)
                        Yeah... 

           A beat then--
                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I remember... when I came home with 
                        all that blood on my dress after 
                        beating those boys up at school... 
                        I remember dad was so mad at me... 
                        so mad. And he’s yelling at me and 
                        he’s going in and all that, but 
                        behind all the anger, behind it 
                        all, I could see that he was... 
                        relieved, proud even. He didn’t 
                        have to worry about me. It’s a hard 
                        world, but I was harder.    
                             (emotional, pushing it 
                              down)
                        And then I got harder... and 
                        harder... and harder... and 
                        harder... and then he worried. 
                             (shaking her head)
                        And then when those animals took 
                        mom... and........... and he looked 
                        at me, and he knew, he knew what I 
                        had done... and I swear to fucking 
                        God I saw that same pride in his 
                        eyes, I swear it... and I was eight 
                        again, standing in front of him in 
                        that blood soaked dress...
                             (looks to Priest, heavy 
                              eyes)
                        How do you think he’d look at me 
                        now?  

           Priest just gives her a look, she shakes her head... yeah, 
           probably that...  

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I dragged you into all this.

           Bella gets up and starts to walk away...

                                 PRIEST
                        Where are you going?

                                 BELLA
                             (over her shoulder)
                        Finally getting out of that 
                        dress... 

           MEANWHILE THROUGHOUT NYC & THE SURROUNDING BOROUGHS...  

           -a BUTTONED UP GENTLEMAN teaching a young girl piano lessons 
           gets a call on the house phone, excuses himself, takes it, 
           immediately leaves
           -a young boy runs into a Butcher shop, says something to the 
           BURLY BUTCHER breaking down a whole pig with a clever, the 
           butcher spins the clever, throws it against the wall, leaves

           -a SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS-WOMAN in a Maserati gets a call on 
           her massive car phone, answers it, her face hardens as she 
           bangs an illegal u-turn and races back towards the city 

           -a half naked waitress walks up to a HARD LOOKING TATTOO’D 
           BIKER, whispers something in his ear, he throws the stripper 
           off his lap, leaves the strip joint

           -a SLENDER BALLERINA stretching in prep for the ballet gets a 
           page, looks at the message, grabs her gym bag, leaves 

           -a REAL ESTATE AGENT showing a property gets interrupted by 
           her assistant, smiles at the young couple viewing the million 
           dollar penthouse, excuses herself, leaves, the couple just 
           staring at each other

           ...and so on, and so forth...  

           Bella, Jericho and Priest’s pictures being flashed all over 
           town... 

             -EVERY KILLER WITH A WORKING TRIGGER FINGER IS ACTIVATED-

           NYC just became a $4 mill hunting ground... 

           Off a picture of Bella we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           BELLA IN A CAR

           ...staring at something...

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           ...it’s Deets, at a park, his arm in a sling, pushing his 
           EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER in a swing, laughing, smiling... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER THAT DAY

           ...Deets dropping his daughter off to his EX-WIFE... 

           Gives his daughter a big hug before saying bye, his ex at a 
           distance.
                                 DEETS
                        Hey...

           His daughter looks up at him, smiles, adores her dad... 

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Hey...

           Deets smiles back, adores her more... 

                                 DEETS
                        Right?

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Right. 

           From a distance Bella watches on... 

           SHIFT TO HER POV--

           ...and now it’s YOUNG BELLA hugging YOUNGER JACOB, holding 
           him tight, smiling... a few moments, then--

           BACK TO 

           ...Deets and his daughter. 

                                 DEETS
                        I’ll see you in a few days. 
                             (daughter nods)
                        Go on inside and let mom and I talk 
                        for a second, huh?

           His daughter nods, gives him one last hug then runs past her 
           mom into the house. 

           Ex-wife approaches... awkward silence........ no hello, just-- 

                                 EX WIFE
                        She needs braces. 

                                 DEETS
                        How much we talking?

           Ex-wife gives him a look...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        I got it. I got it. 

           He lights a cig. She pulls it from his mouth, smokes it, nods 
           to his slinged up wing...

                                 EX WIFE
                        Fall off a bar stool?
                                 DEETS
                        You wanna cut me a break, here, Di? 

           She just shakes her head... 

                                 EX WIFE
                        Killing yourself out there and for 
                        what? 

           Looks to the house, sees his daughter peeking from the 
           window, makes a face at her... then back to his ex--

                                 DEETS
                        For her. She’s gonna be proud of 
                        her old man...  

           Ex wife just stares at him, pity plain on her face...

                                 EX WIFE
                        Proud? You think what you’re doing 
                        out there is going to make her 
                        proud, Adler? 

           She shakes her head...

                                 EX WIFE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got teeth marks on your 
                        boots and blood on your hands...

           A beat... Deets has nothing to say...

                                 EX WIFE (CONT’D)
                        She’s young, she’s not dumb...  

           She gives him back his cigarette... looks at him for a long 
           moment... trying to see if any semblance of the man she once 
           loved is still there? Maybe? Who knows...  

                                 DEETS
                        Got some money coming to you in a 
                        week or so. 

           She nods, turns and walks back into the house. 

           Deets makes another face at his daughter when his ex walks 
           over and grabs her from the window... his face falls...

           Walks back to his car, gets in, sits there for a second... 

           Takes a baggie of coke from his pocket, stares at it, slams 
           his fist into the steering wheel then dumps the baggie out. 

           Bella watching this entire thing. 
           INT. DEETS’S HOUSE - ASTORIA QUEENS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Deets enters, pitch black. 

           Flicks on the light, tosses his jacket and starts to take off 
           his guns when-- 

                                 BELLA (O.S.)
                        Might wanna leave them on...

           He pulls one and whips around to find--

           BELLA

           ...at the kitchen table, that same glass of whiskey from last 
           unannounced visit in hand, no gun this time. 

           Deets shoots glances out the window...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Just you and I this time. Shoot me 
                        if you want, but I think you’re 
                        gonna want to hear what I have to 
                        say first... 

                                 DEETS
                        Then?

                                 BELLA
                        Shoot me...
                             (with a wink)
                        ...if you want. 

           She kicks the chair out a bit...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Sit. 
                             (with a grin)
                        You look exhausted...

           He gives her a look, sits, puts his gun down next to him. 

           She pours him enough whiskey to kill an Irishman. He slams 
           half in one gulp. 

           They stare at each other for a long beat...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        This is where you thank me for 
                        saving your life... 

                                 DEETS
                        You come here for an ‘atta boy’?
                                 BELLA
                        Who doesn’t like an ‘atta boy’?

           Deets smiles, lifts his glass--

                                 DEETS
                        Atta boy. 

           Slams the drink, pours another, tops Bella off, too... 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        You know there’s a contract out on 
                        all ya’ll... even the fucking 
                        Priest. 

                                 BELLA
                        Figured. 
                             (thinking)
                        How much?

                                 DEETS
                        A mill each for the gents, two for 
                        the ‘Bell’ of the ball...

           Bella smiles, half joking-- 

                                 BELLA
                        Open to cops?

                                 DEETS
                        NYC Bella, it’s open to everyone... 

           She looks at his gun on the table then at him...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Not my style. 

                                 BELLA
                        I know it’s not, that’s why I’m 
                        here...

           She throws a folder onto the table--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Irish got a shipment of heroin 
                        coming in tonight, Chelsea Pier, 
                        sometime after midnight... 

           Deets grabs the folder and looks it over, photos of the 
           Westies (the Irish gang out of Hells Kitchen) and details of 
           the shipment...  
                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Was gonna use this to get to them, 
                        but change of plans... Take it, 
                        bust ‘em, do it right. It’s gonna 
                        be a haul, might even put stripes 
                        on your shoulders...  

                                 DEETS
                        You making a play here?

                                 BELLA
                        If I was making a play this 
                        conversation would have went... 
                             (makes a gun with her 
                              finger, points it at him)
                        Boom. Dead. 

           Deets stares at her while she sips her drink...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m making a deal.

                                 DEETS
                        Go on...

                                 BELLA
                        You get the bust with the Irish. 
                        You get the glory. You get me as 
                        far away from this city as fucking 
                        possible... 

                                 DEETS
                        What do you get?

                                 BELLA
                        Your word that you’ll protect my 
                        father. 

           Deets is taken aback, wasn’t expecting that... 

                                 DEETS
                        Why you gonna trust me?

           Bella glances at the pic of Deets and his daughter at the 
           beach...

                                 BELLA
                        ‘Cause you’re a father. 

           Then back to Deets with innocent eyes... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        And I’m a daughter. 
           They just stare at each other for a long moment, nothing 
           said, nothing needs to be... 

           A beat, then--

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Who do you think put the lead in 
                        dad? In your gut... 

           Deets looks at her, looks away... nothing needs to be said 
           there either... 

           The realization that one of his own tried to take him out 
           hits Bella like a punch to the face... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Did he know something? Was he gonna 
                        turn on the brass?

           (*note: ‘brass’ is cop slang for high ranking officers)

                                 DEETS
                        I don’t know, Bella. I truly don’t. 

                                 BELLA
                        Yeah...

           Still trying to reconcile with this...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Who polices the police though, 
                        right?
                             (shaking her head)
                        There’s still some good left in 
                        you, do something about it... Be 
                        effective. 

           A long beat, Deets nods... 

           Bella gets up, goes into her jacket, pulls a thick envelope, 
           drops it on the table...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        I hear braces are expensive... 

           Exits as Deets opens the envelope to find stacks of hundred 
           dollar bills... 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Empty. Priest and Jericho long gone; already in the wind. 
           Bella standing there, a packed bag next to her... one last 
           glance at the MURDER WALL... hits the lights...

           BLACKNESS. 

                                                            OVER BLACK:

           The CRASH of WOOD SPLINTERING. 

           Muffled SCREAMS slowly morphing into--

                                 DEETS (V.O.)
                        Get on your fucking knees! LET’S 
                        GO! DOWN! DOWN! LET’S FUCKING GO! 

                                                           SMASH IN ON:

           DEETS

           ...his cowboy boot mashing down on some ‘micks’ busted up 
           mug, a .45 to his temple...

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           Cops.

           ...holding court over the bust of his fucking career.

           Nods and shoulder claps all around... 

           A second as he soaks it in when--

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Deets!

           Deets turns and looks to the OFFICER calling out for him. 
           Walks over to him...   
           Standing over a bloodstained MICK face down, hogtied... 

                                 DEETS
                        Yeah?

                                 OFFICER
                        Guy here wants to make a deal...

           Deets laughs out loud.

                                 DEETS
                        A deal?! This ain’t a fucking game 
                        show...
                             (looking around)
                        The weight of this thing, better be 
                        coming with a fucking parachute... 
                        What is it? 

                                 OFFICER
                        Wouldn’t tell me, wants to talk to 
                        who’s calling the shots... 

                                 DEETS
                        Alright...
                             (curious, leans down)
                        What you got Irish?

                                 MICK
                        Got the line on a cop about to get 
                        popped...

                                 DEETS
                        Fuck you going on about?!

                                 MICK
                        Getting to a cop to smoke out some 
                        girl... 

           Off Deets’s hard look we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HOSPITAL ROOM

           Bella with her father...

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....

           Still in a coma but he’s fighting. 

           Bella watches him, clearly emotional-- 
                                 BELLA
                        I love you dad. And it’s going to 
                        be okay, I promise you. I have 
                        someone watching over you the right 
                        way and I trust him. 

           INTERCUT WITH:

           Deets speeding through the NYC streets, siren blaring, radio 
           to his face... 

                                 DEETS
                             (over the radio)
                        Owens and Ciprio, I need verbal 
                        response you’re both at the 
                        hospital manning the door, over...

           Nothing.

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Owens and Ciprio respond with 
                        positions now, over!

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT. JACOB’S HOSPITAL ROOM

           The hospital is chaotic! 1 AM in NYC... the witching hour. 

           No Owens, no Ciprio, A BURLEY DOCTOR tightens his face-mask 
           and grips the door handle...

           BACK TO DEETS

           ...his car catching air as he barrels towards the hospital. 
           Throws the radio, picks up the car phone, dials a number... 

           INSIDE JACOB’S HOSPITAL ROOM WITH BELLA

           She’s in the bathroom, drying her hands when LIGHT creeps in 
           from under the door... someone else is in the room! 

           Bella cracks the door and peaks inside... A DOCTOR, scrubs 
           and all... she exhales then--

           The MD pulls A MEAT CLEVER... FUCK! 

           Bella grabs a towel and immediately pounces--

           Wraps the towel around the hitter’s neck and starts to choke 
           him with it-- 

           The man twists away and breaks free-- 
           Squares up to fight, his surgical mask ripping off revealing:

           IT’S ONE OF THE ASSASSINS... THE BUTCHER! 

           ...his MASSIVE MEAT CLEAVER in hand, spins it with a grin-- 

                                 BUTCHER
                        Gonna make me rich, Bella...

           Bella readies...

                                 BELLA
                        Come collect...

           The Butcher Attacks! Swinging the cleaver like a blacksmith 
           hammering hot steel, moving like a goddamned force of nature! 

           Bella quickly wraps the blanket around her hand and deflects 
           each fierce slice the Butcher takes at her-- 

           The Butcher lets a round house kick fly that connects hard, 
           nearly taking her head off-- 

           This dude is a fucking savage!

           The Butcher brings the cleaver down on Bella, but she 
           deflects it, knocks it out of the man’s hand and drills the 
           guy with a ferocious elbow to the nose, shattering it, blood 
           everywhere--

           Bella gets up, shakes it off, but so does this tough 
           motherfucker--

           They square up:

           Fists fly, bones break, blood spatters... 

           The Butcher grabs the blade, gets on top of Bella, pushing 
           the cleaver to her throat as she wrestles with his arm to 
           keep from getting decapitated... 

           The blade inches from her neck and closing in when--

           BLOOD SPRAYS ALL OVER BELLA!  

           The Butcher, wearing a new Colombian necktie, falls on top of 
           Bella, dead. 

           Over him, Deets holding a scalpel... 

           Bella exhales deeply, exhausted, bloodied, heaving - pushes 
           the Butcher off of her then vomits all over the floor.. 
           Silence now except for Bella breathing heavily, the Butcher 
           choking on his own blood, and:

           Beep..... Beep...... Beep...... Beep..... Beep..... Beep.....  

           Bella looks to Deets...

                                 DEETS
                        Keeping my promise...

           Bella smiles--

                                 BELLA
                        Atta boy. 

           Deets helps Bella to her feet, looks at all the machines 
           hooked to Jacob, still working, they look good. 

                                 DEETS
                        They’re coming, all of them... 

           Bella looks to the door...

                                 BELLA
                        The cops go on a coffee break?! 

                                 DEETS
                        4 million buys a lot of looking the 
                        other way... 

           They’re on their own. They look around the room...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Can we move him? 

                                 BELLA
                        Not with the machines pumping life 
                        into him... 

           Bella grabs the cleaver from the ground...

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        You ready for this?

                                 DEETS
                        Fuck no! 

           He holds the scalpel out in front of him...

                                 BELLA
                        Where the fuck is your gun?!
                                 DEETS
                        I USED ALL MY BULLETS BUSTING THE 
                        IRISH!!

           Before Bella can respond--

           CLINK, CLINK, CLINK... a GRENADE skids into the room... a 
           second later SMOKE billows from it, engulfing the room in a 
           CLOUDY HAZE. 

           A PUNCH to Bella’s face--

           A KICK nearly takes Deets head from his shoulder--

           A KNIFE SLASHES Bella’s arm, blood sprays-- 

                                 BELLA
                        Fire alarm! On the wall! Find it!

           A KICK to Deets’s kneecap, he falls--

           Bella BLINDLY PAWING at the wall for the fire alarm, finds 
           it, pulls it, the alarm sounds and the sprinklers erupt. The 
           smoke clears to reveal--

           THE BALLERINA 

           ...mid air, gracefully landing a kick to Bella’s chest. 

           A back flip then levels Deets again with THE HARD WOOD TOE OF 
           HER POINT SHOES, crushing his nose, blood sprays.  

           A smile as she pulls her blade and swan dives at Bella when--

           THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

           ...THREE SILENT BULLETS whistle in from the hospital window, 
           burying themselves into the Ballerina, nearly ripping her 
           tiny frame in half, ending the ballet.  

           Bella looks out the window... PRIEST ON AN ADJACENT ROOFTOP 
           with a grin. 

                                 DEETS
                        I invited a few friends... 

           As if on cue THE REAL ESTATE AGENT flies through the door 
           like a rag-doll, landing head first on the hard floor, her 
           neck snapping, her BUSINESS CARDS spilling from her blazer, 
           fanning out all over the linoleum. 

           JERICHO steps in with a cocky smile.  
                                 JERICHO
                        I was told I was needed... 

           Bella rolls her eyes as she gathers herself.  

           The sprinklers pouring down, relentlessly pounding cold water 
           on the blood stained floor, the alarm blaring...

           The already chaotic hospital now even more chaotic... 

           Jericho nods to Deets’s arm (the one he shot)--

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        How’s the wing?

                                 DEETS
                        I’ll live... 

           Bella interrupts the dick swinging contest, turns to Deets--

                                 BELLA
                        How long until fire and police 
                        show?

                                 DEETS
                        Middle of the night in New York 
                        City, fire alarm at the hospital 
                        ain’t top priority... 

           Jericho smiles...

                                 JERICHO
                        Got an idea.

           Walks over to the window, grabs two GRENADES from his vest, 
           PULLS THE PINS, chucks them into the ambulance lot... 
           KAAAA-FUCKIN-BOOOOOM!

           The trucks shoot from the pavement like roman-fucking-
           candles!

           They all just stare at him...................................

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        That should do it. 

                                 DEETS
                        4 minutes until the place is 
                        swarming with fire and cops... 
           Jericho tosses a gun with a silencer on it to Bella then one 
           to Deets... he and Deets catch eyes, nod to each other... 

           The action outside the room is pure anarchy, people 
           screaming, yelling, clawing at each other to evacuate as 
           quickly as they can... 

                                 JERICHO
                        Everyone is leaving, everyone! 
                        Anyone coming in--

                                 BELLA
                             (cocking her gun)
                        Assume they’re here to party. 

           Jericho gives Bella a wicked grin as The Beatles ‘come 
           together’ kicks in out of nowhere from the hospital room 
           speakers... 

           They all just look at each other curiously before Bella turns 
           to Jacob with a knowing smile... 

                                 BELLA (CONT’D)
                        Good selection, dad... 

           They close in - together, united as one, ready for the war...

           John Lennon hissing the words ‘shoot me’ - as if to cheer the 
           team on as all hell breaks loose...

           Shoot me!- Jericho timing a shot out perfectly, putting it 
           between two fleeing nurses and through the Versace sunglasses 
           of the charging SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS-WOMAN  

           Shoot me!- Deets putting a bullet through the PIANO TEACHER’s 
           pearly whites, tickling his ivories, singing out the back of 
           his skull 

           Shoot me!- Bella filleting the HARD LOOKING TATTOO’D BIKER 
           with the Butchers cleaver like a piece of raw meat then a 
           bullet to his brain for good measure (and because John said 
           so...)

           A HITTER GET’S BY, enters the hospital room when--

           Shoot me!- Priest does just that... the fucker crumbles...

           John Lennon urging them to:

           come together, right now

           ...they do as he says, circling around each other, back to 
           back--
           THREE MORE MINUTES of:

           BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES!.......BULLETS! BLOOD! BODIES! 

           As the newly minted team works in unison to protect Jacob 
           and...

           A KNIFE SCREAMS PAST DEETS’S FACE, BURYING ITSELF INTO THE 
           NECK OF ANOTHER HITTER.

           Jericho nods to Deets who nods back.

           ...look out for each other. 

           THREE MINUTES LATER--

           Sirens and an empty hospital but for the dozens of dead 
           bodies piled up around Jacob’s hospital room door... 

           The CACKLE OF POLICE RADIO’S... CLOSER... CLOSER... CLOSER!

           Deets looks to the team--

                                 DEETS
                        Go. I’ll handle this, go. 

           Bella looks to Jacob...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        He’s safe, go. 

           Jericho grabs Bella. 

                                 JERICHO
                        He’s got him, let’s go. 

           Bella nods as they disappear right before the police arrive, 
           leaving Deets standing there over a sea of dead bodies, his 
           gun high in the air, his badge out to identify himself... 

           INT. NYPD PRESS ROOM

           Deets flanking the CHIEF OF POLICE who’s at the podium 
           fielding questions as our HELMET HAIRD REPORTER breaks the 
           news: 
                                 HELMET HAIRED REPORTER
                        It appears New York City has a new 
                        super cop as Detective Adler Deets 
                        risked his life to single handedly 
                        save his fellow officer from 
                        multiple assassination attempts 
                        last night...

           ...as we PULL BACK to reveal:

           DEETS’S DAUGHTER staring at her dad’s face all over the news, 
           beaming proudly, a smile from ear to ear... 

           His Ex-Wife leaning against the kitchen doorframe drying a 
           dish, shaking her head, the hint of a smile on her lips... 

           The HELMET HAIRED REPORTER pushes on:

                                 HELMET HAIRED REPORTER
                        Last night and through the morning 
                        Detective Deets orchestrated a 
                        coordinated wide-spread shakedown 
                        of the NYPD, exposing corruption 
                        throughout the ranks...

           The IMAGE on screen cuts to clips of DOZENS OF NYPD OFFICERS 
           IN HANDCUFFS being escorted from their homes, cars, social 
           clubs, etc... Deets there, quarterbacking each scene.  

           His daughter turns to his ex-wife with a wide grin... ex-
           wife’s smile finally takes form, nods proudly. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BELLA, PRIEST AND JERICHO WATCHING THE NEWS REPORT 

           Silence for a long beat, then...

                                 JERICHO
                             (semi-annoyed)
                        Single handedly?

           Everyone laughs.

           Bella gets up and walks over to Jericho, gives him a kiss... 

                                 BELLA
                        Did good, stud. 
                                 JERICHO
                        Wow! Wow! Would you look at this?!

           He turns to Priest, a face-full of exaggerated surprise, then 
           back to Bella... really making a meal outta this moment...   

                                 JERICHO (CONT’D)
                        Did that kill you to say?

           Bella smiles as she starts towards the door...

                                 BELLA
                             (over her shoulder)
                        You have no idea... 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. NYPD PRESS ROOM

           And Deets walking up to the podium. 

           Stands there - uneasy, awkward...

           Flashbulbs pop off like bullets as reporters fire shot after 
           shot with fully loaded cameras...

           Deets blinks hard, leans into the mic... REVERB--

                                 DEETS
                        Shit.

           Everyone laughs...

           He pulls back a bit, exhales deeply, tries again--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Not, uh... yeah...  

           Looks to the brass (the high ranking police officers on the 
           stage nearby) and the PR rep who all flash him the thumbs up 
           and motion for him to keep going... dance monkey, dance... 

           Deets smiles to himself, shakes his head, turns back to the 
           crowd of reporters...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Effective. I’m ‘effective’ they 
                        say...
                             (nods)
                        It’s a word that’s been thrown 
                        around a lot lately... effective. 
                        What it means to me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        When you talk about a cop being 
                        effective, you’re talking about a 
                        particular kind of psycho... and 
                        I’m as effective as if fucking 
                        gets. 

           The room bursts into laughter and applause. 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        There it is! Finally getting the 
                        audience I deserve here. Been 
                        kicking ass in the name of this 
                        department for years, ain’t that 
                        right, Cap?

           His CAPTAIN pumps his fist in the air...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        The fist. Might as well be the 
                        fucking motto of the NYPD...

                                                              FLASH TO:

           DEET’S EX WIFE

           Watching on TV, her face tightening as she senses something 
           isn’t right... turns to her daughter...

                                 EX WIFE
                        Sweetie, go run to the kitchen and 
                        get mommy a Tab from the fridge 
                        with a glass and some ice...

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Mom?!

                                 EX WIFE
                        Go!

           She begrudgingly gets up and leaves the room as we--

                                                              FLASH TO:

           PRIEST AND JERICHO

           Watching the press conference...

           Jericho’s eyes narrow as he calls out to Bella who’s one foot 
           out the door...

                                 JERICHO
                        Might wanna catch this...
           Bella walks back to the TV as we--

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           DEETS AT THE PODIUM

                                 DEETS
                        I can’t tell you how many people 
                        I’ve beaten confessions out of... 
                        and I’m not talking just whacked 
                        around, I’m talking world class ass 
                        kickings... so much blood on my 
                        fucking hands, I just... that’s how 
                        we do it though, right? 
                             (turns to the brass)
                        Right?! 

           The laughter stops, the flashbulbs double, the brass shuffle 
           in their dress-shoes, the PR rep looks like she might puke...

           A UNIFORMED OFFICER tries to escort Deets from the podium... 

           Deets drills the dude with a left hook and knocks the poor 
           fucker out... 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        I also assaulted an officer... 

           The guys blood all over Deets’s hand... he holds it up for 
           the reporters to get a shot of... 

           Flashbulbs erupt as he turns to his superiors--  

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Anyone else comes up, i’ma shoot em 
                        in the fucking head. 

           He pulls his gun and slams it on the podium...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Psychopath, remember?

           Captain turns to one of his minions--

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Get me a half dozen uniforms in 
                        here now! Go!

           Minion carefully slinks out as Deets turns back to the 
           reporters... they’re terrified, but this is a fucking 
           Pulitzer in the making here...  
                                 DEETS
                        We cuffed up all those dirty cops 
                        this morning and made a big 
                        spectacle of cleaning up the bad 
                        apples... and now we dance the 
                        dance and sing the song and that’s 
                        all well and good, but ain’t 
                        nothing gonna change until we take 
                        down these motherfuckers right 
                        here... 

           Deets points to EVERY HIGH LEVEL COP on stage with him... 

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Up here talking about ‘a new day 
                        for the NYPD’... ain’t nothing new 
                        but the recruiting class being 
                        brought in... the same gestapo 
                        tactics, the same hunting orders... 
                        Systemic. Fucked. Period. THE. 
                        SYSTEM. IS. BROKEN. This thin blue 
                        line of bullshit-- 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        He’s on drugs! Get off the stage, 
                        Deets!

                                 DEETS
                        This thin blue line of bullshit I 
                        made a career upholding... doing 
                        whatever it takes; fabricating 
                        evidence, forging confessions, 
                        lying on reports, pinning the tail 
                        on any donkey with a big ass ‘cause 
                        fuck it, that ass looks right, 
                        right? 
                             (looks at the brass)
                        And the darker the skin, the 
                        better, right, Cap? 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        GET THE FUCK DOWN OFF THERE, DEETS!

                                 DEETS
                        Blackmail, mob muscle, 
                        racketeering, protection payoffs... 
                             (to the brass)
                        ...those $500 loafers on your feet 
                        ain’t buying themselves, right, 
                        gents?

           The HALF DOZEN UNIFORMS finally show - guns drawn, carefully 
           approaching Deets... he knows it’s over, looks to the media 
           who are feasting on this like a pack of starving wolves...
                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Report this! Run with it! 
                        Investigate all these 
                        motherfuckers! Don’t let this die! 
                        BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE! 

           Deets looks around frantically as he tries to muscle off a 
           half dozen cops...

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the camera? Where’s the 
                        camera?!

           A few reporters point to a CAMERAMAN with a rig on his 
           shoulder...

           Deets stares into the camera as he fights the cops off--

                                 DEETS (CONT’D)
                        That’s for Jacob, Bella... 

           Off Deets staring into the camera we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           BELLA

           ...staring at Deets on the TV getting manhandled and cuffed 
           by the uniformed officers, still looking at the camera as 
           best he can, a wicked smile on his face...

           Bella smiles back...

                                 BELLA
                        Effective. 

           Off Bella’s satisfied smile we--

           slowly------------->fade------------->to-------------->BLACK.

                    --A FEW MOMENTS OF BLACKNESS BEFORE WE--

           FADE IN ON:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Bella sitting there with a YOUNG DETECTIVE...
                                 YOUNG DETECTIVE
                        Came to this morning... nurse said 
                        he’s been in and out. 

           Bella nods... 

           A moment before Jacob starts to stir... Bella approaches the 
           bed, sits next to him, tears in her eyes as he slowly opens 
           his... 

           Look at each other--

                                 JACOB
                             (groggy, struggling)
                        Isabella..? When... When did you..?

                                 BELLA
                        I just got here, just now, dad, 
                        this morning... 

                                 JACOB
                        I had these dreams that you were 
                        here talking to me, and I could 
                        hear your voice, and you kept 
                        telling me it was going to be okay, 
                        and...

           He’s weak still... 

                                 BELLA
                        Rest. It’s okay, it’s okay... I’m 
                        here.  

           Bella grabs his hand in hers and looks to the Young Detective 
           with a nod as Jacob smiles and rests his eyelids again... 

                                 YOUNG DETECTIVE
                        Okay. The blues posted up at the 
                        door know the deal, on the team. 
                        You stay as long as you want... 

           The Young Detective gets up and moves to leave...

                                 BELLA
                        Where are you going?

                                 YOUNG DETECTIVE
                             (over his shoulder as he 
                              leaves)
                        It’s a new day, Bella...  

           Bella looks at his feet as he leaves - cop salary approved 
           $39.95 Payless loafers on... a new day indeed. 
           Off the slow grin creeping across Bella’s face we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A HARD HITTING MONTAGE

           -the Young Detective and his army of righteous police 
           officers busting in on every last high ranking corrupt 
           motherfucker on the NYPD - arresting them; doing it the right 
           way... 

           A TOOTH spits from the CAPTAIN’S smug face as one of the 
           officers stomps on the dudes grill like he’s putting out a 
           smoke... 

           Hey, Rome wasn’t built in a day, right?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           BELLA

           ...driving Jericho’s 442 across the Brooklyn Bridge... 

           Fleetwood Mac’s ‘go your own way’ blasting from the car’s 
           radio:

           you can go your own way
           go your own way

           The wind rushes through Bella’s hair, the sunlight kissing 
           her face through the car’s windshield... God finally smiling 
           down on her... 

           Shuts her eyes for a moment when--

           BANG! 

           ...a GUNSHOT rings out and the car’s passenger side WINDOW 
           EXPLODES!

           Cars on the bridge halt to a screeching stop, some smashing 
           into each other, other narrowly avoiding it, the mighty 442 
           swerving wildly, BLOWING THROUGH THE BARRIER, soaring off the 
           bridge, EXPLODING MID-AIR as it crashes into the water below.  

           C...........H............A............O............S!

           People run from cars; some fleeing, some looking over the 
           guardrail at the wrecked 442 being swallowed up by the dark 
           waters... Bella being eaten with it.  

           ON A ROOFTOP 100 YARDS OUT
           PRIEST disassembles a sniper rifle, tears in his eyes... 

           He gives the scene one last look as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           PRIEST 

           Staring at something, vacant eyes... 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           ...he’s standing in front of a GROUP OF GANGSTERS sitting at 
           a table.  

           The news report of Bella’s death playing on the TV in the 
           b.g. 

           An ASIAN GANGSTER - the one we saw Bella let escape to save 
           Deets - throws him a bag of cash...

                                 ASIAN GANGSTER
                        Two million...

                                 PRIEST
                        I want to buy the hit off of me and 
                        Jericho. A million each... 

           Priest pushes the bag with the two mill in it back to him...

           The Asian Gangster considers this for a moment then nods and 
           shoos him away as we-- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FUNERAL

           ...and Bella being laid to rest. 

           Deets and Jericho there. Priest in the distance, can barely 
           watch, eventually walks away...

           He passes a few unsavory looking characters there to make 
           sure it’s real, that she’s dead... it is, she is.  

           Back to Jericho who’s just staring at the grave as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           JERICHO 

           His stare...

           WIDEN TO REVEAL

           ...he’s staring at a TV screen, watching a VHS copy of the 
           NEWS REPORT of Bella’s death: 

           ...rewinds the tape, plays it again, rewinds it, plays it 
           again, rewinds it, plays it again... 

           ...staring at the screen the entire time, his eyes squint as 
           we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CHURCH CEMETERY - NIGHT

           ...and Jericho deep into a grave, digging it out, filthy.  

           It’s Bella’s.

           Lighter burned crack pipes and used heroin needles litter the 
           area like discarded candy wrappers. 

           Another deep thrust of the shovel when--

           WHACK! 

           ...the buried treasure... 

           Jericho digs around the coffin then lifts it up and uses the 
           hard metal of the shovel to pry it open...

           Inside:

           A CHILD’S BABY DOLL with a marker drawn smile on it...staring 
           at him...as if she knew he’d eventually put it together. 

           Bella’s voice rings out, as if to taunt him:

                                 BELLA (V.O.)
                        Save that macho ‘baby doll’ shit 
                        for the cheap seats... 

           He laughs out loud as he holds up the doll and we--

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           BELLA

           ...driving Jericho’s 442 across the Brooklyn Bridge... 
           Fleetwood Mac’s ‘go your own way’ blasting from the car’s 
           radio:

           you can go your own way
           go your own way

           The wind rushes through Bella’s hair, the sunlight kissing 
           her face through the car’s windshield... God finally smiling 
           down on her... 

           Shuts her eyes for a moment when--

           BANG! 

           ...a GUNSHOT rings out and the car’s passenger side WINDOW 
           EXPLODES!

           The bullet sings past Bella’s head as she quickly SETS A BOMB 
           IN THE CAR and pulls the steering wheel hard left sending the 
           442 careening off the bridge...

           She DIVES FROM THE CAR, mid air, landing in the water below 
           before the bomb goes off and the CAR EXPLODES. 

           Everyone on the bridge watching the flaming car sink as 
           BELLA’S HEAD ROCKETS UP from the water below the bridge.  

           She fills her lungs with a massive breath of air then dives 
           back down and swims from the scene... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           PRIEST 

           ...rushing to his car, getting in and racing to the meet 
           point where Bella emerges from the water and gets into his 
           car with a smile... 

           BACK TO SCENE

           ...and Jericho staring at the child’s toy baby doll.

                                 JERICHO
                        Well played, lady... 
                             (shaking his head)
                        ...well played. 

           Jericho smiles to himself as--

           The Rolling Stones’s ‘sympathy for the devil’ kicks in and--

                                                                  INTO:
           MID CREDIT SEQUENCE:

           *The IMAGE OF DEETS comes up ON SCREEN, suit and tie on the 
           witness stand in front of a packed courtroom, as a young (not 
           yet batshit fucking crazy) U.S. Attorney Rudy Guiliani leads 
           him through questioning...

           WRITING ON SCREEN (in italics) MIXES IN WITH VARIOUS IMAGES 

           Detective Alder Deets spent the better part of the next six 
           months single handedly cleaning up the NYPD...

           Deets, now in his prison issued jumpsuit, dives over the chow 
           table onto a gangster before the guy can manage pulling a 
           shiv (a prison-made knife) on another inmate and starts 
           beating the absolute dog shit out of the dude...

           Then the next 5-7 (good behavior permitting) cleaning up 
           Rikers Island... 

           The image abruptly shifts to Deets with a black eye making a 
           funny face at his daughter and smiling a toothless grin as 
           she explodes in laughter, his ex-wife looking on proudly...   

           All while still trying to impress his daughter. 

           *The IMAGE OF PRIEST comes up ON SCREEN as he locks the door 
           to the church...

           Priest is still a man of the cloth... 

           Priest walks down the street, pulls a few dollar bills from 
           his cloak and puts them into the empty guitar case of a blind 
           busker strumming for his supper. 

           Still doing God’s work...

           A couple of TOUGH LOOKING CHARACTERS sit against PRIEST’S NEW 
           CAMARO as he approaches... they pull switchblades...  

                                 TOUGH CHARACTER 
                        This your ride, priest?

           A wicked smile creeps across Priest’s face as he nods and 
           starts to unbutton his cloak...  

           ...however that might be. 
           Now, in terms of Jericho and Bella... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ON SCREEN: MONTANA, 6 MONTHS LATER

           A WOMAN on a step ladder works to stock books in a small 
           bookstore... her back to us... a conservative dress with a 
           sweater over it, flats, her hair in a pony tail...  

           Doris Day’s ‘it’s magic’ plays ever so faintly in the b.g.

           you sigh, a song begins
           you speak and i hear violins

           The DING of a BELL as the front door to the shop opens and 
           the woman stops, turns her head ever so slightly to smell the 
           air... a familiar cologne... we get the slightest peak at her 
           face... it’s BELLA!

           it’s magic

           She slowly steps from the ladder and turns around to see who 
           entered but the store is empty... no-one... just the baby 
           doll from the casket sitting upright on the counter... 

           ...a marker drawn wink added to the marker drawn smile on it. 

           Bella looks at the doll then out the window to see the ass 
           end of brand spanking new 442 barreling out of sight... 

           She shakes her head, smiling to herself. 

                                 BELLA
                        Always has to get the last word 
                        in...

           Goes to put the doll on the windowsill when she catches the 
           sight of an OLDER MAN across the street walking towards the 
           shop, holding two coffees... looks like her dad... the man 
           approaches... it is.  

           Jacob smiles and waves to Bella. Bella smiles and waves back. 

           Peace... 

           ...finally.

           And...

           .........................IT’S MAGIC---------------->

                                                              for now...
