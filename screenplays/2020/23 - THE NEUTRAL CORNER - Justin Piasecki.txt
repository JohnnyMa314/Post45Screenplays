           EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

           A 1980s sedan upside down in a roadside ditch. Battered and 
           smoking. As we float toward the wreckage...

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (archival, scratchy)
                        ...to the athletes assembled before 
                        you, to those here in the arena, to 
                        those viewing around the world, I 
                        declare open the games of this 23rd 
                        Olympiad of the modern era.

           A bang from inside the car. Another. Another. The door kicks 
           open. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK. Then the muffled roar of a crowd pounding above us.

           INT. ARENA TUNNEL - NIGHT

           We’re floating behind a satin-robed BOXER, hood up as he 
           marches through the arena’s concrete underbelly, trainers and 
           crew following in formation. Owning the road. 

           This is fight night. 

           Suddenly they all step aside, making room for A SINGLE MAN 
           passing through. Dress pants, blue collared shirt, black bow 
           tie. A silent monarch, greying hair around cauliflower ears, 
           the leather veneer earned over a thousand blows.   

           This is RAY TENNYSON (50s). He is the referee of this fight.

           Others pressing the walls as he marches through - custodians, 
           ring girls, execs. Never slowing. 

           Down the hall a few MEN IN SUITS wait near a dressing room. 
           Ray pauses a moment before entering, shaking hands with one. 

                                 RAY
                        Governor.

           Ray disappears inside. The Governor must wait here.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Catered and staffed. A classic movie poster on the wall: 
           Astaire and Rogers in “Shall We Dance?” 
           The CORNER MEN, the INSPECTORS, the PRESS, all falling silent 
           as Ray enters. A FIGHTER on a table getting his fists 
           wrapped, looking up. 

           Ray approaches, gets eye level. 

                                 RAY
                        How are we doing Mr. Dwyer?

                                 FIGHTER
                        Good Mr. Ray. 

                                 RAY
                        Okay. When the bell rings I want 
                        you to stop punching and return to 
                        your corner. I don’t want any extra 
                        curricular activity. I’m too old 
                        for that crap. Got it? Let’s hear 
                        it.

                                 FIGHTER
                        Yes Mr. Ray. 

                                 RAY
                             (to the room)
                        For the chief seconds, I don’t care 
                        who wins tonight. I care about the 
                        sanctity of the fight. I have to 
                        know your guy is okay at all times, 
                        and it’s not my job to assume it, 
                        he’s got to prove it to me. He gets 
                        knocked down, he’s going to stand, 
                        he’s going to walk over, he’s going 
                        to show me his gloves. If he can do 
                        those three things, we fight. 
                        Everyone understand?
                             (then, in Spanish, German, 
                              Russian) 
                        Entiendes? Verstehst du? Znayesh?

           Nods all around. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        No standing eight count, no three 
                        knockdown rule, you cannot be saved 
                        by the bell at any time except the 
                        final round. Will you comply with 
                        my wishes?

           The fighter obeys. Ray is one of two men who control his 
           destiny tonight.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Good. Let’s check that mouth piece.
           INT. ARENA - NIGHT

           Emerging from the tunnel we find ourselves on the floor of 
           the MGM GRAND GARDEN. Lights and cables snaking under the 
           logos of brands and flags of nations. Cut Men carting spit 
           buckets past Nevada State Troopers. Tuxedo’d Commentators 
           shouting over sixteen-thousand spectators, the sound of this 
           billion-dollar industry roaring up to the rafters. 

           And from above...

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER PA)
                        ...welcome you to the MGM GRAND 
                        here in Las Vegas for Showtime 
                        Championship Boxing presented to 
                        you by Top Rank along with...

           IN THE RING

           Overflowing with the entourages of each fighter.  

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                        The WBA, the president is Gilberto 
                        Mendoza, along with the Nevada 
                        State Athletic Commission, the 
                        chairmen is Tom Hoover... 

           HOOVER (50) talking ringside, serious. An overseer in a suit. 

           Ray stands apart against the ropes, eyes closed, not letting 
           the hype of the intros affect him. His hands folded and zen, 
           now wearing rubber nitrile gloves. Blood is coming. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                        ..Our three judges scoring this 
                        bout, from Nevada Mark Boone, also 
                        from Nevada Carol Geffen, and from 
                        New Jersey Kenny Yaeger. 

           For these three Ray opens his eyes, a curt bow to his fellow 
           arbiters around the apron. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                        And now introducing our third man 
                        in the ring, the referee in charge 
                        of this bout, Ray Tennyson.

           No attention to himself, only stepping forward as the ring 
           begins to clear. 
           IN THE STANDS

           TWO MEN in the nosebleeds, still amongst the screaming crowd. 
           Young, tattoos crawling up thick necks. One in a skull cap, 
           the other not watching the boxers, but studying Ray himself. 

           THE RING

           Ray meets the fighters in the center, stepping between them. 

                                 RAY
                        Gentlemen, you both received 
                        instructions in the dressing room 
                        for what’s expected. Low lines are 
                        going to be here, and here... 

           Ray indicates points on their belts. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        This will be a professionally 
                        fought bout, because you’re both 
                        professionals. I know it, you know 
                        it, and that’s how I expect it. I 
                        say break, you break. I say fight, 
                        you fight. I want caution at all 
                        times, protect yourself at all 
                        times. Are we ready to box? 

           Hearing Ray but eyes locked. They’re ready.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Tap it up then, let’s go to work.

           Gloves smash and they recede to their corners. Ray remains in 
           the center, arms outstretched, the law between lions, holding 
           them at bay.   

           The crowd is pulsing. The volume is rising. Ray’s eyes hone 
           in on a small gavel hovering above a ringside bell. 

           It strikes. 

           A blur as they clash. Blood sprays across his dress shirt.

           INT. CASINO BAR - NIGHT

           More saloon than Caesar’s. A dive with a few threadbare card 
           tables scattered around. This isn’t Vegas. This is RENO.  

           A dusty TV bolted above the bar silently plays highlights 
           from the fight. A CLIP on repeat of Ray taking an inadvertent 
           hit during a clinch. He reels but recovers, spits, instantly 
           diving back in. The crowd LEAPING. 
           Ray sits alone at the bar. He’s changed his shirt, a drink 
           and a newspaper laid out before him. A post-fight tradition. 

                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Replay is gonna start in a few. 

           A bartender stepping in to swap out his drink.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                        Want me to turn it on for you?

                                 RAY
                        What for?

           Ray looks up from his paper. Stares back through a newly 
           forming black eye. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Think I wasn’t paying attention the 
                        first time?

           The bartender grins, refills his drink and steps away.

           Ray reaches for the glass, pauses. Looking down he scratches 
           at a dried fleck of blood left on his wrist.

           INT. RAY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Desert chic mixed with military clean. Watercolors and 
           cactus. A woman’s touch here.

           INT. RAY’S HOME, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ray showers. As the water rolls off his back we see a line of 
           scar tissue running down the base of his neck. Surgical.

           INT. RAY’S HOME, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The television left on, boxing after-shows bleeding into late 
           night infomercials. Ray turns off the television. A congested 
           voice drifts over from the bed.

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        Did you win? 

                                 RAY
                        Oh yeah. You should see the other 
                        guys. How’s the head?
                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        ..Don’t talk so loud... 
                             (her answer, then)
                        We’re out of kleenex. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m sorry. I’ll pick more up 
                        tomorrow. 

           She turns, hearing him groan into bed. CONNIE is in her 40s, 
           a little Texas in her voice, an old A&M Law sweatshirt on. 
           She gives him a sleepy kiss before rolling back over. 

           As she drifts back to sleep...

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh yeah, someone called looking for 
                        you tonight.  

                                 RAY
                        Yeah? 

                                 CONNIE
                        Yeah... guess they don’t have Pay 
                        Per View. Didn’t leave a name. 

                                 RAY
                        Probably someone from work. I’ll 
                        get it in the morning. 

                                 CONNIE
                        When do you go in? 

                                 RAY
                        Early. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Okay. Well I ironed your shirts. 
                             (a beat)
                        And I cleaned your gun. 

           INT. RENO DISTRICT COURTROOM - DAY

           Waiting to begin. Glimpses of the chosen decor on the walls: 

           The Nevada State seal, a print of Raphael’s Judgement of 
           Solomon, and above the bench: A framed pair of antique boxing 
           gloves, circa 1900. An inscription beneath: T.R. Esquire. 

           Booted men and women grouped in side conversations around the 
           gallery, all falling silent as a bailiff, ODELL, calls out. 
                                 ODELL
                        All rise. Let the record reflect 
                        the court is now in session. 

           They do so as RAY emerges from chambers, black robe flowing, 
           a pair of reading glasses tucked with a few files under his 
           arm. He steps up into his chair, perching above it all. 

                                 RAY
                        Good morning. 

           The gallery murmurs back as Ray pulls a docket forward. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        We have the matter of the State of 
                        Nevada versus Knotts, case number 
                        05 CF 381. Will the parties...
                             (looks up, sees something)
                        Will the parties state their 
                        appearance for the record please. 

           Attorneys at each table rise. 

                                 ABNEY
                        Good morning, Judge. The State of 
                        Nevada appears by Washoe County 
                        District Attorney Mark Abney.

                                 MELISSA
                        And good morning, William Knotts 
                        appears in person. He's represented 
                        by Jerome Buting, immediately to my 
                        left, and I am Melissa Mathis.

           A beat.

                                 RAY
                        Would both counsels approach the 
                        bench please. 

           The attorneys exchange looks as they approach. The Court 
           Reporter removes her hands from her keyboard as Ray leans in 
           to the attorneys. Silence, eyeing them both. Then: 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                             (to Melissa)
                        You changed your hair.

                                 MELISSA
                        I did your honor.

                                 RAY
                        Coming to my party?
                                 MELISSA
                        I’ll be there.

           Ray turns to Abney now.

                                 RAY
                        Mr. Abney are you aware miss Mathis 
                        was my law clerk for a number of 
                        years prior to joining the public 
                        defender’s office?

                                 ABNEY
                        I was not your honor. 

                                 RAY
                        Now that you are, do you feel I can 
                        still provide a fair, unbiased, and 
                        impartial manner in this case? 

           Staring him down through his black eye, intimidating. 

                                 ABNEY
                        W-well, I --

                                 RAY
                        Relax Mr. Abney. You can both 
                        return to your seats. 

           They do so, Abney a little thrown as Ray nods to the Court 
           Reporter, hands at the ready as he addresses the court. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        With respect to this matter, I know 
                        and have a prior professional 
                        relationship with the defense’s 
                        counsel. With the integrity that 
                        the people of this beautiful city 
                        have entrusted and believe this 
                        seat has - it’s appropriate for me 
                        to recuse myself from this case at 
                        this time. We will notify the 
                        district administrator’s office, 
                        and there will be another judge 
                        assigned for prompt rescheduling of 
                        the preliminary hearing. 

           Ray taps the gavel. 

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - EVENING

           Classic. Lamplit. Ray’s robe and gun harness now hanging on 
           the rack. Degrees and photos on the wall. He’s been in here 
           for years.
           Ray works at his desk, hidden somewhere under a mound of 
           paperwork. His current clerk, LYLE, appears in the doorway. 

                                 LYLE 
                        1118.1 motion hearing in the 
                        morning. Want me to pull the trial 
                        transcript?

                                 RAY
                        What for. Think I wasn’t paying 
                        attention the first time?

           Lyle makes a face. The usual answer. 

                                 LYLE
                        Headed home soon? 

                                 RAY
                        Speaking engagement. You can get 
                        out of here. Go see your lady. Have 
                        a good night. 

                                 LYLE
                        You too sir.

           But Lyle hovers in the doorway, watching Ray continue to 
           work.

                                 LYLE (CONT'D)
                        How are you ever going to retire?

           Ray looks up at this. He sits back, thinks on it. 

                                 RAY
                        Well... I suppose, one day, I just 
                        won’t show up.

           INT. RENO BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           Sweat and bricks. Pillars of punching bags along the walls. 
           The lights turned low over everything but the sparring ring 
           in the center. 

                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        I’d like to think you’re all here 
                        tonight seeking the sage wisdom of 
                        some veterans of the sport... 

           Faces listening from metal folding chairs set out around the 
           ring. Amateurs and apprentices taking notes. A VIDEO CAMERA 
           taping in the back. All watching Ray pacing inside the ropes. 
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        ...and not just because it’s 
                        required by the Nevada State 
                        Athletic Commission to get your 
                        official’s license. 

           Soft laughs from the seats. We recognize CAROL, the judge 
           from the opening fight, sitting ringside with other speakers.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Either way, tonight I’m going to 
                        tell you what this is. And I’m 
                        going to show you, courtesy of our 
                        two fighters on loan here: who’s 
                        rabbit punching, who’s raking 
                        laces, who’s got a glove or knee on 
                        the mat. What’s going to cost the 
                        point.  

           He motions to two TEENAGE FEMALE BOXERS on standby in the 
           back. Then:

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        But first I want to talk about what 
                        it means to be the third man in the 
                        ring. The other judges, they won’t 
                        see everything, they’ll be looking 
                        to you, everyone will be looking to 
                        you. There is no instant replay, 
                        there are no second opinions. So 
                        you go in, you make your calls 
                        alone, and those calls stand. It’s 
                        why I don’t rewatch fights, I don’t 
                        reread old transcripts. Your calls, 
                        you can’t take them back. People 
                        will praise you, more will blame 
                        you. This profession has lost a lot 
                        of guys, good guys, who couldn’t 
                        let go of the calls they’ve made. 
                        The curse of the second guess. 
                        Maybe that hit was low, maybe I 
                        should have called the fight. I 
                        should have seen, I should have 
                        known... well that’s bullshit. Our 
                        robes, this patch --

           He taps at a patch on his breast, a pair of boxing gloves 
           outlined by the state of Nevada.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Doesn’t make us anything other than 
                        human. You won’t always be right, 
                        but that’s not your job. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        In the moment, you make sure you’ve 
                        got a decent head and a good heart, 
                        and you make the decision that 
                        moment allows. That’s your job.

           Meeting eyes in the audience. Letting this sink in.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Okay, let’s see one. 

           INT. RENO BOXING GYM - LATER 

           Streetlight spilling in as two men enter the gym. One we 
           recognize, the athletic commissioner from the MGM fight, 
           HOOVER. A man in a polo following beside him. KURT REDFORD. 

           The sounds of a fight brewing deeper inside. Wandering 
           closer...

           The two female boxers now fighting in the ring, red and blue 
           shorts. Ray floating around them, barking shots. Hoover and 
           Redford stand back by the video camera, watching Ray work.

           IN THE RING

           The boxers lock up, start trading point blank shots. Ray 
           dodging in and out, gauging. 

                                 RAY
                        Back of the head, watch it watch 
                        it... Okay break. Back it off.   

           Ray pries them apart. Circling again he looks out into the 
           audience, sees the two men in back of the room. Hoover nods.

           Suddenly Red EXPLODES with a cross. Blue REELS back, knees 
           buckling. She gets her balance, gloves coming back up -

           But Ray is already between them, sending Red to her corner as 
           he fans out his hands at Blue, starts counting...

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        1, 2, 3... 

                                 BLUE
                             (straightening)
                        I’m up I’m up, what are-

                                 RAY
                        Knee touched the mat. That’s a 
                        knock down kid. One point. 5, 6...
                                 BLUE
                        What!? No it didn’t!

           Unconvinced looks from trainees around the ring. They didn’t 
           see it either. Even Red looks doubtful. Ray could give a 
           shit, ignoring them all.

                                 RAY
                        Right knee. Check the tape if you 
                        want. 8...

           Hoover snorts, ribs his partner. This is the guy they came to 
           see. 

           In the ring Ray flags the point, sees Carole hesitant, pen 
           stalled over her scorecard. 

                                 CAROLE
                        ...Ray I was two feet away, I don’t 
                        think-

           Ray straightens up, eyes the clock, calls out:

                                 RAY
                        That’s round.
                             (to a trainee)
                        Terry why don’t you jump up, take 
                        the next few. 

           Ray climbs down, throws a towel over his shoulder. He catches 
           a look from Carole as he passes, gives her a reassuring nod. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Check the tape.

           With that he waves the two men over toward the gym office.

           As they disappear inside a few trainees huddle around the 
           video camera, its viewfinder screen folded out: 

           The end of the last round pulled up. They replay it, 
           forwarding frame by frame, the knee lowering, lowering...

           Touches. Just a single frame, but undeniable. Trainees’ faces 
           going slack, gazing toward the office door, now closed. 

                                 TRAINEE
                        How the hell did he see that?

           INT. RENO BOXING GYM, OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ray draws the blinds, digs a water out of a cooler. 
                                 HOOVER
                        How’s the eye doing?

                                 RAY
                        Eh, modeling career is on hold.

           They shake. 

                                 HOOVER
                        Heard you’re thinking of starting 
                        one of these places yourself.

                                 RAY
                        Thinking about it.

            Careful to say more. Hoover then motions toward his guest. 

                                 HOOVER
                        Ray this is Kurt Redford. He’s down 
                        from Colorado Springs. 

                                 KURT
                        Good to meet you Ray.

           Offering his hand. A subtle pause before Ray takes it, 
           picking up on something. 

                                 RAY
                        Same.

                                 HOOVER
                        Why don’t we all take a seat. 

           All finding a seat, shoving equipment aside. 

                                 KURT
                        I got your name from Doug Hackett. 
                        He sends his best.

                                 RAY
                        Doug’s a good man. How’s he doing? 

                                 KURT
                        Still thinks his doctors are trying 
                        to kill him. Single handedly 
                        keeping the steak industry alive. 

                                 RAY
                        The same then. 

           Chuckles fall into silence. Then:

                                 HOOVER
                        So Ray, how retired are you? 
                                 RAY
                        Well... I promised Connie end of 
                        the year. Told the bar association 
                        the same. Suppose I should give you 
                        my two weeks at some point. 

                                 HOOVER
                        ...why don’t you hold off on that. 

           Another silence. Kurt sits forward. 

                                 KURT
                        Ray I’m on the committee to elect 
                        the officials for next year’s 
                        Olympic Games. Names we can count 
                        on, who know their sports, clean 
                        records, incorruptible reputations. 
                        I’d like to nominate you as one of 
                        the candidates.

                                 RAY
                        You want me to ref for the games?

           Kurt and Hoover exchange a quick look. 

                                 KURT
                        We don’t want you to just ref for 
                        the games. We want you to open 
                        them. 
                             (a beat)
                        One athlete, one coach, one 
                        official, each chosen to be the 
                        icon of their field. At the opening 
                        ceremonies you’ll walk the track. 
                        You’ll take the podium, and you 
                        would take the Olympic oath on 
                        behalf of every judge and referee 
                        in every sport in the entire world 
                        that night. 
                             (a smile)
                        And then, I want you to ref the 
                        games.

           Ray, stunned silent. 

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        Now officially there are other 
                        candidates. And there’s a bit of a 
                        vetting process. Background check, 
                        proficiency test, interview, we’ll 
                        give you some matches at the 
                        Olympic Trials as sort of a dry 
                        run. But get through those, there’s 
                        a fair shot... podium’s yours.
           Ray sits, still frozen. 

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        That is, if you’re interested. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m interested. 

           EXT. RENO NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

           Ray runs, pounding ahead, a nightly habit. He starts up a 
           hill...

           AT THE TOP

           Alone here, a vista of the city. He slows, not winded, just 
           overwhelmed. A mist in his eyes, the situation hitting him. 

           He screams. Years of pent-up yearning flowing out of him. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Applause. We’re in the middle of a RETIREMENT PARTY, beers 
           and seafood, boxing and courthouse colleagues all turned to 
           the center as Connie shoves a reluctant Ray forward. 

           He clears his throat, shrugs.

                                 RAY
                        Well this was supposed to be a 
                        retirement party. I know we may be 
                        kicking the can a little now on 
                        that one but, well we’d already put 
                        down a deposit on the shrimp. 
                             (laughter)
                        Thank you all for being here. 
                        Seeing some of these faces just 
                        reminds me of how long I’ve 
                        actually been doing this. When I 
                        first started out... paid nothing, 
                        worked two jobs, just for the 
                        pleasure of getting punched in the 
                        head. When we graduated law school 
                        Connie said Well, at least you 
                        don’t need to work two jobs 
                        anymore... thank God that didn’t  
                        last. 
                             (looking out now)
                        It’s truly been the greatest night 
                        shift I’ve ever had. 

           His glass goes up. A hundred more raise with him.
           LATER

           Ray weaving through the crowd, nods and backslaps. Tom Hoover 
           and his bailiff Odell watching him from afar. 

                                 HOOVER
                        You know how many guys manage to 
                        stay certified in both pro and 
                        international boxing? Guy is a 
                        glutton for punishment and 
                        paperwork. 

                                 ODELL
                        Shit I don’t even like to file my 
                        taxes on time. 

           Across the room Ray stops to chat with a couple, a towering 
           man in a muscle-strained blazer. They exchange a few words, a 
           grin. As Ray moves on we see the man is EVANDER HOLYFIELD. 

           AT THE BAR

           Ray slides up, flags down the bartender. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah gin sling and a Stella. 

           The bartender nods, sets off. Ray waits alone, rubs his eyes. 
           A slab of tacky wrapping paper appears, sliding down to him. 

           Ray looks over. Finds GRAHAM YATES grinning back at him. 60s, 
           warm, flat cap and tobacco rind of a veteran sports writer.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Figured you had enough gold 
                        watches.

                                 RAY
                        Well, you know I’ll always take 
                        cash...

           They lean over a moment, embrace.  

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Wasn’t sure you’d be in town. 
                        Thought your editors might have you 
                        off covering cock fights in 
                        Indonesia or something... 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Well you only fake-retire once. 

           Ray smiles, turns the gift over in his hands.
                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        You don’t have to open it now-

           Ray tears into it. It’s a framed FIGHT POSTER from Korea. A 
           black and white still of two fighters mid strike - a younger 
           RAY focused between them. 

                                 RAY
                        Goddamn... look at that hair. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        First WBC international fight. 
                        Believe we both popped our cherries 
                        on that one. Pretty sure I saw you 
                        puke in Kwon Soon’s spit bucket 
                        before the match.

                                 RAY
                        Horse shit. Never happened... 

           A running joke. Ray drifts off, disappearing into the poster.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Did feel like a pretty big house 
                        that night though...

                                 GRAHAM
                        And look at you now. House doesn’t 
                        get much bigger. Really, 
                        congratulations Ray. You following 
                        the Olympic Trials at all? 

                                 RAY
                        No, they’re bringing me out next 
                        week. Anyone interesting? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Eh... there is this one kid, former 
                        AABA champ. 26 and 2. 

           The bartender drops off Ray’s drinks. 

                                 RAY
                        AABA, WBC, IBF... alphabet mafia. 
                        Where’s that league out of, Albany? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Penitentiary league.

           Graham studies Ray as he goes for his drink. Nothing.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        Name’s Cameron Mills. Ring any 
                        bells?
                                 RAY
                        Nope. Why, should it? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Possibly. Apparently you’re the one 
                        who convicted him in the first 
                        place. 

           Ray pauses briefly. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah and when was that?

                                 GRAHAM
                        His case? About eight years back. 

                                 RAY
                        Graham, you know how many cases 
                        I’ve seen in eight years? 

                                 GRAHAM
                             (relenting)
                        Yeah I figured... 

                                 RAY
                        His record. He even eligible?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Mayweather. Liston. Tyson. If we 
                        DQ’d every felon from boxing we’d 
                        be out of a job. Olympics run no 
                        different. And anyway, apparently 
                        the kid’s been doing pretty good on 
                        the amateur circuit. Got out year 
                        before last, paroled on some 
                        technicality. I pulled the 
                        transcript hoping to make some 
                        sense of it but, hell it’s all a 
                        bit over my head. Maybe I could 
                        send it over. There are a few parts-

                                 RAY
                        I didn’t convict him.

                                 GRAHAM
                        How’s that?

                                 RAY
                        I’ll save you the read. Criminal 
                        trial, I can tell you without 
                        looking I didn't convict anybody. 
                        Jury did. 

           Graham nods, accepting. 
                                 GRAHAM
                        So no recollection whatsoever huh? 

           Staring at each other. Sees what this was.

                                 RAY
                        Thanks for the gift Graham. Hey, 
                        enjoy the shrimp. Paid enough for 
                        it.

           With that Ray grabs his drinks and heads off. Graham watches 
           him disappear into the crowd, embarrassed... but wondering.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           The silhouettes of several HORSES, huddled together for the 
           night. Barely visible in the glow of a far off porch light. 

           EXT. RAY'S HOME, BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           We see Ray’s house backs up to a sprawling pasture, the 
           Sierra Mountain range looming hazily in the distance.

           Ray sits in a rocking chair, tie undone, staring off. Connie 
           appears in sweats in the doorway behind him. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Coming to bed?

           Ray smiles, nods. Connie gives him a kiss, slips back inside. 
           Alone now Ray goes back to the horses. He’s wide awake.

           EXT. RENO STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ray pounds forward, steps echoing off the silent buildings 
           around him. His eyes bored ahead...

           PRELAP:

                                 COURT OFFICER (V.O.)
                        ...next. Case number 239488FC 

           INT. RENO COURTROOM - DAY (THE PAST)

           Ray’s courtroom. State seal and gloves on the wall. The 
           attorney we met earlier, Melissa, now younger and sitting at 
           the clerk’s desk, handing papers to Ray on the bench, not yet 
           gone grey.
           The Prosecutor and Public Defender remain in their seats, 
           working through the assembly line as a kid in an orange 
           jumpsuit walks off, another taking his seat. 

           The same face we saw studying Ray in the stands of the 
           opening fight. CAMERON MILLS, now 17 and leaner, what looks 
           to be glass cuts healing on his face. 

                                 RAY
                        Okay, we’ve got the State of Nevada 
                        vs Cameron Miles. Mr. Miles this is 
                        an arraignment, this is not your 
                        court date. This should be 
                        relatively brief. You’ve been 
                        charged with-

           Cameron utters something under his breath.  

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        What’s that?

           His public defender leans over to hear, rises. 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        He’d just like to make the court 
                        aware his name is pronounced Mills, 
                        your honor.  

                                 RAY
                             (adjusting his glasses)
                        My apologies. Mr. Mills you’ve been 
                        charged by Washoe County with a 
                        three part indictment filed on 
                        March 10 of this year against 
                        yourself and Mr. Samuel Brooks, now 
                        deceased, which includes the 
                        following:
                             (off his records)
                        Two counts of permitting drug 
                        abuse, a violation of revised code 
                        292513B. One count of trafficking 
                        harmful intoxicants, each of those 
                        felonies of the 5th degree. And an 
                        added count of gross vehicular 
                        homicide, PAC code 750.317, a 
                        felony punishable by life or any 
                        term of years.

           He quiets, reading on silently. He lowers the records. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        So, counts one and two, the 292 
                        violations. How do we plead?

                        We plead guilty your honor. 

                                 RAY
                        Okay, and count three?

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Guilty your honor. 

                                 RAY
                        And the added count four,  
                        vehicular homicide. 

           A pause here, conferring. 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        We’re standing mute on count three. 

                                 RAY
                        ...standing mute.

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        That’s correct. We are in active 
                        conversations with the DA toward a 
                        possible plea your honor. 

                                 RAY
                             (direct to Cameron)
                        You understand if you deny any 
                        element of the final offense I 
                        won’t be able to accept the plea. 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Understood your honor. 

           But Ray’s eyes remain on Cameron, making sure he’s been 
           heard. Cameron stares right back.  

                                 RAY
                        ...very well. Until then, pursuant 
                        to rule 3.17oC a plea of not guilty 
                        shall be entered on the defendant’s 
                        behalf on the last count of the 
                        indictment. 

           A court reporter typing rapidly, keeping up as he speaks.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        That brings us to bond. What are we 
                        doing? 
                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Your honor considering the 
                        defendant’s age we would ask that 
                        he be released to his guardians on 
                        his own recognizance.

                                 RAY
                        State, any problems with that?

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        We’d also move for the suspension 
                        of his license, including alcohol 
                        and drug prohibitions with health 
                        recovery services and subject to 
                        random substance abuse monitoring.

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        No issues your honor. 

                                 RAY
                        Mr. Mills, any questions?

           That stare again. This kid may not be all there. Ray moves 
           on, reaches for the gavel- 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Okay, bond is-

                                 CAMERON
                        What are those? 

           Ray halts, hearing him for the first time. Ray sees he’s 
           staring at the framed gloves on the wall. 

                                 RAY
                        Boxing gloves. Belonged to a famous 
                        law student. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Who? You?  

                                 RAY
                        ...Teddy Roosevelt.  

           Cameron glares, mumbles something again. 

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                                                     PUBLIC DEFENDER
           What’s that?
                                              Your honor we’re ready to 
                                              close-

                                 CAMERON
                             (rising above)
                        Said don’t need no gloves bitch. 
           Echoing across the court. Ray smirks. Then, calmly...

                                 RAY
                        Bond’s denied, defendant is to be 
                        remanded to custody. 
                             (off defender’s look)
                        You heard him. Sounds like he can 
                        take care of himself. Mr. Mills 
                        pending your plea agreement we’ll 
                        set a pretrial hearing for June 15, 
                        trial hearing set for the following-

           Wood scraping the floor. Ray looks up to see Cameron leaping 
           over the table, bailiffs and corrections officers suddenly on 
           alert as he starts for the bench.

           A wild look before he’s tackled to the floor, four struggling 
           to restrain one, cuffs and keys rattling. 

           Cameron is brought to a stand, now feet from the bench...

           Ray hasn’t flinched. Just stares him down as we hear a click 
           beneath the desk. He quietly sets his now unchambered gun on 
           the podium.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Son, this is Nevada.

           Letting that sit. Ray reaches for his gavel... 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        We’ll see you at trial Mr. Mills. 

           Bangs it down.

           INT. PLANE - DAY (THE PRESENT)

           Ray stares out the window. Beneath: the snow and stone of the 
           Colorado Rockies silently flowing past. 

           His Seat Neighbor stirs behind him, craning his neck. Ray 
           leans back, realizes he’s blocking the view. 

                                 RAY
                        Sorry.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        No you’re okay. 

           They look out together. 
                                 NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
                        Visiting or coming home? 

                                 RAY
                        Visiting.
                             (and then)
                        Used to be home though.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        First time for me, gorgeous huh? 

           Ray only smiles, says nothing, goes back to the window. Then -

                                 NEIGHBOR  (CONT'D)
                        Hey you see that? 

           He nods down below. On the ground: a dot of orange light 
           burning in the distance.

                                 NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
                        What, maybe some kind of forest 
                        fire? 

           Ray squints, slowly starts to grin. 

                                 RAY
                        No.
                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER, COLORADO SPRINGS - DAY

           A COLOSSAL FLAME, roaring atop a three-story iron torch. 

                                                           POP WIDE TO:

           The torch burning over a sprawling campus, Ray looking up as 
           he’s driven through the gates. Flags whipping in the wind 
           over bronze statues, the Olympic rings looming above it all. 

           INT. LOBBY, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           From afar as Ray is cleared through security, slipping a 
           lanyard over his head.

           INT. OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER, VARIOUS - DAY

           Watching through glass as he’s escorted through campus, 
           elites of their sport silently training inside. Marksmen 
           firing in optical head gear. Gymnasts powdering hands. 
           Fencers lunging at electronic targets.
           INT. ATRIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           Alone now Ray walks the walls, statues and murals continuing 
           inside. Jesse Owens...Mia Hamm...Jackie Joyner-Kersey...Ali. 

           A flock of athletes run past outside. Ray wanders to the 
           window, watching them work their way around the track. 

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Ray.

           Another man waiting down the hall, lanyard dangling. Ray 
           placing the face as he walks over, a little younger than Ray, 
           smiling to a fault. This is DANNY PEÑA. 

                                 RAY
                        Danny... 

                                 DANNY
                        You get called up too? 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, committee must be getting 
                        desperate.

           They shake. 

                                 DANNY
                        How are you? We missed you at the 
                        Detroit conference last year. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah I had trial. Let me guess, I 
                        missed Ritchie retell how he fed a 
                        Bally’s steak to Tyson’s tiger 
                        after the Ruddock fight. 

                                 DANNY
                        Couple of times.

                                 RAY
                        How’s Atlantic City been? 

                                 DANNY
                        Slow. Luna and I are actually in 
                        Vegas now. 

                                 RAY
                        Vegas... 

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah. Jersey Athletic Commission’s 
                        got a hundred refs and no fights to 
                        give them.

                        Bunch of guys waiting by the phone. 
                        So, you know, go where the work is.  
                             (gazing around)
                        But hell, can you believe this...

           Silence. Both taking it in.

                                 RAY
                        Not yet.

           Kurt Redford appears down the hall. 

                                 KURT
                        Gentlemen. Sorry to keep you 
                        waiting. I’ll bring y’all inside 
                        now.

           INT. BOXING GYM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           The lights coming on, revealing the ropes and red leather of 
           a boxing acropolis. A grid of vacant boxing rings flanked by 
           white boards and weights, gloves and speed bags. Every piece 
           gleaming like it’s been spit-shined the night before. 

           Kurt leads them across the gym. 

                                 KURT
                        Be a little quiet until we get the 
                        team together. Couple months you’ll 
                        hear these bags running all night. 
                        Office is right over here. 

           Ray falls behind as they move ahead, seeing something...

           A wall of team photos, boxers dating back to the 1930s. He 
           drifts over, eyes falling on one of the teams. 

           1984. Haircuts and gear of the time. A young Evander 
           Holyfield smiling in the top row. Other fighters, names and 
           weight classes listed below. A line at the bottom: 

                   *NOT PICTURED: Tennyson, Raymond, 69kg - Welterweight

           Kurt appears beside him.

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        ‘84. Good team that year.

           Ray just nods, looking on...

                                 RAY
                        ...Yeah. We were. 

           He flashes a pained smile, turns for the office. 
           INT. GYM OFFICE, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           All three flipping through regulations paperwork. 

                                 KURT
                        ...286 boxers, 273 bouts, 76 
                        countries, translates to about 35 
                        officials. We’re sending three. 

           Kurt sets the binder aside. 

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        As for the fighters, used to be 
                        pretty simple. Eight weight 
                        classes, eight spots, you win at 
                        trials you’re on the team. But 
                        boxing went off and got too damn 
                        popular, so now we have the 
                        qualifiers. It’s at these two we’ll 
                        have you guys come in, run your 
                        matches, prove your stuff.   

           Ray and Danny staring back. They’re ready.

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        Now we just finished the Eastern 
                        Qualifier in Philadelphia. That 
                        leaves the Last Chance Qualifier 
                        here in Colorado Springs, then the 
                        trials themselves two months later 
                        in Dallas. Ray, that’ll be yours. 
                        Danny we’ll bring you back here in 
                        a few weeks. 
                             (digging through papers)
                        This is the list of the fighters 
                        enrolled for each event. Take a 
                        look, let me know if you see any 
                        conflicts of interest, sign off at 
                        the bottom.

           Kurt sets out two sheets, sliding them across the desk. Ray 
           stares at his a moment, throws Kurt a nervous smile. 

                                 RAY
                        Should I have my lawyer present 
                        Kurt? 

                                 KURT
                             (hands going up)
                        I’m required to ask that. After 
                        what happened in Rio with the 
                        Russians, Olympic task force is 
                        coming down hard on this one.

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        Expelled every boxing official that 
                        year, even brought in 
                        Pricewaterhouse Coopers as a third 
                        party to run the new vetting 
                        process. Part of which includes me 
                        asking you that question. 

           Ray takes this in, silently goes back to his sheet. Danny 
           scribbles his name, slides it back. 

                                 DANNY
                        No conflicts. 

           Ray reaches the bottom of the page, looks up at Kurt. He sets 
           it back on the desk, and signs.

                                 RAY
                        No conflicts. 

           INT. PUB - LATER

           Two drinks getting low on the table. Spasms of laughter. 

                                 DANNY
                        Wait what event was this?

                                 RAY
                        Painting.

                                 DANNY
                        Bullshit. 

                                 RAY
                        Until 1948. Painting was a 
                        sanctioned, medaled Olympic event. 
                        Along with literature, sculpture, 
                        architecture, town planning... 

                                 DANNY
                        How about lawn mowing?

           Laughs again as a waitress drops a fresh round of drinks. 

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        You ever been? To the games. Just 
                        to see it?

                                 RAY
                        Nah. 
                             (staring at his drink)
                        I wanted to be the guy that got to 
                        be down there. You know, walk that 
                        lap around the track.

                        Look up and realize, no matter 
                        where it’s being held, that night, 
                        you’re in the center of the world.  

           Danny leans back, likes the sound of it. 

                                 DANNY
                        How’d the guy that replaced you do?

                                 RAY
                        Lost to a Croatian, first round.

           Danny winces. Ray smiles, Ray grabs his drink. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        So Vegas huh. Enjoying it? 

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, been about a year now. 
                        Actions good. You and Connie are 
                        what, up in Reno? Hell of a commute 
                        on a fight night. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah well, it suites us.

                                 DANNY
                        We’ll have to bring you back down, 
                        have you over for dinner. 

           Ray nods. Then --

                                 RAY
                        Think we have a chance at getting 
                        this thing? 

                                 DANNY
                        I think one of us does. 
                             (a knowing grin)
                        Didn’t expect the tribunal though. 
                        Conflict paperwork bullshit, what 
                        happened to handshakes?  

           Silence. Finally -

                                 RAY
                        I knew someone on yours. 

                                 DANNY
                        ...Yeah?

                                 RAY
                        Cameron Mills. 
           Danny stares back. 

                                 DANNY
                        Shit Ray... everybody knows Cameron 
                        Mills. Golden Gloves, PAC 
                        Challenge. You run his fights 
                        before? He owe you money? He sleep 
                        with your sister? 

           Ray smiles, shakes no. 

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Then forget it. Just cause you 
                        heard of a guy doesn’t mean you 
                        gotta take yourself out. He’s not 
                        even on your card. 
                             (then)
                        You know, I heard him and a few 
                        other guys have a prelim next week, 
                        charity exhibition in Carson. I was 
                        thinking of going. Why don’t you 
                        come with, check it out.  

           Ray considers it, sets his drink aside.  

                                 RAY
                        Next time. 
                             (off his look)
                        Like you said. Hell of a commute. 

           EXT. GARAGE, RAY'S HOME - NIGHT

           Connie perches over a saddle, working the leather with a 
           brush. A row of stables outside behind her. A doorbell rings 
           inside the house. Connie rises, grabs a rag.

           EXT. RAY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Opening the front door to find Graham Yates on the steps, a 
           shit-eating grin between a plant and a bottle with a card. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Desert Hibiscus and some overpriced 
                        gin. A little salutations for you 
                        and Ray.

                                 CONNIE
                        Awww well thank you Graham.

           They embrace and she takes the gifts, juggling them...

                                 CONNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...Ray’s actually out of town...
                                 GRAHAM
                        Well then I’ll let you pick which 
                        one he gets. 
                             (another grin, then)
                        Oh and uh, if I could drop this off-

           He unearths a bundle of papers, “TRANSCRIPT COPY” stamped 
           across the top sheet. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        ...Unless you speak legalese?

                                 CONNIE
                        I do. But not at eight o’clock on a 
                        Sunday. And I charge 300 an hour. 
                             (then)
                        But I can leave it on his desk for 
                        you.

                                 GRAHAM
                        That’d be swell.

           She smiles back, holds up the bottle. 

                                 CONNIE
                        You wanna come in?

           But Graham is already drifting back down the stairs. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Oh... no. Gotta get back. Cats 
                        would worry.
                             (starting down the path)
                        Water that hibiscus!

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           An abandoned intersection. Ray’s car waiting for the light. 
           The only one there. 

           INSIDE

           Ray staring forward. His eyes drift up, settle on the street 
           signs. After a moment he flips his blinker on, goes right. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Ray stands next to the car. It’s cold but he doesn’t care. 
           His emergencies blinking silently at.... 

           The empty shoulder of the road ahead, gravel falling off into  
           darkness. Ray walks over, looks down into the ditch below... 

           Nothing but prarie grass and patches of the last snowfall. 
           PRELAP:
                                 CONNIE (OVER PHONE)
                        Does it look any different?

           EXT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Behind Ray as he sits on the bed, phone to his ear, hints of 
           scar tissue beneath his undershirt.

                                 RAY
                        Like nothing happened. 

                                 CONNIE (OVER PHONE)
                        Good.
                             (Ray pauses at this)
                        Cause a lot of good has happened 
                        since. You know that right. 

                                 RAY
                        I know. 

           Ray stares off. Some shuffling on the other end. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh, Graham Yates brought some 
                        transcript papers over. I left them  
                        on your desk. Brought some flowers 
                        with it. Little card too, man’s a 
                        sweetheart isn’t he. 

           Ray’s eyes roll. He eases himself back on the bed. 

                                 CONNIE (CONT'D)
                        When’s your flight get in? 

                                 RAY
                        I’ll have to check. 

                                 CONNIE
                        I’ll pick you up. You’ve had lots 
                        of calls. Interviews and things. 
                        Sounds like word’s spread a bit. 

                                 RAY
                        From who. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Nevada Bar Association. Ring 
                        Magazine. Reno Star wants to take 
                        your picture. 

                                 RAY
                        I don’t want my picture taken.
                                 CONNIE
                        Well I want your picture taken. 

           Ray grunts. Connie, earnest now.

                                 CONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Hon. This is a good thing remember. 
                        You earned this. Try to enjoy it. 

           SERIES

           INT. RENO BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           The metal chairs now packed to the brim. Ray climbs into the 
           ring, takes in the larger crowd. 

                                 RAY
                        Okay. Let’s get started. 

           EXT. RAY’S HOME, FIELD - DAY

           Ray sits on a horse, looking stiff. 

           On the ground a PHOTOGRAPHER repositions an assistant with a 
           bounce-board, Connie proudly standing by. The photographer 
           takes a few more shots, looks up.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Go ahead and smile a little.

           Ray squints some. The Photographer sees it through the lens.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
                        Little more.

           Ray awkwardly curls his lip. 

           INT. RENO BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           The two student boxers now pummeling each other. Ray guiding 
           a student ref, prowling behind them.  

           INT. EXAM HALL - DAY

           Catching GLIMPSES of an exam:

           “ring regulation dimensions” “Bandages applied in presence 
           of“ “offending boxer’s infringement” ”the neutral corner”

           Ray seated with twenty others, silently taking a proficiency 
           exam. Someone walking the aisles behind them, proctoring.
           INT. VACANT BUILDING - DAY

           Open and gutted. Enough for a gym. Ray tours the space with a 
           Contractor while a Building Owner points along the foundation

           INT. HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Walking along, smiles and shakes from bailiffs and staff 
           attorneys as he heads toward his chambers. 

           END SERIES

           INT. OUTER CHAMBERS - DAY

           Ray enters. Lyle rises. 

                                 LYLE
                        Welcome back sir. 
                             (Ray waves him back down)
                        Left your mail by your door. Need 
                        your signature on the top form 
                        there. 

           Ray walks over, sees the ‘form’ is an issue of The Reno Star, 
           Ray’s photo on the cover. Ray rolls his eyes, finds Lyle 
           hiding a smirk.  

                                 LYLE (CONT'D)
                        There’s a student from the U of N 
                        Law Review waiting outside chambers- 
                        I told him we’d make him an 
                        appointment but he said he’d wait.

                                 RAY
                        U of N. Alma mater, Go Wolves... 

           Ray continues to sort his mail, comes across a pre-opened 
           manilla envelope. He lifts it, staring at something inside.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        What’s this? 

           Lyle glances up.

                                 LYLE
                        Oh yeah some guy dropped that while 
                        you were out. Told him your mail 
                        needs to be screened and he took it 
                        downstairs, but I got his name here 
                        somewhere...
                             (searching his desk)
                        Ah, yeah. Cameron Mills. 
           Ray, motionless.

                                 RAY
                        He say what he wanted? 

                                 LYLE
                        No sir. Why, you know him?

           Ray looks back inside the envelope, finally tosses it aside. 

                                 RAY
                        Anything else?

           Lyle shakes his head. Ray starts for his office... halts in 
           the doorway. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Would you pull the latest parole 
                        hearing for that name, Cameron 
                        Mills. I wanna know who the DA was 
                        that approved that deal.

                                 LYLE
                        Yes sir.

                                 RAY
                        And the law kid outside. Go ahead 
                        and send him in. 

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ray sifting through stacks accumulated on his desk. A 
           manicured young man appears behind him, knocks on the door 
           frame. Overdressed, a U of N bag on his shoulder. 

           This is HAMPTON.

                                 HAMPTON
                        Thank you for seeing me your honor. 
                        Hampton Fischer. 

           Ray clears a stack of motions off a chair for him, takes a 
           seat himself. 

                                 RAY
                        So, law review huh? Good for you. 
                        Most extracurricular I got was 
                        dating a girl in the law school 
                        acapella group. “Habeas Chorus.” 

                                 HAMPTON
                             (smiling politely, then)
                        I’m not actually on law review sir. 
                                 RAY
                        ...So what is this. Looking for a 
                        clerkship? Externship? 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Not exactly. 
                             (and then)
                        I work in Vegas.

           Ray stares, quietly sits back. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to speak with you about 
                        your other line of work. I facilita- 

                                 RAY
                        I know what you are. 

           A weight in the air now. Hampton tries again.

                                 HAMPTON
                        The industry has grown beyond wins 
                        and odds. Round by round datum. 
                        Holding calls in the 4th. Headbutts 
                        in the 8th. Your unique position-

                                 RAY
                        And you’re a fucking stupid one at 
                        that. 
                             (Hampton goes quiet)
                        Do you know how many bribes, in how 
                        many countries I’ve been offered? 
                        You ever hear of me taking one? 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Which is why you make an ideal-

                                 RAY
                        Shit boy, the Japanese at least 
                        have the decency to bring some saki 
                        along with their offers. And maybe 
                        you didn’t hear but I’m about to 
                        retire. There’s nothing left to fix 
                        you dumb shit. Next time do your 
                        homework- 

                                 HAMPTON
                        You filed a trademark for an 
                        intramural boxing gym late last 
                        year, and a construction permit for 
                        a Washoe county building renovation 
                        in August. 

           Silence. He has Ray’s attention now.
                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        I don’t mean to offend, and I don’t 
                        mean to waste your time. But if 
                        you’ll hear me out I’d like the 
                        opportunity to discuss how we can 
                        secure your retirement, forego your 
                        loans... and with all due respect, 
                        there is one thing left to fix.  
                             (direct now)
                        If you’ll hear me out. 

           Ray stares at him for the longest time. Then, calmly... 

                                 RAY
                        Go close the door. 

           INT. OUTER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Lyle typing at his desk as the door clicks shut across the 
           room. Silence. Then a muffled thump from behind the door, 
           something hitting the floor. Lyle looks over. Quiet inside.

           The door pulls open and Hampton emerges, hand cupping his 
           nose, a smear of blood on his cheek. He walks silently 
           through the outer room, disappearing into the hallway.

           Ray appears in the doorway, eating an apple. 

                                 RAY
                        What are we thinking for lunch? 

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           An empty rib container on the desk. Ray working late.

           He rises, heads toward a wet bar in the corner, eyes drifting 
           to the outer room as he pours... 

           The opened manilla envelope on the table.

           Ray takes a drink, staring at it. 

           INT. RENO COURTROOM - NIGHT

           Lights out and empty. The sound of metal rolling back and 
           forth on wood, echoing across the room. 

           WITH RAY

           Sitting at the bench. The envelope discarded beside him. 
           We see he’s brought his drink with him, sipping as he idly 
           spins what we now see is a metal belt buckle on the desk. 

           As it comes to rest we see its face: the sculpted relief of a 
           pair of boxing gloves. It’s crude, amateur. 

           And on the back: Four letters stamped into the brass. 

                                         H.D.S.P.

           INT. OUTER CHAMBERS - DAY (THE PAST)

           That same buckle, face down, initials up.  

           Daytime now. We’re in Ray’s outer office, his old clerk 
           Melissa sorting mail at her desk. 

           Ray’s bailiff Odell perches on the corner, eating his lunch 
           as they stare down at the buckle.

                                 MELISSA
                        H.D.S.P?

                                 ODELL 
                        High Desert State Prison. 

           Ray in his office, studying a flyer in his hand. Odell lifts 
           the buckle, inspecting the engraving. 

                                 ODELL (CONT'D)
                        Got a secret admirer in the metal 
                        shop?

                                 RAY
                        Something like that.

           Ray holds up the flyer. A black and white fight poster 
           “UNIFIED PRISON SYSTEMS LEAGUE” across the top. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Prison match. I’ve been cordially 
                        invited, week after next.

                                 ODELL
                        Nobodies gonna be dragging their 
                        ass all the way to Clark County.
                             (back to his sandwich)
                        You know, I saw a baseball game at 
                        San Quentin once. Dude got stomped 
                        stealing second, Muslims said foul. 
                        Umpire got the fuck out of there... 

           But Ray doesn’t hear him, reading a note scrawled on the back 
           of the flyer. Finally he lowers it.
                                 RAY
                        Wanna be my date?

           EXT. HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON, NEVADA - DAY (THE PAST)

           Barbed wire and white concrete baking in the desert sun.

           INT. RECEPTION, HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON - DAY (THE PAST)

           Spectators removing personal items. Keys, watches, belts. 
           Surrendering as others are buzzed through a turn style gate.

           EXT. YARD, HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON - (THE PAST)

           Converted to an outdoor arena with a ring in the middle.

           Corrections officers lining the apron. Inmates hanging on the 
           fence in a caged set of bleachers, riot gear on hand in the 
           wings. A sense of anarchy about to break. And in the center: 

           Two inmate fighters trading blows, a hulking guard pulling 
           ref duty around them.  

           Ray and Odell sit with the rest of the public, tracking the 
           bout while waiting for the next match. 

                                 ODELL
                        What’s this guy fight at?

                                 RAY
                        Welterweight.

                                 ODELL
                        Wasn’t that yours?

                                 RAY
                        It’s a weight class Odell not a 
                        Chevy. I don’t own the thing. 

           Just then a fighter goes down in the ring, crowd rising, ref 
           sending his opponent to the corner as he starts the count.

                                 ODELL
                        And this the guy that jumped you?

                                 RAY
                        No thanks to you. 
                                 ODELL
                        Hey you’re still here aren’t you? 
                        Unfortunately people have the 
                        tendency to just not like you. At 
                        least this one’s trying to make 
                        amends.

           Ray glances at him, then digs into his pocket, hands him the 
           flyer invitation we saw earlier. 

                                 RAY
                        Wrote a note on the back. 

                                 ODELL
                             (reading aloud)
                        “..Sublimem posuisti ut te ipsum..”
                             (lowering it)
                        What is that, Italian?

                                 RAY
                        Latin. For go fuck yourself. Wanted 
                        to get it past the mail check.
                             (and then)
                        Think he pissed on it too. 

           Odell makes a face, sets it aside. In the ring the corner men 
           wave over their fighter. He’s done. 

                                 ODELL
                        So then why the hell did we come?

                                 RAY
                        Thought it might be nice to see the 
                        shit kicked out of him.

           YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The ring has been reset. An announcer coming through the PA 
           system as two new fighters are released into the yard.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER PA)
                        Hopkins, Andre. Folsom. 
                             (then)
                        Mills, Cameron. Nevada. 

           Ray watching as CAMERON emerges. He’s older now, 20, the 
           skinny kid in court now showing early tattoos on muscle. He 
           walks in with an inmate in a Muslim skull cap, the man with 
           him in the stands at Ray’s opening fight. This is KUFI. 

           They lean in the corner, strapping on his headgear as they 
           confer with his trainer, an OLDER INMATE, brawny and bearded.
                                 RAY
                        Goddamn. That’s Bernard Scott.

                                 ODELL
                        Colleague of yours?

                                 RAY
                        Never met him. He was the IBF 
                        Middleweight champ for three years 
                        before he went in. Thought he was 
                        in Angola. 

           As the ref waves them to the center...

                                 ODELL
                        What’d your guy do again?

                                 RAY
                        Drove his car through two kids.

           Odell, going still at this. Ray leans forward. The bell rings-  

           Andre is the bigger fighter here, steering Cameron around the 
           ring. A few exchanges, Cameron batted away each time. Finally 
           Andre lands a temple blow just as the round ends. The crowd 
           yelling, Cameron staggering hard. 

           Odell cheers, smacks Ray’s shoulder. Ray just watches. 

           Cameron, still reeling as the next round begins. More of the 
           same, Andre looming, Cameron retreating...

                                 ODELL
                        Should have put some money dow-

           Suddenly Cameron plants and snaps, a blind pop under the chin 
           that sends Andre stumbling back. But Cameron stays with him, 
           step for step, a metronome pounding away.

           A mouthguard goes flying. Cameron doesn’t stop. Andre’s nose 
           breaks. Cameron doesn’t stop. 

           The crowd rising. Ray on his feet, the world shifting. 

           A flap of headgear is knocked loose. The ref moving in now 
           but Cameron’s merciless, gloves chipping away, again, again-

           The headgear goes flying off in a spray of sweat and blood. 
           Guards flooding the ring now, dragging Cameron back as Andre 
           collapses, penitentiary physicians sliding in.

           The inmates shaking the fence now. Roaring through the chain 
           link as Cameron is pinned to the corner, roaring back. 
           Suddenly his eyes start to roam, the faces, the bleachers...

           They lock on Ray. 

           Ray frozen as a glove rises, pointing straight at him. Split 
           lips curling back into a grin of teeth and blood. 

           INT. OUTER CHAMBERS - MORNING (THE PRESENT)

           Lyle comes from down the hall, arriving for the day. He sees 
           Ray’s door open. 

                                 LYLE
                        Good morning your honor.

                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        Good morning.

           Lyle sets his bag down, slows. A form sitting on his desk. He 
           lifts it, reading...

                                 LYLE
                        A restraining order?

                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        File that for me would you? Make 
                        sure a copy is on file with 
                        courthouse security, in case he 
                        tries coming back in.

                                 LYLE
                        Yes sir. 

           Lyle adds it to his pile, starts settling in. 

                                 LYLE (CONT'D)
                        Oh DA’s office sent over that 
                        release record you asked for. Looks 
                        like Don Farber’s case.

           Ray emerges from the office, reaching for the file. 

                                 RAY
                        Farber? I thought this was Jim 
                        Hawkin’s trial. 

                                 LYLE
                        Must have inherited it when 
                        Hawkin’s left for senate. 
                                 RAY
                             (flipping through)
                        ...still, shouldn’t have been 
                        eligible again for another five 
                        years...

                                 LYLE
                        He wasn’t. It wasn’t parole. DA 
                        approved a petition for early 
                        release. 

           On Ray.

           INT. WASHOE DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Donald E. Farber writes at his desk. Bookish. Innocent. 
           Perking up as Ray lets himself in. 

                                 FARBER
                        Well hello Judge. Hey I heard you 
                        just got nominated for some big-

           Papers exploding in his face as Ray throws the file at him. 

                                 RAY
                        What the horse shit kind of deal is 
                        that! 

                                 FARBER
                        Now h-hold on a minute what’re you- 
                             (collecting one of the 
                              pages)
                        The Mills case? Hell this was three 
                        years ago...

                                 RAY
                        Jim Hawkins would have never signed 
                        off on that. You just undid half a 
                        decade of appellate hearings- 

                                 FARBER
                        Well quite frankly I’m surprised 
                        the charges weren’t vacated 
                        altogether. Honestly I was just 
                        trying my best to protect the 
                        county from getting sued. 

                                 RAY
                        What the hell does mean? 

           Farber, aware of the authority. Lowering his voice.
                                 FARBER
                        Listen I think Jim’s a good lawyer. 
                        I respect him. I respect the court. 
                             (leaning in)
                        But you tried him as an adult. You 
                        threw out his plea deal. You gave 
                        him the maximum sentence... if 
                        someone had looked closer into this-

                            RAY
                                                         FARBER (CONT'D)
                                              You squashed his parole. A 
                                              defendent may not be 
                                              disqualified as a youth based 
                                              on their controlling offense - 
                                              People vs Edwards-
           He did not qualify as a 
           youthful offender. The plea 
           negotiations were done 
           without court consent. 
           Sentencing under NRS penal 
           code 484B-

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                             (voice rising above)
                        He killed someone Don. 
                             (then)
                        An eighteen year old girl. Ripped 
                        the arm off her brother. Their 
                        futures. Were the rest of their 
                        lives worth 1500 days of his?

           Silence. Then, evenly...

                                 FARBER
                        Judge what I’ve read, incarceration 
                        conduct, probation reports... it 
                        all indicates Mills has made every 
                        effort at rehabilitation.
                             (then)
                        I don’t think he’s the same man you 
                        remember.

           Ray, holding his stare. He turns for the door. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Court is in session. An attorney, JOHANSSON speaking. 

                                 JOHANSSON
                        ...if you recall it was the People 
                        who moved in limine to exclude the 
                        indemnification litigation...

           ANGLE - UNDER THE DESK

           As she continues: the belt buckle being turned over and over. 

           Ray sitting on the bench, staring off, mind running.
           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Lyle trailing Ray inside.

                                 LYLE
                        I’ll pull those limile motions for 
                        decision. Do you want...

           Surprised to find Ray, his robe already off. He slides the 
           gun harness from his shoulders, removes the pistol. 

                                 RAY
                        Call my wife. Tell her I’m in  
                        mediation tonight. It’s going to be 
                        late.

           Ray leans over, locks the gun away in a safe. When he rises 
           he sees Lyle stalling, uncomfortable.  

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Just tell her Lyle. 

           Walking past him on the way out. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

           Sunset and gravel. Ray’s car as it drives past a sign:

                                       CARSON CITY

           EXT. CARSON PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Limos and valet in line out front. Ray climbs the steps 
           through arriving guests toward the plaza doors. 

           INT. HALLWAY, CARSON PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Tuxedo’d bodies and dresses drifting into a ballroom. A sign 
           beside the doors reads: RINGSIDE FOR ST. NICHOLAS RESEARCH 
           FOUNDATION

           Ray approaches the sign-in table. An ATTENDANT looking up.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Name? 

                                 RAY
                        Raymond Tennyson. I’m not on the 
                        list. 
                                 ATTENDANT
                        Oh I’m sorry, this is a private 
                        event for the St. Nicholas Hosp- 

                                 RAY
                        Listen, I just came from court... 
                             (reaching for his wallet)
                        I’m a judge with the second 
                        district. Some colleagues invited-

                                 ATTENDANT
                        It’s black tie only with reserved 
                        seating. And RSVPs were two-hundred 
                        a plate...

           Ray starts counting out money, sets it on the table.

                                 RAY
                        That’s five. And I don’t need a 
                        plate.

           INT. BALLROOM, CARSON PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Stepping into an ornate ballroom where a BOXING MATCH is 
           taking place as a medical fundraiser. Couples mingling at 
           dining tables around the ring. 

           Ray standing out amid the formal elegance. He’s handed a 
           champagne flute, promptly sets it on another waiter’s passing 
           tray as he moves closer...

           High dollar donors congregating near the ropes, watching the 
           fight. Amongst them: a young man, a bandage across the bridge 
           of his nose. It’s Hampton. He whispers to a large Native 
           American man in a suit beside him. We’ll call him WYATT. 

           Ray halts. Hampton doesn’t notice him, eyes on the fight. 

           Suddenly the bell sounds. Opera claps and colored paddles 
           going up around the room. Everyone here is a “judge” tonight. 

           The two fighters bow politely as the referee hands a 
           BENEFACTOR the mic. He examines the audience.

                                 BENEFACTOR
                        Looks like Red has it. Saw some 
                        Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
                        surgeries in the making there... 

           Soft laughter as the fighters escort themselves off.
                                 BENEFACTOR (CONT'D)
                        Next up we have our welterweight 
                        fight but first, let’s keep those 
                        donations coming. Show your support 
                        out front, at the bar, don’t forget 
                        the auctions. So far we’ve raised.. 

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Ray.

           Ray turns. Danny threading his way over.

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Braved the commute huh? 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah well, good cause.

                                 DANNY
                        Absolutely. C’mon...
                             (lifts his empty glass)
                        Go make some contributions.

           Ray clocks Hampton again, follows Danny back. 

           INT. HALLWAYS, CARSON PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           The attendant smiling as someone steps up to the table. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Name?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Graham Yates. Should be under The 
                        Vegas Sun. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        ...Yes it is, and here you go.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Thanks. Any booze left?

           A wink as he plucks up his name tag and heads inside.

           INT. BALLROOM, CARSON PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

           As the bartender delivers two drinks. 

                                 DANNY
                        Still gotta have you over for 
                        dinner. How’s Sunday?
                                 RAY
                        ...Sunday...sure. 

           Ray distracted, facing the now empty ring. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        How’s the action been?

                                 DANNY
                        For an exhibition? 
                             (shrugs)
                        Fights only three rounds but, 
                        invite the press, make some money. 
                        White people get to think they saw 
                        boxing. But the guys will break a 
                        sweat, give ‘em a show.

           Suddenly applause as two fighters enter the room: HIROSHI, a 
           buzz cut asian fighter. And behind him: Cameron. 

           Ray watches as Cameron climbs into the ring. Matured now, old 
           scars on new muscles. Tattoos in Arabic across his skin. Too 
           focused to take in the crowd as he heads for the center -

                                 RAY
                        Who’s training him?

                                 DANNY
                        Mills? Dunno. Think he’s working 
                        out of Rhodes Gym in Henderson. 
                             (and then)
                        So who you got?

           Ray shoots him a look. Danny shrugs. 

                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        C’mon, make it interesting. Twenty 
                        on Mills. 

                                 RAY
                        Bet cash on cards and horses. Never 
                        boxing. 

                                 DANNY
                        Fair enough...
                             (beat)
                        Drinks then. 

           Ray doesn’t answer, just turns away toward ring. Then:

                                 RAY
                        ...Two gins on Hiroshi.

           Danny grins. As the fighters step up...
                                 DANNY
                        You know my guy was in prison?

                                 RAY
                        ...that so. 

           The bell rings. 

           PRESS TABLE

           The fight underway in the background. Graham knocking back 
           his champagne as he arrives at the press table, a few 
           journalists jeering as he pulls up a chair. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Nice of you to show Yates. Only 
                        missed the first two fights. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Well that’s dandy, cause I only owe 
                        five hundred words of copy. 
                             (to a passing waiter)
                        Pour me one more if you would?

           INTERCUTTING WITH

           Ray and the fight. It’s slow, neither fighter risking injury 
           here, throwing punches for the crowd.

           Suddenly Cameron takes a headbutt to the mouth, blood 
           running. It’s an illegal move but the crowd doesn’t know 
           that, cheering as the referee separates them. 

           Cameron just walks away, staying in his corner, obedient. 

                                 DANNY
                        Well he took that well.

           Ray studies Cameron, head lowered as he waits, lips moving 
           silently in what looks like prayer.

                                 RAY
                        ...he did.

           He looks out as the ref waves him back in, releasing them. 

                                 DANNY
                        Olympic committee confirmed my 
                        technical team yesterday. How you 
                        feeling about Dallas? 
                                 RAY
                             (glued to the fight)
                        Fine. 

                                 DANNY
                        Colorado’s creeping up on me. I 
                        don’t know, got me nervous.

                                 RAY
                        Nervous?

           In the ring the two men collide, locking up. The ref hovering-

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, I mean you’re on the roster 
                        Ray. Me, I’m not getting those HBO 
                        calls. But getting this... that’s 
                        big leagues. That’s business. I 
                        just didn’t realize there’d be all 
                        this background check shit, you 
                        know? Find some reason to cut us.

           Ray turns from the fight. 

                                 RAY
                        Like what? 

                                 DANNY
                        My wife’s residency papers, fucking 
                        parking tickets I don’t know what 
                        these Pricewaterhouse guys look at. 
                        You’re not worried at all? 

           On Ray. Suddenly a SLAM. A rise from the crowd. 

           The ref is COLLAPSED ON THE CANVAS beneath Cameron, Cameron’s 
           gloves pulling away as he backs to the corner. The benefactor 
           scrambles in to the ref’s side, checking him. 

           Out cold.

           Graham with the press table, paying attention now. He looks 
           down. A bloody tooth on the mat in front of him. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Goddamn.

           At the bar Danny and Ray stand to see above the rest. Ray 
           spots Hampton through the crowd, in his seat, on his phone.  

           Ray’s gaze then drifts across the room, over to the ring... 

           Cameron at the ropes, staring right back at him. 
           Ray numbed as he smiles through his bloody mouthpiece, 
           hauntingly familiar to the prison match as his glove rises in 
           salute to the man at the bar. And ACROSS THE RING... 

           Graham sees it.

           PRELAP:

                                 ODELL (V.O.)
                        Bad blood? Nah.

           EXT. RENO COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Graham sits across from Odell, listening as Odell eats his 
           lunch on a courthouse bench.

                                 ODELL
                        If there’s bad blood it ain’t 
                        coming from Judge T.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You don’t think there might be a 
                        reason he’d remember the guy? Keep 
                        tabs on him?

                                 ODELL
                        Like what? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        I don’t know, kid says the wrong 
                        thing at trial, offends his mother. 

                                 ODELL
                        Pretty sure Judge T. doesn’t have a 
                        mother. Besides, you know how often 
                        judges get cursed out, spit on... 
                        I’ve seen people take shits on the 
                        courtroom floor, and he still gave 
                        ‘em probation. Guy’s the patron 
                        saint of leniency. 
                             (another bite)
                        If anything, it’s the other way 
                        around. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        What’s that mean?

                                 ODELL
                        Inmates. Trial doesn’t go their 
                        way, it’s never their fault, or the 
                        jury’s fault. Nah, sustained this, 
                        overruled that - Judge fucked me 
                        over. Gonna keep reminding him too. 
           Odell looks over from his lunch, sees Graham’s confusion.

                                 ODELL (CONT'D)
                        You know how many death threats 
                        these guys get? It’s why they gotta 
                        screen their mail, get their own 
                        elevator. Why do you think one in 
                        four judges carry a gun? 
                             (another bite)
                        If it were me, I’d be worried the 
                        guy was coming to fuck with me. 

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           Ray at his desk. A half-written motion decision typed on his 
           screen, but Ray’s not reading, instead staring out his window- 

           A grey afternoon, the wind hinting of a storm. 

           Just then the phone in the outer office begins to ring. Ray 
           peers over: Lyle missing from his desk. He rises and answers.

                                 RAY (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah.

                                 VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Judge Tennyson?

                                 RAY
                        Yes? 

           The line goes silent a moment. Ray listening closer. Then: 

                                 VOICE  (OVER PHONE)
                        Lieutenant Gordon in the security 
                        office. We have a restraining order 
                        on file for a Cameron Mills, is 
                        that correct? 

                                 RAY
                        It is. Is there a problem? 

                                 VOICE/GORDON (OVER PHONE)
                        He attempted to enter the building 
                        a few moments ago your honor. But 
                        he was identified immediately, and 
                        is currently being escorted out to 
                        his vehicle now. 

                                 RAY
                             (beat)
                        I understand. Any trouble?
                                 GORDON (OVER PHONE)
                        No sir. Just wanted to keep you 
                        informed. 

                                 RAY
                        Thank you officer.

           Ray goes to the window. Outside:

           PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Two security officers supervising as Cameron climbs into the 
           passenger side of a red SUV. KUFI in the driver’s seat.

                                 VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        If you’d like we can send notice to 
                        the marshal’s service, have them 
                        send a car over. 

           The officers wait there, making sure the SUV exits the gate. 

                                 RAY
                        ...that won’t be necessary.  

           Ray hangs up, returns to the window, watching the SUV as it 
           pulls out of the lot, and disappears down the street. 

           EXT. STABLES, RAY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Connie at the side of a brown and white mare, cradling its 
           front leg as she works it’s hoof clean with a metal pick.

           Ray comes around the wall, leans on the fence. 

                                 RAY
                        How’s the leg?

                                 CONNIE
                        Well you were right, it’s a stone 
                        bruise. Hoof wall looks a little 
                        tender but I think it’s thrush... 

           She looks up, sees Ray idly picking at some straw, mind 
           elsewhere. She moves on to the next leg.

                                 CONNIE (CONT'D)
                        So you going to tell me what’s been 
                        eating you? Or you want me to keep 
                        pretending this is one of those 
                        seasonal brooding phases. 
                                 RAY
                        ...there’s a case. Tough one. Been 
                        dragging on a while. 

                                 CONNIE
                        You wanna talk it over?

                                 RAY
                             (staring off, then)
                        Nah, should be about settled now.

           Ray discards the straw. Connie not convinced but letting it 
           go, moves around the horse.

                                 CONNIE
                        Well in that case, grab a leg. 

                                 RAY
                        ...Rather grab your leg. 

           Connie looks up, finds Ray grinning at her. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Well then get your old ass over 
                        that fence and come and get it. 

           Ray amused, considers it.

                                 RAY
                        Nah. Might pull something. Think 
                        I’ll go inside, ice my back.

           He starts strolling back to the house. She smiles, unreins 
           the horse. A roll of thunder as she follows him inside. 

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           A storm rolling through. Trees swaying hard across the plain. 

           EXT. RAY'S HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Rays steps out. The morning air is cold, his breath steaming 
           as he sets his watch for a run.

           Suddenly YELLING from the road. A car honking, the bestial 
           cry of an animal screaming in the distance. 
           EXT. ROAD, RAY’S HOME - EARLY MORNING

           A horse, eyes wild and panicked, bucking in the air between 
           two cars parked across the road, their drivers circling -- 
           attempting to keep it from bolting.

                                 DRIVER 1
                        Whoah... whoa...

                                 DRIVER 2
                        Watch it. Watch the kick --

           Ray arrives, jumps back just as a hoof cuts the air. He yells 
           to one of the drivers --

                                 RAY 
                        Flash your lights, your brights. Go- 

           The driver runs to his cab, hits the high beams. The horse 
           suddenly stalls, a thousand pound deer in headlights. In that 
           instant Ray dives for the reins, reels them tight.

           The horse pulls but Ray holds it close, settling as it 
           recognizes Ray’s scent. 

                                 DRIVER 1
                        She yours?

                                 RAY
                             (catching his breath)
                        Yeah... yeah she’s one of ours. 

                                 DRIVER 1
                        Better check your fences. 

           Ray looks out: His horses free from their pasture, scattered 
           across the desert prairie. 

                                 DRIVER 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Storm must of knocked something. 

           Ray looks back toward the house, Connie now on the steps. A 
           look on her face. 

           EXT. FIELD, RAY’S HOME - LATER

           From afar as Connie rides out to collect another horse, 
           grazing in the distance. 

           FENCE LINE

           Strands of barbed wire bobbing in the wind. A break in the 
           fence where the horses got through. 
           RAY on his own horse, approaching in the background. 

           He dismounts, walks over to examine the break. A post on its 
           side. He kneels beside the wire, inspects the ends. Unclear 
           if they’ve been cut or just worn.

           Ray goes to the horse, unloads some tools, looking out as he 
           pulls on his gloves:

           Nothing but insects and the wind. But somehow eerie. Like 
           someone’s out there, looking back. 

           EXT. STABLES, RAY'S HOME - DAY

           Connie rides in from the field, finds Ray hovering over a 
           work bench, knotting a thread of wire.  

                                 CONNIE
                        Checked the south creek, rode near 
                        all the way to 67. No sign of her. 

                                 RAY
                        I’ll call the Merritts. And the 
                        McCrays. Have them keep an eye out. 
                        She’ll show up. 

           Ray goes back to work. Connie’s eyes drift to the stall the 
           mare was in yesterday, now siting empty. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Was this the storm? 

           Ray turns, looks up at her on the horse. A deeper question in 
           her voice. He smiles softly. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah. Just the storm.

           She relaxes a little, leads the horse off down the row.

           Ray watches until she’s gone, then turns back to the bench, 
           pulls back a cloth: 

           He’s got a lever action .223 rifle laid out on the bench, 
           chamber open, a scope laid out beside it. He resumes, setting 
           the mount over the barrel. He locks it in place.

           EXT. PEÑA CONDO - NIGHT

           The door opening. Ray and Connie smiling on the front steps, 
           a bottle of wine in Ray’s hand. 
           Danny answering with his wife, LUNA. Music on in the 
           background, welcoming them inside. 

           INT. DINING ROOM, PEÑA CONDO - NIGHT

           The plates cleared and alcohol low. We see now Luna is 
           pregnant, the two couples laughing around the table. 

                                 CONNIE
                        ...first amateur match, so proud of 
                        him. I go to take his picture, 
                        accidentally leave the flash on. He 
                        had me ejected. 

           Wide eyes and laughter, Ray grumbling. 

                                 RAY
                        I had you reseated. 
                             (to the others)
                        It was a youth circuit. All the 
                        seats were fine.  

                                 LUNA
                        First time Danny introduced himself 
                        he told me he was a fighter. 
                        Middleweight from Tapito Mexico 
                        City. Next morning I’m getting 
                        dressed, I see his little bow 
                        tie... suddenly he’s a retired 
                        fighter. And he’s from Peoria.  

           More laughter, Danny shrugs bashfully.

                                 LUNA (CONT'D)
                        Ray you ever box? 

           Frozen smiles. Danny subtly shaking her off. Ray sees it. 

                                 RAY
                        It’s okay. 
                             (to Luna)
                        Used to. I was in an accident when 
                        I was nineteen. There’s a fissure 
                        in my 3rd and 4th vertebrae, left 
                        me open to something called 
                        musculoskeletal seizures. Wrong 
                        punch in the right spot... that 
                        pretty much took me out of it.  

           Luna listening. Connie grabbing his knee under the table. 
                                 DANNY
                        You know, when my cousin blew out 
                        his shoulder he couldn’t give it 
                        up. Stayed on as a trainer. You 
                        ever consider that? 

                                 RAY
                        Not really, no.
                             (then)
                        Never felt right, not being in the 
                        ring.

           Hanging in silence again. Ray leans forward, lifts the wine.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        C’mon, who can I get? 

           INT. PEÑA CONDO - LATER

           Luna and Connie talking in the kitchen in the bg. 

           INT. OFFICE, PEÑA CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           Ray follows Danny into his office, subtly pulls the door 
           closed behind them as Danny heads for the shelf.

                                 DANNY
                        Whiskey okay?

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, thanks.

           Danny pours into two coffee mugs, handing him one as he takes 
           a seat.

                                 DANNY
                        Sorry for the mug. Never move. Been 
                        over a year and we’re still 
                        unpacking.

           Ray smiles, stares down at his drink. A beat. 

                                 RAY
                        Danny I need to show you something. 

           Ray softly unearths a folded document, holds it out. Danny 
           takes it, not sure this isn’t some kind of a joke. 

                                 DANNY
                        What is this?
                                 RAY
                        It’s an injunction. To disqualify 
                        Cameron Mills from Olympic 
                        eligibility. 
                             (as Danny reads)
                        It’s all within the AIBA 
                        guidelines. 

                                 DANNY
                        Then why aren’t you filing it?

                                 RAY
                        ...Because eight years ago I sent 
                        Cameron Mills to a Nevada  
                        penitentiary for second degree 
                        murder. And now he’s following me.

           Danny looks up at this.  

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        I lied to you earlier. I’m sorry. 
                             (then)
                        I have been working for this for 
                        thirty years. And if 
                        Pricewaterhouse discovers I have a 
                        personal history with him now, well 
                        it’s like you said. This guy isn’t 
                        worth taking myself out. I have a 
                        conflict of interest. You don’t. 

                                 DANNY
                        ...No, but I’m about to. How’s that 
                        going to look Ray? I’m trying to DQ 
                        a fighter from my own match? Forget 
                        them finding a reason to cut me, 
                        I’d be handing it directly to them. 

                                 RAY
                        Judicially your report would be 
                        inadmissible for any dismissal, 
                        they shouldn’t even contact you-

                                 DANNY
                        Inadmiss- Ray this is boxing not 
                        court.

                            RAY
                                                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           He’s been threatening me 
           okay? Calling my home, 
           showing up at my office. He-
                                              If you’ve got a problem with 
                                              the guy call the cops. This 
                                              has nothing to do with me-

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        He is not worthy of this sport. 
           Ray, rattled now. Danny sees it. Finally --

                                 DANNY
                        Ray... I swear to you, I won’t say 
                        anything. But no. No. 

           They sit there, a silent stare ultimately broken by a knock 
           at the door. Luna peeks her head in. 

                                 LUNA
                        Honey, hey can you help with the 
                        espresso machine. The filter thing 
                        is overflowing again. 

                                 DANNY
                        ...yeah. I’m coming.

           Danny looks at Ray, saying nothing as he sets the injunction 
           aside and follows her out. 

           Ray, alone now. Ashamed. Angry. Staring off now...

           He rises, as if to rejoin them. Instead he steps quietly over 
           to Danny’s desk. On top:

           Papers, bills, check books. Ray casually sifts through the 
           them, finds one with Danny’s signature at the bottom. 

           Ray glances up toward the door. The others away in the 
           kitchen. 

           He lays the paper next to the injunction letter, eyeing the 
           signature. A quiet storm brewing inside... 

           Ray reaches for a pen. 

           INT. INCHEON STADIUM, SOUTH KOREA - (THE PAST)

           A darkened arena, foreign chanting, the ring harshly lit 
           behind us through the haze of a thousand cigarettes.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        ...Geuneun du beon-ui paebae, se

                        beon welteo eiteu chaempieon...

           Ray’s silhouette leans into frame, holds, then vomits into a 
           bucket.

           SUPER: INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA

           Wiping his mouth as he rises we see he’s slightly younger, 
           his uniform impeccable, probably ironed twice. 
           GRAHAM watching from his seat several rows back, snorting as 
           Ray checks himself over. He frowns at his bow tie, goes to 
           wipe it -- 

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) (CONT'D)

           Ray steels himself, ascends the stairs...

           But we stay on the floor as Ray begins his instructions, 
           floating toward a TIMEKEEPER at a table around the apron, her 
           hand gripping the brass hammer beside the bell. 

           The volume rising as the fighters position. She waits for her 
           signal, raises it -- 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. RENO COURTROOM - DAY (THE PAST)

           The gavel pounding. Ray back in court. Odell waiting as he 
           gathers his papers, dismounting from the bench.  

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY (THE PAST)

           Ray working at his desk. A knock on the wall. A tall man in 
           western business attire leaning in his door frame. This is 
           distract attorney JIM HAWKINS.   

                                 HAWKINS
                        Welcome back your honor. Konichiwa. 

                                 RAY
                        Wrong 3000 year old Asian empire. 

           Hawkins grins, wanders in.

                                 HAWKINS
                        How’s the backlog?

           Ray elbows his pile, keeps working.

                                 RAY
                        What’s up Mr. Hawkins?

                                 HAWKINS
                        Mills case is up for parole. Just 
                        got notice. 

           Ray looks up at this, sits back.
                                 RAY
                        You talk to the family? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I did. They were wondering if you 
                        had any intentions on a letter of 
                        recommendation. 

                                 RAY
                        For them? 

                                 HAWKINS
                        For him. 

           Ray doesn’t follow.

                                 HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                        I assumed not but, they’re asking 
                        as a courtesy while they prepare 
                        their statement for the parole 
                        board. Mills wrote to us hoping to 
                        make some restitution. Believe he 
                        sent you the same. Imagine it’s in 
                        there somewhere. 

           He nods at Ray’s pile. Ray glances at it a moment. 

                                 RAY
                        ...I’ll take a look. 

           He goes back to work. 

           INT. HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON, DORMITORY - NIGHT (THE PAST)

           Inmates echoing down the block. Cameron in his room, grunting 
           as he does hand-stand push ups against the wall. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Mills.

           A GUARD at his door. Cameron kicks off to the floor, rises. 

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Visitor.

           INT. HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON, VISITATION ROOM - (THE PAST)

           Glass partitions reflecting the fluorescents above. Cameron 
           is led into the room, now wearing a Muslim cap. He slows as 
           he’s seated, seeing who’s waiting on the other side. 

           It’s Ray. 
           He watches Cameron lift the phone from the receiver. Finally -

                                 RAY
                        Islam huh? Nice touch. Parole 
                        board’s gonna love that. 

           Cameron weathers it, goes to speak.

                                 CAMERON
                        I don’t know if you got it, but I 
                        wrote you a letter. I wanted to-

                                 RAY
                        I got it. 

           Ray slides the letter onto the metal counter. We see it’s 
           unopened. 

           He leans back, at ease. Then, matter-of-factly: 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You know, I was in an accident 
                        once. Never caught the guy but, 
                        from the way people saw him drive 
                        off they could tell, he’d had a 
                        night... Took something from me 
                        that day. And I’ve often asked 
                        myself what he’d need to say in 
                        order for me to forgive him... 
                        Never did come up with an answer. 

           Ray then motions to the letter. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You were looking for restitution. 
                        You know the kid you hit? Violin 
                        player. Started when he was six. 
                        All lined up to go to this 
                        conservatory out in Boston. I’ll 
                        make you a deal. You cut off your 
                        right arm too, I’ll write you a 
                        letter of recommendation. 

           Ray smiles at him. Then drops it, troubled. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Guess that doesn’t do much for the 
                        girl though does it... 

           Staring off, deep in thought. Finally he sits up.
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        So let’s make different deal. I 
                        don’t know what you think I did, 
                        but the state of Nevada entitles 
                        you to a fair and public hearing by 
                        an impartial tribunal to render a 
                        reasoned verdict. That’s what you 
                        got. So whatever you think it is I 
                        owe you, forget it. 
                             (direct now)
                        The letters stop, packages stop, 
                        the calls stop. You do that, and 
                        I’ll forget you exist and trust me, 
                        that’s to your advantage. That’s 
                        the best deal you’re going to get. 
                        Am I heard?

           Staring him down. Finally Cameron nods. Ray rises, slaps 
           something down on the counter. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You can have that back. 

           Ray hangs up the phone, walking out. Cameron’s eyes drift 
           down... the BELT BUCKLE, resting on the counter.  

           EXT. RANCH ROAD - DAYS LATER (THE PAST)

           Ray’s car cruising toward his house up the hill.

           I/E. RAY’S CAR - SAME

           Ray in a suit now, returning home from work. He looks out the 
           driver’s window:

           His wife, riding in the field the distance. He smiles.

           EXT. RAY’S HOME - DAY (THE PAST)

           Ray locks the car, starts for the house, sees: A package left 
           on his porch, sitting on the rocking chair. 

           INT. RAY’S HOME, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Looking over the package, now open on the bed. A note on top:

                       “Keep it off your shirt next time - Graham” 

           Ray lifts a small box out, removes the lid. A wry grin. 
           A referee’s black silk bow tie, resting on the felt.

           Ray takes off his work tie, stands in front of the mirror. 

           The house phone starts to ring. He lets it, threading the tie 
           through his collar. Suddenly a yell from downstairs:

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        I got it. 

                                 RAY
                             (calling back)
                        Let the machine get it. 

           The ringing cuts off. Ray stands in the mirror. It suddenly 
           occurs to him who this call might be from. He listens, the 
           silence lingering, drawing out... Then:

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        It was Jim Hawkins. He asked me to 
                        give you a message:
                             (a beat)
                        “Parole’s denied.” 

           Ray takes in a breath. Another. He looks back in the mirror.  
           Something settling over him. A peace. 

           He resumes tying, watching as the bow tie takes shape...

           PRELAP:

                                 OLYMPIC ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
                        ...declare open the games of this 
                        33rd olympiad of the modern era.

           INT. THEATRE STAGE, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - (THE PRESENT)

           We’re mid rehearsal of the opening ceremony speeches. Ray and 
           the other nominees standing on stage, OLYMPIC ADMINISTRATORS 
           watching in the aisles as a STAGE MANAGER leads them through.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        ...at which point the torch will be 
                        entering the stadium, as that comes 
                        around your stage will rise... 

           The manager waves in an assistant waiting off stage. She 
           brings out an Olympic flag, posts it beside the microphone. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        ...the flag will be brought in, the 
                        honorees will step down. You will 
                        all step forward.... 
           Ray follows suit with two others, an ATHLETE and a COACH.  

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        You’ll each be introduced. The oath 
                        of the athlete as we rehearsed. 
                        Then Mr. Tennyson you will come 
                        forward...
                             (Ray does)
                        You will take hold of the flag in 
                        your left hand, swearing to it...

           Ray does so as the Manager temporarily plays orator. 

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, to take the 
                        oath of the Olympic official, 
                        boxing judge and referee Raymond 
                        Tennyson. 

           He steps aside, nodding Ray forward. Ray goes to the mic, 
           bringing forth a small placard. Reading off it now... 

                                 RAY
                        In the name and on the behalf of 
                        all the judges and officials of our 
                        profession, I swear we shall 
                        officiate in these Olympic games 
                        with complete impartiality, 
                        respecting and abiding by the rules 
                        which govern them, and commit to 
                        ourselves to uphold the fundamental 
                        principles adhered to in these 
                        trials of man and sport. 

           A beat. Ray lowers the card, looks out at the lights. The 
           moment sinking in.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Perfect. You will then rejoin with 
                        the others. Across the stage the 
                        secretary general will start...

           As he proceeds with the rehearsal Ray glances out in the 
           audience, finds Kurt Redford leaning against the wall in the 
           back, waiting.

           INT. HALLWAY, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           They step into the hall. Kurt lets a few athletes pass 
           through, disappearing down the hall. Alone now: 

                                 REDFORD
                        I’ve got some news. 
                                 RAY
                        Let me guess, I’ve got to learn the 
                        thing in ten more languages.  

           Kurt smiles, gets quiet.

                                 REDFORD
                        It’s not good news. 
                             (a breath)
                        I’m afraid as of this morning Danny 
                        is being removed from consideration 
                        on the Olympic roster. 

           Ray stares back, says nothing. 

                                 REDFORD (CONT'D)
                        I got a call a few hours ago... 

                                 RAY
                        Kurt, listen before you make any 
                        decisions I think we shou-

                                 REDFORD
                        Danny is in the ICU at Vegas 
                        Memorial. 

           Ray, going still. 

                                 RAY
                        What happened? 

                                 REDFORD
                        We don’t know. He was found 
                        downtown sometime last night. The 
                        injuries are... significant. 

                                 RAY
                        And Luna?
                             (Redford, not following)
                        His wife. 

                                 REDFORD
                        Wasn’t with him. 

           Ray breathes a little. Then -

                                 REDFORD (CONT'D)
                        Ray the committee is requesting 
                        that you take over his matches at 
                        next week’s Olympic qualifiers.  

                                 RAY
                        What about Dallas?
                                 REDFORD
                        Well you can keep Dallas if you’d 
                        like. But frankly, at this point 
                        they need someone they can rely on 
                        while we look into some things. 
                        You’re essentially vetted, not 
                        really a safer bet.
                             (then)
                        If you can step in now, that’ll 
                        give us time to find someone for 
                        Dallas in a few months. 

           Kurt digs out a folder, offers it to him. 

                                 REDFORD (CONT'D)
                        Roster for next week, fighter’s 
                        names are in there. 

           Ray stares down at it, still processing. Redford sees it. 

                                 RAY
                        Listen, I’m sure you want to get 
                        back. Go home, see your wife. When 
                        you have a chance though look it 
                        over, let us know. 

           Kurt lingers a moment, starts down the hall. 

           EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The silhouette of a plane passing over the lights of Vegas.  

           INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           The lights lowered inside. We barely recognize Danny laying 
           still in the bed, face swollen, his neck braced. Luna asleep 
           in a chair at his bedside. 

           HALLWAY

           Ray at the window, luggage at his side, looking in. Danny’s 
           fingers bandaged, staples in his skin. It’s a hard image.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ray.

           The Nevada athletic commissioner Tom Hoover standing down the 
           hall, a styrofoam coffee in his hand. He’s been here a while. 
           INT. COMISSARY, HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nearly empty. Custodians and hospital brass taking their 
           breaks. Ray and Hoover sit at a table against the wall. 

                                 HOOVER
                        Found him over behind The Bellagio. 
                        Probably coming from the Martinez 
                        fight.

                                 RAY
                        What’d the physician say? 

                                 HOOVER
                        Broken ribs, broken hands. Right 
                        eye is blown. Detached Retina.
                             (Ray looks away, phased)
                        LVPD came to sit with Luna for a 
                        statement but she’s more or less 
                        catatonic. Can’t blame her. 

                                 RAY
                        They know anything? 

                                 HOOVER
                        Not really. Money was gone. They 
                        think it could be a mugging. 

           Ray, watching him.

                                 RAY
                        But you don’t. 

                                 HOOVER
                        Hell of a beating just to take a 
                        guy’s wallet.
                             (and then)
                        Has he said anything to you? 

           Ray frowns, shakes his head. 

                                 RAY
                        Why?

           Hoover shakes it off, reaches for his coffee. Ray presses:

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Tom, why.

                                 HOOVER
                        ...there was a complaint. 

           Ray, at attention now. 
                                 HOOVER (CONT'D)
                        There’s word he might have had a 
                        dispute with someone. I don’t know. 

                                 RAY
                        A fighter?

                                 HOOVER
                        I really don’t know Ray. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’d you hear it from. The 
                        committee?  

                                 HOOVER
                        People, Ray. You know how it is, 
                        could be something, could be 
                        bullshit. People talk. Hell we’re 
                        still dealing with that Baker 
                        accusal from ‘05. Until there’s an 
                        inquiry, wrong thing gets out, 
                        risks a guy’s career...
                             (grabbing his coffee)
                        People get angry.

           On Ray, his own anger burning. 

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

           Ray’s BMW roaring through the streets. 

           We’re away from the strip here, the industrial side of town. 
           Cash-advance outfits and tire shops behind gated lots. 

           Ray clocks his street, hits the turn. 

           EXT. RHODES BOXING GYM - NIGHT

           A crumbling parking lot. Window paint blacking out the glass. 
           A gate pulled down over the door: ”Rhodes Boxing Gym” 

           This is the training gym of Cameron Mills. 

           Ray pulls to the curb, steps out. He starts for the door, 
           eyeing the red SUV on his way, sitting silent across the lot -

           Ray reaches the door. Flecks of light inside through 
           scratches in the paint. He grips the gate, pulls. Locked 
           down. He pounds on it a few times, listens... nothing. 

           Finally he turns, starts back toward the street... 
           Then suddenly bends down, lifting a piece of concrete off a 
           broken parking bumper. He takes a few steps toward the gym...

           And launches it against the door. 

           Glass shattering behind the fence. 

           A view inside now showing the gym empty. Just a utility light 
           left on in the back. Ray stares inside, starts for his car. 

           And then - glass crunching. A figure filling in the doorway 
           behind him. Ray turns to find Kufi behind the gate. 

           Ray holding his ground. Then --

                                 RAY
                        I want to see him. 

                                 KUFI
                        Really. Restraining order suggested 
                        otherwise. 

                                 RAY
                        Enough fucking around. Let’s talk.

                                 KUFI
                        I ain’t going to talk for him. 

                                 RAY
                        Then bring him out. 

                                 KUFI
                        He ain’t here. 

                                 RAY
                        Bullshit. 

           Kufi shrugs, not moving. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        What’s this about? 

                                 KUFI
                        About what you did.

                                 RAY
                        And what does he think I did? 

                                 KUFI
                        You made a mistake. 

           Ray, absorbing this. 
                                 RAY
                        You got a problem with me, you come 
                        at me. The man he nearly beat to 
                        death last night, he didn’t do 
                        anything...  

                                                           RAY (CONT'D)
                           KUFI
           See now you at it again - my 
           man was with me, you say 
           whatever you-
                                              Now he’s blind in one eye. 
                                              His career is over. Do you 
                                              get what that means you 
                                              fucking animals-

                                 KUFI (CONT'D)
                        You will not get him to stop!
                             (silence)
                        He ain't gonna break your rules, 
                        violate your laws. You ain't gonna 
                        find nothin on him. He has spent 
                        years living in your world, to get 
                        back here. Now you afraid. 
                             (toes the glass)
                        So you can provoke us, fuck with 
                        us, try and get him to slip. Well 
                        alrujulat efu al'akh brother. He 
                        ain’t going to give you nothing 
                        back. Nah, no matter what you try, 
                        he’s gonna be up there. You’re all 
                        gonna see him fight. 

           Ray, staring him down. 

                                 RAY
                        Come on out to the house again I’ll 
                        kill you. 

           Ray starts walking. 

           EXT. RANCH ROAD - DAWN

           Ray runs on a dirt road. A low fog swallowing up the dust 
           trail lingering in his wake.

           INT. RAY’S HOME - DAY

           Ray stands at the sink, covered in sweat, eyes still locked 
           ahead. The phone on the wall starts to ring. Ray looks at it.

           EXT. HIGHWAY ROAD - DAY

           Ray’s car grinds to a halt on the shoulder. He steps out. 
           AHEAD:

           A sedan and a pickup pulled over, hazards blinking. The 
           sedan’s light shattered and grill smashed, painted in blood. 

           A RANCHER consoling a Woman off to the side. She sees Ray 
           approaching, going to him... 

                                 WOMAN
                             (shaken)
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. We...

           Ray walks passed her to the road, sees:

           The painted mare, struggling on the ground. A gash in her 
           side, her two front legs broken. Fearful eyes roaming as she 
           struggles to breath.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        We had our fog lights on but she 
                        just stepped out...

           She starts crying. Ray says nothing, watching.

           He walks off, heading back to his car. He returns, now 
           holding the rifle. He aims it down at the horse -- fires. 

           The rancher flinches. The woman continues sobbing softly in 
           the bg. Ray stands there, gun still raised. There is not fear 
           in his eyes, or sadness. There is only fury. 

           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           WORKMEN preparing for the upcoming tournament. Bleachers 
           going up, a ring being constructed in the center. Kurt 
           talking with a foreman, stepping away as his cell rings. 

           He answers. 

                                 KURT (INTO PHONE)
                        This is Kurt. 

                                 RAY (OVER PHONE)
                        It’s Ray Tennyson.

                                 KURT
                        Ray, hey - sorry for the noise. How 
                        is everything there?  

           Silence on the other end. Then:

                                 RAY 
                        No conflicts. 
                                 KURT
                        ...Okay then, that’s good to hear. 
                        So we’ll see you here next week.

           Kurt waits for more. The line goes quiet.  

           INT. ICU HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - DAY

           Through the window: Luna at Danny’s bedside, head down. 

           Ray sits out in the hallway. He’s claimed a row of chairs, 
           court documents laid out, working from here. 

           As he makes notes on a case file a figure lowers into the 
           chair beside him. It’s Luna. In a daze. Finally --

                                 LUNA
                        We came out here to get away from 
                        all this.

           Ray searches for some words. Finally he holds up the file - 

                                 RAY
                        You know I’ve been doing this from 
                        one side of the table or the other 
                        for 25 years. I promise you, it all 
                        comes around. The guy who did this -

                                 LUNA
                        Danny wasn’t mugged. 

           Ray falls silent. She stares forward, unable to look at him. 

                                 LUNA (CONT'D)
                        He owes people money.

                                 RAY
                        ...which people?

                                 LUNA
                             (not hearing him)
                        He can’t control himself, gambling. 
                        Racked it up the first time back 
                        East, should of caught up to him 
                        then but, he found an out. Fixing 
                        in the ring. Made it look good too, 
                        point off here, knee down there. 
                        Got himself even. Out here was 
                        supposed to be a fresh start... 
                             (and then)
                        But he cannot stop himself. 

           Looking to Ray now, tears welling, half smiling.
                                 LUNA (CONT'D)
                        Told me the Olympics, that’d be the 
                        out this time. Make, 2-3 times a 
                        match after that. Just gotta make 
                        it there, hold out, just a little 
                        longer...

                                 RAY
                        What does he owe. 

                                 LUNA
                        I don’t know, thousands- he stopped 
                        telling me, he was hiding so much--
                             (breaking now)
                        I couldn’t tell the police. I 
                        didn’t want to tell you. But he 
                        just left me by myself... 

           She starts crying, leans into him. Ray embracing her, 
           listening to her cry. Then, soberly --

                                 RAY
                        Tell me where to go.

           INT. LUXOR HOTEL - NIGHT

           A looming onyx pyramid in the center of Las Vegas.

           INT. ATRIUM, LUXOR HOTEL - NIGHT

           Immaculate Egyptian decor eclipsing the guests. Ominous stone 
           faces lit from beneath, the illusion of temple pyres burning. 

           Ray rides an escalator to the gaming floor. 

           INT. CASINO FLOOR, LUXOR HOTEL - NIGHT 

           Alive at this hour. Ray walks through, lights and sounds 
           calling from every direction. He finds the blackjack section: 

           Half a dozen dealers hosting the tables. Loners and small 
           groups playing the wheels. 

           Ray watches a moment, moves on. Whatever he’s looking for, it 
           isn’t there. 

           INT. CASINO BAR, LUXOR HOTEL - LATER

           A drink on the bar. Ray turned away, eyes fixed:
           A view of the blackjack tables from here. Traffic has died 
           down, tables clearing out. 

                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Get you a refill? Maker’s right?

           Ray turns back, his glass down to the ice. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, thanks. 

           A look back out at the floor. From afar a pit boss walking 
           over and relieving a dealer. Ray watching...

           BLACKJACK TABLE

           Ray takes a seat as the new DEALER preps the table, shuffling 
           at the card shoe, back turned away. Over his shoulder - 

                                 DEALER 
                        Good evening. Just about ready 
                        here. 

                                 RAY
                        Take your time. 

           The dealer turns around, smiles. It’s HAMPTON. Masking his 
           surprise. Ray slides a few bills forward. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Hundred in chips please.

                                 HAMPTON 
                             (calling out)
                        Changing a hundred. 

           The pit boss floating nearby in the background. As Hampton 
           counts out Ray’s chips...

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        So how are we doing tonight sir? 

                                 RAY
                        Call me Danny. 

           Hampton nods, slides his chips forward. He gets Ray’s 
           intention here. Ray sets out his bet. Then -- 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You know what, let’s do three. 

           Setting chips at the seats on either side of him. Ray is now 
           playing three hands at once. 
                                 DEALER
                        Money plays to the table limit. No 
                        foreign cheques. 

                                 RAY
                        Okay. 

           They play a few hands. Hampton is fluid, practiced. Ray stays 
           on two, hits on one. Hampton draws, and busts. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Player wins. 

           He collects the old hand, deals again, nodding at Ray’s stack-

                                 HAMPTON  (CONT'D)
                        Looking to play a while? 

                                 RAY
                        Just looking to break even.  

           Ray hits on all three. As Hampton deals... 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Even’s a nice place to be. 
                             (off his chip pile)
                        Not sure that’ll get you there. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah. What would you say it’d take?

           But Hampton just continues the game, the pit boss circling. 
           He flips his own card: a King, giving him twenty. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Goes to the house. 

           Hampton starts clearing the table. Ray still awaiting an 
           answer, then noticing Hampton has paused. We see he’s left 
           three cards out on the felt. A 3, 10, and King. $310K.  

           A beat before he sweeps them in with the rest. Ray stares at 
           the felt a moment, cracks a smile. 

                                 RAY
                        Bullshit. 

           Hampton smiles with him as he shuffles the next hand. Then --

                                 HAMPTON
                        You married Danny?

           Ray smile falls. Hampton continues to shuffle. 
                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        I bet you tell her everything too. 
                        I would. You know, just in case. 

           Behind them a few college kids start to make their way over. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        I’m off at three. Room 289. 
                             (louder)
                        Cash out sir? 

           The kids filling into the chairs around him. Ray sits with 
           this a second, then slides his chips off and steps down. 

           INT. CASHIERS WINDOW, LUXOR - NIGHT

           From afar, Ray at the cage as a teller counts behind the 
           glass. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, LUXOR - DAY

           Hampton’s body man Wyatt sitting near the door. A knock. He 
           glances through the door, pulls it open and steps aside. 

           Ray in the doorway, a shopping bag in hand. Stepping in... 

           The room cleaned and ready. A quality card still on the bed. 
           Not living in, just borrowing. 

           Hampton perches over two laptops on the desk, spreadsheets 
           and a live ticker scrolling something in the corner. 

           A click behind Ray. He turns, sees Wyatt closing them in. 

                                 RAY
                        A federal judge goes missing. You 
                        know what happens then? 

                                 HAMPTON
                             (smiling crisply)
                        They’re some of my best clients. 
                             (then leaning back)
                        Relax, this is a loner from a 
                        friend in housekeeping. If this was 
                        other business we’d be at the Palms

           A smile. Ray just sets the bag on the bed. Business. Hampton 
           shrugs, tips open the bag. Poker chips inside, oranges and 
           grays. $500s and $1000s. The bag is full. He appraises, then:    

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                             (matter of factly)
                        Okay. 
           Hampton sits back, studies Ray.  

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        I gotta know, that bag - what is 
                        that to you? Your gym? Early 
                        retirement? Just the next few 
                        years? 

           Ray holds his look, then:

                                 RAY
                        So we’re good? 

                                 HAMPTON
                        ...we’re good your honor. 

           He pivots back to his laptop. Ray starts for the door, Wyatt 
           rising, pulling it open for him. 

           Ray steps through the doorway, stands there, looking down the 
           hallway. Adrenaline releasing... 

           He glances back inside. 

           INT. PUBLIC DEFENDER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Folders and file boxes. Overworked and understaffed. Melissa 
           working at her desk, calling out at a knock at the door.

                                 MELISSA
                        ...Yeah...

           Graham’s head pokes in, takes the room in. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Graham Yates. I called earlier... 

                                 MELISSA
                        Right, the Clark County restorative 
                        justice piece. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Right. Mind if I take a seat?

                                 MELISSA
                        Grab it where you can find it. 

           Graham clears a chair. 

                                 MELISSA (CONT'D)
                        Surprised The Sun is interested in 
                        a Juvenile detention study. 
                                 GRAHAM
                        Well yeah, they’re not. 

           Graham, sheepish as he pulls out the transcript. We see it’s 
           dog eared, post-its flagging pages throughout.  

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        You know I have tried just about 
                        every name on that cover. Everyone 
                        is either attorney-client, retired, 
                        wrong number or, go fuck yourself.  
                             (holding it out)
                        I was hoping there’s a chance you 
                        would not give me the latter. 

           Melissa studies it. Then, evenly --

                                 MELISSA
                        I’m sorry. I consider Judge 
                        Tennyson a friend. 

           Graham, hearing something in this. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Good. So do I.
                             (and then)
                        But why would you assume this is 
                        about Ray Tennyson.

           Melissa, caught in a corner. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        Look, I could take this over to the 
                        DA, or the old PD, but frankly I’m 
                        afraid I might shine a light on 
                        something that’s a little above my 
                        station. Legal just ain’t my 
                        business... but boxing is. 
                             (and then)
                        And I’m afraid to say it’s no 
                        longer the sport we both fell in 
                        love with. It’s infested; drugs, 
                        boys throwing fights, hitting their 
                        wives, buying off officials. Ray is 
                        one of the few guys that we can 
                        still point to, to prove the 
                        gentlemen have not left the sport. 
                             (and then)
                        And now I’m worried he’s about to 
                        do something that’ll throw that 
                        away. If he is, I’d like to give 
                        him the chance to stop himself 
                        before he does.
           He sees Melissa wavering, winning something here. Graham 
           cautiously leans forward, opens to the first marker.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        Page 72 here...

           EXT. RAY'S HOME, FRONT PORCH - AFTERNOON

           Ray returned home, sitting on his porch. We see the rifle 
           propped in corner while he stares out across his acreage. 

           Something catches his attention on the horizon. He reaches 
           for the gun, peering through the scope.  

           ANGLE - SCOPE

           His neighbor resetting a post along his property, his own 
           fence broken down the line.  

           Ray lowers the gun, seeing this. Doubt crawling in. 

           INT. CASINO BAR - NIGHT

           The same bar we saw him post-fight in the beginning. Ray at 
           the counter, his haunt, a paper in hand as he drinks alone. 

           A beer bottle suddenly slides in from down the bar, stopping 
           short beside him. Ray looks over, finds Graham smirking at 
           the other end. Ray shrugs, takes the beer. Seat yourself.

           Graham starts over but posts up a few stools down, giving Ray 
           some space. They drink silently for a moment. Then: 

                                 GRAHAM
                        You ever hear of a guy named Bobby 
                        Dunlap?

                                 RAY
                        Cut man from Detroit? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Yeah... cut man from Detroit. 

           He smiles to himself, drinks. Falls back into silence. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        Used to be a trainer. At least 
                        that’s how I like to remember him. 
                        Good one. Brought up Graziano, 
                        Caputo, Hagler. He was the guy...

           Ray, still reading. Graham watching the tv. 
                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        But there was one fight. Cow 
                        Palace, San Francisco, ABA 
                        Middleweight title. His guy was 
                        fighting a kid he used to train, 
                        broke up over some shit, I don’t 
                        know. Anyway, his guy comes out... 
                        just throwing hammers. Kid can’t 
                        return, can’t come back. He’s gone 
                        before the end of the 3rd. 

           Ray listening patiently now. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        Janitor later says he finds powder 
                        on the floor in Dunlap’s locker 
                        room beneath his wraps. Plaster of 
                        Paris, mix with a little sweat, 
                        guy’s gloves would have been 
                        swinging concrete. Did he ever get 
                        caught though? No. Fight stayed, 
                        belt stayed... but it was enough. 
                        Caputo drops him, Roy Junior drops 
                        him... Dunlap’s integrity, it’d 
                        been questioned. Ends up running 
                        corners at the American Legion. 
                             (takes a drink)
                        Thirteen good years as a trainer. 
                        But what does everyone remember him 
                        as? A cut man from Detroit. 

           Graham kills off his drink, looks down from the TV. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        So do you know Cameron Mills or not 
                        Ray. 

                                 RAY
                        ...Yeah. I know him.
                             (turning to him)
                        He’s the guy whose life I fucked 
                        over, right? 

           Ray suddenly staring right at him. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Nevermind he committed three 
                        felonies, or twelve people saw it 
                        the same. Never mind he refused a 
                        plea deal, or dismissed his first 
                        three public defenders. No, that’s 
                        all on me. 
                             (direct now)
                        And you know what? I sleep fine. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        I don’t second guess, and they’ll 
                        try to get you to. You know how to 
                        tell you’re getting a call from a 
                        state penitentiary? You hear a 
                        little pause, and little click, and 
                        then after the recording: a voice 
                        reminding you they’re coming for 
                        you. And you just hope your wife 
                        wasn’t the one to pick up the phone 
                        that day. Those kind of guys are 
                        hard to forget. 
                             (and then)
                        So no I don’t need any more 
                        reminders from you, or to read any 
                        transcript to remember exactly who 
                        Cameron Mills is. He’s my job. 

           Graham looks down, out of words. Then, digging into his coat--

                                 GRAHAM
                        You know, you’re right. You don’t 
                        need to read it. There’s nothing 
                        there. No procedural misconduct, no 
                        violation of inalienable rights. 
                        For all purposes, record shows 
                        Cameron J. Mills had a fair trial. 

           He counts out a few bills, rises to leave. Holds a moment...

                                 GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        The plea hearing though... 
                        interesting bit at the end there.

           He sets the money on the counter and exits. Ray, thrown,  
           watching as he walks out.

           INT. OFFICE, RAY’S HOME - NIGHT

           The lights turning on. The transcript Graham brought over, 
           still sitting on the desk. UP TO:

           RAY, staring at it from the doorway. 

           IN THE HALLWAY

           As he quietly steps inside, closing the door behind him. 

           PRELAP: Violin music RISING. Fast, chaotic...
           INT. RENO COURTROOM - DAY (THE PAST)

           The courtroom sitting still, all listening to what we see now 
           is a recording of a violin. 

           Ray on the bench, Melissa at the clerk’s desk. A different 
           public defender next to Cameron, sitting expressionless as 
           the prosecutor JIM HAWKENS turns off a speaker.

           He lets the silence linger a moment, then rises. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        I was asked by the family to play 
                        this in lieu of a victim impact 
                        statement, because no words can 
                        describe what they’ve lost here.

           A TEENAGE BOY sitting in the gallery, part of his right arm 
           removed, shirt sleeve pinned and folded. His mother and 
           father beside him, eyes red, staring forward. 

                                 HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                        This was the last time Ryan played. 
                        Two weeks later Mr. Mills and Mr. 
                        Brooks would be arrested for the 
                        DUI crash that left Ryan without 
                        his arm, and all of us without his 
                        sister. The only reason Mr. Mills 
                        has this plea in the first place is 
                        because the family wants to show 
                        compassion, to try and forgive this 
                        defendant for his actions in hopes 
                        of finding some sense of closure. 

           Hawkins takes his seat. Ray clears his throat. 

                                 RAY
                        I understand we’ve reached a 
                        settlement on the arraignment, part 
                        of which the defendant has agreed 
                        to publicly acknowledge his 
                        complicitness in the charges. 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        That’s correct your honor. My 
                        client is ready to proceed. 

           Ray nods for Hawkins to go ahead. 
                                 HAWKINS
                             (addressing Cameron now)
                        On the afternoon of March 7th, did 
                        you and Samuel Brooks purchase 
                        alcohol from the convenience store 
                        located at 667 Virginia Avenue? 

           Cameron looks to his lawyer, who nods for him to go ahead. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Yes.

                                 HAWKINS
                        Did you then proceed to purchase a 
                        small amount of methamphetamines 
                        from the 1600 block of the Oxbow 
                        apartment complex. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Yes. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        And what did you do then? 

                                 CAMERON
                        We went back to the car. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        And who did the car belong to?

                                 CAMERON
                        My uncle Kenny. 

           Hawkins nods, lets this be heard.

                                 HAWKINS
                        What happened next? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Sam lit it up. We smoked it there. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        And how about the vodka. 

                                 CAMERON
                        We drank it. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        All of it? How much? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Two bottles of New Amsterdam and 
                        some Tito’s we already had. 
                                 HAWKINS
                        And despite this you then proceeded 
                        to re-enter the vehicle. 

           Cameron nods his head. 

                                 HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                        Where you then drove through the 
                        intersection of Arroyo and Wabash, 
                        failing to adhere to the red light, 
                        striking the Tanner’s sedan, 
                        severely injuring Ryan and 
                        hospitalizing Kaitlyn where she 
                        would later die. 

           Cameron says nothing. Ray watching, waiting. The defender 
           leans forward: 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        That is a correct statement your 
                        honor. 

                                 HAWKINS
                        In exchange for the plea the people 
                        move to dismiss count 2 of the 
                        indictment. The sentence agreement 
                        on counts 1 and 3 stipulates the 
                        defendent will serve no less than 
                        two years in the Nevada Department 
                        of Corrections, those two counts 
                        will run concurrent to each oth- 

           Wood banging. In the gallery the teenage boy has heard 
           enough, walking out of the courtroom. Ray watching.

                                 HAWKINS (CONT'D)
                        For the resolution on count 4, as 
                        part of this plea agreement the 
                        people will be accepting an Alford 
                        Plea for his involvement in the 
                        vehicular homicide of Kaitlyn 
                        Tanner, whereas the defendant does 
                        not admit guilt but concedes there 
                        is sufficient evidence to find him 
                        guilty at trial.

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Your honor my client and I have 
                        reviewed the presentence agreement, 
                        and the Defense is satisfied.

                                 HAWKINS
                        The people are satisfied your 
                        honor.
           The court, waiting on Ray, his eyes still locked onto the 
           doors the boy disappeared through. Finally:

                                 RAY
                        You know I have never in almost 
                        fifteen years not accepted a plea 
                        agreement between parties... 
                             (a moment, then)
                        But I am not comfortable with him 
                        not pleading straight up. Used to 
                        be, when we practiced law, we would 
                        approach the court, and we would 
                        resolve the case with the court’s 
                        direction and approval. That’s been 
                        lacking in this case. On top of 
                        that the defendant’s demeanor- 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Your honor my client is 17 years 
                        old, he has some emotional 
                        problems, and frankly he’s scared- 

                                 RAY
                        It’s unprecedented in my experience 
                        on this bench, and I cannot in good 
                        conscience, looking at the facts 
                        and circumstances of this case, 
                        file the sentence agreement that 
                        you all put in place. Your options 
                        are, negotiate a new deal 
                        commensurate with the charges or- 

                                 HAWKINS
                        Defense has shown no willingness to 
                        accept further guilt on recor-

                                 RAY
                        Then we’ll go to trial. 
                             (cold now)
                        Mr. Mills you tore a boy’s arm off 
                        his body. Nevermind you took away 
                        what he was meant to be, you took 
                        away his sister. You took away his 
                        heart. You crushed her skull. You 
                        snuffed out her life. That took 
                        away more than you’ll ever feel. 

                                 PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        Your honor-

                                 RAY
                        Shut up.
                             (returns to Cameron)

                        And if you’re convicted of felony 
                        murder you’ll go to prison for the 
                        rest of your life - that means 
                        you’ll die there. And that’s the 
                        least Laura deserves. 

           Melissa looking up from her desk. The court reporter’s hands 
           coming to rest as she finishes. 

                                 GRAHAM (V.O.)
                        Who was Laura?

           INT. PUBLIC DEFENDER’S OFFICE - NIGHT (EARLIER)

           Graham now sitting beside Melissa, paging through from the 
           transcript.  

                                 GRAHAM
                        I went back through, couldn’t find 
                        any reference to her. The victim’s 
                        name in the crash was Kaitlyn, I 
                        wasn’t sure if this was a middle- 

                                 MELISSA
                        Laura was Ray’s sister. 

           Graham looks up at her. 

           EXT. FIELD - (THE PAST) NO SOUND

           We’re at the opening scene of the film. A car overturned in a 
           roadside ditch. Battered and smoking. The door kicked open:

           A nineteen year old Ray lays in the grass. Blood on his 
           Olympic boxing sweats, back broken, tears streaming as he 
           screams back into the car... 

                                 MELISSA (V.O.)
                        She was in the car, driving him to 
                        practice the day he was hit. Other 
                        car hit her side first. She died 
                        that morning. 

           A YOUNG WOMAN suspended upside down by the seat belt, 
           lifeless eyes frozen open, staring back at him. 

           INT. RENO COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS (THE PAST)

           On Ray, staring down. Melissa looking out. A few murmurs 
           around the room but many just listening as Ray continues on. 
                                 RAY
                        The adoption of the plea agreement 
                        is rejected. We will notify the 
                        district administrator’s office...

           Sound fades as he continues. 

                                 MELISSA (V.O.)
                        That day everyone just figured he 
                        mispoke. Tensions were high, he 
                        never acknowledged it, defense 
                        never raised it - how could they? 
                        No one there knew she existed, he 
                        never talks about her... 
                             (finally)
                        And I never did either. 

           Ray pounds the gavel. 

           EXT. RAY'S HOME - NIGHT (THE PRESENT)

           Ray’s car running in the driveway. From behind we see Ray in 
           the driver’s seat. Building to something. 

           INT. GARAGE, RAY’S HOME - DAWN

           The garage door rising to reveal Ray’s car now gone. 

           Connie stands in the doorway, staring at the vacant driveway. 
           A worry on her face. She looks back inside: a room at the top 
           of the stairs. 

           EXT. NEVADA - DAWN

           Driving. Desert drifting by, purple before the sun arrives. 

           INT. RHODES GYM - MORNING

           The gate is up. A black garbage bag taped over the door where 
           the glass used to be, flapping in the wind. 

           Ray slides the bag aside, steps through. Lights on but no one 
           in sight. Still early. But we hear the irregular heartbeat of 
           a punching bag in the back. 

           Ray wanders further in, finds a man training, chain rattling, 
           obscured by a heavy bag in the back corner. 

           Circling from a distance we find Cameron, in a trance, locked 
           ahead. Breaking as Ray comes into view. 
           Cameron lowers his gloves, his eyes flickering down, and for 
           the first time we see: the HOLSTER on Ray’s belt, pistol 
           handle showing beneath the leather.

           This is Nevada. 

           They stand there a minute regarding each other. Finally -- 

                                 CAMERON
                        We shouldn’t be talking.

                                 RAY
                        Then what were you trying to do the 
                        last couple weeks.

                                 CAMERON
                        That was before I was on your card. 

                                 RAY
                        So you heard from the committee.
                             (beat)
                        You could have said something then. 
                        Why didn’t you? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Why didn’t you?

           Ray, no response. Cameron resumes punching.

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        Like I said, not appropriate for us 
                        to talk about it now. 

                                 RAY
                        So we’ll talk about something else 
                        then.

           Cameron just keeps swinging, doesn’t oppose. Ray wades in.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Was that you that called my house? 
                        Talked to my wife? 

                                 CAMERON
                        ...didn’t mean to scare nobody... 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah? Want to tell that to the ref 
                        you flatlined in Carson. 

                                 CAMERON
                        That was an accident. 
                                 RAY
                        Horse shit. 

                                 CAMERON
                             (smiles, keeps pounding)
                        And how’s your eye your honor? That 
                        guy at the MGM, you press charges?
                             (scoffs)
                        This is boxing. Get out the way. 

           Ray concedes, wanders a few steps.

                                 RAY
                        You came to my home. Middle of the 
                        night. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah? When?

                                 RAY
                        You know when. Last week.

                                 CAMERON
                        Eid-al-Adha.
                             (off Ray’s look)
                        Islamic holiday. Festival of 
                        Sacrifice. If it was at night – I 
                        was at temple.

           Ray, considering this. 

                                 RAY
                        Anyone else see you?

                                 CAMERON
                        Only about a hundred brothers.

           Ray stares off, done with the bullshit. Direct now.

                                 RAY
                        What are we doin here?

           Cameron slows, faces him. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        I’m tired of this over the shoulder 
                        chicken shit. What do you want with 
                        me? 

           Cameron just stares at him. Ray, growing unnerved. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You want an apology? You got a 
                        problem with me, let’s finish it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You gotta hit me? Beat the living 
                        shit out of me... 

           Ray’s voice rising, desperate for an answer. Not sure if he 
           should be furious, terrified, ashamed. Finally Cameron sighs, 
           rips the tape off his gloves, starts unwinding...

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        That’s right. There we go... 

           Ray loosens his belt, lets the gun fall to the mat. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Let’s do it. I ain’t gonna say 
                        anything... 
                             (takes off his glasses)
                        It’s just you and me. C’mon you son 
                        of a bitch, you wanna tell me 
                        something, I make a bad call... 
                             (discards his watch, his 
                              wedding band)
                        You wanna fucking hurt me? Hurt me!

           Ray stands there, disheveled, out of breath. Cameron steps 
           forward, bare knuckled now. Their eyes inches apart. Then...

                                 CAMERON
                        I wanted to.  

           Cameron rests his gloves on the bench. On Ray, frozen there 
           as Cameron starts across the gym.

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        Five years. Lost my mom, lost my 
                        brother. The nights I spent blaming 
                        you. Like a wheel just, running...

           Cameron gets to his gym bag, starts breaking down his gear. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        You know in the Qur’an, there’s an 
                        entire chapter on the quality of 
                        forgiveness. I could use some of 
                        that, the way I was back then. 
                        Whoever is injured, let them 
                        pardon, for his own pardon will be 
                        his reward upon God. 

           Silence. Ray’s voice drifts over from across the gym... 

                                 RAY
                        Did you do it? 

           He looks back at Ray, reading his face. Needing to know. 
                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah, I was in the car. I was 
                        drunk, high as shit...and any other 
                        day I probably would have been 
                        driving too... just not that day.
                             (then, sheepish)
                        I can’t drive stick. 

           On Ray, his face falling. Realizing what he’s done. 

           Cameron hikes his bag up on his shoulder...

           Suddenly he grabs Ray by the shoulders, Ray flinching, not 
           sure what’s happening. Cameron leaning into him -

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        Mmaghfira, aleafw, alssafh, 
                        almaghfira.

           Cameron releases him, steps back. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        No, I’m not coming for you. I was 
                        coming to forgive you. I’m still 
                        figuring that part out with my God. 
                        ...imagine you are too. 

           With that Cameron disappears into the locker room, leaving 
           him there. 

           INT. RAY’S HOME - DAY

           Footsteps on the porch outside. Ray comes through the door. 
           He looks hollow, a vacant stare as he slides his jacket off. 

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        Where’d you go?

           Connie on the couch across the room, her back to us. She 
           turns, glancing over. 

                                 RAY
                        Just for a drive.

           Her eyes drift lower to the gun on his waist. More than a 
           drive. He sees it, starts unfastening it. Then...

                                 CONNIE
                        Did you know? What you said.

           Ray slows. Connie rises from her seat. We see now she has the 
           transcript in her hands. She walks to him, quietly setting it 
           on the counter beside them. 
           Ray looks at it, goes back to removing his harness. 

                                 RAY
                        You don’t know what you read Con. 
                        You know how many-

           She slaps him. Not letting him off. He stares down.

                                 CONNIE
                        Did you know? 

           A long silence. 

                                 RAY
                        No. Not at first. 
                             (then)
                        Afterwards, I started wondering...

                                 CONNIE
                        ...you could have looked back.

                                 RAY
                        I never wanted to. 

           Finally looking up, facing her. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        If I didn’t look, then I’d never 
                        have to know. 
                             (then, measured)
                        I was upset-

                                 CONNIE
                        You weren’t upset... You stole 
                        years from that man because you 
                        were small. 
                             (he says nothing)
                        You could have disclosed after 
                        sentencing, you could have recused 
                        yourself from the start, you could 
                        have- 

                                 RAY
                        But I didn't! All right!? 

           Bursting suddenly, yelling at himself more than her.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        It’s over. I can’t do anything for 
                        him now - you want me to fix this-

                                 CONNIE
                        You can’t fix this...
                                 RAY
                        So what do you want me to do 
                        goddamnit!? Hate myself for it? I 
                        do! Blame myself every day for it? 
                        I will!

                                 CONNIE
                        Good!
                             (cutting him off)
                        If that’s what you need. How many 
                        other cases will there be Ray? Who 
                        else might you get? Christ who else 
                        have you already had...
                             (then)
                        You decide the course of people’s 
                        lives. You're either supposed to be 
                        worthy of that, or decent enough to 
                        know when you're not.

           That hangs there, their pulses running, their breaths 
           settling. Finally --

                                 RAY
                        What are you saying? 

                                 CONNIE
                        ...I’m saying it’s time to know 
                        that maybe you’re not.

           On Ray. He stays there as she moves past him, walking out. 

           INT. RAY’S HOME, BEDROOM - DAY

           Through the window: Connie now in the distance, riding alone. 
           Ray stands at the glass, watching. Mind running.  

           Finally he turns away, goes to a drawer. He unearths a small 
           box, sets it on the desk. We float toward it as he turns on a 
           closet light, starting to pull down luggage and clothes in 
           the bg. 

           Arriving over the box we see inside: A black silk bow tie.

           EXT. OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           The flame in full blaze. 

           Cars swarming through the gate. A message on the marquee: 

                        “USA BOXING: LAST CHANCE OLYMPIC QUALIFIERS”
           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           Hundreds on the stadium floor, the ring in the center, lit 
           and hovering above it all. 

           QUICK SHOTS OF: 

           - Pockets of boxing teams and gear. Athletes warming up.  
           - Spectators and VIPs in the stands. 
           - Cameras and journalists logging in at press tables. 
           - Judges testing electronic score cards. Timers at the bell. 

           Ray getting an incoming call as he enters the hall. He clocks 
           the screen, silences it, looking up to take it all in. The 
           flags of the globe above. The Olympic rings on the mat. 

           The adrenaline. 

           Kurt Redford finds him through the crowd, greets him. 

                                 KURT
                        Quite a show, huh. 

                                 RAY
                        Yea. Little bigger than I remember.

                                 KURT
                        Well, last stop. No one’s gonna 
                        miss it. Listen, we got the 
                        inspectors making the rounds. After 
                        roll we’ll get you introduced, 
                        bring in the ring physician. Need 
                        anything else I’ll be in the stands 
                        with the committee. 

                                 RAY
                        Thanks, I’ll be fine. 

           Seasoned. Good to go. Kurt nods.

                                 KURT
                        C’mon then, let’s get you ready.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           An organizer shows Ray into a private single bay locker room, 
           leaves him to dress. Ray wanders further in. 

           A shirt laid out on the bench. White collared, freshly 
           pressed. A patch on the breast where the Nevada Athletic 
           Commission symbol is usually found. Ray lifts it up: 
           A familiar blue star background against a red and white 
           striped glove: “USA BOXING” 

           PRELAP: 
                                 GIRL’S VOICE (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        ...the bombs bursting in air, Gave 
                        proof through the night, that our 
                        flag was still there. O say does... 

           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           All standing silent, eyes on the ring as a girl sings the 
           anthem. 

           RAY, now in uniform. Notices across the arena: GRAHAM in the 
           press pit, hat off and over his heart. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        ...that star-spangled - banner yet 
                        wave. O’er the land of the free... 
                        And the home of the brave... 

           Applause as the lights come up. Ray takes one last glance 
           into the stands. Kurt talking with a small aristocratic group 
           seated off to the side. The Olympic Officials committee.

           Ray shakes hands with the head judge, then climbs into the 
           ring, and gets to work. 

           PRELAP: The BELL

           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - SERIES

           BOUT 1

           Two fighters colliding, rapid fire in-fighting. 

           Ray running a match. Fighters in Red and Blue. FIVE JUDGES 
           seated around the ring, craning necks to follow the action.  

           Ray leaning dangerously close, a face near a buzz saw, eyes 
           tracking with each blow. Finally --

                                 RAY
                        Step it back. Break. Break! 

           Ray halts the action, walks them apart. Calling out the 
           charges to blue... 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Hitting with the forearm. Hitting 
                        with the elbow. Caution. 
           Then to Red. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Holding, back of the head. 
                        Knock it off. 

           A series of hand signals to the fighters, the sign language 
           of boxing. Then repeating them around the ring to the judges, 
           deducting a point. 

           The judges looking down, typing into an electronic score pad. 

           IN THE STANDS

           Kurt leaning over to one of the committee members, pleased. 

           BOUT 2

           Fighters circling. Suddenly a straight right SNAPS Blue’s 
           head back. Blood gushing from his nose. Red still coming...

           Ray’s already there, stepping between them,

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Corner!

           Sending Red back as he grips Blue’s headgear, tilts it back. 

           A RING DOCTOR appearing at the ropes as Ray inspects. Ray 
           waves him off. Not broken. 

           Instead he whips some gauze out of his pocket, scrubbing the 
           nose, blood streaking, stopping the flow. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        You good? You good? 
                             (Blue sniffs, nod)
                        All right. 

           Ray gives some space, commands to resume. Leather flies. 

           PRESS TABLES

           Graham chewing on a straw, typing as he balances a laptop on 
           his thigh.  

           BOUT 3

           An ANNOUNCER with the mic as the two fighters are introduced. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        In the red corner, lightweight from 
                        Ann Arbor Michigan, Jackson Hess. 
           Applause from the crowd. Ray standing aside, blood spatter 
           starting to accumulate on his shirt. As the announcements 
           continue Ray looks out at one of the event monitors, 
           Cameron’s fight in an upcoming slot: 

           “Welterweight - MILLS, C. vs NAVARRO, A.”

           Around him the ring starts to clear, the announcements over.

           Ray starts for the center. 

           EXT. HALLWAY, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - LATER

           Ray, exchanging nods with staff as he threads his way down 
           the hallway. He reaches his room, pushes through the door...

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           He grabs a towel off a stack, wipes his face. Suddenly his 
           head is FLATTENED against the locker wall. He struggles but 
           is pinned further, a thick hand pressing him from off screen.

           HAMPTON steps into the eyeline beside him. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        I told you, I don’t fuck people 
                        over. I make an arrangement, I 
                        honor it. I’m reliable.
                             (and then)
                        It’s a good reputation. 

           Wyatt continues to pin as Hampton holds up the phone. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        So want to tell me what the hell 
                        this is? 

                                 RAY
                        Don’t run it. Pull the bet. 

                                 HAMPTON.
                        Pull the bet...

           Hampton shakes his head, motions for Ray to be let up. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        Ray this was your proposition, not 
                        mine--
                                 RAY
                        So fuck what I said. The money, you 
                        keep it. Danny’s clear, you’re 
                        even. That’s what you wanted. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        It’s too late for what I wanted. 
                        That’s not how this works. This is 
                        out there Ray.
                             (off Ray’s face)
                        Online. Union pools, college kids 
                        in Jersey. Fucking guys in lockup. 
                        I told you, the industry will bet 
                        on anything. And that’s just the 
                        weekend players. We don’t deliver, 
                        there are people bigger than both 
                        of us that we would answer to.
                             (beat)
                        This is way beyond your 300k now.

                                 RAY
                        ...How much then?

                                 HAMPTON
                             (pitying)
                        More than you can afford to give. 

           Ray tightens his lips, shakes his head. He can’t do it. 
           Hampton sighs, looks off his phone. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        Black Audi, 7HI-42R Nebraska plates-
                        that’s your rental car, right?
                             (reading on)

                        United Airlines, Flight 586, 
                        departing 4:38, gate 12...

           Ray, losing some color now. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        C’mon Ray don’t put me in this 
                        position. 
                             (then, direct)
                        There is nowhere else to go. So 
                        this is going to go reliably. Mills 
                        to go down, by decision or 
                        knockout, any round. You make it 
                        look how you need to. Right? 

           Ray lowers his head, defeated. Hampton straightens his shirt, 
           starts to leave. Wyatt goes to unlock the door... 
                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        I’m not going to do it. 

           Hampton stalls in the doorway.

                                 HAMPTON
                             (resigned)
                        You mean that don’t you. 

           A look. He does. 

           Hampton speaks something low to Wyatt. He starts toward Ray, 
           cornered in the locker bay. Ray struggles, manages to clip 
           him in the face. Wyatt goes red, hits Ray under the ribs, in 
           his side, in his back --

           Ray’s eyes go wide.

           Going docile all of a sudden. He may be having a seizure. 
           Hampton doesn’t realize it, watching as Wyatt lays Ray’s arm 
           across the bench...

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        You have two choices. Make a scene, 
                        or go out and finish. 

           He steps back, nods. Wyatt grabs Ray’s wrist... 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        You don't go out there, your 
                        committee’s going to pull you. You 
                        complain, we’re going to have a 
                        different problem.

           And STOMPS Ray’s upper arm. We hear a pop. Ray yelps. 

                                 HAMPTON (CONT'D)
                        You go out there and the bet 
                        doesn’t show - we break it all. 

           Wyatt releases him, Ray sliding to the floor. 

           We stay with him as they exit in the bg, Ray breathing in 
           short bursts, teeth clenched, writhing on the ground.

           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - DAY

           The arena ready to go. 

           Spectators in their seats. Judges at their tables. Cameron 
           and his opponent, NAVARRO, staying loose on the floor with 
           his trainer, ready to ascend.
           Kurt in a sidebar with the Announcer, glancing toward the 
           hallway. He checks the time on the monitor... 

           Ray emerges onto the floor, his steps normal, if not a little 
           gradual. 

           GRAHAM watching as he makes his perfunctory greetings with 
           the ring crew, his left arm kept subtly tucked near his body. 

           *note: all movement with this arm will be with limited motion 

           Ray goes to a Ring Deputy, signing a release. He nods toward 
           Cameron. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’s his second? 

                                 DEPUTY
                        He doesn’t have one.

                                 RAY
                        What about him?

           Kufi, sitting outside the ring perimeter. 

                                 DEPUTY
                        Not licensed. Only AIBA certified 
                        trainers in the corners. 

           Ray turns back, finishes, walking up the steps into the ring.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and gentlemen we are ready 
                        for our 4th bout, for the 
                        welterweight contender of Team USA. 
                             (to the fighters)
                        In the red corner, from Oxnard 
                        California, Anthony Navarro. 

           Applause. Ray pulls on his rubber gloves, wincing slightly. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                        And in the blue corner, from 
                        Henderson Nevada, Cameron Mills. 

           Over the rope Kufi puts his head against Cameron’s, a few 
           last words before he ascends. Ray waves them to the center. 

                                 RAY
                        Gentlemen, low lines are going to 
                        be here, and here... I call stop, 
                        you stop. I call break, you break.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Watch the heads, no holding, you 
                        cannot be saved by the bell at any 
                        time except the final round. Will 
                        you comply with my wishes? 

           Navarro nods. Ray finds Cameron staring at him. Finally he 
           nods. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Touch gloves. 

           They do. Ray looking out as they retreat to their corners:

           IN THE STANDS

           The noise level rising now. Committee settling. Hampton and 
           Wyatt taking seats in the crowd, watching him. 

           Ringside a gavel hovers over the bell. 

           Ray raises his good hand out, holding them. Sweat already 
           stinging his eyes...  

           The bell rings. 

                     NAVARRO’S TRAINER
                                                          KUFI
           Piernas fuertes chico!
                                              This is yours Cam this is 
                                              yours!

           Navarro coming out strong. Half the mat suddenly behind him.  
           Cameron planting just in time -- a wave of melees washing 
           over him. The world thundering inside his headgear.  

           He ducks, slipping out, ears already ringing.  

           Navarro pivots, keeping Cameron to the outside. It’s 
           immediately clear, he’s outclassed here. Cameron about to 
           reset when Navarro rushes again. Cameron burying his head,  
           enduring another savage round. 

           Ray stands aside, letting it happen.

           Out of nowhere Cameron suddenly slides and bursts out with a 
           right around the side of the head. Navarro stumbling. 

           Ray leaps forward, signing to Cameron.  

                                 RAY
                        Back of the head.

           Kufi yelling out. Ray ignores him, facing the judges.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Blue, back of the head, warning. 
           The committee watching in the stands, unalarmed by the call. 

           PRESS TABLE

           Graham and another journalist looking on as fight resumes.

           RING

           The fighters tangling until the bell rings. Ray breaks them 
           apart, a finger to Navarro as he directs him to his corner. 

                                 RAY
                        Watch the laces red. 

           Informal but visible. In the stands Wyatt gives a look to 
           Hampton. 

                                 HAMPTON
                        He knows what he’s doing. 

           The fighters circle as the next round resumes, diving into a 
           clinch. Almost instantly Ray is on them, prying them apart. A 
           moment as he stands between them, then... 

                                 RAY
                        One point deduction, Red. Lacing. 

           Navarro’s trainer cursing. Judges’ heads dipping as they make 
           note. Hampton paying attention now.

           The fight resumes. Navarro, fighting conservatively after the 
           call, throwing long arm punches. Cameron making up some 
           ground. The crowd volume rising...

           Off the momentum he over-swings, opening himself up. Navarro 
           takes advantage, drops an overhand right to the face. Cameron 
           wobbles back... 

           His knee, dipping to the mat. 

           He regains his balance. Navarro already walking toward the 
           corner, waiting for the count to start... 

           Ray just drops his hand. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Fight. 

           Confusion around the ring. Navarro’s trainer screaming. 
                                 TRAINER
                        Where’s the count? He’s down! 

           Ray stares at him a moment. Glances at the judges. 

                                 RAY
                        He’s up. Didn’t touch.

           A low RUMBLE from the crowd. The closest judge eyeing Ray 
           warily now. Even Cameron looks confused. Ray doubles down. 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Fight. 

           The fighters wade back in. The Committee talking amongst 
           themselves now. Kurt beside them, watching closely. 

           Cameron takes another hit, splashing him against the ropes. 
           The crowd screaming as Navarro roughs him up, Cameron pawing 
           blindly, his glove gripping the rope in the fray... 

           It grazes the mat.

           Ray doesn’t call it. 

           Groans in the arena. Hampton typing on his phone now. 

                                 TRAINER
                        Oh c’mon what the fuck is this!?!

           Cameron watching as Ray halts the action, letting him up. 
           Realizing what’s happening here... 

           Ray is throwing the match for him.  

           Ray pulls both fighters off the ropes. As he does Navarro 
           inadvertently knocks into his arm. Ray grimaces, pain 
           plunging the world into white noise. As it returns... 

           Navarro’s trainer yelling at him. Ray calls down --

                                 RAY
                        Stay back and shut up, or I’ll have 
                        the deputy remove you! 

           IN THE STANDS 

           Kurt looking on as they yell, seeing it unravel around he 
           ring. The crowd on high now, feeding off the drama. Judges 
           trying to narrow their focus as the fighters return from 
           their corners. 

           Graham watches Ray. He looks pale, winded, sweating now as he 
           cuts the air to start the fight.  
           Both fighters stepping out measured, gauging each other... 

           WHAM! A surgical blow from Navarro beams Cameron. His head 
           rolls, his body crashing to the mat. Undeniable.

           He’s down. 

           The crowd deafening now, blood in the water, leaping to their 
           feet. Graham leaning forward. Hampton craning his neck. 

           Ray rushes over, kneeling at side. 

           He starts the count.  

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        ...1..2..c’mon get up...

           Cameron getting his bearings, yelling something. Ray can’t 
           hear it, drowned out by the crowd. He continues:

                                 RAY (CONT'D)

           Cameron gets to a knee, calling out above the noise now:

                                 CAMERON
                        I said don’t do this!

           Ray stalls. The count has stopped. Cameron facing him. 

                                 CAMERON (CONT'D)
                        Let me do this on my own.

           Ray stares back down at him, conflicted, eyes pleading.

           But Cameron gets to his feet. The crowd cheering as they see 
           him rise. He nods at Ray. 

           He’s ready. 

           Ray stands there, the center of the ring waiting for him, the 
           room thundering around him, but he’s not hearing it. He’s 
           watching the kid in the blue shorts, already beaten to hell, 
           huffing in the corner as he waits to take it all over again.

           Ray walks to the center, holds out his hand...

           ...lets it drop. A blur as they clash.

           INT. GYMNASIUM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - LATER

           The ring has been cleared. The fight is over. 
           Ray stands in the neutral corner while across the ring the 
           Announcer leans over the ropes, conferring with a lead judge. 
           A tally coming in. They nod to Ray. 

           Ray brings the fighters to the center. Grips their wrists.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        In the center ring, our Olympic 
                        welterweight contender for the 
                        United States of America...
                             (a moment)
                        The red corner, Anthony Navarro! 

           Cheers from the stands. With great strain Ray raises 
           Navarro’s hand, masking the pain. Navarro leaps into the air, 
           starts for his corner. 

           Ray yanks him back. Over the noise...

                                 RAY
                        You shake this man’s hand. 

           Navarro quiets a moment, embarrassed, shakes with Cameron. 
           Cameron nods congratulations, goes for his gear as Navarro is 
           enveloped by his people. 

           Ray navigates his way to the edge, sees Hampton watching him 
           from the bleachers. Holding his gaze a moment. 

           Finally Hampton looks away, starts for the exit with Wyatt. 
           Settled. Neither hoping to see the other again. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey ref!

           Ray looks down on the floor. Graham at his table, his things 
           packed, an unlit cigarette bobbing in his mouth.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Good match. 

           Meaning it. He slips his hat on, disappears into the crowd. 

           Ray turns back, looking for Cameron over the fray. He catches 
           him across the gym, bag on his shoulder, walking out with 
           Kufi. As much as Ray wills it, he does not look back.

           Ray stands there in the ring as the celebration continues 
           around him. Drenched in sweat, speckled in blood, arm crooked 
           against his side. Hating himself.

                                                              FADE OUT:
           FADE IN:

           INT. OUTER OFFICE, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - WEEKS LATER

           The executive side of the campus. Olympic logo outside 
           offices and reception desks. 

           Ray sits alone in a waiting area. He looks rested, his color 
           returned, but somehow he seems older now. He’s got a blazer 
           on, one side draped over the small cast now around his arm.

           He watches the snow flurries out the window. Looks over as a 
           woman arrives, taking a seat. Late 30s. Adjusting her blazer, 
           her papers, her posture. This is AMY.

                                 RAY
                        Interview?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. You too?
                             (Ray nods)
                        Well we did all the hard stuff 
                        already. This should be the easy 
                        part right?

           Failing to convince herself, knee still bouncing. Ray 
           notices, tries taking her mind off it. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’d you run your matches? 

                                 AMY
                        Philadelphia. Eastern Qualifiers. 
                        You? 
                                 RAY
                        Here. 

           She nods. Remembering herself she leans over, offers her hand-

                                 AMY
                        Amy Seaver.

                                 RAY
                        Ray Tennyson.

                                 AMY
                        ...I know who you are. 
                             (off his look)
                        I have HBO.

           A half smile. Then, motioning to his arm.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Did you ref, or did you compete?
           Ray smirks, looks down curiously at his cast.

                                 RAY
                        ...you know I boxed for ten years, 
                        never broke more than my tooth. Now 
                        I get taken out by a patch of ice. 
                             (he grins, shrugs)
                        Should be off end of the month.
                        You? Ever a fighter? 

                                 AMY
                        Me? No. 
                             (a beat)
                        My brother was. 

           Ray looks up at this. She continues on --

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        I’m a marriage therapist, Monday 
                        through Friday anyway.
                             (a look, like she knows 
                              how that sounds)
                        Watch my patients fight though. 

                                 RAY
                        I bet you keep them in line.
                             (smiling, then)
                        They know about this? Your side 
                        gig.

           She contemplates a moment. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m not sure they’d get it. Why we 
                        do it. 
                             (then)
                        But that’s all right. For me, this 
                        job isn’t the side gig...  

           Then she leans toward him, her voice low, like it’s a trade 
           secret. 
                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        They are. 

           An innocent smile. Ray absorbs this. Suddenly --

                                 KURT (O.S.)
                        Ray.

           Kurt Redford emerging from a conference room. 

                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        We’re ready for you. 
                             (to Amy)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                                 KURT (CONT'D)
                        Amy good to see you. We’ll be with 
                        you right after. 

           Amy nods back, goes back to her papers. Ray slings his bag 
           over his shoulder, getting ready to rise. Looking over:

           Amy sitting there. Lost in her reading. Knee still bouncing.  
           Ray reaches into his blazer...

                                 RAY
                        Actually why don’t you go ahead. 

           Amy looking up as Ray digs out his phone. He clocks the 
           screen, flashes it to Kurt. He starts texting... 

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, court’s been trying to 
                        track me down. Case management 
                        teleconference, supposed to be this 
                        afternoon but, I just need to call 
                        in for a few. I’m really sorry -
                        You all get started. I mean if it 
                        makes no difference to everyone...

           Gazing up, checking with Kurt. Kurt shrugs.

                                 KURT
                        No, no we can see her now. 

                                 AMY
                             (to Ray)
                        You sure?

                                 RAY
                             (already typing again)
                        Yeah, probably better I don’t have 
                        this hanging over my head anyway.

           Amy exchanges a look with Kurt, okay then. He steps back, 
           pulling the door open for her. Ray continues on his phone.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Hey. 

           Ray looks up. Amy paused in the doorway.

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        Good luck. 

           Ray grins, nods back.  

                                 RAY
                        You too. 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Committee members rising as they walk in, Ray outside through 
           the doorway behind them, typing in his seat. 

           We stay there, Amy making the rounds in the foreground, sound 
           dropping as they float over to greet her, shaking hands. 

           One by one they take their chairs, clearing the frame... 

           As the door closes we see Ray’s chair. It’s now empty. 

           INT. APARTMENT - DAWN (NEW DAY)

           A spartan one bedroom. Weights on the floor, laundry hanging 
           over furniture. The sun starting to rise through the blinds. 

           Cameron walks through frame, brushing his teeth. He heads for 
           the kitchen, crossing a TV glowing in the corner. On screen:

           The Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games. Enclaves of 
           nations in matching sweats and suits, circling the track. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER TV)
                        ...here now we see the delegation 
                        from Morocco. Returning medalists 
                        in both men’s 800 metres and marath-

           Drowned out as Cameron starts a blender on the counter - 
           protein and wheat grass. He grabs a duffel bag, starts 
           throwing in gear around the room. 

           The ceremonies continue in the background: Silent light shows 
           and pyrotechnics. Flags waving around a stage in the center. 

           As the blender cuts off we become aware of a noise outside. 

           A car horn. 

           INT. RED SUV - IN MOTION - DAWN

           Cameron in sweats. Kufi in the driver’s seat. He flips the 
           sun visor down.

                                 KUFI
                        You got your sauna hood?

                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah in my bag. 

                                 KUFI
                        You bring your Titles or your 
                        Reeboks. 
                                 CAMERON
                        Neither. Stop crawlin’ all up my 
                        ass. I ain’t gonna need them today. 

           Kufi keeps driving. Mumbles...

                                 KUFI
                        Keep it up you ain’t gonna have a 
                        ride home. Need ‘em then. 

           Cameron looks over, then back out the window, cracks a smile. 

           EXT. HIGHSCHOOL FIELD - MORNING

           Pulling up to a football field, a track running around the 
           outside. Abandoned this early. 

           A figure waiting on the grass, in sweats of his own. Ray. 

           He sees Kufi in the parking lot, offers him a nod as Cameron 
           starts over. Kufi returns it.  

           TRACK

           As Cameron gets to him on the field. 

                                 RAY
                        Morning.

                                 CAMERON
                        Morning your honor. 

           Cameron grins. Ray watches him. Smart ass. 

                                 RAY
                        Let’s see the smirk after you run 
                        twenty. Go on.  

           Cameron sets down his bag, starts his run. Ray starts 
           walking, following after. It’s no Olympic track, pitted 
           asphalt, fading lanes... but it will do. 

           Ray starts to jog behind him... a little faster now. 

           Then, something coming over him. 

           Ray begins to run. 

                                         THE END
