           SUPER OVER BLACK: 1984

           INT. CROWN THEATER - NIGHT

           Stop Making Sense, the Talking Heads concert film, flickers on the 
           screen.

           University of Virginia STUDENTS watch from threadbare seats as 
           David Byrne dances around in his big suit.

           LIZZY HAYSOM (20), sits alone. Wrapped in an oversized London Fog 
           trench coat, she’s mesmerized by the music’s inscrutable mix of 
           melancholy and fun.

           JENS SOERING (19), black jeans and a baggy black sweater hanging 
           on his thin frame, slouches in the back row. He brushes back his 
           untidy hair and adjusts his glasses.

           Jens gets up and moves down the aisle, wanting to get closer. He 
           finds a seat near the screen and settles in.

           He glances over at Lizzy, her dirty blonde hair dimly radiant in 
           reflected light from the screen.

           EXT. CROWN THEATER - NIGHT

           It’s pouring rain.

           Sheltering under the theater’s glowing marquee, Lizzy lights a 
           cigarette to delay the soaking she’s in for.

           She takes a long drag, feeling the smoke counteract the cold 
           shiver that wants to run through her body.

           She looks over at the other side of the entryway, where Jens 
           smokes a cigarette.

           Jens feels Lizzy watching him.

           They make eye contact for the first time.

           EXT. THE VIRGINIAN - NIGHT

           Rain comes down on the brick buildings of Charlottesville’s 
           University Ave. Inviting light spills out from the windows of The 
           Virginian, an old diner with wooden booths.

           Inside, over cups of coffee and a big plate of fries, Lizzy and 
           Jens smoke cigarettes. Deep in conversation, their bodies lean 
           towards each other, drawn together as if by magnetic force.

           We can’t hear them because we’re still outside in the rain.
           INT. JENS’ DORM ROOM - DAY

           Lizzy and Jens have sex on the top bunk.

           She’s on top, contorting her body to fit in the cramped space 
           between the bed and the ceiling. It could be awkward, but instead 
           it crushes them together, intensifying their physical connection.

           INT. JENS’ DORM ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Lizzy and Jens are naked in bed.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m really good at something. Want 
                        to know what?

                                 JENS
                        Okay. What?

           He has just a hint of an unplaceable European accent.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m really good at making men fall 
                        in love with me.

                                 JENS
                        You’re really good at talking about 
                        your other boyfriends.

                                 LIZZY
                        They weren’t boys. They were men.

                                 JENS
                        I see. Men.

                                 LIZZY
                        And I wasn’t in love with them. I 
                        cast my spell and made them love 
                        me. So I could humiliate them. 
                        Fucking men. All fucking men.

                                 JENS
                        All fucking men?

                                 LIZZY
                        You’re not included. You don’t feel 
                        like a man.

                                 JENS
                        Oh, thank you.

                                 LIZZY
                        I mean that in a good way. You feel 
                        like you. You’re not a man or a 
                        woman or anything. You just...
                                 JENS
                        No, I think you’re right. I’m 
                        turning into something else. I feel 
                        like I could be... Like a different 
                        shape or a different... I’m using 
                        all these parts of my brain that I 
                        didn’t know were there, you know?

                                 LIZZY
                        I totally know. I feel it too.

                                 JENS
                        It’s like I’m really becoming 
                        myself. Like I wasn’t who I should 
                        be before and now I am. God, I feel 
                        bad for the me before I knew you. 
                        And for everyone else. I don’t 
                        think normal people feel like this.

           This makes sense to Lizzy like nothing ever has before.

                                 LIZZY
                        You’re so fucking right.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           An electric carving knife slices through juicy turkey flesh.

           It’s Thanksgiving at Loose Chippings, the suburban, colonial-
           revival home of Lizzy’s parents. It’s the kind of place with 
           carpet vacuumed so recently you can see lines in it.

           DEREK HAYSOM (early 60s) presides over the turkey on the 
           sideboard. He’s a sturdy, balding South African expatriate with 
           penetrating eyes.

           NANCY HAYSOM (early 60s), buzzes out of the kitchen with the 
           mashed potatoes. In a crisp dress, it’s like the 1950s never ended 
           for her.

           Lizzy carries in a basket of dinner rolls. With short hair and a 
           huge oxford shirt, she’s trying a new wave look.

           Jens sets the table. Nancy notices how he’s placing the knives.

                                 NANCY
                        This way, please.

           Nancy turns a knife so it faces in the opposite direction. Derek 
           unplugs his carving knife and looks over at Lizzy.

                                 DEREK
                        You’re wearing that for dinner?
                                 LIZZY
                        Uh huh.

           Nancy reaches out to feel Lizzy’s hips.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re thin. Too thin.

           Lizzy writhes away from Nancy, intercepting Derek’s platter of 
           turkey as he moves it to the table. She sets the platter on the 
           table, stealing a slice to chomp on.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                             (to Derek)
                        Isn’t she thin?

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m eating right now. Look at me. 
                        Jens, tell her I eat all the time.

                                 JENS
                        She eats all the time.

                                 DEREK
                        Young man, I can’t quite place your 
                        accent.

                                 JENS
                        I’m from Austria. Originally. But 
                        I’ve moved around a lot. We had to 
                        because of my father’s job.

                                 DEREK
                        My father moved us around too. 
                        What’s your father’s job?

                                 JENS
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t say. 
                        Honestly, I shouldn’t even be 
                        telling you that his job is secret.

                                 LIZZY
                        I think you’re supposed to say that 
                        he “works in energy.”

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, LIZZY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is girlish, with a pink bedspread and ballet slippers 
           hanging on the wall.

           Lizzy and Jens sit on her childhood desk passing a cigarette and 
           blowing the smoke out of the window.
                                 LIZZY
                        You know, I don’t know what your 
                        father actually does.

                                 JENS
                        He’s a diplomat.

           Lizzy gives him a look like, “Liar.”

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m being serious now. A low-
                        level diplomat at the German 
                        consulate in Detroit.

                                 LIZZY
                        What about Austria?

                                 JENS
                        Sometimes I say Austria because it 
                        sounds wealthier or something.

                                 LIZZY
                        What about your mom?

                                 JENS
                        She died of cancer. Long time ago.

                                 LIZZY
                        God, I didn’t know. I’m sorry.

           Jens shrugs. He notices little bruises on Lizzy’s arm.

                                 JENS
                             (taking up her arm)
                        What’s this?

           A knock comes at the door.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Time to go to your own room, Jens.

                                 LIZZY
                             (whispering in Jens’ ear)
                        She’s afraid we might fuck if you 
                        stay in here.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, GUEST ROOM - MORNING

           Morning sun streaks in. Jens is curled up in bed.

           He would still be asleep, but coming from somewhere is a faint, 
           nerve-jangling sound of hammering.
           I/E. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, GARAGE/DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Lizzy hammers a nail into the desk she’s 
           building.

           WHACK! WHACK! Her hammering is violent, angry.

           WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! It feels like she might hurt herself.

           Jens walks through the garage to where Lizzy is working in the 
           driveway. She doesn’t look up.

                                 LIZZY
                        My father needs a desk for his 
                        computer.

                                 JENS
                        Can I help?

           Lizzy gets a nail lined up. WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

                                 LIZZY
                        He says the juniper extract they 
                        use in gin is a poison. It’s like 
                        speed.

           Jens doesn’t know what to make of this.

           WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! She drives in another nail. Jens decides to 
           leave her alone.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy, a tumbler of something that looks like gin in her hand, 
           tends the fireplace with a poker.

           Jens walks in, exchanging a guarded, fleeting look with her.

           Nancy knocks back a gulp from whatever is in her glass as she 
           watches Jens leave the room.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A door stands slightly ajar.

           Jens looks down the hall towards the living room. No sign of Nancy 
           or anyone else heading in this direction.

           He pushes the door open.

           Inside is a kind of artist’s studio. There are paints and brushes 
           and painted canvases leaning against the wall.
           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, ART STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Jens examines the amateurish paintings, all signed by Nancy 
           Haysom.

           A forest.

           A foot in a ballet slipper.

           A nude woman’s torso. Or is it a girl’s torso?

           A stack of Polaroids catches Jens’ attention. He picks it up.

           He flips through flowers and landscapes.

           Then: a fifteen-year-old Lizzy sitting nude on a stool.

           What the fuck?

           A dull thud, like something heavy dropping, comes from somewhere 
           in the house.

           I/E. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, GARAGE/DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

           Lizzy sucks at her bleeding finger.

           Looking around the garage for something to stop the flow, she 
           opens the bottom drawer of an old armoire. She finds some cut up 
           bits of t-shirts.

           As she wraps a strip around her finger, she notices something at 
           the bottom of the drawer.

           She clears away the t-shirt scraps and finds an old Frederick’s of 
           Hollywood box. On it, there’s an illustration of an alluring woman 
           from the 1960s.

           EXT. KEMPER STREET STATION - NIGHT

           Fog hangs in the air. Yellow haloes ooze from streetlights.

           Derek pulls his Buick into the parking lot.

           Jens and Lizzy rush to grab their luggage from the trunk.

           Nancy hovers nearby.

                                 NANCY
                        Before you go, I want to tell you 
                        how much we love you. I don’t know 
                        if we say that as much we should.

                                 LIZZY
                        We have to go.
           Nancy kisses Lizzy on the cheek.

           Derek presses a twenty dollar bill into her hand. Lizzy kisses him 
           on the cheek and drags Jens away.

           They trudge through the fog together, approaching the old brick 
           station.

           Jens looks behind him, but Lizzy’s parents have already been 
           swallowed up by the fog.

           SUPER OVER BLACK: 1985

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           A bright spring day. Tulips in bloom. Birds chirping.

           MABEL, CAROL, and LOUISE (all 60s), walk down the street towards 
           Loose Chippings.

           Derek’s Buick is in the driveway.

           The porch light is on.

           EXT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - MOMENTS LATER

           Mabel presses the doorbell.

                                 CAROL
                        They never do leave the porch light 
                        on during the day unless they’re 
                        not coming home until after dark. 
                        But that doesn’t make sense because 
                        this is our day for bridge. They 
                        never forget about bridge.

                                 LOUISE
                        And their car is here.

           Mabel presses the doorbell again.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - SAME TIME

           The doorbell rings.

           Everything is vacuumed and scrubbed and in its place.

           Except for a splatter of blood on the living room carpet.
           EXT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - SAME TIME

           Carol rifles through her purse.

                                 CAROL
                        He gave it to me for emergencies 
                        and I put it in the little zipper 
                        pocket. Unless that was my other 
                        purse...

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - SAME TIME

           The voices coming from outside sound distant.

           Derek Haysom lies in a pool of blood on the dining room floor. 
           He’s been stabbed dozens of times.

           In the kitchen, Nancy Haysom is sprawled out in a glistening red 
           slick of gore. Her throat has been slashed.

           The violence done here is overwhelming, sickening.

           The sound of a key turning intrudes on the silence.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, KITCHEN - DAY

           The bodies have been taken away. Everything else remains.

           REESE REZEK (30s) crouches on the periphery, pulling on white 
           gloves. Though dressed in an unassuming blazer and jeans, she has 
           an unnerving edge. Like there’s a spring coiled up inside her.

           She gets up and looks around the kitchen.

           There’s a cake on the counter. And a bowl of lumpy white liquid. 
           Maybe whipped cream that was left out.

           Reese pulls a couple knives out of the knife block. They’re 
           spotless.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, ART STUDIO - DAY

           Reese takes in Nancy’s bland, badly done forests and innocuous 
           ballet slippers. Do they have a menacing energy? Why should they?

           Reese notices a cluster of Polaroids, facedown on the floor.

           Crouching, Reese is about to flip them over when she hears voices 
           coming from the front of the house.
           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           DANTE HERNÁNDEZ (early 30s), Reese’s partner, wears a suit, but no 
           tie. In contrast to Reese, he’s at ease in his body.

           DAVE MCLEOD (50s) is an easygoing Bedford County sheriff.

           Reese walks in.

                                 DANTE
                        My colleague, Detective Rezek.

           Reese takes one glove off to shake hands with McLeod.

                                 MCLEOD
                        Dave McLeod. I was just telling 
                        your partner how glad we are to 
                        have some city cops up here with 
                        real experience. I mean, we’ve had 
                        a couple homicides in the county 
                        before, but nothing like this.

                                 REESE
                        Hm. Hey, what’s this place called?

                                 MCLEOD
                        Called?

                                 REESE
                        I saw a name outside. Like it was 
                        an English country manor.

                                 MCLEOD
                        Oh, yeah. Loose Chippings.

                                 REESE
                        Loose Chippings. What’s that mean, 
                        you think?

                                 DANTE
                        I was about to ask if the family’s 
                        been informed.

                                 MCLEOD
                        Right. Okay. We’ve been in touch 
                        with the daughter...

           He takes out a notepad and consults it.

                                 MCLEOD (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth. She’s up at UVA. I 
                        talked to her myself. I mean, over 
                        the phone. That was the hardest 
                        part of the whole thing.
           As they talk, Reese looks at the sticky, half-dried blood where 
           Derek’s body used to be. In the blood is a partial tennis shoe 
           print and a smeared sockprint.

                                 DANTE
                        Other family?

                                 MCLEOD
                        Nobody close.

                                 REESE
                        When is she coming up here?

                                 MCLEOD
                        Who? Oh, the daughter? Well, I 
                        didn’t ask her that. I guess I 
                        didn’t think it was the right 
                        moment, if you know what I mean. I 
                        mean, the neighbors ID’d the bodies 
                        so, in the circumstances, I didn’t 
                        think we needed her right now.

                                 REESE
                        In the circumstances, we need her 
                        as soon as possible.

           McLeod writes this down, nodding as if to say, “See, this is why 
           you guys are here.”

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        And see if she has a boyfriend.

                                 MCLEOD
                        Boyfriend?

                                 REESE
                        Or girlfriend. Anyone like that.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Sounds of children at recess drift in from outside.

           Reese, Dante, and McLeod clear away child-sized desks, 
           consolidating them into one corner.

           SIERRA (19) knocks on the glass of the classroom door. You can 
           tell she usually has a goth look, but she’s awkwardly trying to 
           appear strait-laced for her police interview.

           Reese gives her a sign like, “Wait just a minute.”

                                 REESE
                             (to McLeod)
                        Who’s that?
                                 MCLEOD
                        That’ll be the girl who called us 
                        up. Far as I understand, she’s a 
                        friend of Lizzy Haysom. Anyway, 
                        seems she’s eager to tell us a 
                        story. Something about Christmas.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           [We’ve gone back a few months in the past. It’s December, 1985.]

           A Christmas party is in progress. Teenagers smoke joints and dance 
           to “Sensation” by Bryan Ferry.

           Sierra has black lipstick and a Cocteau Twins shirt. She’s waiting 
           for the bathroom.

           The bathroom door opens and Lizzy steps out, but freezes when she 
           spots Sierra.

           Before Sierra knows what’s happening, Lizzy pulls her into the 
           bathroom.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lizzy locks the door behind them.

                                 SIERRA
                        I can’t do anything. My boyfriend’s 
                        here.

                                 LIZZY
                        Look. Look, look, look.

           Lizzy wraps her arm around Sierra’s waist and directs her 
           attention to the mirror, where they make eye contact.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        What do you see?

           Sierra is stumped by this question.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        I’m the devil. You’re the one with 
                        black fucking lipstick, but I’m the 
                        devil. And that makes you...
                             (dramatically whispering)
                        The sacrificial lamb.

           Lizzy breaks eye contact in the mirror and looks to real-life 
           Sierra.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        Boo!!!
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           [We’re back in the present.]

           Dante has a video camera going. He and McLeod interview Sierra.

           Reese sits off to the side, listening intently.

                                 DANTE
                        So you did have... relations with 
                        Miss Haysom?

                                 SIERRA
                        It was just the one time. I mean, I 
                        hardly knew her. But I just thought 
                        when I heard about, you know, that 
                        I should tell you about what she 
                        said to me.

                                 REESE
                        Sorry to jump in here, but I’m kind 
                        of a music fan. “Sensation” is a 
                        great song, but I don’t think it 
                        was out yet last Christmas.

                                 SIERRA
                        Maybe it wasn’t “Sensation” then. 
                        Maybe it was something else. But I 
                        really thought I remembered it. I 
                        mean, it’s a big part of the 
                        memory. But it’s not important, is 
                        it?

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY, LATER

           Dante puts a new tape in the video camera.

           The classroom door is open like someone is expected to arrive at 
           any moment.

           Reese catches Dante’s eye as McLeod leads Jens into the room.

           Jens looks around. He has a bandage wrapped around his hand.

                                 JENS
                        Should I sit?

           No waver in his voice. For someone about to talk to the police, 
           he’s very confident. Almost weirdly so.

                                 MCLEOD
                        Right here.

           McLeod indicates a child’s desk/chair. Jens sits.
                                 MCLEOD (CONT’D)
                        These are detectives Hernández and 
                        Rezek. They’re up from Roanoke to 
                        give us a hand. They’ll be asking 
                        most of the questions.

                                 JENS
                        Oh. Well, I have to tell you, I’m 
                        happy to answer anything you want, 
                        but I don’t know how I can help. I 
                        mean, I want to help, but the main 
                        thing I’m worried about is Lizzy.

                                 DANTE
                        How’s she doing?

                                 JENS
                        Honestly... She’s in bad shape. 
                        Critical condition, emotionally.

                                 DANTE
                        That’s why we’re glad you’re here. 
                        Maybe you can just lay everything 
                        out for us.

                                 JENS
                        Everything what?

                                 DANTE
                        About last weekend. It’s like this: 
                        Something you don’t even know you 
                        know could be important. So all you 
                        need to do is take us through and 
                        let us do the work.

           Jens knows this friendly attitude is bullshit. Reese glances at 
           his bandaged hand.

                                 REESE
                        Just start at the beginning. Start 
                        with renting the car.

           EXT. HERTZ LOT - DAY

           [We’ve moved back in time to see events of the previous weekend 
           play out according to Jens.]

           A hail storm is in progress. The sky is so dark that the yellow 
           Hertz sign glows like it’s twilight.

           Jens and Lizzy dash through the onslaught towards a gray Chevette. 
           They pile in and slam the doors behind them.
           INT. CHEVETTE - DAY

           They inch along in excruciating Washington, D.C. traffic.

           Suddenly, Jens peels out of traffic, onto the shoulder.

                                 LIZZY
                             (shouting with joy)
                        Oh my god, what are you doing?

           He zooms past all the suckers and swerves onto an exit ramp.

           He slams on the brakes as they come up behind a truck.

                                 JENS
                        I’m getting us out of traffic.

           INT. MACARTHUR THEATER - NIGHT

           The opening credits of Porky’s Revenge! play over a bawdy 
           graduation scene.

           Lizzy sits down next to Jens with a pack of Red Vines.

           Onscreen, a guy gets a boner under his graduation robe.

                                 LIZZY
                        Look at this fucking guy. This guy 
                        is every piece of shit I’ve ever 
                        dated.

           A MAN IN A BLUE SUIT turns around to shush them. As soon as he 
           turns back, Jens gives him the finger.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        That was Bush!

                                 JENS
                        What?

                                 LIZZY
                        George Bush! I’m telling you.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           [We’re back in the present.]

           Reese watches Jens closely, looking for signs of stress, but his 
           body is at ease.

                                 DANTE
                        Hang on, what time was the movie?
                                 JENS
                        I don’t know. Pretty late. But I 
                        know it was over before midnight 
                        because we stuck around for Rocky 
                        Horror after that.

                                 DANTE
                        What’d you do between getting to 
                        D.C. and going to the movies?

                                 JENS
                        Yeah, the thing is, it’s kind of 
                        personal.

           FLASH: Lizzy sticks her tongue in Jens’ mouth.

           Jens recrosses his legs, resting his bandaged hand in plain view.

                                 REESE
                        Hey, what happened to your hand?

           Jens looks at his hand like he didn’t remember anything happened 
           to it.

           He turns to Reese, making real eye contact with her.

                                 JENS
                        I hurt it yesterday. I’m auditing 
                        this machine tech class and... 
                        Well, I guess that’s why I’m not 
                        going to be a machinist.

           INT. BLUE RIDGE ARMS, REESE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Reese kicks the door closed behind her.

           She turns on the lamp and opens her suitcase.

           She takes out a small framed picture and sets it up on the bedside 
           table.

           The picture is of a man in a police lieutenant’s uniform. It’s in 
           black and white and looks pretty old.

           Next, she gets out a little tape player. She sets it next to the 
           picture and presses play.

           Sade’s Promise comes on.

           Reese slips her shoes off and collapses on the bed.

           She lets her head sink into the pillows and closes her eyes for 
           just a second.
           INT. BLUE RIDGE ARMS, REESE’S ROOM - NIGHT, LATER

           KNOCK! KNOCK! Someone’s at the door.

           Reese wakes up, but takes a second to remember where she is.

           KNOCK! KNOCK!

           Reese gets up and staggers to the door. She looks through the 
           peephole and then opens up.

           Standing on the other side, Dante holds up a folder.

                                 DANTE
                        Forensics.

           Reese makes way to let him in. Dante hands her the folder.

           Reese sits on the bed and opens the folder. Dante pulls a chair 
           over so he can see what she’s looking at.

                                 REESE
                             (scanning over the pages)
                        Three blood types.

           She flips through a few pages. Dante notices the little framed 
           photo on the bedside table.

                                 DANTE
                        Who’s this guy?

                                 REESE
                        My dad.

                                 DANTE
                        You bring this everywhere?

                        Jesus.

                                 DANTE
                        What?

                                 REESE
                        Look at this blood alcohol on the 
                        Haysoms. You see this?

           She hands him the page.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        See that? What’s that tell us?

                                 DANTE
                        They had a hell of a party.
                                 REESE
                        Yeah...

                                 DANTE
                        Okay. What do you think?

                                 REESE
                        I think... I think regardless of a 
                        “critical emotional condition,” we 
                        need to talk to Elizabeth Haysom.

           I/E. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PARKING LOT/CLASSROOM - DAY

           A cab pulls up and drops Lizzy off.

           She walks towards the front doors of the school, but stops, 
           looking unsure.

           In the classroom, Reese knocks on the window to catch her 
           attention.

           Through wavy glass, Reese and Lizzy make eye contact for the first 
           time.

           Reese makes a hand gesture like, “Come inside and go around to the 
           right to find us.”

           Lizzy nods and disappears into the building.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Reese looks down the empty corridor.

           She hears footsteps approaching before she sees Lizzy come around 
           the corner and walk towards her.

                                 REESE
                        You’re late.

           Lizzy comes to a stop in front of Reese. They’re near the open 
           classroom door, but it feels like they’re alone.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Detective Rezek. You’ll meet my 
                        colleagues in second.

                                 LIZZY
                        Okay.

                                 REESE
                        How are you holding up?

           Lizzy shrugs.
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           We see Lizzy from the perspective of Dante’s video camera. The low 
           quality sound and image is unsettling, ghostly.

                                 DANTE (O.S.)
                        Tell us about your weekend in D.C.

           Lizzy shifts in her seat.

                                 LIZZY
                        Didn’t Jens tell you?

                                 REESE (O.S.)
                        We want to hear it from you.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m sorry... I’m just still... This 
                        is really hard for me.

                                 REESE (O.S.)
                        If it wasn’t important, we wouldn’t 
                        put you through this.

           Lizzy chews on that, trying to steady herself.

                                 LIZZY
                        Well, okay... We just drove up and 
                        goofed off. Fooled around in a 
                        hotel room and...

                                 REESE (O.S.)
                        Tell us about the hotel room.

           Lizzy crinkles her nose.

                                 LIZZY
                        Do you guys get off on hearing that 
                        kind of stuff?

                                 REESE (O.S.)
                        We’re not looking for details. Just 
                        how long you were there. Anything 
                        unusual you might remember.

           Lizzy thinks about it. Is she deciding on details of a story? 
           Wondering what Jens said?

           FLASH: The bristles of a Wite-Out brush streak along the surface 
           of a blurry Polaroid.

                                 LIZZY
                        Well, first we went to this 
                        restaurant.
           INT. THE BRANCH LINE - NIGHT

           [It’s the previous weekend. We’re seeing events according to 
           Lizzy.]

           The place is jam-packed with train memorabilia. The centerpiece is 
           a real caboose.

           Lizzy and Jens are in a booth.

           The cover of the menus features an absurdly phallic train rushing 
           into a comically vaginal tunnel.

                                 JENS
                             (holding up his menu)
                        Remind you of anything?

           INT. GEORGETOWN MARRIOTT, ROOM 1017 - NIGHT

           Jens flips cable channels. Lizzy peeks out from the bathroom.

                                 LIZZY
                        Ready?

                                 JENS
                        I still don’t know what I’m 
                        supposed to be ready for.

           Lizzy steps out of the bathroom. She’s wearing a 1960s Frederick’s 
           of Hollywood lingerie set in sheer blue and lace.

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 LIZZY
                        I think it was my mother’s from the 
                        ‘60s. Or it could have been my 
                        father’s. I mean, isn’t it fucking 
                        funny? Funny, but also strangely 
                        making you want to fuck?

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           [We’re back in the present.]

                                 LIZZY
                        After that we went to see a movie. 
                        Police Academy. The second one.

                                 REESE
                        You’re sure it wasn’t Porky’s?
                                 LIZZY
                        You mean Porky’s Revenge? Is that 
                        was Jens said?

           Lizzy looks around for confirmation. Nobody gives her anything.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        No, you’re right. It was Porky’s. 
                        We saw Police Academy in 
                        Charlottesville. I mean, we see a 
                        lot of movies. So anyway, after 
                        Porky’s we saw Rocky Horror. At 
                        midnight.

           Dante let’s it hang for a second before moving on.

                                 DANTE
                        What’d you do the rest of the 
                        weekend?

           FLASH: Lizzy wraps her wet hair in a towel.

                                 LIZZY
                        I remember I took a bath. I love 
                        taking baths in hotel rooms. And 
                        then we drove back Sunday morning.

                                 DANTE
                        That’s it?

                                 LIZZY
                             (sarcastically)
                        Oh wait. This is important. As we 
                        were leaving, we stopped at Beenie 
                        Weenie. I had a hot dog. No chili.

           Silence. Then rustling of papers.

                                 REESE
                        So we’ve actually been in touch 
                        with Hertz. And according to them 
                        the car... Gray Chevette, right?

                                 LIZZY
                        I guess so. I don’t really remember 
                        what car it was.

                                 REESE
                        Well, that’s what I have here. Gray 
                        Chevette. Anyway, according to 
                        them, it was driven 669 miles. 
                        That’s about four hundred miles 
                        more than a trip to D.C. would 
                        take.

           Reese pauses, but Lizzy doesn’t jump in with a response.
                                 REESE(CONT’D)
                        Actually though, 669 miles is just 
                        about right for Charlottesville to 
                        D.C. to your folks place and back.

                                 LIZZY
                             (after a moment)
                        I mean, they could be wrong about 
                        those kind of things. Rental car 
                        companies are a total scam, right?

                                 REESE
                        Right...

                                 LIZZY
                        We did get lost. I remember that. 
                        But not four hundred miles lost. 
                        You should talk to Jens about it.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WOMEN’S RESTROOM - DAY

           Reese finishes washing her hands, but leaves the water running.

           A stall door opens and Lizzy steps out. Reese turns the water off 
           as if she just finished with it.

                                 REESE
                        I could give you a ride back to 
                        Charlottesville.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’ll take a cab.

                                 REESE
                        That’s a pretty expensive ride. 
                        Come on, I’ll take you back.

                                 LIZZY
                        Is that allowed?

                                 REESE
                        Sure. Why not?

           INT. PLYMOUTH - DAY

           Reese drives a police-issue Plymouth.

           Lizzy pointedly stares away from Reese.

                                 LIZZY
                        So I know you coppers don’t drive 
                        your real cars. What do you really 
                        drive? Can I guess?
           Reese glances over at her.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        Shitty little Volkswagen Rabbit, 
                        I’ll bet you anything.

                                 REESE
                        So Jens... He’s been helping you 
                        through all this?

                                 LIZZY
                        Is this still part of the official 
                        interview? I mean, whatever I say 
                        can and will be used against me, 
                        right?

                                 REESE
                        Only if you have something to hide.

           Lizzy smirks. Reese ignores it.

                        So, let’s see, if you and Jens have 
                        been together since October, that 
                        makes it... six months more or 
                        less. That’s a long time at your 
                        age.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m not young. I mean, I don’t care 
                        about age. Like, how about how long 
                        have you and your partner been 
                        together? I guess a year maybe 
                        because you like each other, but 
                        you haven’t... Have you?

           Lizzy rests her chin on her hand, making a show of leering 
           interest. Glancing over, Reese notices Wite-Out painted on one 
           fingernail.

                                 REESE
                        Run out of nail polish?

           It takes Lizzy a second to figure out what Reese is talking about. 
           Then she looks at her nail.

                                 LIZZY
                        Oh, it’s my brand. It’s called Wite-
                        Out. W-I-T-E-O-U-T. Madonna does 
                        it. I do it. You should try it.

                                 REESE
                        If you’re trying to make me sorry I 
                        offered you a ride...
                                 LIZZY
                        Is it working?

           INT. UVA MACHINE SHOP - DAY

           A saw blade rips through a piece of wood. STUDENTS work at various 
           machines.

           The professor, MR. DOUGDALE, leads Reese towards a band saw that 
           looks like it’s from the WPA era.

                                 DOUGDALE
                             (yelling over the noise)
                        Happened at this machine.

                                 REESE
                        It doesn’t have an automatic shut 
                        off or--

                                 DOUGDALE
                        No, no, these are your basic good 
                        old dangerous type machines. But I 
                        still don’t know how he did it.

                                 REESE
                        When he came in on Monday, could 
                        his hand have already been injured?

                                 DOUGDALE
                        You mean, somehow that’s what 
                        caused the accident?

           Reese steers Dougdale away from his students.

                                 REESE
                        Could Jens have done it on purpose?

           Dougdale shakes his head like, “No way.”

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I know you can’t really believe it, 
                        but--

                                 DOUGDALE
                        Honestly, I have no idea what any 
                        of these kids have going on in 
                        their heads. So...

           He shrugs.

           INT. CAPTAIN ELLIS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Lizzy’s interview plays on a television.
                                 LIZZY
                        We did get lost. I remember that. 
                        But not four hundred miles lost. 
                        You should talk to Jens about it.

           Dante pauses the tape. Lizzy’s frozen image jitters on the screen.

           Reese turns to CAPTAIN ELLIS, an avuncular man with graying hair.

                                 REESE
                        We’re talking to the boyfriend 
                        again tomorrow. And I want to have 
                        his hand examined.

                                 ELLIS
                        Where’s that put us? Is he your 
                        suspect? You’re not telling me the 
                        daughter’s a suspect, are you?

                                 DANTE
                        We’re also looking into some other 
                        stabbings along the 81 corridor. 
                        Seeing if there could be a 
                        connection, but...

                                 REESE
                        Derek Haysom was stabbed to death. 
                        When he died, his attacker kept 
                        stabbing him. More than thirty 
                        times in all. Nancy Haysom was 
                        stabbed at least six times. Her 
                        throat was cut. We have no forced 
                        entry. No robbery.

                                 ELLIS
                        So.

                                 REESE
                        So we’re looking for someone close 
                        to the Haysoms. And as far as we 
                        can tell there’s aren’t a hell of a 
                        lot of options. Now, do I think a 
                        suburban, all-American girl like 
                        Elizabeth Haysom could do something 
                        like that? Do I think he boyfriend 
                        might have done it? Well, it 
                        doesn’t sound very likely, but--

                                 ELLIS
                        You sold me, it doesn’t sound very 
                        likely.

           But hearing Ellis say it, Reese knows he’s wrong.

                                 REESE
                        They’re going to bolt.

           EXT. UVA DORMS - DAY

           Three cars pull up in front of the dorms: a CAMPUS POLICEMAN in 
           his cruiser, McLeod in his Sheriff’s Department SUV, Reese and 
           Dante in their police-issue Plymouth.

           INT. JENS’ DORM ROOM - DAY

           McLeod opens dresser drawers. Dante checks the wastebasket. 

                                 MCLEOD
                        Clothes are gone.

           Reese picks up a note on the desk.

                                 DANTE
                             (to Reese)
                        What is that?

                                 REESE
                        He left us a note. Shit. Wait, pick 
                        up the phone. Hit redial.

           Dante picks up the phone and presses the redial button. After a 
           ring, someone picks up.

                                 AMTRAK AGENT (V.O.)
                             (over the phone)
                        Tracks are back. This is Amtrak, 
                        how can I help you?

           INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY

           The train is stopped at Charlottesville’s Union Station. 

           PASSENGERS check their watches, waiting for the train to close its 
           doors and get going.

           Reese gets on at the back, a walkie-talkie in hand.

                                 REESE
                             (into the walkie)

                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                             (over the walkie)
                        Me too. See anything?
           Reese looks out the window into a train on the opposite track 
           where she sees Dante searching for Lizzy and Jens.

                                 REESE
                        Nothing yet.

                                 MCLEOD (V.O.)
                             (over the walkie)
                        Nothing in the station.

           Reese makes her way through the coach car, looking at faces.

           She gets to the end of the car and goes through the door.

           She checks the bathroom. Nothing.

           She leans out the open door to the platform, looking along the 
           side of the train. The STATION DISPATCHER blows his whistle.

           Reese ducks back into the train.

                                 STATION DISPATCHER (O.S.)
                        All aboard, all aboard!

           Reese moves to the next car. She looks at faces, quickly and 
           methodically.

           She freezes.

           She’s right behind Lizzy and Jens. They’re in a seat facing away 
           from her.

           They haven’t seen her.

           Reese slides into the empty seat behind them.

           The train lurches and begins to move.

           Reese looks to the other train, where Dante brings his walkie to 
           his mouth. Moving fast, she turns hers off before Dante’s voice 
           comes through.

                                 LIZZY (O.S.)
                        I feel like I should be nervous. 
                        Like in a movie waiting for a plane 
                        to take off and the Nazis are after 
                        you.

           Just inches behind them, Reese listens.

                                 JENS (O.S.)
                        Don’t be nervous.
                                 LIZZY (O.S.)
                        I’m not. It’s like I know this path 
                        and it’s dark, but I’m so sure 
                        where I’m going, it doesn’t matter.

                                 JENS (O.S.)
                        Like our brains are ready for it.

                                 LIZZY (O.S.)
                        Yes. Oh my god, It’s sick how much 
                        I love you.

           GERALD, the ticket collector, steps onto the back of the car.

                                 GERALD
                        Tickets, please! Tickets out!

           Reese hears the clicks of Gerald punching tickets behind her. She 
           pulls out a notepad and scrawls something down.

           As Gerald approaches, she gets out her badge and puts a finger 
           over her mouth. He’s puzzled, but understands that he’s supposed 
           to keep quiet.

           Reese shows him the note. It says, “Where are they going?” An 
           arrow points at the seat in front of her.

           Gerlald nods. Moving on, he takes tickets from Lizzy and punches 
           them.

                                 GERALD (CONT’D)
                        Alexandria. You kids going to the 
                        Washington Memorial?

           EXT. ALEXANDRIA UNION STATION, PLATFORM - DAY

           Lizzy and Jens disembark from the train with dozens of other 
           passengers.

           Reese slips off behind them. She spots LIEUTENANT HARDING, a 
           uniformed Alexandria policeman. She jogs up to him holding her 
           badge.

                                 LIEUTENANT HARDING
                        Lieutenant Harding. You’re Rezek?

                                 REESE
                        That’s me. Come on. Let’s pick 
                        these guys up. You got the doors 
                        covered?

                                 LIEUTENANT HARDING
                        Just like you said.
           They weave through knots of slow-moving travelers, losing sight of 
           Lizzy and Jens as they duck inside.

           The walkie on Harding’s belt crackles.

                                 ALEXANDRIA POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                             (over the walkie)
                        Nothing at south door, over.

           INT. ALEXANDRIA UNION STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s very busy. Jens hustles Lizzy around a luggage cart.

                                 JENS
                        Don’t look behind you.

                                 LIZZY
                        What?

           Jens yanks them into a luggage room off to the side.

           Across the lobby, Reese hasn’t spotted them.

                                 REESE
                             (into her walkie)
                        Does someone have them?

                                 ALEXANDRIA POLICEMAN (V.O.)
                        Still nothing here, over.

           Reese picks an exit door and heads for it.

                                 CAPTAIN KNOX (V.O.)
                             (over the walkie)
                        This is Captain Knox, Alexandria 
                        Transit PD. Everyone stand down. 
                        Repeat, stand down.

           Reese spots CAPTAIN KNOX near the door with two OFFICERS.

                                 REESE
                        Hey! I’ve got fugitives here.

                                 CAPTAIN KNOX
                        Okay, listen up sweetie, this is my 
                        jurisdiction. A busy transit hub. 
                        Now, I don’t know who you are, but 
                        I certainly can’t have you running 
                        all over my--

                                 REESE
                        I radioed from the train. I spoke 
                        with--
                                 LIEUTENANT HARDING
                        Sir, she spoke with me.

                                 CAPTAIN KNOX
                        That’s nice, but we’ve got a 
                        process here. Last time I checked, 
                        you’re city, I’m transit so--

           Reese turns away from Knox. She looks around the station is 
           desperation. Could they still be here? Where the fuck are they?

                                 CAPTAIN KNOX (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you walk away from me. Hey!

           Jens and Elizabeth risk a peek out from the luggage room. Seeing 
           Reese distracted by Captain Knox, they make a dash for a side 
           door.

           EXT. ALEXANDRIA UNION STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jens and Elizabeth pile into a taxi.

                                 JENS
                        Dulles.

           The DRIVER nods. The taxi pulls away.

                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                             (reading from Jens’ note)
                        “Dear Officers Rezek and 
                        Hernández...”

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Reese unlocks the door of the police evidence warehouse.

                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                        “I assume you will be very excited 
                        by now and get all the wrong 
                        ideas.”

           - Reese and Dante file evidence boxes in rolling stacks.

                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                        “My advice is to continue your 
                        investigation as before; 
                        undoubtedly you will find whom you 
                        are looking for.”

           - Reese parks her Volkswagen Rabbit in her driveway. She turns the 
           engine off, but doesn’t get out.
                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                        “As for me? From what Liz has told 
                        me of what you discovered at her 
                        parents’ house, I can only say that 
                        I am incapable of such a thing.”

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Really, it’s a converted garage. A kitchenette/living/dining room 
           all in one.

           Two framed boxing posters lean against the wall.

           Dante sits at the table reading aloud from Jens’ note (which is 
           sealed in a Ziploc evidence bag).

                                 DANTE
                        “You will have to take my word for 
                        it. We are not coming back. Jens.”

           He puts down the note. Reese brings over a pizza box and gets 
           beers out of the fridge.

                                 REESE
                        You believe him that time?

                                 DANTE
                        This is a twenty-year-old kid we’re 
                        talking about. He’s just trying to 
                        fuck with us.

           Dante holds his beer up to “cheers.”

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        To getting fucked with.

           Reese clinks, but she’s not happy.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        Nobody thinks this is our fault.

           Dante opens the pizza box and takes a slice.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        And you get to say, I told you so.

           INT. ROANOKE POLICE DEPARTMENT, DETECTIVES BULLPEN - DAY

           FIELDING, a brash detective with a full head of hair, pours 
           himself a cup of coffee. Reese waits for her turn.
           Fielding reaches out and touches Reese’s arm.

                                 FIELDING
                        How do you take it?

                                 REESE
                        Thanks Fielding, I’ll get my own.

           Fielding watches Reese pour herself a cup.

                                 FIELDING
                        I don’t think it would set the 
                        women’s movement back too far if 
                        you let me pour you--

                                 REESE
                        I just like to get my own.

           Fielding leans in, confidentially.

                                 FIELDING
                        Just to let you know, that shirt 
                        shows a lot.

           She involuntarily glances at her shirt. Can he see my bra? Or--

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        I just thought you should know. So, 
                        you know, just in case you care.

           Turning away, he makes a face like, “Sorry to break it to you.”

           Reese goes to her paper strewn desk. It’s a normal shirt. Why 
           would he say that?

           She sets down the coffee next to the picture of her father. Before 
           she can do anything else, Captain Ellis spots her through his 
           office window.

           He motions her over.

           Reese grabs her blazer from the back of her desk chair.

           INT. CAPTAIN ELLIS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Reese steps in, still getting her blazer situated.

                                 REESE
                        I’ll have our report on your desk 
                        by the end of the day.

                                 ELLIS
                        That’s not what I wanted to talk 
                        about.
           Now Reese is worried. She sits down.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        You know we’re taking some heat on 
                        this. In the press. From the higher-
                        ups.

           Ellis studies her. Reese starts wondering if she’s supposed to say 
           something.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Have you heard about this joint 
                        task force we’re putting together 
                        with the DEA?

           Reese isn’t following.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting ahead of myself. What 
                        I’m saying is, I’m transferring you 
                        to that task force. You’ll be in 
                        the field and you’ll serve as my 
                        liaison officer.

           It takes her a second to realize, but this is a demotion. Bullshit 
           work.

                                 REESE
                        To get me out of sight.

                                 ELLIS
                        Yes, if you want the truth.

                                 REESE
                        As punishment for being right.

                                 ELLIS
                        No, not as punishment. Don’t think 
                        of it like that. They bolted and 
                        you warned me. And those transit 
                        cops fucked us.

                                 REESE
                        Right. They fucked us. If they had 
                        cooperated--

                                 ELLIS
                        Okay. We both know that. But how it 
                        looks... Part of my job is to 
                        manage that.

                                 REESE
                        Just tell the truth.
                                 ELLIS
                        They wanted me to let you go, okay? 
                        I told them the truth, but the way 
                        they see it is you fucked this up.

           That hits Reese hard.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        So this DEA thing was my last 
                        option. I know you’re pissed, but 
                        please just keep your head down.

           INT. EUROPCAR OFFICE (CHARLES DE GAULLE LOCATION) - DAY

           Jens and Lizzy stand at the counter. CEDRIC, the Europcar manager, 
           tries to explain something.

                                 CEDRIC
                        Yes, but there is a problem. Even 
                        if you pay cash, we need a credit 
                        card on file.

           Jens digs in his wallet and comes up with a credit card.

                                 JENS
                        How’s this? This is my mother’s 
                        card, but I’m able to sign for it.

           EXT. EUROPCAR LOT - DAY

           Lizzy watches a jet fly directly overhead.

           Jens opens the trunk of a yellow Saab and throws in their luggage.

                                 LIZZY
                        Isn’t your mother dead? You told me 
                        she died of cancer.

           Jens looks over at her guiltily.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        She’s not dead?

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Reese puts on bright red lipstick and thick black eyeliner.

           - A DEA AGENT tapes a wire and microphone to Reese’s chest. He 
           runs the wire up and over her shoulder.

           - DEA AGENTS in a van listen to Reese in conversation with a SMALL-
           TIME COKE DEALER.
           - Reese (surprisingly believable as a hardcore punk girl in ripped 
           tights and an oversized Bad Brains shirt) scores coke in the 
           graffitied bathroom of a bar.

           - In a strip mall parking lot, Reese scores coke from an 
           INTIMIDATING DEALER in a run-down tour van.

           - Reese, in her punk getup, rides up in a rickety, caged elevator. 
           It jolts to a stop on the third floor of an apartment building.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING 3RD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Thumping sounds of an obscure hardcore band come from apartment 
           3C.

           Reese takes a focusing breath and bangs on the door.

           She cocks her ear as she waits for an answer, but can’t hear 
           anything except music.

           She bangs on the door again.

           LANCE SLOANE (19) unlocks the door and opens it. He’s wearing a 
           cutoff Ford/Dole ‘76 shirt.

           With no greeting, he leads her inside.

           INT. APARTMENT 3C - CONTINUOUS

           Reese follows Lance into the living room. The black-painted walls 
           are covered with hardcore posters and snapshots. The music is 
           deafening.

                                 LANCE
                             (yelling)
                        Wait here!

           Lance disappears down a hallway.

           Reese looks over at OSCAR DOYLE (early 20s), a longhaired kid 
           smoking a joint on the couch.

                                 DOYLE
                        You a narc?

                                 REESE
                        Oh, fuck yes! Are you?

           Doyle takes a long hit of his joint, bobbing his head along with a 
           relentless drum solo. He holds the joint out to Reese.
           She hesitates a fraction of a second, probably not enough for 
           Doyle to notice, before accepting it.

           She takes a casual hit.

                                 DOYLE
                             (indicating the music)
                        This is my shit!

                                 REESE
                        This is you?

                                 DOYLE
                        Fuck yeah, fuck yeah, fuck yeah! 
                        You like it?

           Reese exhales and hands the joint back to Doyle.

                                 REESE
                        Maybe.

           Doyle leaps up from the couch. He points out pictures of his band 
           on the wall.

                                 DOYLE
                        Here’s me. And that’s everyone. 
                        We’re called All Against One.

           Reese goes cold as she notices another picture.

           It’s Lizzy.

           She’s standing next to Doyle, stuffing a 7-Eleven employee of the 
           month plaque into her jacket. She’s looks different. Like a 
           teenage delinquent. Maybe a junkie.

                                 REESE
                        Who’s this?

                                 DOYLE
                        Oh, fuck her. Some junkie. Owes me 
                        a hundred dollars.

                                 REESE
                        Why don’t you collect?

                                 DOYLE
                        You really want to know?

           Underplay it. You don’t give a shit. Reese shrugs. Doyle turns 
           down the music.

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        She and her little German numbnuts 
                        boyfriend chopped up her parents. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        And the pigs were too stupid to nab 
                        them before they skipped town.

                                 REESE
                        Bullshit.

                                 DOYLE
                        No, serious. Those people up in 
                        wherever the fuck. Chopped up. That 
                        was her and the German fucker who 
                        did it. And what I heard was--

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, GARAGE - NIGHT

           [It’s the night of the murders, as Doyle imagines it.]

           Lizzy and Jens crawl in through a window. They each have a knife.

           They steal across the garage to the kitchen door.

           Lizzy cracks it. Nobody there. Voices come from some other room.

           Jens is nervous. Ready to call the whole thing off.

           Lizzy kisses him deeply. Sexually. Pleadingly. She pulls back and 
           looks into his eyes.

                                 LIZZY
                        For me, Jens. Listen to me. For us.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Derek and Nancy are dead on the floor.

           Jens clutches a bloody knife. He can’t catch his breath.

           Lizzy looms over her mother. She’s holding her knife, but it’s 
           clean.

           She takes a deep breath and then sticks her knife in between her 
           mother’s ribs.

           INT. APARTMENT 3C - DAY

           [We’re back in the present.]

                                 DOYLE
                        She didn’t do shit until they were 
                        dead. That way, see, listen to 
                        this: Her boyfriend did the murders 
                        and all she did was stick some dead 
                        people. I fucking swear you 
                        couldn’t make this shit up.
           INT. ROANOKE POLICE DEPARTMENT, DETECTIVES BULLPEN - DAY

           At her desk, Reese waits on the phone. Incongruously, she’s still 
           in her punk outfit.

           Fielding walks by with a cup of coffee in hand.

                                 FIELDING
                        I like the look.

           Reese flips him off.

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        Oh good. Very authentic. You know, 
                        I heard punk chicks’ll suck dick 
                        for a gram of coke. What do you 
                        think?

           A SLOVENIAN OFFICIAL comes on the line.

                                 SLOVENIAN OFFICIAL (V.O.)
                             (over the phone)
                        Dober dan.

           Fielding rolls his eyes and drifts away.

                                 REESE
                        Dober dan, hello. I’m hoping for 
                        someone who can speak English.

           Across the bullpen, Dante spots Reese on the phone. He approaches 
           her just as she’s wrapping up her call.

           Reese hangs up the phone and looks up at Dante.

                                 DANTE
                        What was that?

           Reese shrugs like, “Nothing.” Dante takes a seat.

                                 REESE
                        I’m putting irons in the fire.

           Dante scoots in for a clandestine talk. Reese thinks about 
           pretending she doesn’t care that much. But she can’t do it.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        Soering used his mother’s credit 
                        card once. To rent a car near 
                        Charles de Gaulle. Yellow Saab. As 
                        far as I can tell, they never 
                        returned it.

                                 DANTE
                        Plates?
                                 REESE
                        I’ve got them, but the only thing 
                        I’ve been able to pick up is they 
                        left France two weeks ago. Heading 
                        into Italy. After that, nothing.

           Dante notices a motley pile of correspondence on her desk.

                                 DANTE
                        What’s all this?

                                 REESE
                        “Tips.”

           She picks up an envelope and hands it to Dante.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                             (sarcastically)
                        This one has a picture of the guy 
                        who really did it.

           Dante pulls a newspaper clipping out of the envelope. It’s a 
           picture of Jens, his features crudely altered with a Sharpie to 
           make his hair longer.

           EXT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - DAY

           Reese parks her VW across the road from the house. She’s dressed 
           like herself again.

           She opens her glove compartment and takes out a pocket-sized lock-
           picking kit.

           EXT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - A MINUTE LATER

           A sign on the front door reads:

                                      DO NOT ENTER
                                      By Order of
                                 Bedford County Sheriff

           Reese uses tools from her kit to pick the lock. She glances over 
           her shoulder, but nobody’s watching her.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, DINING ROOM - DAY

           The place is frozen in time.

           Reese looks at the same blood stains she’s seen before. The same 
           smeared sockprint.
           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, KITCHEN - DAY

           A terrible smell hangs over the room. It’s from rotting whipped 
           cream in the bowl on the counter.

           Reese covers her nose and mouth with her hand. Why am I here?

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, ART STUDIO - DAY

           The art studio is the same too. Nothing touched for weeks.

           The jumble of Polaroids is still facedown on the floor.

           Crouching, she flips the helter-skelter pile.

           Just some snapshots of flowers and landscapes.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, ELIZABETH’S ROOM - DAY

           Reese takes in the thick atmosphere of the room. She opens the 
           window. In the process, she knocks over a cup of pens on the desk.

           A few pens roll off and go behind the desk.

           Reese reaches into the gap between the desk and the wall. She 
           pulls out the pens and then feels something else.

           Sensing it could be important, Reese uses a pen rather than her 
           fingers to coax it out.

           It’s a blurry Polaroid, half obscured by Wite-Out. The half you 
           can see is a naked woman’s chest and hips. Is it Lizzy?

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS, SHARON HUGHES’ OFFICE - DAY

           In the colorless government office, Reese sits across a desk from 
           SHARON HUGHES (40s). Raspy voice, salty vernacular, crisp 
           pantsuit, Dolly Parton hair. You don’t want to fuck with this 
           woman.

           They each have copies of the same report in their hands.

                                 REESE
                        Turn to page eight. You’ll have 
                        read the report, of course. But I 
                        wanted to direct your attention 
                        to... to...

           Reese scans page eight. What was I trying to...?

                                 HUGHES
                        You got a hot date or something?
                                 REESE
                        No, I--

                                 HUGHES
                        Where’s your head at?

                                 REESE
                        Here.

                                 HUGHES
                        Fuck wrong.

           Hughes looks Reese over for an uncomfortably long time.

                                 HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        Play along with me for a second, 
                        okay? Where are you from, Rezek? 
                        What kind of background? What kind 
                        of family?

           Reese would rather not get into this personal stuff, but...

                                 REESE
                        My dad was a cop. He died before I 
                        was born.

                                 HUGHES
                        My dad was a cop too. Pretty much 
                        every man I knew was in law 
                        enforcement somehow. But I’m the 
                        first woman in my family to do it.

                                 REESE
                        Yeah. Me too.

                                 HUGHES
                        Okay. Good. So take a squint around 
                        when you leave. I’m deadly fucking 
                        serious. Go ahead and count how 
                        many women you see. And I’m not 
                        talking secretaries. I’m talking 
                        people with offices.

                                 REESE
                        I know.

                                 HUGHES
                        I’ll give you a hint. You’ll only 
                        need one hand. You can do whatever 
                        you want with the other one.

                                 REESE
                        No, I mean, I really know. I do. 
                        I’m not here to fuck up or waste 
                        your time.

                        But if you want to know the truth I 
                        can’t get my mind off a case. A 
                        homicide case.

                                 HUGHES
                        I need you here. Brain, brawn, tits 
                        and all. Now are you here for me?

           INT. GEORGETOWN MARRIOTT, ROOM 1017 - NIGHT

           Reese surveys the room where Lizzy and Jens stayed the weekend of 
           the murders.

           Impersonal furniture. Hotel art. Nothing to reveal anything about 
           past occupants.

           She opens her suitcase, pulls out the picture of her dad, and sets 
           it on the bedside table.

           She pulls out her tape player and puts on Grace Jones.

           INT. GEORGETOWN MARRIOTT, ROOM 1017 - NIGHT, LATER

           In the bathroom, paper-wrapped soaps are in place. The towels are 
           folded just so.

           Grace Jones is still going.

           Reese reaches into the shower and turns on the water.

           She broods, feeling just short of connecting across the chasm of 
           time to the night when Lizzy and Jens were here.

           RING! The tension snaps. It’s the phone in the other room.

           RING! Reese shuts off the shower.

           RING! She moves to the other room and turns off Grace Jones.

                        Quite an international list you’ve

                        Yellow Saab, French plates. Sound 
                        familiar?

           EXT. TRIESTE BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Posters in Italian are plastered on the alley’s stucco walls.

           A yellow Saab is parked halfway on the narrow sidewalk.

           Around a bend, the opposite end of the alley emerges onto a busy 
           thoroughfare.

           EXT. TRIESTE THOROUGHFARE - CONTINUOUS

           A garish neon sign over the doorway to a club reads, “Pianeta 
           Obscuro.”

           INT. PIANETA OBSCURO - NIGHT

           Mai Tai’s buoyant, disco-inflected club hit “History” booms out 
           onto the dance floor.

           DANCERS and DRINKERS, all young and mostly high, are packed into 
           the neon-lit, mirror-walled space.

           Jens stands at the bar. In jeans and a geometrically-patterned 
           shirt, he’s got something approaching swagger.

           The BARTENDER slides two vodka sodas across to him.

           Jens picks them up and turns to force his way through the sweating 
           crowd on the dance floor.

           He gets to where he expects to find Lizzy, but she isn’t there. He 
           peers around, trying not to spill the drinks.

           The song ends and the dancing slackens.

           Lizzy parts ways with a MOD GIRL.
           Lizzy has bright red hair and a shimmery top. She’s confident, 
           invigorated by the club and being on the run.

                                 JENS
                        I was looking for you!

           Startled, Lizzy turns to him.

                                                      JENS (CONT'D)
           Well, here I am!
                                             We can’t do that.

                                 LIZZY
                        What?

                                 JENS
                        We can’t lose each other and you 
                        can’t dance with other people. Even 
                        girls.

           INT. PIANETA OBSCURO, FRONT VESTIBULE - SAME TIME

           ENZO ALFONSI (30s), a local police detective, shows the BOUNCER 
           his badge.

           The bouncer glances at Reese and Dante before waving them all 
           through.

           INT. PIANETA OBSCURO - MOMENTS LATER

           Overwhelmed by the flashing lights and silhouetted knots of 
           bodies, Reese loses track of Dante and Alfonsi.

           It’s hard to imagine finding anybody in here.

                                 ALFONSI
                             (handing Reese a beer)
                        This way, you blend in, yes?

           Reese glances at Dante, who also has a beer.

                                 ALFONSI (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           Alfonsi leads them through the crowd. They inch past the bar and 
           along the back wall.

           They go up a set of steps to a low platform, where the DJ presides 
           over turntables.

           Alfonsi leans over to the DJ, whom he seems to know, and whispers 
           in his ear.

           Turning back to Reese and Dante, Alfonsi guides them to the other 
           side of the platform.
           They have a perfect view of the crowd.

           Reese scans the sea of faces, drenched in sweat and flashing 
           lights.

           Deep in the crowd, Lizzy dances with Jens like nothing else 
           matters. For an instant, for no reason at all, she opens her eyes 
           and glances up at the DJ.

           Her overheated body goes ice cold, as pink light flashes on 
           Reese’s face.

           Drawn by her eyes, Reese spots Lizzy. They hold eye contact. It 
           only lasts a second or two, but it feels longer.

                                 LIZZY
                             (shouting at Jens)
                        We have to go!

           Lizzy yanks his arm, dragging him into the crowd.

           Up on the DJ platform, Reese grabs Dante’s arm and points to where 
           Lizzy was a moment before.

                                 REESE
                        There!

           Reese leads the way down the stairs.

           She pushes into the crowd on the dance floor, her sense of 
           direction thrown off by the lights and noise.

           Moving by instinct, she forces her way past a group of BODY-
           PAINTED MEN AND WOMEN.

           Emerging from the thickest snarl of the crowd, Reese steals a look 
           behind her.

           Dante and Alfonsi aren’t there.

           No time to think about that. Which way did Lizzy and Jens go?

           Past the bathrooms, a closing service door catches Reese’s eye.

           She sprints down the hallway, past a WOMAN VOMITING ON THE FLOOR, 
           and rips open the service door.

           INT. ANCIENT PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Disorienting aftereffects of the music ring in Reese’s ears.

           At the end of the cave-like passageway, Lizzy and Jens disappear 
           up a set of stone steps.
           Reese flies down the corridor, past crates of alcohol and San 
           Pellegrino.

           She climbs the steps and finds a closed metal hatch directly above 
           her. She heaves it open and springs through it.

           EXT. TRIESTE BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Reese has no clue which way to go. It’s happening again. She’s 
           losing them.

           She chooses a direction at random.

           She comes around a corner and finds POLICE IMPOUND OFFICERS 
           hitching the yellow Saab to a tow-truck.

           Making the snap decision to double back, Reese retraces her steps 
           and emerges on the other end of the alley.

           EXT. TRIESTE THOROUGHFARE - CONTINUOUS

           PEDESTRIANS crowd the sidewalks.

           Reese looks around. Pick a direction.

           She glances behind her, hoping to see Dante or Alfonsi, but she’s 
           alone.

           Reese looks down the street, towards a busy square.

           A block ahead, a couple walks casually away. It’s them. It has to 
           be.

           Reese dodges around a group of SMOKING TEENAGERS.

           The couple steps into the square. For a second, Reese loses them.

           She picks up the pace as she catches sight of the couple again. It 
           has to be them, right?

           The couple turns and Reese sees their faces.

           Fuck. It’s not them.

           EXT. TRIESTE PUBLIC STAIRWAY - SAME TIME

           The stairway cuts between an old building and a walled graveyard, 
           leading down a hill to the road below.

           Lizzy and Jens crouch in the shadows, catching their breath.

           They’re looking up at Reese, who stands on the street above 
           looking in the direction of the other couple.
           Reese turns around, ready to give up. Then she looks down the 
           stairs.

           She spots Lizzy and Jens. They take off down the stairs.

           Reese follows, taking the stairs two at a time.

           She’s not gaining.

           She comes to the bottom of the steps at full-tilt, taking a sharp 
           left into the street.

           EXT. TRIESTE BACK STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Reese spots Lizzy and Jens, who are giving it everything they’ve 
           got.

           She follows them down the street, which slopes towards the 
           waterfront.

           EXT. TRIESTE WATERFRONT - CONTINUOUS

           Lizzy and Jens emerge onto the industrial waterfront.

           They head towards the lonely shipping depots.

           Is Reese gaining?

           Up ahead, a curving ramp leads to an elevated street.

           Jens peels off and runs for it. Lizzy follows.

           Reese gets closer every second.

           The ramp gets steeper and steeper. Each of them fight through the 
           pain to run as fast as they can.

           Reese gains, yard by excruciating yard.

           As the ramp levels off into and elevated street, she’s getting 
           close to her physical limits.

           Jens trips and falls.

           He’s up again in a second, but it’s enough for Reese to catch up 
           and whip out her .38.

           Nobody has the energy to say anything.

           They all just stand there, catching their breath and listening to 
           the rhythmic sound of a nearby train.

                                 JENS
                        Are you going to shoot us?
           Cla-clack, cla-clack, cla-clack, cla-clack. The sounds of the 
           train continue.

                                 LIZZY
                        We didn’t do anything. We don’t 
                        know anything about it.

                                 REESE
                        So come back and prove it.

           Jens has realized they’re standing on an overpass. The train is 
           passing just a few feet below. Its last few cars are open hoppers 
           filled with garlic.

           He grabs Lizzy’s arm and yanks her to the railing.

           Lizzy understands what they have to do.

           They jump.

           Reese hesitates for a fraction of a second. Then it’s too late.

           The train has passed.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           INT. TRIESTE HOTEL, REESE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A fake-gilded bedroom set is crammed into the microscopic room.

           Reese tries to sleep in the ornate bed. First she tries her back 
           and then she tries her side, wriggling around to get the covers 
           how she wants them.

           After a long while, she turns on the lamp.

           She picks up the picture of her dad from the bedside table.

           She turns on her tape player. It’s a Grace Jones again.

           INT. TRIESTE HOTEL, DANTE’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dante can’t sleep either. He smiles at Reese’s music, which he can 
           hear through the paper-in walls.

           He knocks on the wall. Reese turns the music off.

                                 DANTE
                        For some reason, there’s a bottle 
                        of rum in my room.
           INT. TRIESTE HOTEL, DANTE’S ROOM - NIGHT, LATER

           Dante pours rum into glasses. Reese sits on the bed.

           They “cheers.”

                                 REESE
                        My aunt always said my dad drank 
                        rum. When he got back from the war. 
                        He liked to go to Trader Vic’s. 
                        He’d get the what’s that drink 
                        called?

                                 DANTE
                        Mai tai.

                                 REESE
                        No.

                                 DANTE
                        Zombie.

                                 REESE
                        No. The one Nixon drank.

                                 DANTE
                        Navy grog.

                                 REESE
                        Yeah. She said he always drank navy 
                        grog at Trader Vic’s. Just one.

                                 DANTE
                        You ever had one?

                                 REESE
                        No. What is it exactly?

                                 DANTE
                        I never had it either. I think it’s 
                        strong.

                                 REESE
                        Right. That’s why he just had the 
                        one. After his shift, she said.

           Reese looks at her rum.

                                 DANTE
                        You grew up with your aunt, right?

                                 REESE
                        My mom died when I was little and 
                        my dad died before I was born so... 
                        So I grew up with my aunt. My dad’s 
                        sister.
                                 DANTE
                        And your dad was a cop?

                                 REESE
                        Yeah. I guess he was a brave guy. I 
                        like to think he’s watching out for 
                        me. I mean, I don’t believe in 
                        anything like that so I don’t even 
                        know what I’m talking about.

           She knocks back the rest of the rum and lies down with her feet 
           hanging off the side of the bed.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        What am I talking about?

                                 DANTE
                        I don’t know.

                                 REESE
                        If my dad really is looking out for 
                        me he’s probably slapping his 
                        forehead and wondering how his kid 
                        could be so dumb. He’s probably 
                        saying, “Two times you had them and 
                        two times you let them get away. 
                        What a fucking idiot.”

                                 DANTE
                        You did what you could.

                                 REESE
                        “Here lies Reese Rezek. She did 
                        what she could.”

                                 DANTE
                        That’s on your tombstone?

                                 REESE
                        No, pepperoni and cheese.

                                 DANTE
                        What?

                                 REESE
                        It’s a frozen pizza slogan.

           They’re looking at each other. Without either of them having 
           moved, the space between them seems to have shrunk. When did that 
           happen?

           Reese sits up.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I should go.
           She’s not actually going.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        You have a boner.

                                 DANTE
                        Fuck. Come on.

           He covers his crotch with his hands.

                                 REESE
                        No, I’m sorry. It’s okay.

           Reese pulls his hands away to get a look at his boner. It isn’t 
           weird. It’s kind of sweet.

           She pulls his hands to her breasts.

           She touches his crotch and kisses him.

           Then they’re making out like teenagers.

                        DANTE
                                                     REESE (CONT'D)
           I’m sorry I had a boner. I--
                                             I’m sorry I noticed, but...

           She breaks away from their embrace. She flops down on the bed and 
           starts taking her clothes off.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        Take your clothes off. Take your 
                        clothes off and... Shit.

                                 DANTE
                        What?

                                 REESE
                        Bad underwear.

           Dante shrugs. He doesn’t care.

           She takes her pajama bottoms off. Underneath she has dingy 
           underwear that might have been white to start with.

                                 DANTE
                        I like seeing all of you. Bad 
                        underwear and--

                                 REESE
                        Good, because I want you to see my 
                        bad underwear. And I want to shut 
                        up and stop talking.

           They’ve been so focused on her bad underwear that Dante hasn’t 
           taken anything off yet.
           She grabs him and kisses him more. She reaches into his pants and 
           gets them halfway off as he grabs her butt.

           Everything else bad that has happened or will happen doesn’t exist 
           in this moment.

           INT. TRIESTE CENTRALE TRAIN STATION, WOMEN’S RESTROOM - DAY

           A white-tiled, marble-countered room.

           Lizzy scrubs her hair over a sink, trying to get the red dye out. 
           But her hair has a red glow that won’t go away.

           INT. TRIESTE CENTRALE TRAIN STATION, PUBLIC LOCKERS - DAY

           Lizzy uses a key to open a locker.

           She pulls out and unzips a gym bag.

           Inside, she finds an envelope with some money. There’s also a note 
           from Jens, which begins, “Don’t worry, we’ll be laughing about 
           this one day.”

           EXT. ITALIAN RURAL CROSSROADS - DAY

           Surrounded by almond orchards, POLICEMEN have a checkpoint set up.

           They wave through a camper van.

           A bus approaches. The police stop it and two of them get on.

           Another policeman waves through a pickup filled with DAY LABORERS.

           EXT. PICKUP - SAME TIME

           In the bed of the truck, Lizzy peeps out from under a pile of 
           burlap sacks. The young men sitting around her seem pleased at 
           having got one over on the police.

           EXT. ALMOND ORCHARD - DAY

           The pickup bumps along the dirt road that slices through the 
           trees. It comes to a stop and Lizzy hops out.

           The truck pulls away, leaving Lizzy alone with the hum of insects 
           and the chirping of birds.
           EXT. ITALIAN RURAL ROAD - DAY

           At the edge of the orchard, Lizzy stands beside a lonely stretch 
           of road.

           An old Peugeot approaches. Lizzy puts her thumb out, but it zooms 
           by.

           She feels invisible.

           The sound of another motor grows and a white Fiat convertible 
           comes into view. Lizzy puts her thumb out.

           This time the car stops.

           The driver is GIADA (20s), an Italian woman with an Hermès scarf 
           around her head.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING

           The look is black and pink deco revival.

           Lizzy and Giada are ensconced at the far end of the bar, with icy, 
           fizzy, red Americanos in front of them.

                                 GIADA
                        Go on, try it.

           Lizzy examines the drink.

                                 GIADA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t tell me you’ve never had 
                        Campari before.

           Lizzy shakes her head.

                                 GIADA (CONT’D)
                        What have you been doing in Italy 
                        then?

           Lizzy shrugs and takes a sip.

                                 GIADA (CONT’D)
                        You like it?

                                 LIZZY
                        I like it.

                                 GIADA
                        I don’t know what to think of you.

                                 LIZZY
                        You should think that I grew up in 
                        a boring place with boring people. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZZY (CONT'D)
                        That I myself was boring until 
                        quite recently.

                                 GIADA
                        I’ve made up so many stories in my 
                        mind leading up to meeting you on 
                        the side of the road.

                                 LIZZY
                        You’d never guess the real story.

                                 GIADA
                        You’re a wealthy heiress, on the 
                        run from your parents.

           Lizzy shakes her head and takes a sip.

                                 GIADA (CONT’D)
                        You’re an orphan with no parents. 
                        Or so you thought. You’ve just 
                        found out that your parents are...

                                 LIZZY
                        My boyfriend killed my parents and 
                        an American police detective is on 
                        our trail. That’s why we’ve 
                        separated, you see.

                                 GIADA
                        I see. Imaginary boyfriend. So the 
                        truth probably is something boring.

           They take sips of their drinks, the cool beads of condensation 
           from the glasses making their hands damp.

                                 GIADA (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to go dancing with me 
                        tonight?

           Lizzy takes a sip to give herself time to think.

                                 LIZZY
                        I can’t. There’s a night bus to 
                        Locarno. Switzerland. My boyfriend--

                                 GIADA
                        The one who’s not real.

                                 LIZZY
                        The one who’s not real. But he is 
                        real and he’ll be waiting for me. 
                        And he wouldn’t like it if I went 
                        out dancing with you.

                                 GIADA
                        He doesn’t have to know.
                                 LIZZY
                        No. I’d tell him. I’d tell him 
                        because I needed forgiveness. Or to 
                        hurt him. Or for some reason. I 
                        know I’d tell him and I don’t want 
                        to do that.

                                 GIADA
                        So I don’t have a chance?

                                 LIZZY
                        Maybe in another life.

           SUPER OVER BLACK: 1986

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Above a big picture of Captain Ellis, multicolor letters spell 
           out, “FINALLY OFF THE CLOCK!”

           Tons of COPS are here to celebrate. It’s crowded and rowdy.

           Reese, in a black dress and blazer, stands in the back.

           Fielding appears beside her with two glasses of Champagne.

                                 FIELDING
                        Try it. You might like it.

           Reese eyes him and takes a glass.

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        So this DEA thing is kind of 
                        permanent, huh?

                                 REESE
                        Yeah.

                                 FIELDING
                        At least you get to do the cool 
                        outfits. I love the punk ones. It’s 
                        like a whole other side of you. 
                        Like a bad side. I mean, how much 
                        do you get into the part?

           Reese looks around the room for someone, anyone else to talk to.

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        You know, I like punk chicks. Like 
                        Debbie Harry.

                                 REESE
                        She’s not punk. And I’m not working 
                        in the field anymore.
                                 FIELDING
                        Hey, how come you don’t like me? 
                        I’m always kidding around, but 
                        you’re not into it.

                                 REESE
                        I just want to do my job. I don’t 
                        want to do whatever this is.

           She looks him in the eye. I’m not interested.

                                 FIELDING
                        Don’t flatter yourself.

           Reese spots Dante through the crowd. She hands Fielding her empty 
           Champagne glass.

           Reese weaves past knots of people to find Dante.

                                 REESE
                        Jesus, that guy’s such a limp dick 
                        little shit.

                                 DANTE
                        Yeah...

           Dante realizes that he knows something Reese doesn’t.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        You know he’s taking over Ellis’ 
                        job, right?

                                 REESE
                        Fuck me. You’re kidding.

           He’s not kidding.

           A waiter passes with glasses of Champagne. Dante snags two of 
           them.

           For a while they just drink.

                                 DANTE
                        You know the thing that happened 
                        when we were in Italy? What’d you 
                        think of that?

           Reese takes a moment to answer. Not because it’s awkward, but 
           because it’s important.

                                 REESE
                        I liked it. But.

           She looks him right in the eyes. There’s no shame here for either 
           of them.
                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I think we’re supposed to be 
                        something else. What do you think?

                                 DANTE
                        Yeah. Same.

           INT. MARKS & SPENCER (HAMPSTEAD LOCATION) - DAY

           A pen moves along the signature line of a check, elegantly forming 
           the name Julia Holte.

           Lizzy clicks the pen closed.

           We’re in a cheerful English department store.

           Lizzy confidently pushes the check across to MAGGIE, a timid clerk 
           at the front counter. Maggie looks at the name on the check.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thank you, Ms. Holte.

           Maggie slips a leather jacket into an M&S bag.

                                 LIZZY
                        Thanks. I like your necklace.

           Maggie touches her necklace, which is ordinary in every way.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, thank you.

           Lizzy smiles, heads for the door, and exits.

           Life in the store goes on.

           An ELDERLY WOMAN compares blends of tea.

           A YOUNG BOY sneaks sweets into his PARENTS’ shopping basket.

           A TEENAGE COUPLE argues in low voices.

           Jens walks in, carrying the M&S bag, now artfully rumpled.

           He makes his way to the customer service counter where an 
           OFFICIOUS MANAGER comes to attention.

                                 JENS
                        I was hoping to return this jacket. 
                        I bought it for my girlfriend, but 
                        she doesn’t like it.
           EXT. HAMPSTEAD SIDE STREET - DAY

           Lizzy stands in place bobbing around. She rubs her hands and acts 
           all nervous and excited and weird.

           She keeps glancing up the street.

           Finally, Jens comes around the corner. He doesn’t have the bag 
           anymore, but he doesn’t look happy.

           In fact, he looks panicked.

           He shakes his head like, “Be cool, act cool, we need to move fast 
           and get out of here.”

           Then suddenly, he smiles and whips out a handful of cash.

           EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY

           In a shadowy grove of bushes, Lizzy and Jens are half undressed 
           and having sex on the ground. It’s really dirty and leafy and 
           damp. And joyful.

           EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY, LATER

           Now they’re lying flat on the ground catching their breath. Lizzy 
           notices her underwear half buried in a drift of leaves.

                                 LIZZY
                        My underwear has leaves in it.

                                 JENS
                        It’s good luck. Ancient German 
                        saying.

           Lizzy rolls around a little just to feel the dirt and the leaves 
           and the damp under her body.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m so fucking happy. It’s like I’m 
                        on drugs, but really on drugs and 
                        the real drugs are us and fucking 
                        and stealing money and writing 
                        books about it later but I don’t 
                        want to think about that right now 
                        because we’re here.

           Lizzy grabs him and licks his face.

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Reese uses an X-Acto knife to slice out a color photocopy of 
           Lizzy’s Virginia driver’s license.
           She’s sitting on the floor at the coffee table, which is covered 
           with bits of information about Lizzy and Jens.

           The mail slot opens and mail comes shooting through.

           Reese leans back to grab it, tossing aside the junk and opening a 
           letter postmarked from Germany.

           As she scans the letter, a few phrases stand out like, 
           “Unfortunately, we have no records of...” and “...best of our 
           knowledge, Mr. Soering has never gone under any other names.”

           INT. GROUND FLOOR FLAT - DAY

           The place is tiny and barely furnished.

           Lizzy sits in bed (really, a mattress on the floor) paging through 
           the Next catalogue.

           Jens comes in from the bathroom. He’s just showered.

           Lizzy holds up the catalogue.

                                 LIZZY
                        Julia Holte’s first catalogue.

           She points out that it’s addressed to Julia Holte.

                                 JENS
                        Why does it say £3 on it?

                                 LIZZY
                        Because it cost £3.

           Jens can’t believe it. Lizzy turns to men’s suiting.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        There’s fabric samples. And it’s 
                        hardbound like a book and it knows 
                        what we want.

                                 JENS
                        We have to be smart with our money.

                                 LIZZY
                        I know that. I know. But look.

           She turns to lingerie. Jens nods, unenthusiastically.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        Ooh la la.
           EXT. SHOPPING PLAZA - NIGHT

           A copy shop has a neon sign in the window that reads, 
           “International Fax Services.”

           Reese pays a CLERK and heads for the door.

           Outside, Reese fumbles as she unlocks her car door, dropping a 
           folder and its contents all over.

           Dante jogs over and scoops it up for her.

                                 REESE
                        Oh, hi. Thanks.

           Dante has just come out of an Italian restaurant. He isn’t alone. 
           PATRICIA (30s), an elegant, cheerful woman is with him.

                                 DANTE
                        You ever been to that place? It’s a 
                        good place for going out.

                                 REESE
                        I’ve never been.

                                 DANTE
                        This is Patricia. My fiancé. We 
                        just got engaged.

                                 REESE
                        Oh. Good to meet you. He’s a real 
                        catch.

                                 PATRICIA
                        Oh, definitely.

           Patricia and Reese shake hands.

                                 DANTE
                        Reese and I used to be partners. 
                        She’s one of the good ones.

           Nobody knows what to say next, so there’s awkward silence.

                                 REESE
                        Anyway, I’ll get going and leave 
                        you to it.

           Dante realizes he’s still holding Reese’s folder. He can’t help 
           noticing it’s profiles of Lizzy and Jens.

           He hands it to her.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                             (to Patricia)
                        Good meeting you.
           Reese gets into her car and closes the door.

           INT. UNDERGROUND CARRIAGE - NIGHT

           Lizzy’s hair is bright green now, but the glow of being on the run 
           has faded. She’s drunk and leaning on Jens’ shoulder.

                                 LIZZY
                        What are we going to do?

                                 JENS
                        We’re going to go home and go to 
                        sleep.

                                 LIZZY
                        Remember how we were becoming the 
                        people we were meant to be? 
                        Remember when we said that?

                        Maida Vale. This is Maida Vale.

           The trains slows down as it pulls into the station.

                                 LIZZY
                        Remember?

                                 JENS
                             (getting up)
                        This is our stop.

                                 LIZZY
                        But you remember, right?

           The doors open. Passengers exit as Jens tries to get Lizzy out of 
           her seat.

                                 UNDERGROUND CONDUCTOR (V.O.)
                        Maida Vale. This is a Bakerloo line 
                        train to Queen’s Park.

                                 JENS
                        Come on.

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m not coming. You don’t remember.

                                 JENS
                        I do remember. Come on.

                                 LIZZY
                        No, fuck you. You don’t.

           Jens pulls her up and towards the exit. She lets him.
           At the door, she pushes him away.

           The doors close with her on the train and him off.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember either, so fuck 
                        you. Cunt.

           But she does remember. She only wanted to hurt Jens, but he didn’t 
           even hear her.

           INT. MARKS & SPENCER (AYLESBURY LOCATION) - DAY

           The store is decked out for Christmas. HOLIDAY SHOPPERS crowd 
           around stacks of chocolates and cakes.

           Lizzy signs another check as Julia Holte. Her green hair is faded 
           and dull.

           EXT. AYLESBURY HIGH STREET - SAME TIME

           Jens leans on the wall of a cinema near a poster for Robocop.

           He watches the CROWD OF SHOPPERS going by, tapping his foot 
           impatiently until he sees Lizzy approaching with an M&S bag.

           Jens snatches the bag, rumples it, and heads to the store.

           A few yards from the door, Jens notices a SUSPICIOUS MANAGER 
           peeking his head out.

           His flight instinct kicks in, but he hesitates, not wanting to 
           attract attention.

           The manager takes a step towards him.

           Jens turns, running headlong into a POLICEMAN.

           INT. ROANOKE POLICE DEPARTMENT, DETECTIVES BULLPEN - DAY

           The room is trimmed with drooping lengths of fake garland.

           Reese pours herself a coffee and heads towards her desk.

           As she passes an artificial Christmas tree, Fielding calls out 
           from the doorway to his office.

                                 FIELDING
                        Hey, Rezek. You in on Secret Santa?

                                 REESE
                        Sure.
           GOFFMAN (20s), balding young detective, looks up from his desk.

                                 GOFFMAN
                        Whoever gets her, she wants a 
                        dildo. That’s the only fucking 
                        thing she wants.

                                 REESE
                        You’re thinking of yourself again, 
                        Goffman.

           This garners a smattering of laughs.

                                 FIELDING
                        Hey, I’ve got the real thing if you 
                        ever get sick of Goffman’s dildo.

           Reese, hearing the phone ringing on her desk, jogs the last few 
           yards.

                                 REESE
                             (answering the phone)

                        hope I’ve got the right person.

           She sets her coffee down. He heart is racing.

                                 REESE
                        This is Rezek. Detective Rezek.

                        I’ve got two faxed documents in 
                        front of me. Profiles of Jens 
                        Soering and Elizabeth Haysom. Do 
                        you know who I mean?

           INT. ROANOKE POLICE DEPARTMENT, FIELDING’S OFFICE - DAY

           Reese comes in an closes the door behind her. She looks warily at 
           Fielding.

                                 FIELDING
                        Show me your tits and I might let 
                        you go.

           He lets it hang just a second.

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        No, god, please. I’m just kidding. 
                        Don’t show me your tits. Is this 
                        really that important to you?
           Reese is trying to figure out how to get what she wants without 
           showing vulnerability.

                                 FIELDING (CONT’D)
                        Sit down.

                                 REESE
                        That’s okay.

                                 FIELDING
                        You think you can get what we need?

                                 REESE
                        I’ll get the truth.

                                 FIELDING
                        Ask me nicely. Come on, just this 
                        once, ask me without the attitude.

                                 REESE
                        I’ve said what I have to say.

           Fielding thinks it over. Reese lets him.

                                 FIELDING
                        This is a one-off. It doesn’t mean 
                        you’re back on homicide. I want you 
                        back here and back on your real job 
                        in 72 hours. And don’t say I never 
                        did anything for you.

           INT. SCOTLAND YARD INTERROGATION ROOM #1 - DAY

           Lizzy sits alone at a table. She looks edgy and unhappy. She’s 
           waiting for something and can’t understand what’s taking so long.

           The door to the room opens and Reese steps in.

           She takes a seat across from Lizzy.

           She sets a tape recorder on the table between them and presses the 
           record button.

                                 LIZZY
                        You look older than I remember.

                                 REESE
                        You look like you have regrets.

                                 LIZZY
                        No regrets.

                                 REESE
                        You’re here. Whatever happened 
                        before led you here.
                                 LIZZY
                        Same goes for you too.

           Reese watches Lizzy for a while. Play it slow. Wait for tension to 
           build. Wait for the right moment.

           Now.

                                 REESE
                        Do you miss your parents?

                                 LIZZY
                        This is a bullshit thing, right? 
                        Like a tactic. You trip me up. Try 
                        to spook me.

                                 REESE
                        No. I really want to know. Do you 
                        miss them?

           FLASH: Paint, the color of skin, brushed onto a canvas in a 
           curving stroke.

                                 LIZZY
                        Well, since you really want to 
                        know, I’ll tell you. I don’t miss 
                        them. I don’t give a shit that 
                        they’re dead. I honestly like it 
                        this way, but do you want to know 
                        the really fucked up part?

                                 REESE
                        Yeah.

                                 LIZZY
                        I can’t even enjoy it, because you 
                        guys have the wrong idea.

                                 REESE
                        So who killed them?

           Lizzy shakes her head. She doesn’t know. Or doesn’t want to know.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        You want to know what I think?

           Lizzy shrugs.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        How about this? I’ll say what I 
                        think and you tell me to fuck off 
                        if I’m wrong.

                                 LIZZY
                        And what happens then?
                                 REESE
                        I fuck off. You deal with your 
                        local fraud charges.

                                 LIZZY
                        So I tell you to fuck off and you 
                        fuck off?

           Reese waits for the tension to build. Lizzy tries not to look 
           nervous. She’s nervous.

                                 REESE
                        I think Jens loves you. A hell of a 
                        lot. I think that he saw how you 
                        felt about your parents and decided 
                        to do something about it. I think 
                        you didn’t know what he would do. 
                        And I think you want to tell me 
                        what really happened, but you feel 
                        like shit because Jens did this 
                        thing, this crazy thing, for you. 
                        Or that’s what he thinks. That’s 
                        what he’s got you thinking too.

           Lizzy takes all of this in.

           FLASH: Another curving stroke in skin colored paint.

                                 LIZZY
                        Fuck off.

           INT. SCOTLAND YARD INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - DAY

           Reese steps in with the tape recorder in hand. Jens looks up at 
           her very calmly.

                                 JENS
                        Don’t turn that thing on.

           Reese sits down, setting the recorder on the table and turning it 
           on.

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        I won’t talk with it on. I just 
                        want to talk like people.

                                 REESE
                        Elizabeth spoke with it on.

           Jens reaches forward and shuts off the tape recorder.

                                 JENS
                        What did she say?
                                 REESE
                        I want to know what you have to 
                        say. I’m here to find out the 
                        truth. That’s all. That’s why I 
                        wanted the tape recorder going.

                                 JENS
                        Did she say she did something?

                                 REESE
                        Tell me about that weekend again. 
                        Just take me through it in your own 
                        words.

                                 JENS
                        Do you think I could get some 
                        coffee? And a chocolate bar?

           Reese gives it a moment before responding.

                                 REESE
                        Yeah. What kind of chocolate bar? 
                        Don’t they have different ones 
                        here?

                                 JENS
                        I want the one with the coconut.

           Reese gets up and exits the room.

           Jens waits. He takes another sip of water.

           He tries out clasping his hands together on the table. He doesn’t 
           like how it feels so he puts his hands in his lap.

           Reese comes back in and sits down.

           She watches Jens trying to stay calm.

           He feels her watching him. It’s not comfortable.

                                 REESE
                        I’ll tell you one thing Elizabeth 
                        said. She said she hated her 
                        parents. I mean, really hated them.

           The door opens and a UNIFORMED OFFICER brings in a paper cup of 
           coffee and a Bounty bar. He sets them down on the table and exits.

           Reese waits for Jens to say something. The seconds tick by. He’s 
           going to say something.

                                 JENS
                        She didn’t do anything. She didn’t 
                        know anything about it.
           Jens unwraps the Bounty bar. He takes a bite.

           Reese turns on the recorder.

           Don’t scare him off. Let him take his time.

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        I want you to see something.

           He holds his hand up for Reese to see.

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        Look here.

           Jens points out pale, shiny scars on his fingers.

                                 REESE
                        From your accident. In the machine 
                        shop?

                                 JENS
                        That’s here.

           He points to a scar running down his middle finger.

                                 JENS (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t an accident. I did it to 
                        hide the others. That shows you the 
                        kind of will I had.

           Reese keeps looking at the scars. It’s hard interpret them with 
           certainty.

                                 REESE
                        The will for what, Jens?

           INT. CHEVETTE - DAY

           [It’s 1985. The weekend of the murders.]

           Jens is at the wheel. Lizzy has her feet up on the dashboard. 
           They’re somewhere between Charlottesville and D.C.

                                 LIZZY
                        My mother’s probably having her 
                        sixth gin about this time. Maybe 
                        she’ll get drunk enough to use that 
                        fire poker on my father. That would 
                        be something wouldn’t it?

           Lizzy looks over at Jens, but he’s focused on the road.
                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        They told me to break up with you. 
                        My mother told me you didn’t have 
                        the right kind of standing for a 
                        girl like me. That’s exactly how 
                        she said it. “He doesn’t have the 
                        right kind of...” She pauses there 
                        and then she finds this word, 
                        “Standing.” “Standing,” she says. 
                        “The right kind of standing.”

           She waits for Jens to react, but he’s giving her nothing. She 
           takes her feet off the dashboard.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Earth to Jens, are you 
                        there?

                                 JENS
                        When we visited at Thanksgiving, I 
                        saw something. In your mother’s 
                        studio. Pictures of you...

           FLASH: A Polaroid flashes and spits out a picture.

                                 LIZZY
                        I may take up black magic. Then 
                        maybe I’d get somewhere with my 
                        mother.

                                 JENS
                        Are you listening to me? I said, I 
                        saw pictures of you in your 
                        mother’s studio. Nude pictures.

           FLASH: A partly developed Polaroid. A ghostly, naked torso.

                                 LIZZY
                        You’d help me with my black magic, 
                        wouldn’t you?

                                 JENS
                        You don’t need black magic.

           EXT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS - NIGHT

           Jens pounds on the door.

           Derek answers. He’s a few drinks in and pissed about the rude 
           pounding.

                                 DEREK
                        Jesus, you’re drunk. How did you 
                        get here?
                                 JENS
                        I’m the voice of god. I appear. It 
                        doesn’t matter my Mr. Haysom. Let 
                        me in, let me in or I’ll blow your 
                        house down.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Who is it?

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jens follows Derek into the living room.

                                 DEREK
                        He says he’s the voice of god.

           Jens spots Nancy, who stands there whisking a bowl of cream.

                                 JENS
                        I’ve come to invade your minds and 
                        see if you’re worthy. I’m serious. 

           Jens scans the room taking in the remains of dinner: dirty plates, 
           glasses of vodka, a carved ham and knife.

                                 NANCY
                        What’s he talking about, dear?

                                 JENS
                        I’m taking very serious measures 
                        here because I know how you work. I 
                        know how you flip switches. Little 
                        wires trip in Lizzy’s head and she 
                        can’t help it.

                                 NANCY
                        What is he talking about?

                                 JENS
                        Sir, Mr. Haysom, I’m sure you know 
                        and maybe you’ve done some things 
                        yourself. Maybe so, but I don’t 
                        know about that. But I do know 
                        about your wife and how she loves 
                        your daughter in ways she ought 
                        not. So that’s why I’m here.

                                 DEREK
                        I’m too astounded to speak. If I 
                        haven’t been speaking, that’s why.

                                 JENS
                        You haven’t been speaking because I 
                        don’t want you to speak. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JENS (CONT'D)
                        I’m already in your brain and I’m 
                        powerful. Now listen to me--

                                 DEREK
                        Boy, I used to stick little fuckers 
                        like you for nothing.

                                 JENS
                        Little fuckers like me have 
                        demands. Number one, you will 
                        acknowledge your sins.

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll get the cake.

           Nancy buzzes out, pretending nothing’s wrong.

                                 JENS
                        Number two, money.

           Derek rushes Jens and slams him against the wall. He squeezes 
           Jens’ throat like he’s going to kill him.

                                 DEREK
                        Get the fuck out of my house. Get 
                        out and if I ever see you again...

           Derek squeezes Jens’ neck tighter and then lets go.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        I won’t let go.

           Jens catches himself on the sideboard. His hand is an inch from 
           the ham and the knife.

           Jens wraps his fingers around the knife handle and clutches it 
           tight.

           Derek looks at him like, “You don’t have the guts.”

           But he does. 

           Jens plunges the knife into Derek’s neck.

           There’s blood everywhere.

           Nancy comes at Jens with another knife.

           Jens puts up a hand in defense, his flesh slicing open as he 
           catches the blade between his fingers.

           Jens wrenches the knife away.

           He lashes out at Nancy, stabbing the knife into her shoulder.
           INT. SCOTLAND YARD INTERROGATION ROOM #2 - DAY

           [We’re back in the present.]

           We’re intent on Reese as she watches Jens. She’s steady. Careful 
           not to give him anything.

                                 JENS
                        So what happens now?

           SUPER OVER BLACK: 1988

           INT. HOTEL ROANOKE, LIZZY’S ROOM - DAY

           We’re intent on Lizzy. She’s wearing a chic orange blouse with a 
           belt. She’s not defiant anymore. She’s an upstanding girl from a 
           good family.

                                 LIZZY
                        With Jens it was different. I 
                        thought he was my soulmate. My life 
                        partner. My creative partner. My...

           She pauses to take a sip of water. She’s alone in the room, 
           sitting on the edge of her bed.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        With Jens it was different. I 
                        thought he was my soulmate. My life 
                        partner. He opened a door for me.

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, ROOM 102 - DAY

           Lizzy is on the stand. She’s wearing the orange blouse.

           The proceeding is closed, so the benches are empty.

                                 LIZZY
                        With Jens it was different. I

                        partner. But, because of him, I’m 
                        pleading guilty today as an 
                        accessory to murder in the first 
                        degree. Because of him--

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, ROOM 102 - DAY

           Reese is near the courtroom’s main exit. She’s waiting, watching.

           Closer to the doors, SANDY DAVIS, an attorney, has her hand 
           protectively on Lizzy’s back.
                                 DAVIS
                        Are you ready?

           Lizzy glances back at Reese.

                                 DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Are you ready?

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A MOB OF REPORTERS descends on Lizzy as a BAILIFF opens the 
           courtroom door. Davis tries to protect her.

                     REPORTER #1
                                                       REPORTER #2
           How do you feel after today’s 
           hearing?
                                             Was it your idea for Jens to 
                                             confront your parents? 

           COURTHOUSE POLICE OFFICERS jump in to carve a path for Lizzy.

           Reese slips out of the courtroom unaccosted.

           She heads away from the fray, towards a door at the other end of 
           the hall.

           REESE GOODCHILD (late 20s), a reporter with a pixie cut, catches 
           up with her.

                                 GOODCHILD
                        Reese Goodchild, Roanoke Times. 
                        I’ve never met another Reese 
                        before.

           Reese glances over at her, but does not reply.

                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Those guys are chasing the wrong 
                        story. I want to know about you.

           Reese keeps walking. She’s just a few feet from the door.

                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Give me something. How’d 
                        you get that confession out of 
                        Jens?

           Reese won’t bite.

                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth Haysom pleaded guilty as 
                        an accessory to murder. Do you 
                        think that’s the right charge?

           They reach the door, but Goodchild gets in front of it.
                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        One thing I’m particularly 
                        interested in. You’re not a 
                        homicide detective anymore, are 
                        you? But you’re still involved in 
                        this case. How does that work? Is 
                        that like an official unofficial 
                        thing?

                                 REESE
                        Are you going to follow me to the 
                        parking garage?

                                 GOODCHILD
                        She speaks.

                                 REESE
                        You didn’t answer my question.

           Goodchild takes out her card.

                                 GOODCHILD
                        Give me a call if you want to talk.

           Reese does not take the card. Instead, she opens the door and 
           slips through.

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           The only sounds are the fluorescent hum of overhead lights and 
           Reese’s footsteps.

           Or is there another sound?

           Reese glances over her shoulder. WALT, a tall man in a faded army 
           jacket, heads in her direction. Probably just going to his car.

           Reese keeps walking.

           Walt gains on her. Maybe he’s not just going to his car.

           Reese increases her pace, but she can’t put any more distance 
           between them without breaking into a jog.

           She turns to confront the guy.

                                 REESE
                        Can I help you?

                                 WALT
                        I’ve been trying to help you. Did 
                        you get what I sent you?

           What the hell is this guy talking about?
                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        I drew a picture for you. The guy 
                        you’re looking for.

           Reese turns and starts walking towards her car again.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        He looks a lot like that kid you 
                        popped, but with long hair.

                             (getting her keys out)
                        For one thing, today’s hearing 
                        wasn’t about Soering. It was about 
                        Haysom, who’s already pleaded 
                        guilty. For another thing, Jens 
                        Soering is still in England.

                                 WALT
                        I’m not talking about Jens! I’m 
                        talking about the guy you should be 
                        looking for! The guy who’s still 
                        running around laughing at you!

           Finally, Reese gets to her car. Walt grabs her arm.

           Reese twists out of his grip and pulls out her gun.

           Somehow Walt has whipped out a gun too. A big gun, like a .44 
           Magnum. In the scuffle, he pulls the trigger.

           The shot echoes in the closed space. The bullet glances Reese’s 
           arm, tearing away a hunk of flesh.

           She hits the ground, her gun skittering away.

           Blood spreads across the sleeve of Reese’s jacket.

           Walt bolts.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           On television, a LOCAL REPORTER stands in front of the courthouse 
           interviewing an OPINIONATED CITIZEN.

                                 OPINIONATED CITIZEN
                        I say accessory? Accessory? Are you 
                        kidding me? She planned the whole--

           Dante switches it off. He looks to Reese, who’s in a hospital bed, 
           recovering.

                                 DANTE
                        I brought your things.
           Dante holds up the picture of her father, the tape player, and 
           some tapes.

                                 REESE
                        Thanks.

                                 DANTE
                        How are you feeling?

           Reese shrugs. It hurts.

                                 REESE
                        Ow. Fine.

           Dante sets her things down on the bedside table. He pulls up a 
           chair and sits down.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        Put one on one of the tapes. You 
                        pick.

           He looks through the tapes and puts on Enya by Enya.

           After some tape hiss, the floating, wistful notes of the opening 
           track come out of the tinny speaker.

                                 DANTE
                        When they first told me you were 
                        shot, I didn’t know how bad it was.

                                 REESE
                        It’s okay. I’m okay.

           Reese pushes herself up in bed. Dante takes her hand and squeezes 
           it. Then he remembers something.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Dante lets her hand go.

                                 DANTE
                        Look, there’s something I have to 
                        get out of the way. Something I 
                        have to tell you.

           Reese waits for him to go on, but Dante doesn’t quite know where 
           to start.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        Soering’s going to be extradited.

                        I know.
                                 DANTE
                        But he recanted his confession. He 
                        said he only confessed because he 
                        believed Haysom did it. He thought 
                        he was protecting her.

                                 REESE
                        That’s bullshit.

                                 DANTE
                        The DA’s worried about the 
                        circumstances of the confession. 
                        He’s keeping you out of their case.

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, ROOM 106 - DAY

           JUDGE WILLIAM W. SWEENEY presides over a jam-packed courtroom. 
           Three television cameras and their OPERATORS loom in the back. The 
           whole thing is a zoo.

           Situated between his attorneys, Jens watches Lizzy on the stand.

                                 LIZZY
                        He had a choice. He had a four hour 
                        drive.

           Lizzy pauses. The magnetic force between her and Jens makes her 
           look over at him. For a moment, they make eye contact.

           She rips herself away.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        No matter what I had said to him 
                        before that, he had a choice 
                        whether he killed my parents or 
                        not.

           Reese watches from the last row in the gallery. She can sense the 
           energy in the room. Jens doesn’t have a chance.

           INT. ROANOKE COUNTY COURTHOUSE, PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Reese unlocks her car. An old Honda pulls up nearby and Goodchild 
           rolls down the window.
                                 GOODCHILD
                        Detective Rezek. Reese Goodchild--

                                 REESE
                        Roanoke Times. “Never met another 
                        Reese before.” I remember.

                                 GOODCHILD
                        Just a spectator for this one, huh?

           Reese shrugs. Goodchild holds out her card, but Reese doesn’t 
           reach for it.

                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you’ll want to talk sometime. 

           She keeps holding the card out.

                                 GOODCHILD (CONT’D)
                        Come on. It won’t bite.

           Mostly to get her to go away, Reese takes the card.

           INT. WOMEN’S PRISON, VISITING ROOM - DAY

           Live coverage of Jens’ trial is on a wall-mounted TV, but the 
           sound is off.

           At a dozen tables, FRIENDS and FAMILY visit with PRISONERS.

           A TOUGH GUARD brings Lizzy to a table where Reese is waiting.

                                 TOUGH GUARD
                        One hour.

           Lizzy notices Jens on TV as she sits down.

                        He looks terrible up there.

           Reese looks to the TV. Even without sound, Jens looks self-
           satisfied and obnoxious.

                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        Nodding along, looking sarcastic. 
                        If I were his lawyer, I’d tell him 
                        to cut it out.

                                 REESE
                        You think he’d listen?

           Lizzy shrugs.
                                 LIZZY
                        Why are you here? They told me 
                        you’re not a part of this anymore.

                                 LIZZY
                        I doubt that.

                                 REESE
                        I’ve got this picture I carry 
                        around with me. A framed picture. 
                        It’s of my dad. He was a cop. He 
                        liked boxing. He liked drinking 
                        navy grogs at Trader Vic’s after 
                        his shift. Just one, because one 
                        was enough.

           Lizzy can’t figure what Reese is getting at.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I tell people. But do 
                        you want to know the truth?

                                 LIZZY
                        Sure.

                                 REESE
                        Everything I just said is what my 
                        aunt told me. Later on, she told me 
                        none of it was true. She got the 
                        picture from a yard sale and made 
                        all that stuff up.

                                 LIZZY
                        She should have just left it alone.

                        I started asking too many 
                        questions. I tried to find my dad 
                        in old newspapers. He was killed in 
                        the line of duty. That’s what she 
                        said. So I tried to find him, but 
                        he wasn’t there. So she had to tell 
                        me.

                                 LIZZY
                        So who was your dad really?

                                 REESE
                        He was a drunk. He drank himself to 
                        death before I was born.
                                 LIZZY
                        But you still carry the picture?

                        I wanted to be a detective because 
                        of him. I thought I had this link 
                        to him. Even though we never knew 
                        each other.

                                 LIZZY
                        So you must have been pissed, 
                        right? I mean, when you found out.

                                 REESE
                        For me, everything I knew before

                        Don’t try to see me again. Ever.

           INT. ROANOKE POLICE DEPARTMENT, DETECTIVES BULLPEN - DAY

           Reese takes a sip of coffee and sits down at her desk.

           She tries to refocus, to forget Jens and Lizzy.
           She picks up a stack of papers from her in-box.

           She jumps as Dante taps her on the arm. Looking at him, she can 
           tell he has important news.

                                 DANTE
                        Soering was found guilty.

           Reese doesn’t reply. She opens a Manila envelope marked, “Det. 
           Rezek - Urgent!”

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        I know you were in the courtroom. 
                        Watching I mean, so I thought...

           Reese looks up from the envelope before seeing what’s inside.

                                 REESE
                        He looked like a little shit on the 
                        stand. The jury hated him. He never 
                        had a chance.

           She finally sees what’s in the envelope. It’s a VHS tape of a 
           movie called Stripped to Kill. On the cover, a stripper clasps a 
           giant knife in place of a pole.

           It dawns on Reese that this is supposed to be a joke. Dante can 
           tell she’s about to snap.

                                 DANTE
                        Let it go.

           She should definitely let it go. Not give them the satisfaction. 
           But she holds up the tape for everyone to see.

           resist anymore.

                                 FIELDING
                        You know, that’s a great movie. 
                        This sexy police lady goes 
                        undercover as a stripper. Maybe, 
                        you should check it out. See if it 
                        inspires you.

           Oh. He put the tape in my box.

           She hurls the tape at Fielding’s head.

           TWHACK! The tape hits him square on the forehead and he goes down.

           Dante touches Reese’s arm, but she pulls away.

                                 REESE
                        Don’t touch me.

           Fielding picks himself up and wipes the blood off his forehead 
           with a handkerchief.

           Reese is deadly calm.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I get it. You’re right. I don’t 
                        belong here. I’m leaving now and 
                        I’m not coming back.

           Everyone watches as Reese pulls on her jacket.

           She takes a sip of tepid coffee.

           She pulls her badge out and puts it on her desk.

           She picks up the picture of the man who’s not her father.

           She looks around to see if she forgot anything. No.

           She makes eye contact with Dante. There’s nothing either of them 
           can say surrounded by these people.

           Reese turns and walks out the door.

           TEENAGE GIRLS in t-shirts and sweatpants stand in pairs on a big 
           blue mat.

           Reese watches over them.
           She looks different now. For one thing, her hair is short. But 
           it’s more than that. All of the tension wound up inside her has 
           gone slack. It’s hard to tell if she’s happy or numb.

           INT. REESE’S VW RABBIT - NIGHT

           The car is parked in the strip mall lot. Reese starts it up and 
           the radio comes on.

           Reese switches the radio off.

           EXT. SUBURBAN CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

           Reese pulls her VW into an open spot. A muffled cheer comes from 
           one of the houses. She’s in the right place.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Reese walks in.

           The place is stuffed with CO-WORKERS and their FAMILIES. Holyfield 
           vs. Foreman is on a huge TV.

           Kids run around. People not interested in the fight chat in the 
           kitchen. There’s a huge spread of food.

           PAUL (60s), a spectacled man in a checked shirt, spots her.

                                 PAUL

           Perfect Strangers is on a small TV on the counter. Some people are 
           watching, but most are chatting or preparing more food.
           Reese opens the fridge and grabs a beer.

           Perfect Strangers goes to commercial. It’s a spot for the 11 
           o’clock news.

           Reese sleeps on her pullout couch. Or tries too.

           She can’t get the covers right. Or the pillow.

           She turns on a lamp to check the time: Just past 3 in the morning.

           Why can’t I shut off my brain?

           INT. VIRGINIA UNITED INSURANCE - DAY

           INSURANCE MEN AND WOMEN work in cubicles.

           Pages of a complicated insurance form appear in the tray of a copy 
           machine.

           Reese grabs them and navigates back to her desk.

           She sits down and checks some figures on her computer.

           The phone rings.

                        my name. It’s Walt Whitman. Like 
                        the poet. I own a German car 
                        specialist shop outside Lynchburg. 
                        And, what I was trying to tell you 
                        that day, was I wrote you a letter 
                        where I laid it all out. But--

           She hangs up.

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A light blinks on the answering machine.

           Reese presses play. It rewinds. For a while.

           It clicks, beeps, and begins to play.

                                 WALT (V.O.)
                             (on the answering machine)
                        Since you won’t talk to me, just 
                        listen. I wrote you a letter, back, 
                        oh, four, five years ago. I guess 
                        you read it, thought I was a crank.

           Walt pauses to clear his throat. Reese’s heart races.

                                 WALT (V.O.)
                        Or maybe you never got the letter 
                        and that’s why Soering got nailed 
                        the way he did. See, in my letter, 
                        I laid it all out. With a drawing I 
                        made and everything. And the point 
                        is just this: I saw the man who did 
                        the Loose Chippings job and it 
                        wasn’t Soering. Now, how come you 
                        should believe me? I’ll tell you 
                        how come. You should believe me 
                        because I’m calling and putting 
                        myself out there. Hell, you could 
                        probably get me sent up to the can.

           Reese pulls her VW off of a rural road, into the cracked, weedy 
           lot of Whitman’s.
           She turns the car off, looking out at the forlorn garage and the 
           scrapyard.

           a tangle of German cars in various states of deconstruction, but 
           no sign of Walt Whitman.

           smoking a cigarette. He’s about the same age and build as Jens. 
           But this guy has long, curly hair.

           He puts the seat forward.

           On the floor is a hunting knife. With just enough spots of blood

                                             I’ll tell you what it takes. You 
                                             not only have to prove the 
                                             convicted guy didn’t do it, you 
                                             more or less need to prove who 
                                             did.

                        What if people’s lives are wasting 
                        away in prison because I fucked up? 
                        This isn’t some theoretical thing. 
                        This is real.

           Dante focuses on finishing off his first burger. After he does, he 
           turns to Reese.

                                 DANTE
                        You’ll go crazy if you think like 
                        that.

           Reese shrugs.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        We can’t run DNA locally. We’d have 
                        to send it to D.C.
           He glances at Reese’s untouched bowl of chili.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        Eat your chili. Come on. Before it 
                        gets cold.

           Reese eyes him. Then she picks up her spoon and takes a bite of 
           chili.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the other thing? You said 
                        there were two things.

                        I want to look at the evidence

                                 DANTE
                        I don’t think I can help you with 
                        that.

           Reese eats her chili. After a while, she stops, staring into her 
           bowl.

           She leans her head on Dante’s shoulder. For a moment, he lets her 
           stay there.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do that.

           But neither of them moves right away.

           Then Reese takes her head off his shoulder and goes back to eating 
           chili.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           Distant mountains tower over the bleak, asphalt prison yard.

           The place is entirely deserted except for Reese and Jens, who sit 
           across from each other at a round metal picnic table.

                        knew something was wrong?

           Jens thinks this over for a long time.

                                 JENS
                        I didn’t know until later. I mean,

           Reese pulls out a tape recorder. She meets Jens eyes for a moment. 
           It’s okay.

           She hits the record button.

           The clock on the nightstand says it’s 3:59.

           Jens sits on the edge of the bed watching MTV. The video for 
           “China in Your Hand” by T’Pau is on.

           Jens watches as the lead singer lies down in a stream, her red 
           hair flowing in the rushing water.

           THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

           Someone’s banging at the door. Jens springs up and tears it open.

           Lizzy stands there, wrapped in a sheet. Jens pulls her in.

           Lizzy lets the sheet drop to the floor.
           Her clothes are covered in blood.

           She reaches into her back pocket, pulls out a stack of Polaroids, 
           and hands them to Jens.

           They’re nude photos of fifteen-year-old Lizzy and they’re covered

           Nancy whisks a bowl of cream. Derek sits at the table.

           Lizzy is at the table too, slapping her fingertips against the 
           palm of her hand. Her energy is weird. Like she’s thinking twice 
           as fast and deep as normal.

                        It’s about Mother.
           There’s a carved ham on the sideboard. And a knife. Lizzy wraps 
           her fingers around the handle.

                        Do you know what she’s done to me?

           Derek takes too long to answer. Lizzy is right behind him. She’s 
           got the knife in her hand.

                                 DEREK
                        No. I don’t know what you mean.

           Lizzy puts a hand on Derek’s shoulder. He looks up at her.

           She slices through his neck like butter.

           He’s too surprised to resist. Blood cascades everywhere.

           Lizzy calmly stabs him once, twice, three times.

           He falls out of his chair as Nancy comes in. Before she can 
           scream, Lizzy pushes her against the wall.

                        Don’t scream Mother, don’t scream.

           Lizzy looks Nancy in the eyes. She wants Nancy to see her.

           Nancy’s going to scream, but Lizzy stabs her in the throat.

           In the bathroom, Jens has managed to get Lizzy into the tub.

           The shower is on, but she won’t stand up.

           She lies on her side, watching pink streams come off her body and 
           swirl down the drain.

           Jens sits on the floor next to her. As blood comes off her arm, he 
           sees track marks on it.

                                 JENS
                        Listen to me. Are you listening?

                                 LIZZY
                        I’m listening, Jens. I’m listening.

                                 JENS
                        You were with me. At the movies. 
                        And if you weren’t... I was the one 
                        who did it.

           She reaches up and clutches his hand in hers.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

                                 REESE
                        And the Polaroids? What happened to 
                        them?

                                 JENS
                        We put them in a trash bag. Along 
                        with her clothes. We threw the 
                        whole thing in a dumpster the next 
                        day.

                                 REESE
                        Where?

                                 JENS
                        A parking lot. Behind that place 
                        with the funny name. I remember 
                        because Lizzy got a hot dog there. 
                        Weenie Beenie.

           FLASH: A trash bag goes into a dumpster behind Weenie Beenie.
           It feels true. The whole thing feels true, but--

                                 REESE
                        I’ve been to the room, Jens. Your 
                        room at the Marriott.

           It takes Jens a second to switch from thinking about the dumpster 
           to thinking about the Marriott.

                        The shower’s tiny. Elizabeth

                        you said.

           FLASH: Pink water swirling down the drain.

                                 JENS
                        Maybe she was curled up or sitting 
                        down. I don’t know. Forget the 
                        shower. I’m telling you: Lizzy 
                        killed them and she had someone’s 
                        help.

           EXT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Confidently and methodically, Reese picks the lock.

           INT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Evidence boxes are packed into rolling metal shelves, the kind 
           mounted on tracks to collapse like library stacks.

           Lit by her flashlight, Reese turns a crank on the end of a shelf. 
           It creaks and moves, opening up a narrow aisle.

           She searches the shelves for the boxes she wants.

           Her flashlight lands on “Soering, Jens.”

           She pulls down a box and opens it. Crime scene photographs. A 
           transcript of Jens’ confession. Not what I’m looking for.

           She replaces the box to its shelf and pulls down another.

           First thing she finds is footprint analysis. Could be something.

           Reese turns on a camcorder and presses the record button.

           She shines her flashlight onto the document and tilts the camera 
           from top to bottom.

           She hears a door opening. Oh no.

           The lights come on.
           Voices. Two FORENSIC TECHS. Her heart races.

           She turns off her flashlight.

           She presses the button the stop the camcorder, which makes a tiny 
           beep. Shit. How loud was it?

           The techs pass her aisle without a glance. Okay. Just wait it out.

           Then she hears a crank turning.

           Her aisle begins to close up.

           She shoves files into the box and gets it on the shelf.

           She finds an empty space in the shelves big enough to cram herself 
           into.

           She gets in place just as the shelves clang together, sealing her 
           in.

           She catches her breath. Well, this is great.

           She sees a sliver of overhead lights through the gap at top of the 
           shelves. It’s a strange perspective. Claustrophobic and 
           uncomfortable, but oddly peaceful.

           Muffled voices. Sounds like the techs found what they were looking 
           for.

           Footsteps.

           The lights go off.

           The door closes.

           Reese switches on her flashlight. The beam lands on the shelf 
           directly facing her. Right on a box marked Haysom, Lizzy.

           Reese contorts herself to get leverage with her legs against the 
           opposite shelf.

           CLANG! She kicks at the shelf.

           CLANG! The shelf gives a little.

           CLANG! She opens up a gap.

           CLANG! Another couple inches.

           CLANG! Finally, enough space to roll off of the shelf into a pile 
           on the floor.

           She gives it a second to catch her breath.
           Uncoiling herself, she sits up and pulls out the box of Haysom 
           material.

           She flips through a few folders.

           Nothing too exciting.

           Wait. What’s this?

           A transcript of a witness statement. From Bedford County Sheriff 
           Dave McLeod. Something about a traffic stop. Something about two 
           men with a rented van. Why is this here?

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The camcorder is hooked up to the TV.

           Reese watches footage she recorded of McLeod’s statement.

           She presses the pause button.

           She leans close to the TV to study a line of text that ends, 
           “...gave false names.”

           The phone rings. Reese picks it up.

                        I ran the DNA. A lot of it’s no 
                        good anymore. But they think 
                        there’s blood from four different 
                        people.

                                 REESE
                        Four?

                                 DANTE (V.O.)
                        That’s what they think. And listen. 
                        With the condition of the DNA they 
                        can’t be positive, but what they 
                        think is none of the four are a 
                        match for Soering or Elizabeth 
                        Haysom.

           Holy shit. Okay. What does it mean? Reese looks to the paused 
           image of the document on her TV.

                        Later on, you took a statement from

                        same night, but their van was 
                        impounded because they didn’t have 
                        paperwork on it. And remember what

                        auto shop guy who saw Haysom three 
                        days after Loose Chippings. She was

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - DAY

           Camcorder slung around her shoulder, Reese fights her way up 
           wooded hillside, stepping over ferns and fallen logs.

           She comes to a chain-link fence surrounding a dirt lot.

           In the lot, Reese sees a couple partly-restored muscle cars, a 
           busted tour van, and half a dozen motorcycles.

           Beyond the lot is a misshapen building. What might have started as 
           a farmhouse has been built out with concrete blocks, plywood, and 
           corrugated metal. Surrounded by barbed wire fencing, the place 
           calls to mind a half-baked survivalist compound.

           It’s dead quiet as Reese settles in to watch from the tangle of 
           undergrowth near the fence.

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - DAY, LATER

           Reese squats to pee.

           As she finishes, she hears the sound of a car approaching. She 
           pulls up her pants and gets back into position near the fence.

           She turns on her camcorder as Lance Sloane, opens the gate to let 
           in a green Mercedes convertible. Oscar Doyle gets out of the car.

           TRASK and STAMBLER, two men who look like they could have played 
           in Doyle’s hardcore band, unload big plastic jugs from the trunk 
           of the Mercedes.

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Reese has the camcorder hooked up to the TV.

           She plays back footage of the men unloading the Mercedes.

           The footage jumps to another day from a slightly different 
           perspective.

           Sloane and Doyle talk with an AGING PUNK WOMAN. Money changes 
           hands. Reese holds down the fast-forward button.

           The phone rings. Reese looks at it, but doesn’t answer.

           Reese’s answering machine clicks and her own voice comes on.
                                 REESE (V.O.)
                             (on the answering machine)
                        It’s Reese. Sorry, I’m not here 
                        right now. Leave a message and I’ll 
                        call you back.

           The machine beeps.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                             (on the answering machine)
                        Reese, this is Paul. From Virginia 
                        United Insurance. I know you’ve 
                        been sick and... Well, I just hope 
                        you’re--

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - DAY

           In her usual spot, Reese turns the camcorder on as a beat-up Mazda 
           stops at the gate.

           The driver honks.

           Doyle and Sloane come out of the house. Doyle unlocks the gate and 
           walks it open. The Mazda drives through.

           Doyle pulls a gun as a TEENAGE SKATER gets out of the car.

           BANG! Doyle shoots him in the shoulder.

           The skater hits the ground. Holy shit.

           Doyle yells something, but Reese can’t make it out. The skater 
           hauls himself back into the car.

           Doyle and Sloane watch as the skater backs up his car, turns 
           around, and drives away.

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS, SHARON HUGHES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Reese plunks a fat envelope down on the desk and slides it across 
           to Hughes.

                                 REESE
                        You told me to get in touch again 
                        if I ever had anything.

           Hughes glances at the envelope, but doesn’t touch it.

                                 HUGHES
                        It wasn’t supposed to be like a 
                        lifetime invitation.

           Reese shrugs. Hughes opens the envelope and dumps out a dozen Hi8 
           tapes.
                                 HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        I heard you weren’t a cop anymore.

                                 REESE
                        We’ll have to talk about that. 
                        Because I’m not doing this just for 
                        fun. There’s something I want from 
                        you too.

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh yeah, I bet there is. What is 
                        it? Or should I be afraid to ask?

           INT. DEA SUV - DAY

           DEA AGENTS are in gear for a raid.

           Reese sits in the back wearing a bulletproof vest. She watches out 
           the rain-lashed window as they charge up a steep, muddy incline.

           At the top, they bust through the gate of Doyle’s compound.

           Reese steadies herself as they squelch to a halt. DEMARCO, the 
           driver, turns to her.

                                 DEMARCO
                        You’re not here, remember?

                                 REESE
                        I remember.

           The agents get out of the SUV, joining three others getting out of 
           another SUV behind them.

           Reese watches as they approach the compound, becoming dim shapes 
           as they move away in the downpour.

           She wipes fog off the window to try for a better look, but all she 
           sees is the last agent disappearing around a corner.

           She settles in to wait, listening to the rain on the roof.

           The seconds tick by.

           Reese hears something. So faint she can’t be sure she heard it. 
           What was it? She opens the door a crack to listen.

           A gunshot.

           Two more shots.

           Reese closes the door. She’s not even here.

           Ten seconds go by.
           Twenty.

           The rain comes down harder than ever.

           Reese opens the door and gets out of the SUV.

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Reese moves through ankle-deep mud towards the compound.

           Rain soaks her to the bone. Water runs down her face as she comes 
           around the corner of the building and draws her gun.

           Ahead, she sees a porch covered by a sheet of metal. She hurries 
           up the steps, passing through a cascade of water running off the 
           roof.

           The door in front of her stands open. Beyond it, a bare bulb 
           shines light on what looks like a laundry room.

           She steps through the door.

           INT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           Unmarked jugs line the walls. On the far side of the room are two 
           closed doors. To the left, a screen door leads to a passageway.

           Reese listens for gunshots or any sign of life.

           She can’t hear a thing.

           A flash of lightning. A clap of thunder. The light bulb flickers, 
           comes back on, and then dies.

           The power is out.

           On instinct, Reese goes through the screen door.

           She finds herself in a dirt-floored corridor running around the 
           edge of the building.

           Thick drops of water fall on her face. Looking up, she realizes 
           that the roof is made up of metal sheets.

           Two gunshots tell her she’s on the right track.

           Heart racing, she moves down the corridor, emerging at a junction 
           that looks like metal sheds patched together with junkyard parts.

           She chooses a direction and comes to the head of a steep 
           staircase. Hurrying down the steps, she descends into the darkness 
           of a concrete tunnel.
           There’s a splash of light on the wall. It’s a flashlight someone 
           must have dropped.

           She picks it up and shines it down the tunnel.

           Directly overhead, there’s a flurry of gunshots.

           She moves to a set of stairs at the end of the tunnel. She 
           switches the flashlight off.

           Looking up the stairs, she sees a nebulous square of light.

           More gunshots ring out as Reese eases up the stairs.

           She emerges through an open trapdoor and finds herself at the back 
           of a large storage room.

           With a feeling like hot ice in her veins, she realizes that she’s 
           come out behind the men defending the compound.

           Against the far wall, taking shelter behind piles of scrap metal, 
           are the DEA agents.

           Nobody notices Reese.

           She’s frozen in place, caught between wanting to take action and 
           wanting to delay the moment when people notice her.

           With a sputtering buzz, the power comes back on.

           There aren’t any overhead lights, but points of white-purple 
           appear. It’s the lights in dozens of homemade reptile terrariums.

           Nearest to Reese, a spiky lizard looks up at her from its desert 
           habitat.

           Still, nobody has seen Reese, but some sixth sense tells Sloane to 
           turn around.

           BANG! Reese squeezes the trigger of her .38 and Sloane goes down.

           Doyle shoots back, missing Reese by an inch and shattering the 
           desert terrarium in an explosion of glass.

           Reese ducks behind a gigantic, glass-encased swamp habitat as more 
           shots ring out.

           A few yards away, another terrarium shatters, spewing glass across 
           the floor.

           Trask and Stambler keep taking shots at the DEA agents, while 
           Doyle creeps around to get a better shot at Reese.

           Reese takes a peek out from behind the swamp habitat. She catches 
           sight of Doyle as he edges into a patch of darkness.
           Reese glances down at her foot as an errant lizard skitters across 
           it. When she looks back up, she sees Doyle getting into position 
           to take a shot at her.

           BANG! Reese shoots first.

           She misses.

           Doyle returns fire.

           He misses too.

           Doyle ducks behind what looks like a rusted-out concrete mixer.

           Reese notices that she’s face to face with a baby crocodile, some 
           three feet long, on the other side of the swamp habitat’s glass.

           She shuffles sideways, peeking out to check her flank.

           She can’t see much. Wasn’t there one other--

           Trask rushes her.

           BANG! She shoots Trask down, scrambling backwards.

           Now she’s in Doyle’s line of fire.

           Doyle pulls the trigger, hitting Reese in the shoulder.

           But she finally has a clear shot at Doyle.

           BANG!

           Doyle goes down.

           BANG! CRASH! A DEA agent’s stray bullet blasts away the glass of 
           the swamp habitat. Murkey water cascades out, flinging the baby 
           crocodile across the floor.

           The DEA agents swarm around, tackling Doyle’s men.

           It’s over.

           Rain pounds on the roof. Reese catches her breath.

           She looks at the slug lodged in her bullet-proof vest.

           The scene around her is surreal. The DEA agents hold men down in a 
           standard tableau, but with a disoriented baby crocodile staggering 
           towards them.

                                 DEMARCO
                        Rezek, is that you?

                                 REESE
                        Yeah.
           Demarco appears from behind the wreckage of the swamp habitat. He 
           helps Reese up.

                                 DEMARCO
                             (smiling)
                        I told you to stay in the car.

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - DAY

           The place is a chaos of flashing emergency lights.

           Taking shelter from the rain under an overhang, Reese watches EMTs 
           move Doyle towards the back of an ambulance.

           He’s conscious. Just as the EMTs get him in the ambulance, he and 
           Reese catch each other’s eyes.

           INT. LOOSE CHIPPINGS, LIZZY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           [It’s 1985. The night of the murders, as imagined by Reese.]

           Lizzy sits at her desk, meticulously brushing Wite-Out onto a 
           blurry Polaroid of a naked woman’s chest and hips.

           TAP, TAP. Someone quietly knocks at the window.

           Lizzy takes a steadying breath and the slides the window open.

           Doyle and Sloane are waiting outside. They slip in through the 
           window. They’re wearing gardening gloves.

           Lizzy has two kitchen knives ready for them. They each take one.

           Without another word, they swoop out of the room.

           Lizzy brushes Wite-Out onto her pinky nail as she strains to 
           listen.

           Silence. Silence.

           A scream. Her father’s voice. He’s shouting. Another scream.

           Lizzy breathes quicker. It’s really happening. It’s really--

                                 DEMARCO
                        Rezek.

           EXT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND - DAY

           [Demarco’s voice pulls Reese back to reality.]

                                 DEMARCO
                        Inside’s clear.
           INT. DOYLE’S COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY

           The wall is covered with hand drawn hardcore posters.

           Reese has white gloves on. She’s going through the desk. What am I 
           looking for?

           She opens drawers, carefully searching for something to go on. If 
           I just knew what I was looking for.

           Someone is watching her.

           Reese turns around and finds Sharon Hughes leaning in the doorway.

                                 HUGHES
                        You might be relieved to know that 
                        nobody you shot is going to die.

                                 REESE
                        Oh.

                                 HUGHES
                        This could have been a shitty day 
                        for us, but it was alright because 
                        of you. So thanks for that. But I 
                        am about to contend with the tiny 
                        little problem that you’re not 
                        actually one of my agents.

                                 REESE
                        Well, like you told me, I’m not 
                        here.

                                 HUGHES
                        Yeah, that was okay before you 
                        started shooting people.

           Oh. So this is going to be bad.

                                 REESE
                        So what are we going to do?

                                 HUGHES
                        I haven’t figured that out yet. But 
                        you being here could really twist 
                        everyone’s panties. It depends.

                                 REESE
                        On what?

                                 HUGHES
                        On whether or not I can figure out 
                        some way to sell this as kosher. 
                        And what side of the bed my bosses 
                        wake up on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGHES (CONT'D)
                        But let me tell you, unusually 
                        they’re just looking for a reason 
                        to get those panties twisting.

           Hughes checks her watch.

                                 HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        Okay. For one thing, don’t be here 
                        when the techs arrive. Those little 
                        guys don’t like people touching 
                        shit like you’re doing right now. 
                        And they like filing complaints. 
                        That gives you ten minutes.

           Reese nods.

                                 HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        You find what you’re looking for?

                                 REESE
                        Not yet. I want to talk to Doyle.

                                 HUGHES
                        Jesus H. Fuck, talk to Doyle. First 
                        thing is, we’re trying not to get 
                        fucked here. You ever hear about 
                        the weight of bureaucracy?

                                 REESE
                        Talking to him was the whole point 
                        of this. None of this means 
                        anything if I don’t find out 
                        whether he’s the guy I’ve been 
                        looking for.

                                 HUGHES
                        Listen, just lay low and don’t do 
                        anything until I call. Don’t call 
                        my office. And sure as shit don’t 
                        go talking to anyone until I know 
                        how it shakes out.

           Reese nods. Okay.

                                 HUGHES (CONT’D)
                        And please, please get the fuck out 
                        of here before the techs arrive.

           Hughes turns and leaves before Reese can say anything.

           Okay. Ten minutes.

           Reese opens up a file cabinet. Papers are crammed in every which 
           way. Whatever I’m looking for isn’t here.

           She closes the file cabinet.
           There’s nothing here.

           She examines a shelf. It’s full of three ring binders, hardcore 
           zines, and shoeboxes.

           Reese opens one of the shoeboxes. It’s full of tapes. She pulls 
           one out. It’s unmarked.

           INT. REESE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Exhausted, Reese tosses the shoebox of tapes on her coffee table.

           She flops down on the couch.

           After a moment, she reaches across the narrow canyon between the 
           couch and the coffee table to inch the shoebox closer.

           She pulls out a tape. There’s no label, but someone’s scratched in 
           “1/6/85.”

           She feels around under the couch and comes up with her tape 
           player. She sticks in Doyle’s tape and presses play.

           It’s fuzz and distortion.

           Then something rhythmic comes through. The beginning of a song. It 
           must be a recording of a harcore show.

           Reese lets her head loll upsidedown off the side of the couch.

           The thrashing beat of the song is so warped it sounds like a 
           broadcast from outer space.

           Reese presses stop on the tape.

           Her head is still upsidedown off the edge of the couch, but an 
           overwhelming exhaustion sweeps over her.

           Before she knows it, she’s--

           RING!

           Reese jolts awake and--

           BANG!

           She hits her head on the coffee table.

           RING!

           Disoriented, she staggers to the phone.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Doyle is bandaged and resting in bed. He’s watching an episode of 
           Star Trek: The Next Generation.

           Reese flips the TV off. Doyle looks over at her, pissed.

                                 DOYLE
                        I don’t have shit to say to you 
                        people without my lawyer.

           Reese sits down, facing him in a stiff plastic chair.

           She watches him calmly. Play it slow. Make him curious.

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you going to say something?

                        from watching you.

                                 DOYLE
                        Well, cut it out. It’s freaky.

           Reese just keeps watching. Doyle looks her over too.

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Do I know you?

                        That’s not it.

           Doyle studies her. Reese lets him. Keep him curious.

                                 REESE
                        Picture me about five years 
                        younger. Bad Brains shirt. Ripped 
                        up tights. Turned out I was a narc.

           Now Doyle remembers.
                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        You showed me pictures of your 
                        band. Then I saw a picture of you 
                        and that girl who killed her 
                        parents. What was her name?

                                 DOYLE
                        You’re talking about Lizzy Haysom.

                                 REESE
                        Turned out, her boyfriend killed 
                        the parents to prove his love. At 
                        least, that was the DA’s case.

                                 DOYLE
                        Sounds like you know something 
                        about it.

           Reese watches Doyle. She’s waiting for her moment.

                                 REESE
                        Why don’t I tell you what I think? 
                        Then if I’m wrong, you tell me to 
                        fuck off.

           Her intensity is freaking Doyle out. He doesn’t know what to say.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        I think someone went with Lizzy to 
                        kill her parents that night. Only 
                        it wasn’t the man who’s in prison. 
                        It was you. Maybe you were her 
                        dealer. Maybe you two got fucked up 
                        that night and she asked you to do 
                        something for her.

           Doyle chuckles. He picks up the remote and turns the TV back on. 
           It’s a commercial for Hot Shots!

                                 DOYLE
                        You pigs are dumber than I thought.

           He looks to Reese.

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        I was her dealer. You got that much 
                        right. And sometimes she’d go on 
                        about knocking off her folks. And 
                        oh my god, wouldn’t she just fuck 
                        the brains out of anybody who’d 
                        help her. But I wouldn’t touch that 
                        crazy girl’s murder plots with a 
                        ten foot pole, man. Now, you’ll 
                        like this.

                        Back then, a while after that 
                        German twat went through with it, I 
                        started to think you dumbshits 
                        would pick up a thread, mix things 
                        up, and get some idea about me. And 
                        that scared the shit out of me. So 
                        guess what? I checked to see what I 
                        was up to that weekend. Want to 
                        guess?

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           A live recording of Doyle’s band plays on Reese’s tape player.

           Reese stops it.

           She looks up to Jens who sits across from her. He’s puzzled.

           She pops the tape out. Written in Sharpie on a piece of masking 
           tape it says, “Ottawa - 3/29/85.”

           She pulls three more tapes out of her pocket.

           Somehow, Reese knew Lizzy would ask. She reaches into her purse 
           and pulls out the framed picture. She sets it on the table between 
           them.

           Lizzy stares into the man’s eyes.
                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        He even kind of looks like you.

                                 REESE
                        I think so too.

           Lizzy starts the voice recorder.

           They let it run for a while, capturing nothing but the air between 
           them.

                                 LIZZY
                        What’s your name?

           Sounds like the opening question of an interview. Reese decides to 
           play along.

                                 REESE
                        Reese. Reese Rezek.

                                 LIZZY
                        How many years have we known each 
                        other?

                                 REESE
                        Six.

                                 LIZZY
                        And how’d you get on this path?

                                 REESE
                        It was my job.

                                 LIZZY
                        Still?

                                 REESE
                        No.

                                 LIZZY
                        I got on my path because I went to 
                        a movie. I met Jens at the movies. 
                        We were supposed to meet and fuck 
                        and get pissed off and forget each 
                        other. Imagine me and you at a bar 
                        right now. We’re there and I say, 
                        remember that guy I dated in 
                        college? I wonder where he is now. 
                        You know, one time we went to the 
                        movies and we saw George Bush. Can 
                        you believe it?

           Reese smiles.
                                 LIZZY (CONT’D)
                        We could have had a fun talk about 
                        it. But now it’s not fun. Now all I 
                        have is this. I’m Lady Macbeth for 
                        the rest of my life.

           EXT. DANTE’S HOUSE - DAY

           A suburban brick house with a mowed lawn. 

           GABRIELLE (5), Dante’s daughter, stands in the open front door 
           looking up at Reese.

                                 GABRIELLE
                        Daddy! There’s a lady here!

           I/E. DANTE’S STUDY/BACKYARD - DAY

           KIDS play in the pool. They shriek and splash and do all the 
           things that normal kids do.

           Separated by a halfway open sliding glass door, Dante sits in his 
           study with Reese. He’s wearing shorts and a t-shirt.

           They’re listening to playback on Reese’s tape recorder.

                                 LIZZY (V.O.)
                             (on a tape recording)
                        I have just one thing to say about 
                        Lady Macbeth, because apparently 
                        nobody’s read the play. It was Lady 
                        Macbeth who died of remorse and 
                        grief and killed herself. It was 
                        Macbeth who discovered his true 
                        nature.

           Reese presses stop.

                                 REESE
                        But nobody asked what happened to 
                        the ghost. They all forgot about 
                        him by the end.

                                 DANTE
                        What ghost?

                                 REESE
                        The ghost. His father. I know it 
                        doesn’t make that much sense, but 
                        that’s what I feel like.

                                 DANTE
                        That’s Hamlet. There’s no ghost in 
                        Macbeth.
           Shit, really? Reese lets this soak in.

                                 REESE
                        Oh. Well, I guess I’ve been in the 
                        wrong play.

           Dante nods and squeezes her hand. It’s okay.

           They make eye contact and Reese knows that he wants to tell her 
           something.

                                 REESE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DANTE
                        I’m getting divorced. My wife’s 
                        leaving me.

                                 REESE
                        But you’re always so... I mean, I’m 
                        sorry. What happened?

                                 DANTE
                        My job. That was part of it. And I 
                        guess she met someone else.

           There’s tension here. What’s he trying to say?

                                 REESE
                        I’m not going to be here. I mean, 
                        I’m moving to Arlington.

                                 DANTE
                        I know.

           They’re not rejecting each other. Just stating facts. Outside, one 
           of the kids jumps in with a big splash.

                                 REESE
                        I wish I had a suit.

           They watch the kids having fun for a few moments.

                                 DANTE
                        You could borrow one of my wife’s 
                        suits.

                                 REESE
                        That would be weird, right?

           EXT. DANTE’S BACKYARD - DAY, MINUTES LATER

           Reese stands on the edge wearing one of Dante’s wife’s suits. It 
           has pastel flowers and parrots on it. Not like Reese at all.
                                 GABRIELLE
                        Get in! Get in!

           Reese acts like she’s not going to, then she makes herself all 
           stiff and keels over into the pool with a huge splash. It’s weird 
           and funny, like Buster Keaton almost. The kids love it.

           Everyone splashes and screams and loves Reese. She’s happy and 
           loose and not thinking about anything except right now.

           INT. DEA HEADQUARTERS, HALLWAY - DAY

           A WORKER slides a placard into the holder next to an office door.

           It says, “Reese Rezek, Special Agent.”

           EXT. DEA HEADQUARTERS, REESE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Pouring rain streaks down the tall, narrow windows.

           The modern, comfortable room is set up with sleek filing cabinets 
           and a large desk.

           The door opens and Hughes shows Reese into her new office. We 
           can’t hear what they’re saying because we’re outside. Probably, 
           Hughes is razzing Reese for not liking the DEA.

           After a moment, Hughes leaves Reese alone.

           Reese looks around, taking in the room that’s meant for her.

           She opens up a filing box and gets out the picture of the man 
           who’s not her father.

           She sets him up on her desk and sits down, staring at him.

           She picks up the picture and pulls a hammer from an open toolbox 
           on the floor.

           CRACK. SMASH! She uses the hammer to break away the glass.

           Shaking the glass into the wastebasket, she pulls out the picture.

           She looks at the back. It says, “Love you Dee, always. Robert.”

           She rips the picture in half and throws it away.

           Reese moves to the window, looking out at the wet, inhospitable 
           world.

           For now, she’s dry and she has an office.

                                                               THE END.
