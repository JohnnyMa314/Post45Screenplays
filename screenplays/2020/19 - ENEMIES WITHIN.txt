                                  ENEMIES WITHIN

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Golden hour works its magic on the gridded streets of a 
           freshly constructed New Jersey subdivision. Every porch 
           of every near-identical ranch house proudly displays an 
           AMERICAN FLAG; as a breeze blows through, they LIFT IN 
           SEQUENCE, almost seeming to hail a 

           PASSING TRUCK. Old, but maintained with pride.

           INT./EXT. TRUCK - SAME

           AARON GOLDMAN, early 30s, bites his lip, taps the wheel 
           nervously. On the passenger seat next to him is a 
           MYSTERIOUS, SMALL PACKAGE WRAPPED IN BROWN PAPER.

           As he navigates a few turns, his ANXIOUS EYES, reflected 
           in the rearview mirror, focus on a SEDAN a block back. Is 
           it following? One minute he loses it, the next it 
           appears. Heightening the paranoia is a SPEECH PLAYING 
           FROM THE RADIO, a thundering baritone voice:

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (RADIO)
                        After a world war has been won, men’s 
                        hearts should anticipate a long peace -- 
                        and men’s minds should be free from the 
                        heavy weight that comes with war. 

           The truck makes another turn. Aaron’s eyes in the 
           rearview, searching for the sedan. This time it doesn’t 
           appear. He’s relieved, maybe even a little embarrassed at 
           himself as the speech continues:

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (RADIO) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        But this is not such a period -- for this 
                        is not a period of peace. This is a time 
                        of “the cold war.” This is a time when 
                        all the world is split into two vast, 
                        increasingly hostile armed camps.

           Through the windshield, we see cars parked in the 
           driveway of and on the street next to a house up ahead. 
           Some kind of party. As Aaron parks the truck:

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (RADIO) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        The reason why we find ourselves in a 
                        position of impotency is not because our 
                        enemy has sent men to invade our shores, 
                        but rather because of the traitorous 
                        actions of those who have been treated so 
                        well by this nation.
           One last check in the rearview: nothing. Aaron kills the 
           ignition, swipes the box off the passenger seat and stows 
           it in his pocket.

           As he enters the house’s front door, the sedan TURNS ONTO 
           THE BLOCK. Slow, prowling. Two SILHOUETTED FIGURES 
           inside, their faces obscured by the reflections of trees 
           traveling over the glass. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE

           Aaron walks through the empty house, more confident now, 
           the flicker of a smile on his face as the sounds of a 
           BACKYARD PARTY grow louder: music, laughter. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD

           Emerging through the patio doors, Aaron finds a BIRTHDAY 
           PARTY underway. At the sight of him, a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN 
           (JUDY) makes her way through the clusters of conversation 
           and greets him with an ENTHUSIASTIC KISS. 

           Pulling away, in a teasing tone:

                                 JUDY
                        Late for your own girlfriend’s birthday?

           Aaron pats his pocket, smiles enigmatically.

                                 AARON
                        Had to pick up your present. 

           Seeing the outline of the small box, Judy’s EYES WIDEN. 
           She knows exactly what that means:

                                 JUDY
                        Wait, are you ...

                                 AARON
                        Don’t spoil it -- ah, to hell with it. 

           Aaron DROPS TO ONE KNEE. A THRILLED HUM travels through 
           the party guests as they all turn to look--

           Judy clamps a hand over her mouth, tears in her eyes--

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        Judy, from the moment we met--

           And that’s the moment when the two US MARSHALS come 
           BURSTING THROUGH THE WOODEN GATE.
                                 MARSHAL #1
                        Aaron Goldman!

           Aaron’s head jerks around to see the two marshals SWIFTLY 
           ADVANCING ON HIM, one holding an OMINOUS-LOOKING MANILA 
           ENVELOPE that he pulls away to reveal a SUBPOENA.

                                 JUDY
                                (nervous)
                        Aaron, what is this--

                                 MARSHAL #2
                        You are hereby issued a subpoena to 
                        appear before the United States Senate 
                        Subcommittee on Investigations regarding 
                        your work at Fort Monmouth -- and your 
                        relationship with Julius Rosenberg. 

           You don’t have to know exactly who Rosenberg was or what 
           he did -- the HORROR creeping across the faces of the 
           guests is PLENTY as they all turn to Aaron as if they’ve 
           never seen him before. Even Judy has gone PALE.

           Aaron attempts to stammer--

                                 AARON
                        I -- I think there’s been some mistake--

                                 MARSHAL #1
                        We don’t make mistakes. 

           Holding out the subpoena:

                                 MARSHAL #2
                        We can’t leave until you accept it. 

           Aaron blinks in disbelief, but somehow his feet carry him 
           the short distance to where the marshals stand. He 
           reaches hesitantly for the document -- it might as well 
           be red-hot magma to him -- so Marshal #2 THRUSTS IT INTO 
           HIS HAND as Marshal #1 says contemptuously:

                                 MARSHAL #1
                        Traitor. 

           Panning across everyone’s STRICKEN EXPRESSIONS, Aaron’s 
           the MOST HORRIFIED OF ALL--

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        Today we can almost physically hear the 
                        mutterings and rumblings of an 
                        invigorated god of war. 
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME

           A SCHOOLTEACHER leads her students in a bomb drill. They 
           crouch under their desks as a transistor radio narrates:

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (RADIO)
                        The mad moment has not yet arrived for 
                        the exploding of the bomb, which will set 
                        civilization about the final task of 
                        destroying itself. 

           INT. STREETCAR - SAME

           Commuters heading home from work listen to the same 
           address as it blares from the streetcar’s speakers.

                                 MYSTERY VOICE (SPEAKER)
                        There is still a hope for peace, if we 
                        finally decide that no longer can we 
                        safely blind our eyes and close our ears.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREET - SAME

           MARGARET ADAMS, early 30s, pushes a YOUNG BABY IN A 
           STROLLER, a brown paper package tucked under her arm. 
           Pauses in front of an ELECTRONICS STORE -- every size of 
           TV in the window display all showing the same thing--

           SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY, a man in his prime, addressing a 
           BANQUET HALL from behind a podium, which he grips as if 
           holding fast to America itself as he continues:

                                 MCCARTHY (TV)
                        Today we are engaged in a final, all-out 
                        battle between Communistic atheism and 
                        Christianity. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - SAME

           Under their desks, kids look at one another with 
           frightened expressions as:

                                 MCCARTHY (RADIO)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, the chips are   
                        down -- they are truly down. 

           INT. BARBER SHOP - SAME

           BARBERS and their CUSTOMERS alike shake their heads in 
           disapproval as the radio on the counter goes on:
                                 MCCARTHY (RADIO)
                        It has not been the less fortunate who 
                        have been traitorous to this nation, but 
                        rather those who have had all the 
                        benefits America has to offer ...

           INT. STREETCAR

           Now all the commuters are STEALING GLANCES AT ONE ANOTHER 
           over their newspapers.

                                 MCCARTHY (RADIO)
                        This is glaringly true in the State 
                        Department. There the bright young men, 
                        born with silver spoons in their mouths, 
                        have been most traitorous. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREET 

           Margaret can’t help but HOVER OVER THE BABY PROTECTIVELY 
           as McCarthy goes on:

                                 MCCARTHY (TV)
                        When our great democracy is destroyed, it 
                        will not be because of enemies without, 
                        but rather because of enemies within.

           Shuddering, Margaret HASTENS ON. 

           AERIAL VIEW

           FOLLOWING NOW as, pushing the stroller, Margaret winds 
           her way through the city until she arrives in front of a 
           MODEST TENEMENT BUILDING and DISAPPEARS INSIDE.

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret’s husband JOHN G. ADAMS, mid-30s -- kind-faced 
           and trim, with a hairline that’s already beginning to 
           recede -- has draped two outfits over the ironing board. 

           ON THE LEFT -- an Army uniform, Bronze Star affixed 
           prominently to the lapel. 

           ON THE RIGHT -- a traditional suit and tie.

           At the sound of the DOOR UNLOCKING, Adams looks up, 
           smiles as Margaret pushes the stroller in.
                                 ADAMS
                        My beautiful girls.

           Margaret glances at the ironing board.

                                 MARGARET
                        What do the others wear?

                                 ADAMS
                        I was so nervous in my interview I didn’t 
                        even notice. 

           As Margaret hefts the sleeping baby from the stroller and 
           eases her into a waiting bassinet:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        If everyone else has on their greens I’ll 
                        look disrespectful. If everyone else is 
                        in suits I’ll look ostentatious. 

           Margaret lifts the bag. Balancing it on one hand, she 
           removes the brown paper to reveal a SPLIT OF FANCY 
           CHAMPAGNE. All she could afford. Smiling:

                                 MARGARET
                        Why shouldn’t you be ostentatious? A 
                        decorated veteran -- a graduate of law 
                        school -- a father -- and now counsel to 
                        the United States Army. 

                                 ADAMS
                                (re: the champagne)
                        You didn’t have to do that. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re right. I’m not sure there’s much 
                        to celebrate. Did you hear Senator 
                        McCarthy’s speech?

                                 ADAMS
                        I caught the end.

                                 MARGARET
                        Can that be right? Is it possible the 
                        government is riddled with spies?

                                 ADAMS
                        The Soviets got to Rosenberg. Who knows 
                        where else they might have a foothold. 
                                (re: the baby)
                        How was she today?
                                 MARGARET
                        A wonderful monster. But the stroller 
                        conked her out. 
                                (realizing)
                        If I pop this now she’ll wake up.

           Adams laughs.

                                 ADAMS
                        Maybe we’ll get an hour after dinner.

                                 MARGARET
                        Remember going out to eat?

           PRE-LAP the faint sounds of CLINKING GLASSWARE, the LOW 
           MURMUR of adult conversation as Adams smiles wryly. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Dimly. 

           EXT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - EVENING

           The restaurant sounds still MUFFLED as ROY COHN, 27, lean 
           and hollow-eyed but not unattractive, approaches the 
           stone edifice of the famously Republican -- and exclusive 
           -- CAPITOL HILL CLUB. As a uniformed employee holds the 
           door for him with a respectful nod:

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        Someone holding the door for you ...

           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           With the strut of a favored prizefighter hitting the 
           ring, Cohn passes through the club’s dining room.

                                 ADAMS (V.O.)
                        Table service ...

           Obsequious BLACK WAITERS serve WHITE MALE PATRONS, some 
           of whom glance at Cohn curiously as he passes through. As 
           a young Jewish guy, he’s unusual here, but not unwelcome. 

           As Cohn passes the BAR:

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        Cocktails just taste better when someone 
                        else makes them for you.

           If Cohn’s gaze lingers on the HANDSOME BARTENDER, that’s 
           his business and his business alone as he moves further 
           back to the club’s
           INT. SMOKING ROOM

           Where a FOG OF TOBACCO SMOKE temporarily clears before 
           him, revealing this establishment’s INNER SANCTUM. 

           Leather armchairs in INVITING CLUSTERS. Well-dressed 
           patrons selecting cigars from humidors. 

           And in the center of it all, a TIGHT SQUARE of FOUR 
           UNITED STATES SENATORS. Three we view in profile, 
           drinking whiskey and smoking cigars -- but mostly 
           LISTENING ATTENTIVELY to the fourth. With his back to us, 
           all we see is his COMBOVER and the fact that he clearly 
           RULES THIS CONVERSATION, whatever it may be. 

           Cohn bears down on this group -- his step slowing, a hint 
           of nervousness as he straightens his tie--

           --and then the head of the table TURNS, revealing the man 
           of the hour: SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY. His 45 years look 
           like 55 by today’s standards: he’s balding fast, rough-
           skinned and ruddy-cheeked, paunchy in the middle. 

           He’s also at the top of his game, and everybody here 
           knows it -- and so as his attention has shifted to Cohn, 
           SO HAS EVERYONE ELSE’S. They regard him curiously as he 
           manages to spit out:

                                 COHN
                        Senator McCarthy. Thank you again for the 
                        very gracious invitation.

           McCarthy waves this off with a friendly half-frown.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ve told you before -- it’s Joe. Get you 
                        anything? Cigar? Cocktail? Bobby, we need 
                        another seat!

           An ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WAITER comes scurrying over with a 
           chair. Black, like all of the staff here. Cohn takes him 
           in with an assessing gaze that lasts just a moment too 
           long before smiling in a way that says, I don’t belong 
           here either. As he joins the table:

                                 COHN
                        I’d take a gin martini, if it’s not too 
                        much trouble. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Olive? Onion? 
                                 COHN
                        Twist of lemon, if you have it. And thank 
                        you.

           Bobby smiles appreciatively before departing. Meanwhile, 
           to the others:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Gentlemen, this is the man -- Roy Cohn. 

           The other senators look at Cohn with FRESH INTEREST. KARL 
           MUNDT (age 52, R-South Dakota) removes his pipe long 
           enough to say:

                                 MUNDT
                        The mind that took down the Rosenbergs.

           Cohn smiles modestly.

                                 COHN
                        With all due respect, Senator Mundt, a 
                        jury of their peers made the decision. I 
                        merely helped present the facts.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’d I tell ya? On top of everything 
                        else, he’s humble. Unbelievable. 

           EVERETT DIRKSEN (57, R-Illinois) lowers his thick-rimmed 
           glasses to take Cohn in.

                                 DIRKSEN
                        But the masterstroke -- connecting the 
                        wife -- that was your work. Without you, 
                        she’d have walked free while he fried for 
                        both their crimes. 

           Cohn nods in polite acknowledgement as the youngest 
           member of the group, CHARLES POTTER (36, R-Michigan) 
           takes him in curiously. 

                                 POTTER
                        And now you’ve brought your talents here. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Roy’ll be serving in a prosecutorial 
                        capacity, but you’re already familiar 
                        with his work. It was his research into 
                        Communist infiltration in the State 
                        Department that first sounded the alarm. 

                                 COHN
                        I’m afraid I can’t take all the credit 
                        for that either. 
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Yeah, he had company all right. You all 
                        know the Schines, the hotel family? 
                                (off their nods)
                        Their oldest son David -- the heir 
                        apparent -- he and Roy musta visited 
                        every US embassy in Europe. 

           A nearly imperceptible electric hum travels from McCarthy 
           to Cohn on this. It registers in the way Cohn’s 
           expression FREEZES FOR A MICROSECOND before giving way to 
           a practiced, charming smile.

                                 COHN
                        Fortunately, Schine-affiliated hotels 
                        were happy to comp us our rooms.

           Cohn over-enunciates the plural on the last word to make 
           sure it doesn’t get lost in the hubbub. As if satisfied 
           by this, McCarthy leans back in his chair, continues:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        A guy like you is what we’ve been 
                        missing. Kind of mind that connects the 
                        dots, sees between the lines. Speaking of 
                        which -- first order of business.

           Bobby returns bearing a martini on a tray. Cohn accepts 
           it, sips before replying:

                                 COHN
                        I’m at your service. 

           He quickly shoots Bobby an approving smile before 
           returning his attention to McCarthy. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        There’s a fellow in the Army Counsel 
                        Office who could really be an asset to us 
                        when it comes to cracking the Fort 
                        Monmouth ring.

           As Cohn opens his mouth to reply:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re gonna say. But he’s 
                        new to the role.

                                 MUNDT
                        A blank slate.

                                 DIRKSEN
                        And you two have a lot in common.
                                 POTTER
                        He’s young like you. A JD like you. An 
                        outsider--

           Potter stops himself when he sees the look flashing 
           across Cohn’s face -- surprise mixed with obvious hurt 
           that Potter would state so openly that he doesn’t belong. 
           Swiftly correcting course:

                                 POTTER (CONT’D)
                        --to our world. You can be his guide. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Adams. John G. Adams. After the 
                        Rosenbergs he’ll be light duty. We get 
                        him on our side and there’s no telling 
                        where we might wind up. 

           McCarthy glances at a painting over the room’s fireplace. 
           An oil rendering of THE WHITE HOUSE. 

           EXT. PENTAGON - MORNING

           Adams -- wearing his suit -- pauses in front of the 
           columns of the Pentagon portico in appreciation of the 
           moment. A view of the river and DC beyond reflected in 
           the glass doors. 

           INT. ARMY COUNSEL OFFICES - LATER

           Adams sits in a chair facing a MASSIVE OAK DESK in an 
           ELEGANT OFFICE. Raises a coffee mug to his lips as he 
           glances around, taking in the details of the room: 
           polished wainscoting, framed certificates attesting to 
           Army service and awards, a window framing a gorgeous view 
           of Arlington. Mounted over the desk is an OIL PORTRAIT of 
           a bespectacled, white-haired man in a gray flannel suit. 

           Adams turns as the door behind him opens, admitting that 
           exact man in that exact suit. This is ROBERT T. STEVENS, 
           Secretary of the Army. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Counselor Adams. Sorry for the wait.

           Stevens sits behind the desk. Adams BLINKS, for a moment 
           seeing double. Nope. Not double. Just Stevens and the 
           portrait of Stevens. Surreal. 

           Noticing Adams looking:
                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        I know. My wife.

           Stevens squints downward at the papers on his desk. 

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        John Gibbons Adams. Bronze Star for 
                        service in Europe and Africa. 
                                (peering at him)
                        You look a little old to have been 
                        drafted.

                                 ADAMS
                        My brother was, so I enlisted.

                                 STEVENS
                        Looking out for him. Noble. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I just did what anyone would do.

                                 STEVENS
                        Don’t be so sure. And speaking of men who 
                        were more than happy to stay on this side 
                        of the ocean -- you clerked for the 
                        Senate Armed Services Committee? 

                                 ADAMS
                        Two years, yes, sir.

                                 STEVENS
                        Thankless work. So you must be familiar 
                        with the Subcommittee on Investigations.

                                 ADAMS
                        Vaguely, yes, sir. 

                                 STEVENS
                        They need our help looking into the 
                        service records of some fellows at Fort 
                        Monmouth. Trying to trace who may have 
                        fed information to the Rosenbergs. 

                                 ADAMS
                        All I want is to serve in any capacity I 
                        can, sir. 

           Stevens levels his gaze at him, bemused. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Soldier. I may be a general, but we’re 
                        not in the barracks anymore. You can 
                        speak freely.
                                 ADAMS
                        I suppose I’d hoped for something a 
                        little more -- rigorous than clerking. A 
                        challenge. 

                                 STEVENS
                        It’ll be plenty challenging, believe me. 
                        These guys are serious. They believe 
                        Communists are lurking among our ranks, 
                        and no amount of loyalty oaths can 
                        persuade them otherwise. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Are they right?

           Methodically, as if carefully choosing his words:

                                 STEVENS
                        I couldn’t say. 

           Adams frowns at this, but before he can respond:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        The Subcommittee’s hearings are closed, 
                        so I’ll expect daily memoranda on their 
                        work. Be meticulous. Even details that 
                        seem unimportant to you may matter. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Yes, sir. 

           Stevens shuffles the papers on his desk, then stacks them 
           officiously as if to say, conversation over. 

           INT. ADAMS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Adams enters his new office. File cabinets, a tiny window 
           with a battered shade -- a far cry from the opulence of 
           Stevens’ space. The only hint of cheer is a fern resting 
           on the desk, an unmarked envelope leaning on its pot. 

           Picking it up, Adams suppresses a fond smile, murmurs--

                                 ADAMS
                        Margaret ...

           But when he opens the card, his smile falters. The 
           cramped, masculine handwriting reads:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        John -- welcome to the team. Please join 
                        Special Consultant David Schine and I for 
                        lunch in the Pentagon dining room. 
           INT. PENTAGON DINING ROOM - LUNCHTIME

           White tablecloths, hushed conversations. As Adams enters, 
           scans the room:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Table by the window -- one o’ clock.

           Spying Cohn with DAVID SCHINE -- a cornfed, handsome 26-
           year-old -- Adams lifts a hand in greeting. As Cohn 
           SMILES WIDELY, beckoning him over:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Yours, Roy Cohn, Chief Counsel to Senator 
                        Joseph McCarthy.

           LATER

           Adams, Cohn and Schine sit over the remains of what looks 
           to have been a luxurious meal. The mood between them 
           collegial, friendly as Schine concludes:

                                 SCHINE
                        Of course my old man doesn’t see the 
                        purpose in any of this. Wants me to take 
                        over the business instead.

           Adams smiles.

                                 ADAMS
                        I know the feeling. 

                                 COHN
                        What’s your family’s line?

                                 ADAMS
                        We own a feed store. South Dakota. My 
                        brother runs it now. 

           Schine frowns magnanimously, as if struggling to equate 
           this with his own family’s empire. Moving on:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        But I have my own family. My wife and I 
                        met when we were serving overseas, and 
                        now we have a baby girl. 

           Cohn smiles, seems charmed by this. 

                                 COHN
                        I can almost see it -- a three-bedroom 
                        colonial, picture window, victory garden 
                        out back. Alexandria? Arlington?
                                 ADAMS
                        We live here in the city. Renting. 

                                 COHN
                        Well, you won’t have to endure that 
                        lifestyle for long. You know our boss has 
                        his eye on 1960. Anybody who’s a friend 
                        to him on his way up--

                                 SCHINE
                        Should get used to champagne linens in 
                        the halls of power. 

                                 COHN
                        Where do you hope your career takes you?

           Adams is a little overwhelmed by their solicitousness. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I suppose -- one day I’d like my boss’ 
                        job. Secretary of the Army. 

                                 COHN
                        That’s all?

                                 ADAMS
                        Providing for my family, serving soldiers 
                        like myself once upon a time -- that 
                        would be more than enough for me. 

                                 COHN
                        A man like you could make the laws, not 
                        just interpret them. I tell David the 
                        same thing.

                                 SCHINE
                        Korea will be plenty of public service 
                        for one lifetime. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Drafted?
                                (off Schine’s nod)
                        Sorry to hear that. 

                                 COHN
                        As was I. David’s much more useful to 
                        America here than off in a foxhole 
                        somewhere. He ought to be a general. His 
                        headquarters a penthouse at the Waldorf. 
                        Don’t you agree?

           Cohn locks onto Adams, his friendly demeanor temporarily 
           replaced with something else -- an intensity that Adams 
           can’t quite interpret. After a moment:
                                 ADAMS
                        Room service would certainly beat MREs.

           Cohn relaxes. Smiles gallantly. 

                                 COHN
                        And you’d know. Should we order dessert?

           David shakes his head. 

                                 SCHINE
                        You and your desserts. 

           Cohn hails a passing waiter. 

           INT. ADAMS OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Rain SPATTERS HIS TINY WINDOW as Adams works diligently. 
           At one hand is a CARBON LIST OF NAMES with FBI letterhead 
           entitled SUSPECTED SUBVERSIVES; at the other is an 
           accordion file spilling out CONFIDENTIAL SERVICE RECORDS. 

           Adams’ finger marks where he is on the FBI list -- one 
           LOUIS BAUM, whose service record Adams now consults. It’s 
           a long list of dates and postings, but one in particular 
           catches his eye: LANDSTUHL AIR BASE, in GERMANY.

           Thunder RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE as Adams circles Baum’s 
           name on the list. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT - MORNING

           A depressing, institutional room: peeling wood paneling, 
           flyspecked overhead lights. In the room’s center is a 
           long table at which Dirksen, Potter, Mundt and their 
           AIDES are seated, its center chair conspicuously empty. 

           Off to the side, Cohn and Adams sit together, watching as 
           McCarthy, limping faintly as he paces about, continues 
           his cross-examination of LOUIS BAUM. Mid-30s, sweating, 
           clearly nervous. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Where do you work now, Lou?

                                 BAUM
                        For the Signal Corps Supply Agency, sir. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And do you know a man named Aaron 
                        Goldman?
           McCarthy is now LOOMING OVER BAUM, who looks terrified.

                                 BAUM
                        I do. Fellows used to accumulate in the 
                        office until they had assignments, and 
                        that’s when I first remember Goldman.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Was Julius Rosenberg one of the men who 
                        “accumulated”?

           The COURT REPORTER clacks rapidly at her keys. 

                                 BAUM
                        I don’t remember. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        But you remember Goldman. 

           Once again, McCarthy’s limp is visible as he circles 
           Baum. Cohn murmurs to Adams in a low tone:

                                 COHN
                        Shrapnel. The Pacific.

           Adams’ face registers respect at this. Meanwhile:

                                 BAUM
                        I knew him better. Once we went out to 
                        dinner together with some other fellows.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And during this period of spending so 
                        much time with Goldman, did you suspect 
                        he was a Communist?

                                 BAUM
                        I mean, I knew he was liberal--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did that disturb you?

                                 BAUM
                        I didn’t really think much of it. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did you ever go to the others and tell 
                        them you thought it was important to keep 
                        away from Goldman?

                                 BAUM
                        I didn’t see any reason to. 
                                 MCCARTHY
                        So your testimony is that at no time did 
                        you feel that he might be a Communist. 

           Baum is now recoiling from McCarthy’s hulking presence.

                                 BAUM
                        I wouldn’t say that. I mean, you know, 
                        you never know exactly about people. Some 
                        people have more information than others, 
                        and you often find Communists are better 
                        informed -- they do more reading, they’re 
                        more interested in politics ...

           Baum trails off, realizing he’s made a misstep.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you had some doubt?

                                 BAUM
                        Yes. There was some doubt.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did you ever decide to break off your 
                        contact with him?

                                 BAUM
                        As I said, he was just an acquaintance of 
                        mine--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I don’t need a speech from you. I need 
                        you to answer my question. 

                                 BAUM
                        I saw him less, yes--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You saw him less because you thought he 
                        might be a Communist?

                                 BAUM
                        There was a small element of doubt.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did you ever go to anyone else and say, 
                        “It would be better to see Goldman less”?

                                 BAUM
                        I saw him so infrequently--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Listen to me. Did you ever go to anyone--
                                 BAUM
                        I don’t know what you mean--

           Exasperated, McCarthy THUNDERS:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Unless you be quiet until I finish asking 
                        these questions, I’m going to hold you in 
                        contempt of the committee. We have a lot 
                        of testimony about you, Lou, and you are 
                        going to tell us the truth or have your 
                        case submitted to a grand jury. Did you 
                        ever go to anyone and suggest to them 
                        that they see Goldman less because you 
                        thought he was a Communist?

           When Baum finally speaks, it’s in a tiny, browbeaten 
           voice:

                                 BAUM
                        No, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Are you sure, Lou?

                                 BAUM
                        Yes, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        All right, then. This will be submitted 
                        to the attorney general, with the request 
                        that it be submitted to the grand jury 
                        for an indictment for perjury. 

           McCarthy picks his briefcase up off the table and PATS IT 
           VEHEMENTLY as he goes on:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Because we have the evidence here, the 
                        sworn testimony, that Goldman freely told 
                        you he was a Communist and discussed 
                        Communist ideas with you. Or had you 
                        forgotten about that?

           Baum looks like he’s going to faint. 

                                 BAUM
                        I’m sorry -- this whole thing is so 
                        strange--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        If you change your mind and come in and 
                        decide to tell us the truth, you may. 
                        That’s all. You can go. 
           Baum rises limply, tears in his eyes, as a FEDERAL AGENT 
           takes him by the arm and leads him from the room. Cohn 
           turns to Adams, looking satisfied. 

                                 COHN
                        Not bad. 

           As McCarthy begins chatting with the other senators:

                                 ADAMS
                        So Baum was lying?

                                 COHN
                        The stammering, the nervousness -- don’t 
                        fall for it. They know looking pitiful is 
                        the best way to avert suspicion. 

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s how Rosenberg acted?

                                 COHN
                        The Rosenbergs, the Greenglasses, Perl, 
                        Sobell -- like they had a playbook. 

                                 ADAMS
                        And who exactly was Aaron Goldman?

                                 COHN
                        Colleague of Rosenberg’s. They worked 
                        side by side in the Signal Corps. 

           Adams looks impressed. Nodding to where McCarthy is still 
           talking quietly with the other senators:

                                 ADAMS
                        I should introduce myself.

                                 COHN
                        Another time. Joe briefs the press 
                        personally after every session. Don’t 
                        worry, he’s well aware that your work was 
                        essential. 

           Calling McCarthy by his first name implies a certain 
           familiarity. We know Cohn’s posturing, but Adams doesn’t, 
           inquiring naively:

                                 ADAMS
                        Wouldn’t holding a public hearing be 
                        easier?

           Cohn gives Adams a pitying look -- oh my naive one.
                                 COHN
                        How could the Subcommittee work 
                        effectively with headlines advertising 
                        our every move? The spies would disappear 
                        through Berlin before we could get our 
                        hands on them. This approach allows for a 
                        strategic flow of information -- enough 
                        to keep the public informed, but not 
                        enough to tip our hand.

           Adams watches thoughtfully -- even a touch admiringly -- 
           as McCarthy leaves the room. Clearly these guys know 
           their stuff.

           INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Adams and Margaret sit across from Stevens and his wife 
           DOROTHY (mid-50s, heavy brocade and jewels, serious rich-
           lady style). The remnants of a big, elegant meal on the 
           table. As Stevens raises his wine glass in a toast:

                                 STEVENS
                        To a very successful first month.

           Raising her glass, Dorothy adds:

                                 DOROTHY
                        And to your babysitter, for giving you a 
                        much-needed night on the town. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Amen.

           Everyone chuckles, clinks. Then, to Adams:

                                 DOROTHY
                        I hope this won’t embarrass you, but Bob 
                        has positively talked my ear off about 
                        what a wonderful job you’ve done. 

           Margaret beams at Adams, proud, as he replies with his 
           usual soft-spoken decorum:

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s very flattering. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        He sees a lot of himself in you.

                                 STEVENS
                        I guess that’s true. It’s not everyone 
                        who survives a war only to come back for 
                        seconds from their country.
                                 ADAMS
                        McCarthy did. 

           Stevens and Dorothy exchange a brief, hard-to-read look.

                                 STEVENS
                        Yes. “Tailgunner Joe,” that was his 
                        Senate campaign slogan, wasn’t it?

                                 DOROTHY
                        “America Needs A Tailgunner.”

                                 STEVENS
                        I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot more of 
                        that between now and 1960.  

           A strange silence descends. More about the absence of 
           anything else to say than anything that’s been said. 
           Finally, in a bright, moving-on tone:

                                 ADAMS
                        You know, Margaret served as well.

                                 MARGARET
                        Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency 
                        Service. It’s how we met. 

                                 DOROTHY
                        There was no option for women to enlist 
                        in our war. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It -- wasn’t always easy. Some people 
                        aren’t shy about wondering what kind of 
                        girl wants to wear a uniform. 

           Adams puts a hand over hers. 

                                 ADAMS
                        My kind, as it turns out.

           Stevens and Dorothy exchange smiles. These two are sweet. 

           INT. STATLER HOTEL - LOBBY - SAME

           The Statler is a classy hotel -- so classy that, 
           traveling through its lobby, we find a pair of frosted 
           glass doors, one for the “TEA SALON” and one for the 
           “MEN’S BAR.” This segregation is a mark of old-fashioned 
           propriety ... which, ironically, makes the bar an ideal 
           meeting place for a certain type of clientele. 

           Men like Cohn and Schine.
           INT. MEN’S BAR 

           We find them standing together at the bar, cracking up 
           over cocktails. There’s nothing outwardly unusual about 
           their appearance, nor is there anything outwardly unusual 
           about any of the other men in the bar ... except for the 
           fact that they’re all paired off. 

           This is a safe place. A place where if you were spotted 
           by someone not in the know, you wouldn’t need an alibi. 

           Maybe that’s why Cohn seems more relaxed than we’ve ever 
           seen him. In this light, laughing, freed from the kind of 
           eyeball-darting nerviness that marks his public 
           interactions, he looks handsome, warm, kind. 

           And then, in a flash, the OLD ALERTNESS RETURNS as a pair 
           of men squeezes past Cohn and Schine. These are JOHN 
           MONTGOMERY and MARVIN BRAVERMAN, both mid-40s. Montgomery 
           and Cohn meet eyes, clearly recognizing one another, 
           before the two older men find a spot down the bar.

           Schine, knowing in an instant what just happened, is 
           nervous, asks in a low tone:

                                 SCHINE
                        Okay?

           Cohn nods, replies simply:

                                 COHN
                        A friend. 

           Schine relaxes, reassured. 

           INT. ADAMS BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           The baby sleeps in a bassinet next to the bed. Adams and 
           Margaret are both sound asleep as well--

           --until the phone RINGS, startling them both and 
           awakening the baby, who begins to CRY.

           As Adams picks up the phone, Margaret goes to the baby.

                                 ADAMS
                        Hello?

           He glances at his alarm clock. It’s two a.m.

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        John? It’s Roy Cohn.
                                 ADAMS
                        Do you have any idea what time it is?

           He looks over at Margaret, who’s rocking the baby back 
           and forth with an annoyed expression. Nodding, Adams 
           picks up the phone base and carries it into the

           INT. HALL

           Shutting the bedroom door, Adams sits on the floor of the 
           hall as Cohn responds:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Look at that. Sorry. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Trouble sleeping?

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Sometimes. When something’s on my mind.

           Adams waits. After a moment:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        It’s just that David has to report for 
                        basic in a few days, and I was wondering 
                        if there’d been any progress on that 
                        matter we discussed.

                                 ADAMS
                        What matter is that?

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Getting him a direct commission. Making 
                        him an officer. 

           Adams frowns, confused. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        I thought it might have come up tonight.

                                 ADAMS
                        Tonight?

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Your dinner with Stevens.

           Whoa. Trying for a joking tone that’s belied by a faint 
           tremor in his voice:
                                 ADAMS
                        You put a tail on me, Roy?

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        This is DC. Everyone knows who had dinner 
                        with who.

           On Adams as he struggles to assimilate this:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        We need to work together to keep David 
                        where he belongs. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t have any control over that sort 
                        of thing. 

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Don’t underestimate yourself. Stevens 
                        likes you. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Is that all, Roy? Because, you know, 
                        we’ve got a baby--

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Of course. My apologies for losing track 
                        of the hour. 

           CLICK. The line goes dead. Adams stares at the phone in 
           his hand. 

           EXT. SCHINE HOTEL - MORNING

           A green awning bearing the name ROYAL SCHINE HOTEL snaps 
           crisply in the early morning breeze as Schine exits to 
           deferential nods from the two DOORMEN--

           --and is followed, a few moments later, by Cohn. 

           The two men don’t behave as if they’ve ever met, much 
           less know one another. Schine lights a cigarette. Cohn 
           stands twenty feet away to hail a taxi. 

           But as one pulls up to the curb, Cohn pales at the sight 
           of the figure exiting the backseat:

           SENATOR DIRKSEN, whom he met at the club with McCarthy. 

           A HORRIBLE SILENCE FOLLOWS as Dirksen steps onto the 
           curb, takes in Schine, Cohn, the space between them.
           It would be less suspicious if they were talking. But the 
           distance between them is conspicuous. It couldn’t be more 
           obvious what they were trying to do. 

           What they’ve been doing. 

           No one knows how to act. Schine continues smoking his 
           cigarette as if nothing’s wrong, but can’t keep sneaking 
           glances at the other two to see what’s happening. Cohn’s 
           features are shifting wildly as he struggles to decide on 
           a convincing way to play this off. Dirksen looks pained, 
           but not surprised -- the face of a man finding out 
           something he’d desperately hoped wasn’t true. 

           It’s been way too long now without a word uttered. Cohn’s 
           sweating as he realizes the only thing he can do is 
           double down on the fiction. 

           ON COHN as he keeps his eyes straight ahead and moves 
           toward the taxi, pretending Dirksen isn’t there. He walks 
           right by him, the man who praised him to the heavens in 
           the back room of the club, and doesn’t say a word. 

           ON SCHINE, taking the cue, stubbing out his cigarette and 
           going back inside.

           AND THEN ON DIRKSEN -- left alone in front of the awning, 
           staring at the two doormen. Their SMILING VISAGES drive 
           home how painfully close Schine and Cohn’s ruse came to 
           working. A silent opera just played out under their 
           noses, and unlike the senator, they have no idea.

           INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

           Cohn’s face is frozen as the streets of DC pass by 
           outside his window.

           Then, out of nowhere, he SLAMS A FIST into the seat in 
           front of him. One FAST, VIOLENT MOTION accompanied by a 
           FURIOUS SNARL.

           Then -- a stony expression of total control as he sits 
           back hard. The DRIVER too stunned to react.

           INT. ADAMS’ OFFICE - LATER

           Adams looks up from the paperwork on his desk as--

                                 COHN (O.S.)
                        Homosexuals.
           REVEAL him standing in Adams’ doorway. He’s trembling 
           ever so slightly. Something’s wrong, but Adams could 
           never guess what if he tried. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m sorry?

                                 COHN
                        Deviants. In the military. You and I both 
                        know they’re there. 

           Hesitantly:

                                 ADAMS
                        Of course I’ve heard rumors about certain 
                        fellows -- every soldier has, but--

                                 COHN
                        Then you agree. There’s a serious issue, 
                        one that’s being overlooked. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I suppose, if I forced myself to think 
                        like the enemy--

                                 COHN
                        That’s exactly the kind of thinking Joe 
                        respects.

           Then, as if he just thought of it:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        We should bring this to him. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m no wilder about the idea of perverts 
                        in the ranks than you are, but ... I 
                        don’t know, Roy. This takes us into an 
                        ambiguous area. 

                                 COHN
                        Of course I defer to your expertise--

           Adams frowns. There’s more than one way to take that. 

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        --I just saw an opportunity for you to 
                        impress him with your initiative. 

           On Adams’ face as he contemplates this, we hear Margaret 
           replying in PRE-LAP:

                                 MARGARET (V.O.)
                        But why?
           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Adams and Margaret sit at their cluttered kitchen table, 
           Margaret giving Rebecca a bottle. 

                                 ADAMS
                        To preemptively identify security risks. 
                        People with deeply held secrets could be 
                        vulnerable to Soviet blackmail. 

                                 MARGARET
                        If they’re so deeply held, then how would 
                        a Soviet spy know?

                                 ADAMS
                        There’s always talk.

                                 MARGARET
                        I was the subject of that kind of talk 
                        once.

           Adams looks at her in surprise.

                                 ADAMS
                        Really? Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        My CO took a liking to me. But the 
                        feeling wasn’t mutual.

                                 ADAMS
                        You never told me that.

           Margaret shrugs, turns her attention back to Rebecca. 
           After a moment, rubbing his temples:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        It’s a thread I’m afraid to pick at. 
                        Everyone has secrets. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Why stop at secrets? We can barely afford 
                        formula -- does that make us susceptible 
                        to Soviet overtures if money’s involved?

           Adams winces. That hurt. Trying his best to explain:

                                 ADAMS
                        Roy thinks it’s a chance for me to get 
                        closer to Joe. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Joe’s not your boss.
                                 ADAMS
                        He will be one day. 
                                (beat)
                        I don’t want you to have to live like 
                        this. It’s not -- this isn’t what I 
                        promised you.

           Now it’s Margaret’s turn to look at him in surprise. 
           After a moment, slowly, so it sinks in:

                                 MARGARET
                        John. You’re everything you promised me. 

           He looks up at this. Anguish turning to gratitude on his 
           face.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care if I have to clip coupons or 
                        do my own mending. I don’t care if we 
                        spend the rest of our lives in these four 
                        walls. All I care about is that when she 
                        asks us someday about this time, we won’t 
                        have to lie.

           He smiles faintly.

                                 ADAMS
                        What would I be proud to tell our 
                        daughter. 
                                (beat)
                        I like that. 

           Margaret smiles back. Then, reassuringly:

                                 MARGARET
                        Go to Stevens. Tell him what’s been 
                        happening. Even if he doesn’t know what 
                        to do, at least you’ll have done 
                        everything you could.

           Adams nods, already relieved. 

                                                             SMASH TO:

           INT. STEVENS’ OFFICE - MORNING

           Adams sits across from Stevens. He’s clearly just 
           unloaded everything. After a moment, slowly:

                                 STEVENS
                        They’ve got you right where they want 
                        you. 
           On Adams’ face as the relief we saw before turns back to 
           alarm:

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t -- help me understand.

                                 STEVENS
                        Refuse them and you’ll be in their 
                        crosshairs. Go along with them and 
                        they’ll have something they can use 
                        against you down the line.

                                 ADAMS
                        But Schine, the homosexual issue -- they 
                        were Roy’s requests. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Can you prove it?

           Adams falls silent. Stevens goes on, fuming:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        They don’t respect service -- not one of 
                        them. They think soldiers are just people 
                        who were too stupid or poor to find a way 
                        out of it. 

                                 ADAMS
                        McCarthy has a leg full of shrapnel--

                                 STEVENS
                                (impatient)
                        McCarthy fell off a ladder during a line-
                        crossing party. The only battle he ever 
                        fought in was the war on syphilis. 

           Seeing how taken aback Adams is by all of this, with a 
           regretful sigh:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        I thought I was protecting you. 

           His voice heavy with dread now:

                                 ADAMS
                        From what?

           Stevens is silent a beat, as if deciding how much he 
           should say. Then:

                                 STEVENS
                        You remember Millard Tydings? The senator 
                        from Maryland?
                                 ADAMS
                        The one who was photographed with the 
                        president of the Communist Party?

           Stevens can barely contain his derision. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Millard Tydings is from so much money 
                        they used to call him MyLord as a joke.  
                        He’s about as much a Communist as 
                        McCarthy is a war hero. 

           Off Adams’ continuing lack of comprehension:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        The photo was doctored. Fake. That’s how 
                        Joe and his cronies work. They’re too 
                        stupid to win on their own merits, but 
                        when it comes to underhanded tricks their 
                        brilliance knows no bounds. 

           Adams is stricken by this. Stevens attempts to rally, 
           saying in a comforting tone:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right. This is why I wanted a 
                        man on the inside. I just didn’t think 
                        they’d usher you into their circus quite 
                        so aggressively.  

                                 ADAMS
                        You could have trusted me with the truth.

                                 STEVENS
                        Now I know that. 
                                (beat)
                        If you’re wondering -- yes, this is it. 
                        The last moment you can quit and still 
                        claim ignorance. I wouldn’t fault you. 
                        All I’ll say is that if you stay, you’ll 
                        have the chance to protect the Army in a 
                        way no general ever even dreamed of, 
                        against a threat so insidious it might 
                        just do what two world wars couldn’t. 

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s not what I was wondering. 
                                (beat)
                        I was wondering where to start. 

           Stevens holds up his hands.

                                 STEVENS
                        You’ll have to tell me. 
           INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT - MONTAGE

           Day after day, Adams sits silently next to Cohn in the 
           basement room of the courthouse, watching as McCarthy 
           berates INTERVIEWEE AFTER INTERVIEWEE:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Were you ever a member of the Communist 
                        party?/Why did you sign that 
                        petition?/Your clearance level went up to 
                        top-secret?/And you saw Goldman at this 
                        dinner party? Who else was there?

           One by one, the interviewees respond:

                                 INTERVIEWEES
                        I plead the Fifth./I invoke my Fifth 
                        Amendment rights./I don’t want to answer 
                        that question./I don’t recall.

           Finally we land on McCarthy THUNDERING FURIOUSLY at an 
           unseen interviewee:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You are not going to play with the Fifth 
                        Amendment, sir!

           REVERSE TO REVEAL his subject: PHILIP RUBIN, mid-40s, 
           timid and terrified.

                                 PHILIP
                        I don’t intend to, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I don’t intend that you will. Do you 
                        realize that if you were not an associate 
                        of Goldman’s, you wouldn’t be 
                        incriminating yourself by answering the 
                        question? You’d merely say no. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I just stand on the Fifth Amendment.

           McCarthy SEETHES. Adams leans forward.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Rubin, following your time in the 
                        Signal Corps you were hired at Public 
                        School 50 as a history instructor?

                                 PHILIP
                        That’s correct.
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did you know that teachers who refuse to 
                        say whether they’re Communists are fired?

           Philip’s silent. After a moment, in a softer voice:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a bachelor, isn’t that right,    
                        Mr. Rubin?

           Adams glances sharply at Cohn. But Cohn is staring across 
           the room, studying Dirksen’s reaction to this change of 
           subject. After a moment’s hesitation:

                                 PHILIP
                        That’s right. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And you were born in -- 1911?

                                 PHILIP
                        Yes ...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s interesting that a man your age is 
                        still unmarried. I wonder what our 
                        colleagues in the Department of Education 
                        would make of that. 

           Adams scrawls on his pad: NEED TO TALK TO YOU. Passes it 
           to Cohn, who takes it in with an impassive look as:

                                 PHILIP
                        Fifth Amendment. I cite the Fifth 
                        Amendment. 

           Really wound up now:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        One final question: in view of the fact 
                        that we are at war with communism, and a 
                        great number of our young men have 
                        sacrificed in that fight--

           His limp is suddenly EXAGGERATED, THEATRICAL. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        --do you think any decent American, a law-
                        abiding American without troubles or 
                        perversions, would keep from government 
                        officials his knowledge of any possible 
                        members of the Communist conspiracy?

           Philip stares at her feet, bright red.
                                 PHILIP
                        I cite the Fifth Amendment on that.

                                 MCCARTHY
                                (contemptuous)
                        I’d like to see some of these Fifth 
                        Amendment cases tried in Russia. Try 
                        citing it there. 

           INT. MENS’ ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Adams practically shoves Cohn into the men’s room, then 
           locks the door behind them.

                                 ADAMS
                        What was that all about?

                                 COHN
                        Philip Rubin worked in Aaron Goldman’s 
                        department. His initials are all over 
                        their carbons. Who knows what else he had 
                        access to--

           Adams waves him off impatiently. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Not that. The “unmarried” part. 

           Cohn smirks. All the confirmation Adams needs.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        You took the homosexual issue to Joe 
                        behind my back?

                                 COHN
                        He needed to know. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Know what, Roy? What is there to know?

                                 COHN
                        You told me yourself that every soldier 
                        knew at least one homosexual. 

                                 ADAMS
                        That isn’t what I--

                                 COHN
                        Of course, I’d be happy to tell him I 
                        think it’s a dead end. If.

           Adams bites his lip. Angry.
                                 ADAMS
                        I already told you--

                                 COHN
                        David’s never had to fight a day in his 
                        life. For anything. If he goes to    
                        Korea ...

           Cohn’s tough facade temporarily gives way to just a hint 
           of vulnerability as he stumbles to finish the sentence:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        ... he’ll come back in a coffin. 

           Adams studies Cohn’s face. Looking into the other man’s 
           genuinely haunted eyes, it’s suddenly all coming clear to 
           him -- the intimacy, the threats, the accusations. 

           Realizing what’s happening, Cohn swiftly resumes his 
           PITBULL DEMEANOR, SNARLS:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        And that would hurt the Subcommittee’s 
                        work. Either you get him the commission, 
                        or we will wreck the Army. 

           With that, Cohn SPINS ON HIS HEEL and leaves. Adams’ jaw 
           is dropped, his countenance pale as he watches him go. 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - EVENING

           Adams exits the courthouse, still shaking from Cohn’s 
           threat. As he makes his way down the steps:

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, um, Mr. Adams?

           Adams turns to see ELLIE FRANK, mid-20s with the perky 
           look of a steno pool secretary, descending the steps 
           behind him, notepad and pen in hand. In a nervous rush:

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Ellie -- Eleanor -- um, I’m Miss 
                        Frank and I’m on the Washington desk for 
                        the Milwaukee Journal. Actually I am the 
                        Washington desk. And by desk I mean stack 
                        of fruit crates in my apartment.

           Adams raises an eyebrow at this. Misinterpreting his 
           look, she goes on hastily:
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking, but none of 
                        the men were willing to move. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Actually, I was thinking that Senator 
                        McCarthy is briefing the press pool right 
                        now. That’s where you should be. 

           Adams turns to walk away. But Ellie follows.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ve been to the briefings. But here’s 
                        the thing about them, and I don’t mean 
                        any offense--

           Adams raises a hand to stop her. 

                                 ADAMS
                        We shouldn’t talk about this here. 

           INT. GREASY SPOON - LATER

           Ellie continues chattering away in between VORACIOUS 
           BITES of a burger and fries. Clearly starving.

                                 ELLIE
                        My problem is that I haven’t been able to 
                        confirm almost any of the Senator’s 
                        facts. Mr. Cohn doesn’t think I’m 
                        important enough to sit in on the 
                        Subcommittee’s hearings, so I can’t check 
                        them myself--

           She pauses to swallow.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        --and every time I’ve tried to verify 
                        them independently I’ve come up short. 
                        But the Milwaukee Journal is Senator 
                        McCarthy’s hometown paper, so we’d look 
                        stupid if we were the only ones not 
                        running stories about him. My only option 
                        is to file without confirming the facts 
                        and then run a retraction later. 

                                 ADAMS
                        You’ve been publishing retractions?

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s my job.

           Noticing Adams smiling:
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        What? Is there something on my face?

           She frantically dabs at her lips with a napkin. 

                                 ADAMS
                        No. I was just thinking you remind me of 
                        my wife. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I assume that’s a compliment?

                                 ADAMS
                        Best one I can give. 

           Ellie smiles at this before going on:

                                 ELLIE
                        The problem is retractions are bad for 
                        business. My editor prints them, but 
                        they’re always buried. Who wants their 
                        newspaper to look like it’s constantly 
                        making mistakes? Nobody. 

                                 ADAMS
                        So what’s the question?

           Ellie polishes off her burger, continues with her mouth 
           still full:

                                 ELLIE
                        It just seems strange to me that the 
                        Army’s okay with McCarthy implying that 
                        it’s full of traitors and spies. 

                                 ADAMS
                                (careful)
                        The Army’s goal is to protect the country 
                        through thorough cooperation with the 
                        Subcommittee on Investigations. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Right ... except the way it comes off to 
                        anybody who’s thinking about devoting 
                        their talents and skills to the United 
                        States of America is that they’d better 
                        not read too much or talk too openly 
                        about politics or be married or god 
                        forbid unmarried or go to dinner parties 
                        unless they’ve fully vetted the 
                        background of every single guest or have 
                        attended a single mandatory union meeting 
                        back in 1938 even if not going to it 
                        would have meant losing their job. 
           She pauses to ram french fries into her mouth. In an 
           impressed tone:

                                 ADAMS
                        You’ve done your research. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I have, and I know that not one of these 
                        witnesses has turned out to be guilty of 
                        a damn thing. Everybody does. But you’ll 
                        never see that printed, because nobody’s 
                        more aware than the writers themselves of 
                        how hard McCarthy will come for them if 
                        they cross him. It’s a nice line, 
                        “protecting the country,” but the country 
                        is the people, and from where I’m 
                        standing the people don’t seem protected 
                        at all. 

           Ellie stops, reddens. Maybe that was too far. Adams peers 
           at her for a moment. Then:

                                 ADAMS
                        Eleanor Frank, was it? From the Milwaukee 
                        Journal?

                                 ELLIE
                        Ellie. 
                                (beat)
                        Am I in some kind of trouble?

           Adams rises.

                                 ADAMS
                        No. Just wanted to be sure I remembered. 
                                (beat)
                        Keep it up. 

           He departs before Ellie can react to this. 

           INT. SENATE BUILDING - ARCHIVE - NIGHT

           A basement room lined with institutional shelves housing 
           bankers’ box after bankers’ box of documentation. Adams 
           scans their labels until he finds the one he’s looking 
           for: 1953 SUBPOENA RECORDS, CO - CZ.

           Aaron Goldman’s file is easy to find, given that it’s 
           about three inches thicker than the rest. Adams opens it, 
           browses the titles of the mimeo-d documents:

           GOLDMAN, AARON - HARVEY SACHS TESTIMONY
           GOLDMAN, AARON - HAYM G. YAMINS TESTIMONY
           GOLDMAN, AARON - BARRY BERNSTEIN TESTIMONY

           On and on they go. Adams flips further back, past the 
           hearing records to a document with an FBI HEADER:

           SUSPECTED SUBVERSIVES 

           It’s the same list of names he was working from before. 
           Behind it is Aaron’s LOYALTY QUESTIONNAIRE. Adams pulls 
           it out, reads the questions aloud to himself:

                                 ADAMS
                        Foreign travel. Foreign investments. 
                        Membership in clubs, organizations and 
                        unions. Contributions to causes. Magazine 
                        and newspaper subscriptions. Are you now 
                        or have you ever been a member of the 
                        Communist party.

           Aaron’s form is just a LONG COLUMN OF NOS. But whose 
           wouldn’t be? Adams moves on to another item in the file, 
           furrowing his brow as he reads the title:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Cleared personnel ...

           The document has the same header as the list of suspected 
           subversives, but different introductory copy. The date is 
           also different -- it’s some SIX YEARS EARLIER than the 
           date on the subversive list.

           Swiftly, Adams stuffs both documents into his briefcase. 
           Glances around, paranoid, before replacing the bankers’ 
           box, taking care to align it perfectly with those on 
           either side so that it looks undisturbed. 

           EXT. STATE ROAD - MORNING - AERIAL VIEW

           Adams’ car travels up the coastal highway. Out of DC, 
           headed north toward Jersey. 

           INT. ADAMS’ CAR

           As he drives, a pop song by the Kavaliers jangles:

                          See that guy with the red suspenders
                      Driving that car with the bright red fenders
                        I know he's one of those heavy spenders
                                Get that Communist, Joe

           Annoyed, Adams SILENCES THE RADIO. 
           EXT. JERSEY APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Adams climbs the steps to a decrepit apartment building, 
           then knocks on one of its doors. As he waits, his eye 
           falls on the MEZUZAH mounted to the frame. 

           After a moment, the door opens to reveal our man from the 
           introduction AARON GOLDMAN. And he has fallen a LONG way 
           since then. Unshaven, in boxers and suspenders, he 
           clutches a beer in spite of the early hour, squints 
           suspiciously at Adams before saying:

                                 AARON
                        Help you?

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m so sorry to disturb you, Mr. Goldman. 
                        My name’s John G. Adams. I’m general 
                        counsel to the US Army.

                                 AARON
                        A lawyer.

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s my job to represent the Army’s 
                        interests in Senator McCarthy’s hearings.

                                 AARON
                        Then you’re too late. 

           Aaron starts to swing the door shut. Swiftly:

                                 ADAMS
                        All I’m attempting to do is reconstruct 
                        their investigation. 

           Aaron considers this a moment. Then:

                                 AARON
                        I guess it can’t get worse.

           He holds the door open for Adams. 

           INT. AARON APARTMENT - LATER

           Aaron sits on the unmade bed while Adams sits in the only 
           chair. Removing a pad and paper from his briefcase:

                                 ADAMS
                        What led the Subcommittee to believe 
                        you’re a Communist?
           Coleman immediately turns hostile at the sound of that 
           last word, fires back:

                                 AARON
                        You tell me.

                                 ADAMS
                        You didn’t get any inkling, any sense 
                        from their line of questioning.

                                 AARON
                        You’re gonna turn it around on me. I know 
                        how you people work. 

           Adams purses his lips. After a moment:

                                 ADAMS
                        I’ll be candid with you, Mr. Goldman. I 
                        know how I introduced myself -- but I’m 
                        coming to you today in a personal 
                        capacity, not an official one. I need to 
                        understand how a man who devotes himself 
                        to bettering his country winds up being 
                        accused of the worst kind of treachery.  
                                (beat)
                        This is only Army business insofar as 
                        that’s what you and I, and countless 
                        others, have in common. I’m not here for 
                        you. I’m here for us.  

           Aaron takes this in. After a moment, with a heavy sigh of 
           resignation:

                                 AARON
                        Best I can tell, it has to do with a tiny 
                        period of time when I got in the habit of 
                        taking my work home with me. I was 
                        angling for a promotion -- impress my 
                        girl’s family. You know. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I do.

                                 AARON
                        Except the Subcommittee said that stuff 
                        surfaced later in the USSR. They said I 
                        musta passed it to the Rosenbergs. 

                                 ADAMS
                        If they had any evidence of that, you’d 
                        be in prison already. 

                                 AARON
                        No kidding. 
           He swigs from his beer before continuing:

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        McCarthy brought me in, kept patting at 
                        that briefcase of his claiming the 
                        evidence was inside. After about the 
                        tenth time I just blew up. I took my 
                        responsibilities seriously. I believed in 
                        what we were doing. To hear someone say 
                        otherwise ...

                                 ADAMS
                        You had every right to be angry. 

                                 AARON
                        I embarrassed him, so he torpedoed me. I 
                        can’t find work, not now that my name’s 
                        been in all the papers. They practically 
                        chased me out of my neighborhood with 
                        pitchforks. And my girl ...

           Aaron gathers himself before continuing, on the verge of 
           half-drunken tears:

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        Bet you didn’t know you can’t sell back a 
                        diamond ring for what you paid. They gave 
                        me thirty percent.

           Adams is silent a moment. Then:

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m sorry. But I have to ask. Are you 
                        sure Julius Rosenberg couldn’t have wound 
                        up with documents you took home, through 
                        no fault of yours?

                                 AARON
                        I didn’t even know the guy. I’m not sure 
                        I ever so much as nodded at him in a 
                        hallway. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Can you prove it?
                                (off his face)
                        Right. How could you.

                                 AARON
                        That’s the magic trick. How can you ever 
                        prove what’s in your mind? 

           On Adams’ hopeless face as he takes this in, PRE-LAP the 
           sounds of men’s voices talking--
           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - SMOKING ROOM - NIGHT

           -- as Cohn sits in one of the leather armchairs near the 
           fireplace, quietly studying the room. FOLLOWING HIS GAZE, 
           HEARING WHAT HE HEARS as snatches of conversation drift 
           his way--

           --On TWO YOUNGER MEN talking:

                                 YOUNG MAN #1
                        A real piece of work, blonde.

                                 YOUNG MAN #2
                                (smirking)
                        Natural? Or didn’t you find out?

           --On a MIDDLE-AGED POLITICAL TYPE ordering a drink:

                                 POLITICAL TYPE
                        Four Roses? Surprised you even stock that 
                        swill. Old Fitzgerald’s the only bourbon 
                        worth drinking. 

           --On a WELL-DRESSED OLDER MAN making a pitch to a JUNIOR 
           CONGRESSMAN:

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Anyone who’s anyone will tell you House 
                        experience is just vocational training 
                        for more lucrative work.

           Interrupting Cohn’s focus on these two:

                                 MCCARTHY (O.S.)
                        Roy. I see my sponsorship was a success.

           Cohn looks up sharply to see McCarthy approaching, an 
           OVERSTUFFED BURLAP SACK under one arm. As he sits in the 
           chair opposite Cohn’s, in a cautious tone:

                                 COHN
                        Yes. I’m a member in my own right now. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I think that’s healthy. Institutions have 
                        to change with the times.

           His tone implies that this is a minority viewpoint. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of which. Your work on the 
                        lavender lads.

           Cohn is frozen, silent, waiting for the hammer to fall. 
           And then McCarthy lifts the burlap sack and DUMPS ITS 
           CONTENTS ONTO THE FLOOR BETWEEN THEM. It’s mail, letters 
           from all over the country, some handwritten, some typed. 
           Cohn only has to glance at the pile for words like 
           DEVIANTS and FAGGOTS to jump out at him. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        It appears that this issue might just be 
                        more profitable than communism.  

                                 COHN
                        That’s gratifying to hear. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The constituency is on fire. It’s three-
                        quarters of my mail. The message is 
                        clear: the American people will not stand 
                        for this kind of moral aberration. Not in 
                        the Army ... or anywhere else.

           Cohn nods slowly. Seeing his words have had their 
           intended effect, McCarthy sits back in his chair, 
           satisfied. Just then, Bobby, the waiter from Cohn’s first 
           visit, APPROACHES, putting on a friendly smile.

                                 BOBBY
                        Roy. Great to see you again. 

           Cohn glares at Bobby icily.

                                 COHN
                        That’s Mr. Cohn. 

           Taken aback by this shift in demeanor:

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m so sorry, Mr. Cohn. Martini with a 
                        twist coming right up--

                                 COHN
                        No. We’ll take two glasses of Old 
                        Fitzgerald. Neat.

           Bobby leaves. McCarthy seems surprised, but also 
           impressed -- he had to change himself to fit in too, once 
           upon a time. After a moment:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I see some of myself in you, Roy.

           Cohn’s gaze cuts over to him, alert and eager, as 
           McCarthy goes on:
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        We’re different -- of course. But this 
                        room is full of men from the right 
                        families, with the right names, who went 
                        to the right schools and had places 
                        waiting for them in the right 
                        universities. They were born to be here. 
                        We had to earn it. 

                                 COHN
                        That’s very flattering. Thank you.

           Bobby returns with their whiskeys, swiftly retreats 
           before he can be subjected to another tongue-lashing. 
           McCarthy DOWNS HIS DRINK IN ONE, then traces a finger 
           around the lip of the glass. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Power is a circle -- and we’re the circle-
                        breakers. Don’t forget that.

           Cohn nods, then POPS HIS DRINK SWIFTLY in a studied 
           imitation of McCarthy, only to COUGH as it hits the back 
           of his throat. McCarthy smirks, amused. 

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - SAME

           Meanwhile, Margaret is comparing the two documents Adams 
           took from the Aaron file while Adams feeds the baby. 
           Holding them up to the light:

                                 MARGARET
                        This language on the first page -- it’s 
                        not some kind of departmental 
                        boilerplate. This is an exact copy. 

                                 ADAMS
                        How can you tell?

                                 MARGARET
                        Whoever wrote up the original, their 
                        typewriter had a loose K. It’s off on 
                        both versions. 

                                 ADAMS
                                (impressed)
                        I didn’t notice that.

           Continuing to examine them:
                                 MARGARET
                        There’s also a halo around the date on 
                        the later version. It’s faint, but if you 
                        look closely you can just see it.

                                 ADAMS
                        What does that mean?

                                 MARGARET
                        Someone went over the original date with 
                        correction tape, typed in the date they 
                        wanted, then made a carbon to cover their 
                        tracks. It’s an old trick. 
                                (squinting)
                        Speaking of old tricks -- you can see 
                        faint lines here and here. Scissor marks.

                                 ADAMS
                        Scissor marks?

                                 MARGARET
                        Whoever it was cut up the original, then 
                        reorganized the pieces. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Doctored it, you mean. 

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s my best guess. 

           Adams sits heavily back in his chair, briefly jarring the 
           bottle from Rebecca’s mouth. She starts to WAIL and he 
           quickly replaces it. Then, as she continues eating:

                                 ADAMS
                        Someone took a list of cleared Army 
                        personnel, then rearranged it and changed 
                        the date and title to make it look like 
                        they’d never been investigated before.

                                 MARGARET
                        I think so. Yes. Why would somebody do 
                        that, though? Couldn’t they just reopen 
                        the investigations if they had evidence?

                                 ADAMS
                        Sure. If they had evidence.

           A silence descends as Margaret takes this in. Then:

                                 MARGARET
                        So these people are one hundred percent 
                        innocent. The only thing connecting them 
                        to the Rosenbergs is proximity.
                                 ADAMS
                        Not even that, in some cases. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Then prosecuting them is illegal. Right?

                                 ADAMS
                        They’re not technically being charged 
                        with anything. These aren’t trials, 
                        they’re hearings. Closed hearings. 

                                 MARGARET
                        So nobody gets wind of the truth.

                                 ADAMS
                        Everyone sees what McCarthy wants them 
                        to. A noble crusade against corruption at 
                        the highest levels, starring a war hero 
                        who’s the only one brave enough to 
                        protect the country from itself. 

           Another silence. Then:

                                 MARGARET
                        So what can you do about it?

                                 ADAMS
                        Stevens said the best way to protect the 
                        Army is to maintain the appearance of 
                        cooperation. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What happened to what we’ll tell Rebecca?

           Stressed to the breaking point, Adams explodes:

                                 ADAMS
                        That doesn’t matter anymore! What matters 
                        is protecting us! Her, you!

           Rebecca BURSTS INTO TEARS. Pulling her from Adams’ arms 
           with an admonishing glare:

                                 MARGARET
                        Shhh. It’s okay. That wasn’t meant to 
                        scare you. Shhh. 

           In a more moderate, but still heated tone, Adams presses:

                                 ADAMS
                        Look what Roy did to Ethel Rosenberg. 
                        They could accuse either or both of us. 
                        And then Rebecca -- Rebecca--
           He can’t bear to get the rest out. Pained:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        If she lost us -- if we lost her--

           Margaret meets eyes with him, finally seeing it. 

                                 MARGARET
                        If someone took her away from me ...

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s just it. Being willing to die for 
                        the cause means you have nothing else to 
                        live for. 

           Margaret takes this in. Tears running down her cheeks 
           now. 

                                 MCCARTHY (PRE-LAP)
                        Information has come to our attention 
                        that you may be a homosexual. What 
                        comment do you care to make?

           INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT - DAY

           McCarthy paces. Dirksen, Potter and Mundt off to one 
           side, watching, rapt; Adams sits at the table opposite 
           them, looking unhappy. After a moment:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Well, Mr. Montgomery?

           REVERSE TO REVEAL: John Montgomery, the “friend” Roy met 
           eyes with in the men’s bar. He’s VISIBLY TERRIFIED.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        I don’t know how to answer that without 
                        knowing what the information is.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE ENTRANCE - SAME

           Cohn JOGS LIGHTLY up the steps, checking his watch -- 
           he’s running late. Meanwhile:

           INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT 

           McCarthy looms intimidatingly over Montgomery.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You have a roommate, isn’t that right, 
                        Mr. Montgomery?
                                 MONTGOMERY
                        To share expenses.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You work in the State Department. Your 
                        salary’s a matter of public record. 

           Just then, Cohn enters -- and FREEZES when he sees who’s 
           in the hot seat today. Montgomery shoots him an ANGUISHED 
           LOOK before refocusing on McCarthy.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        I’m saving for a bigger place. 

           Cohn takes a seat next to Adams, whispers:

                                 COHN
                        Why is John Montgomery here? He was never 
                        a soldier. 

           Pointedly not meeting Cohn’s eyes:

                                 ADAMS
                        It appears the cancer is spreading. 

           Meanwhile:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You and your roommate host a lot of 
                        gatherings, from what we understand.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Who told you that?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Gatherings with no women present. 

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Did you talk to my neighbors?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        We make whatever inquiries are necessary 
                        to protect the country. 

           Dirksen cuts a glance at Cohn, sees he’s tense, sweating. 
           But that’s nothing compared to Montgomery, who, realizing 
           he’s boxed in, attempts desperately:

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        That’s all in the past. I -- I used to 
                        drink. I’ve turned over a new leaf.

           McCarthy cocks his head.
                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you’ve reformed.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Yes. Yes. I’ve reformed.

           There’s a tense beat of silence. Then:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        That’s good, Mr. Montgomery. 

           Montgomery looks relieved. But Cohn doesn’t.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you might make a gesture to us 
                        that shows how reformed you are.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Anything. Please. I just don’t want to 
                        lose my job. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You must’ve associated with other men of 
                        unconventional morality. Men who’ve not 
                        seen fit to regain their self-control. 

           Montgomery’s eyes flick briefly to Cohn as McCarthy goes 
           on solicitously:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you’d be so kind as to give us 
                        some of their names. 

           Cohn is a DEER IN HEADLIGHTS NOW. A single pointed finger 
           is all that stands between Montgomery and freedom, and 
           both of them know it. Montgomery raises his eyes to Cohn, 
           his expression impossible to read.

           And then:

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        I can’t do that. 

           McCarthy PURPLES.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Say again?

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        I -- I can’t do that. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you’re siding with your fellow 
                        faggots, is that it? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT'D)
                        Hardly the picture of reform. Now, 
                        imagine this, if you will, Mr. 
                        Montgomery: it’s not Senator McCarthy but 
                        Comrade Malenkov who knows your 
                        disgusting inclinations, the unplumbable 
                        depths of your depravity. The 
                        consequences for you are the same: 
                        pariahship, leperdom, the loss of your 
                        current and future career, and that’s to 
                        say nothing of what will happen to your 
                        little girlfriend. But the consequences 
                        to America are quite different. 

           On Cohn’s frozen expression:

                                 MCCARTHY (PRE-LAP) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        The only way to defang the Soviets now is 
                        to publicize these men’s perversions such 
                        that there’s nothing left for a bad actor 
                        to exploit. 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE ENTRANCE - EARLY EVENING

           McCarthy speaks from the top of the steps to a RAUCOUS 
           CROWD OF REPORTERS -- AND FANS. Many are carrying signs 
           scrawled with HOMOPHOBIC SLOGANS. Triumphantly reveling 
           in the attention and approval:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Make no mistake, boys -- if you’re 
                        against McCarthy you’re either a 
                        Communist or a cocksucker.

           You’d think that final vulgarity would generate some 
           shock or disapproval -- but it ONLY RILES THE CROWD UP 
           EVEN MORE. 

           INT. GEORGETOWN TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           A rectangle of light falls across the dark foyer as 
           Marvin Braverman enters, KEYS JINGLING. He flips on the 
           overhead light--

           --and LETS OUT AN AGONIZED, CHOKED SCREAM.

           RACK FOCUS to reveal the feet dangling in the extreme 
           foreground. Montgomery’s hung himself from the second-
           floor landing. 

           On Braverman’s ANGUISHED, GUTTURAL WAIL--
           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME

           Adams and Margaret are reading next to one another in bed 
           when the phone once again begins to RING. Both of them 
           TENSE VISIBLY at the sound. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t answer it.

                                 ADAMS
                        I have to.

                                 MARGARET
                        You know who it is.

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s why. 

           Reaching over to pick up the receiver, without even 
           asking who’s on the other end:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        What do you want now, Roy?

           INT. SCHINE HOTEL BAR - LATE NIGHT

           Adams and Cohn sit at the otherwise empty bar. As the 
           bartender serves their drinks:

                                 ADAMS
                        Isn’t this David’s last night before 
                        basic?

                                 COHN
                        He’s in New York. With family. 
                                (beat)
                        It was my idea. 

           Adams nods, says nothing. After a moment:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        How worried should I be?

                                 ADAMS
                        I made it back in one piece. I’m sure he 
                        will too. 

           When Cohn doesn’t reply:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Is that why you wanted to see me? 
                                 COHN
                        No.

           Cohn slides something across the bar: a file marked 
           “MAJOR IRVING PERESS.”

                                 ADAMS
                        What is it?

                                 COHN
                        Open it.

           Adams obeys. A loyalty questionnaire, like the one he 
           read from before, is the top page. Under the question 
           “Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the 
           Communist Party?” someone has simply scrawled:

                                    5TH AMENDMENT

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        We can’t become so distracted by 
                        potential threats that we lose focus on 
                        genuine ones. 

                                 ADAMS
                                (careful)
                        I think that’s correct. 

                                 COHN
                        So you agree that Doctor Peress is worth 
                        looking into.

                                 ADAMS
                        Doctor?

                                 COHN
                        He’s a dentist at Camp Kilmer. 

           Adams’ stare is unwavering as he replies:

                                 ADAMS
                        I couldn’t agree more. 

           Adams signals to the bartender, reaches for his wallet -- 
           until Cohn stops him with a hand.

                                 COHN
                        I don’t pay in David’s hotels. 

           It’s meant as a boast, but Adams knows what it really 
           means, and wants Cohn to know he knows. The words are 
           simple, but the tone is loaded as Adams meets eyes with 
           him, replies:
                                 ADAMS
                        I see.

           Cohn holds his gaze. 

           INT. STEVENS’ OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Stevens examines a carbon of the loyalty questionnaire 
           from the night before as Adams says:

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t know how Roy got it.  

                                 STEVENS
                        The FBI requisitioned all of the Loyalty 
                        Board’s records. Someone there’s feeding 
                        them these pathetic little crumbs.

                                 ADAMS
                        Just the issuing of these subpoenas has 
                        ruined peoples’ lives. Isn’t there 
                        anything we can do?

           Stevens peers at him over his glasses.

                                 STEVENS
                        You all right, John?

           Adams hesitates a beat before saying simply:

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s getting to me. The subterfuge, the 
                        double-talk ... I’m not that guy. I never 
                        wanted to be that guy. 

           Stevens nods. Looks genuinely affected by this. 

                                 STEVENS
                        I’m ordering you to take some R and R. 

                                 ADAMS
                        What about Irving Peress?

                                 STEVENS
                        Draft a memo from me to the US Marshals’ 
                        Office. If the Army says we have no 
                        reason to be suspicious, they won’t 
                        proceed, and that’ll be the end of that. 
                                (beat)
                        I meant it about the vacation.

           Adams shakes his head. 
                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t think it’s a good time.

                                 STEVENS
                        It’s never a good time. But taking a 
                        break from the day-to-day will help you 
                        remember the big picture. And that’s 
                        going to be important.

           He taps the questionnaire.

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done your part with this. Leave 
                        the rest to me. 

           Finally convinced, Adams smiles, exits. 

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret enters, pushing the stroller, to see Adams 
           holding up two airline ticket pamphlets and a Rebecca-
           sized swimsuit. With a beguiling smile:

                                 ADAMS
                        Feel like getting out of town?

           Margaret CLAPS HER HANDS DELIGHTEDLY.

                                 MARGARET
                        What for?

                                 ADAMS
                        Does a guy need a reason to take his wife 
                        and daughter to the beach?

           Off Margaret’s charmed smile, the ROAR OF A JET ENGINE 
           carries us over to the

           EXT. KEY LARGO BEACH - DAY

           Where Adams and Margaret help Rebecca build a sandcastle. 
           Stretching out in the sun:

                                 MARGARET
                        Let’s never go back.

                                 ADAMS
                        Sold. 
           EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT

           Adams and Margaret sit on the balcony enjoying the view 
           of the ocean, each with a glass of champagne. In the room 
           behind them, Rebecca sleeps in a crib.

           Clinking his glass against Margaret’s:

                                 ADAMS
                        Cheers. 

                                 MARGARET
                        To our first--

           She’s cut off by the sound of the PHONE RINGING. Rebecca 
           begins to WAIL.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM

           As Margaret picks up Rebecca, Adams answers the phone.

                                 ADAMS
                        Hello?

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        We have a problem, John.

           Adams PALES. Margaret looks at him questioningly. 

                                 ADAMS
                        How did you know where I am, Roy?

           Margaret’s brow furrows. 

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        You know David’s family owns a much nicer 
                        hotel just down the beach. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m sure I couldn’t afford it.

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        You wouldn’t have to pay. 

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s a generous offer, but we’re 
                        content where we are. If that’s all--

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        I’m holding a very interesting memo from 
                        Stevens. 

           Adams is FROZEN IN PLACE as Cohn goes on:
                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        It’s a challenge to our subpoena of 
                        Irving Peress. 

           Adams hesitates a beat too long before replying in an 
           attempt at a lighthearted tone:

                                 ADAMS
                        Last I checked, you weren’t a US Marshal. 

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        How I got it isn’t important. Why it was 
                        written in the first place is. 
                                (beat)
                        There’s only one explanation that seems 
                        credible to me: Stevens is trying to 
                        protect this Communist, possibly to 
                        obfuscate the truth of how and why he was 
                        promoted to major. 

                                 ADAMS
                        He was promoted automatically--

           The words are barely out of Adams’ mouth before he’s 
           realized his mistake. Meeting eyes with Margaret:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        ... wasn’t he?

           That was weak and Adams and Cohn both know it. Trying to 
           regain his footing:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        I was clerking for the Armed Services 
                        Committee when Congress passed the 
                        Doctors’ Draft Act. Senator McCarthy even 
                        voted for it.

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Your recall is incredible.

           Adams is silent, trying to think on his feet as--

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Joe’s briefing the press in ten minutes. 
                        I’m asking you -- as a friend -- do you 
                        think he should he mention the suspicion 
                        this casts on Stevens, as the author of 
                        this memo?

           Adams squeezes his eyes shut, agonized, before replying:
                                 ADAMS
                        I wrote the memo. Stevens never even read 
                        it. He signs a thousand pieces of paper 
                        just like it every day. 

           Adams waits. After a beat of silence:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        I see.

                                 ADAMS
                        I looked into it -- like you wanted me  
                        to -- and didn’t see any cause for 
                        concern. Nothing in his record raises red 
                        flags. And he’s, you know, a dentist. 

           There’s another silence. Adams holds his breath. Then, at 
           long last:

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        I understand. 

           Adams exhales. Margaret looks at him questioningly. He 
           gives her a thumbs-up: all’s well.

                                 COHN (V.O.)
                        Enjoy the rest of your vacation. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Thanks, Roy. 

           Adams hangs up. His hands are SHAKING. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What was that?

                                 ADAMS
                        Nothing. Just -- Roy being Roy.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           Adams, Margaret and Rebecca enter from the beach, wrapped 
           in towels and shaking off sand. Approaching the front 
           desk, where the middle-aged OWNER stands in front of a 
           wall of keys on hooks:

                                 ADAMS
                        Two-Fifty-Eight, please. 

           The owner narrows his eyes at him.

                                 OWNER
                        You’re Adams, right? John Adams, from DC?
                                 ADAMS
                        Yes ...

                                 OWNER
                        This John Adams?

           The owner tosses a newspaper onto the counter. Adams and 
           Margaret both PALE when they see the BLARING HEADLINE:

                                 WHO PROMOTED PERESS?

                 McCarthy Alleges ‘Shocking’ Army Conspiracy to Protect 
                                Communist Infiltrators

           Beneath, the opening paragraph names Adams almost 
           immediately, with Stevens’ named tossed in as well. The 
           source it’s quoting is, of course, ROY COHN.

           Adams lifts his eyes to the owner.

                                 OWNER (CONT’D)
                        Your room’s no longer available.

           Infuriated, Margaret explodes:

                                 MARGARET
                        You can’t do that! 

                                 OWNER
                        I don’t want your red money.

           Hefting Rebecca:

                                 MARGARET
                        What about her? Are you really going to 
                        strand us on this island with a baby?

                                 OWNER
                        Maybe you all should have thought about 
                        what’s best for her before hopping in bed 
                        with Commies and traitors.
                                (beat)
                        I want that room vacated in an hour. I 
                        can make this worse if I have to.

           Adams and Margaret exchange defeated looks.

           EXT. BUS STOP - LATER

           Adams and Margaret try to calm a SQUALLING REBECCA as 
           they wait in the hot sun for the bus to Miami. 

                                                              FADE TO:
           EXT. ADAMS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 

           A cab pulls up to the curb. Adams unloads the luggage 
           from the trunk while Margaret climbs out carefully, 
           trying not to wake Rebecca in her arms. Everyone 
           sunburnt, exhausted, downtrodden. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           As the family heads down the long hall toward their door, 
           a GHOSTLY MALE VOICE seems to echo back at them. All the 
           neighbors are watching TV -- and all the same program, 
           from the way it sounds. But the actual words are 
           impossible to discern.

           Arriving at their door, Adams inserts his key, then 
           pushes -- only to find the door WON’T OPEN. Instead, it 
           yields slightly, then SPRINGS BACK. 

           With a worried frown -- were they robbed? What’s 
           happening? -- Adams TRIES AGAIN, throwing his weight into 
           it this time. Finally the door SLOWLY PUSHES INWARD, as 
           if fighting some unseen force.

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Adams and Margaret flip on the light. The living room 
           appears intact. Silent. 

           But the door. THE DOOR.

           In shoving it open, Adams has pushed aside a SNOWBANK OF 
           MAIL. So high it BLOCKS THE LETTER SLOT, a heap of 
           HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF POSTCARDS. They spill onto the 
           rug, their laminated backs sliding against one another as 
           Adams and Margaret meet eyes.

           The hell?

           Leaning down, Adams plucks one from the top of the pile. 
           The front depicts a wide avenue lined with palms, BEVERLY 
           HILLS in corny lettering. Flipping it over, Adams sees 
           three words handwritten in ALL CAPS:

                                 WHO PROMOTED PERESS?

           On the address line, the sender has hastily scrawled:

                                ADAMS, WASHINGTON D.C.

           Paling, he grabs another one. Mount Rushmore on the 
           front, the same message on the back:
                                  WHO PROMOTED PERESS

           In a panicky tone:

                                 MARGARET
                        John? What is all this?

           But all Adams can see is the handwriting on postcard 
           after postcard, some of it feminine, some masculine, some 
           gouged in as if in anger, some misspelled:

                                  WHO PROMOTED PERESS
                                  who promoted peress
                                 WHO PROMOTED PERESS?
                                 WHO PROMOTED PERRESS

           Meanwhile, that GHOSTLY VOICE is still echoing down the 
           hall, traveling in through the open front door. As Adams 
           continues staring in shock at the postcards, Margaret 
           moves to the TV, flips it on to reveal

           MCCARTHY GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE (TV)

           He stands at the top of the courthouse steps, Cohn 
           hovering behind him, addressing the usual CLAMORING CROWD 
           OF REPORTERS AND SUPPORTERS BELOW. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The Red conspiracy within the United 
                        States Army has come to the forefront as 
                        the most acute threat facing our union. 
                        Fifth Amendment Communists are actively 
                        promoted by men with no business wearing 
                        the uniform of this great nation, and I 
                        promise you today we will hold every last 
                        one accountable -- the Loyalty Board, 
                        General Zwicker, Robert Stevens and of 
                        course, John G. Adams. 

           A smirking Cohn GAZES RIGHT INTO CAMERA as McCarthy 
           emphasizes Adams’ name, almost as if seeing right through 
           the lens to the

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT 

           Where Adams and Margaret meet eyes as the CREAKING OF 
           MULTIPLE DOORS reminds them theirs is open. Peeking out 
           into the hall, Adams sees NEIGHBOR AFTER NEIGHBOR opening 
           their doors to STARE ACCUSINGLY AT HIM. 

           He opens his mouth to speak--
           --and the neighbors’ doors SLAM SHUT AGAIN. Deadbolts are 
           shot into place, chain locks slid across.

           INT. ADAMS BEDROOM - LATER

           Rebecca SCREAMS as Margaret HASTILY RE-PACKS HER 
           SUITCASE. Adams is PACING FRANTICALLY. 

                                 ADAMS
                        There’s my parents’ place in Sioux Falls. 
                        I doubt anyone would look for you there.

                                 MARGARET
                        Your dad isn’t exactly my biggest fan. 
                        What about my sister?

                                 ADAMS
                        Falls Church isn’t far enough. 

           This throws Margaret. Pausing to look him in the eye:

                                 MARGARET
                        What exactly do you think might happen?

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t know. All I know is I won’t be 
                        able to do anything until you two are 
                        somewhere no one can get to you.

           Margaret takes this in in silence. Then:

                                 MARGARET
                        Willa.

                                 ADAMS
                        Your friend from basic?

                                 MARGARET
                        She and her husband have a farm in 
                        Indiana. Even if someone were to go back 
                        that far, she went by her maiden name in 
                        those days.

           INT. UNION STATION - LATE NIGHT

           Next to an idling train, Adams kisses Margaret goodbye, 
           then leans down to kiss the baby in her arms. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m scared.
                                 ADAMS
                        You’ll be safe there. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m scared for you.
                                (beat)
                        Come with us.

           Adams gives her a pained expression.

                                 ADAMS
                        You know I can’t. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I know what I said before, but ... it 
                        wasn’t at our doorstep then. 

                                 ADAMS
                        It’ll be on our doorstep forever if I 
                        don’t do something. It’ll follow us the 
                        rest of our lives. 

           A WHISTLE announces the train’s imminent departure. 
           Urgently:

                                 MARGARET
                        Tell me you have a plan.  

                                 ADAMS
                        Half-baked. Better than nothing.

           Margaret cocks her head at this, but just then:

                                 CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                        All aboard! 

           Adams kisses Rebecca, then Margaret. Seeing in her eyes 
           how badly she needs this:

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s all going to be okay. I’m going to 
                        be okay. I promise.

           Margaret doesn’t look satisfied. 

                                 MARGARET
                        How will I know that when I’m halfway 
                        across the country?

           Helping her off the platform, then leaning in for one 
           last kiss:
                                 ADAMS
                        If everything goes the way I’m hoping it 
                        will, believe me, you’ll know. 

           As the train begins to CHUG SLOWLY FORWARD, separating 
           them inch by inch and then foot by foot--

                                                             SMASH TO:

           INT. GREASY SPOON - LATE NIGHT

           Adams slams a stack of typewritten paper down onto the 
           table between him -- and ELLIE. 

           Looking at it with wide eyes:

                                 ELLIE
                        What is this?

                                 ADAMS
                        My boss asked for daily accounts of 
                        everything I’ve witnessed since being 
                        assigned to the Subcommittee on 
                        Investigations. These are my memoranda. 
                        Unedited. In order. 

           As Ellie eagerly reaches for it, though, Adams places a 
           hand on top of the stack, stopping her.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        You said yourself what you’d be risking 
                        with a story like this. 

                                 ELLIE
                                (prompt)
                        I don’t care.

                                 ADAMS
                        I want you to think carefully about it. 
                        This could end your career in DC. 

           Ellie snorts laughter.

                                 ELLIE
                        My career in DC.

                                 ADAMS
                        Isn’t that why you came here? To build a 
                        career?

           Ellie’s silent a beat. Then:
                                 ELLIE
                        I live in a luggage room. Did I tell you 
                        that before?

           Adams shakes his head. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Off the lobby of my building. Someone 
                        converted it by adding a toilet and a 
                        shower and a sheet of plywood. That’s 
                        where I go every afternoon after the 
                        briefing, to get my daily dispatch 
                        written in time to run it down to the 
                        Adams Morgan Western Union.

                                 ADAMS
                        Okay ...

                                 ELLIE
                        The others all go to the Press Club. They 
                        eat, drink, compare notes, gossip, write 
                        whenever they get around to it, file 
                        their stories from the in-house bureau. 
                        It’s supposed to be really nice. Classy. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Why don’t you go?

           Ellie gives him an are you serious look before grabbing 
           the papers, pulls them toward herself. This time, Adams 
           doesn’t stop her. 

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        As long as you’re sure.

           She puts the papers in her bag. With finality:

                                 ELLIE
                        I’d rather go down doing something than 
                        survive doing nothing. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE MEN’S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Adams enters, positions himself at the mirror. Steeling 
           himself for the day to come. As the door behind him 
           opens, he raises his eyes to the mirror to see--

           --COHN. An anger to his gait and a viciousness to his 
           expression as he SLAPS A NEWSPAPER ONTO THE SINK IN FRONT 
           OF ADAMS.
                                 COHN
                        Just what do you think you’re up to, 
                        John?

           Looking down, Adams sees it’s an issue of the MILWAUKEE 
           JOURNAL, the front-page headline BLARING:

                  MCCARTHY SURROGATE ROY COHN THREATENED TO ‘WRECK THE 
                          ARMY’ OVER REFUSAL TO PROVIDE FAVORS

           Beneath is a byline: Eleanor Frank.

           Still SEETHING:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        How’s your wife going to feel when she 
                        finds out you had an affair with a bottom-
                        tier stringer for a pinko mouthpiece rag?

           Adams turns around to face Cohn, fires back:

                                 ADAMS
                        Hoping for a home field advantage here in 
                        the men’s room, Roy?

           They hold each other’s gazes for a long moment. Then, 
           practically SPITTING OUT THE WORDS:

                                 COHN
                        You’re a real man, aren’t you. Letting a 
                        little girl do your dirty work while you 
                        cower in the shadows.

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m not cowering. I’m standing right here 
                        in front of you, telling you to your face 
                        that you’ve gone too far.

                                 COHN
                        There’s no “too far” when it comes to 
                        protecting this country. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Even if that were true -- the only person 
                        you’re protecting is yourself. 
                                (beat)
                        Imagine, for a moment, that you’re being 
                        scrutinized as harshly as the poor 
                        witnesses you drag down to this basement. 
                        Someone’s doing to you what you’re about 
                        to do to Peress, interrogating your past 
                        and present -- where you’ve been -- who 
                        you’ve been there with ...
           Cohn SNARLS IN RESPONSE:

                                 COHN
                        Don’t threaten me.

           Holding up his hands in a placating gesture:

                                 ADAMS
                        I know you think McCarthy’s your way in, 
                        but he’ll turn on you in a heartbeat if 
                        you give him a reason. 
                                (beat)
                        And we both know there’s a reason. 

           There’s a silence. Cohn SIMMERS, FURIOUS. Then:

                                 COHN
                        Do me one favor, will you, John? When 
                        you’re jobless, homeless, when your wife 
                        has ripped your sobbing baby from your 
                        arms on her way out of your life for 
                        good, when all the doors of the world are 
                        slamming in your face and you’re coming 
                        to the sinking realization that you’d be 
                        better off at the bottom of the Potomac 
                        than continuing to walk this earth   
                        alone -- when that moment comes, and it 
                        will come, John, remember -- your fate 
                        was decided right here. In my -- what did 
                        you call it? Oh, right: my “home court.”

           With that, Cohn SLAMS OUT.

           INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER

           Striding with furious purpose, Adams approaches IRVING 
           PERESS, early 40s, who’s sitting on a bench outside the 
           basement hearing room with a STRICKEN EXPRESSION. About 
           as mundane-looking a guy as you can imagine, except that 
           he’s SWEATING BULLETS. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Dr. Peress?

           Peress’ head jerks up.

                                 PERESS
                        Is it my turn?

                                 ADAMS
                        They’ll let you know. 
                                 PERESS
                        You’re not part of they?

                                 ADAMS
                        Vehemently not. I’m here to protect you, 
                        if I can. I’m John Adams. 

           Peress eyes him distrustfully.

                                 PERESS
                        Big shoes to fill.

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m sorry?

                                 PERESS
                        “Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.”

           Adams cracks a comprehending smile.

                                 ADAMS
                        My namesake.

                                 PERESS
                        Do you like quotations? Another of his 
                        comes to mind: “Property monopolized, or 
                        in the possession of a few, is a curse 
                        upon mankind.” 

           Adams clocks this for the admission it is. After a 
           moment:

                                 ADAMS
                        I think you’d be best served to plead the 
                        Fifth, Dr. Peress. 

                                 PERESS
                        I invoked the Fifth on my loyalty form. 
                        Didn’t do much for me. 

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s different in a hearing. If you 
                        answer just one of their questions, you 
                        yield the privilege altogether. 

                                 PERESS
                        I do?

                                 ADAMS
                        They’ll do everything they can to provoke 
                        you. And once they trick you into 
                        responding, they won’t stop until they’ve 
                        come for your wife, your son, your 
                        practice and your reputation.
           Peress looks up at him. Red-eyed. 

                                 PERESS
                        I’m just a dentist, Mr. Adams. I’m no 
                        one’s idea of a spy. 

           Adams hesitates a beat. Then:

                                 ADAMS
                        Why did you write that? You knew what 
                        answer they wanted. No matter what your 
                        beliefs may be, you knew all you had to 
                        do was lie. Why risk it?

           Peress replies simply:

                                 PERESS
                        Because. It’s my right. 

           Just then, the door to the basement room opens to reveal 
           Cohn. His eyes narrow when he sees Adams sitting next to 
           Peress on the bench.

                                 COHN
                        Dr. Peress. We’re ready for you now.

           INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT - LATER

           The usual scene, but with more REPORTERS than ever before 
           -- though no Ellie. Adams, seated on the other side of 
           the room from Cohn, looks on in tense silence as McCarthy 
           grills Peress.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Why didn’t you complete your loyalty 
                        questionnaire, Dr. Peress?

                                 PERESS
                        I take the Fifth.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s a simple question. Did you not 
                        complete it because you’re not loyal to 
                        the United States? Because you don’t 
                        believe in freedom or democracy?

                                 PERESS
                        I take the Fifth. 
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Dr. Peress, plenty of your fellow 
                        dentists were sent overseas, and yet you 
                        were given a post at Camp Kilmer, is that 
                        correct?

           Peress is silent.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Who made that decision? Who gave you that 
                        preferential treatment?

                                 PERESS
                        I take the Fifth. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You believe your answer to that question 
                        might incriminate you? Or are you worried 
                        about incriminating someone else?

           Peress remains silent. Outraged now: 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Answer the question, Dr. Peress! What 
                        silent actor within the leadership of the 
                        US Army saw to it not only that a Fifth 
                        Amendment Communist was able to enlist, 
                        but that he was subsequently promoted and 
                        granted special favors? 

           Peress glances at Adams. McCarthy briefly follows his 
           gaze before hefting his briefcase, continuing intensely:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Because I have the evidence, right here, 
                        of a conspiracy to promote and protect 
                        subversive elements that--

                                 PERESS
                        If anyone in this room is a subversive, 
                        it’s you!

           Adams SITS STRAIGHT UP, McCarthy PURPLES DANGEROUSLY as 
           Peress goes on heatedly:

                                 PERESS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what you have in that 
                        briefcase, but I know what you don’t -- 
                        the United States Constitution. If you 
                        did, you’d know that remaining silent is 
                        a right guaranteed every American, a 
                        privilege enshrined by our founding 
                        fathers that you’re now trying to equate 
                        with guilt. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PERESS (CONT’D)
                        What does that say about your loyalty, 
                        Senator? What does it say about your 
                        belief in democracy?

           A MURMUR RISES from the spectators. Infuriated, McCarthy 
           barks out:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’re dismissed for the day, Dr. Peress.

           Peress rises, turns to the gallery. 

                                 PERESS
                        To quote the Book of Psalms--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I said you’ve been dismissed--

                                 PERESS
                                (trembling)
                        “His mischief shall return upon his own 
                        head, and his violence shall come down 
                        upon his own pate.” 

           Peress turns back to meet Adams’ gaze before departing, 
           still SHAKING VISIBLY. Meanwhile, Cohn SCURRIES TO 
           MCCARTHY’S SIDE, whispers in his ear while glancing at 
           Adams. They confer. A long, tense beat. 

           Then, as McCarthy finally breaks away from Cohn, with a 
           sinister smile:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The Subcommittee calls its next    
                        witness ...
                                (enjoying this)
                        Counselor Adams. 

           Adams shakes his head, replies calmly:

                                 ADAMS
                        You can’t do that, Senator. 

           McCarthy BELLOWS, ENRAGED:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You are ordered to take the stand and be 
                        sworn in!

           Adams remains seated, staring McCarthy and Cohn down. 

                                 ADAMS
                        You’ll have to subpoena me, just like you 
                        would anyone else. 
           Once again, Cohn whispers in McCarthy’s ear. Then:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        As chairman of this committee, I hereby 
                        bar the Army from these sessions. If you 
                        have anything else to say to us--

           He gestures at the empty witness chair. Adams eyes it for 
           a moment before grabbing his briefcase and walking out.

           INT. STEVENS’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           Adams and Stevens sit with the paper between them. The 
           door to Stevens’ office closed, his window looking out on 
           night in DC. Stevens taps the paper pensively. Finally:

                                 STEVENS
                        I asked for daily memoranda. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I know.  

                                 STEVENS
                                (tapping Ellie’s byline)
                        It appears you were sending them to the 
                        wrong person.  

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m taking a page out of their playbook. 

           Stevens raises an eyebrow, waits.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        They make an accusation. Once it’s 
                        printed, it’s as good as a verdict. Now 
                        whoever they’re after is on the 
                        defensive: senators, the State 
                        Department, writers, the Army, 
                        homosexuals ...

           Adams hesitates before continuing:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        ... whoever. The only common denominator 
                        is everyone’s too afraid of them to fight 
                        back, and the more the person has on the 
                        line, the worse it gets. 

           Stevens nods in unhappy comprehension. After a moment:

                                 STEVENS
                        So now it’s our word versus theirs. 
                                 ADAMS
                        Someone’s going to have to adjudicate. 

           Stevens nods slowly, seeing where Adams is going.

                                 STEVENS
                        The Senate. Where they’ve already seen to 
                        it that there’s no one with the authority 
                        to hold a hearing but them. 

                                 ADAMS
                        They’ll have to recuse themselves. Hire 
                        outside counsel.

                                 STEVENS
                        And be the ones who have to answer the 
                        questions for once.

           Stevens eyes Adams appraisingly.

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        This was a risk--

                                 ADAMS
                        I know, and I’m truly sorry--

                                 STEVENS
                        --but I wouldn’t have confirmed Miss 
                        Frank’s facts if I wasn’t reasonably 
                        convinced you had a plan.
                                (off Adams’ surprise)
                        Nice girl. A little eager.

           Adams gives Stevens a small, appreciative smile. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           INT. STREETCAR - LATE AFTERNOON

           Our commuters headed home from work listen to a news 
           broadcast blaring from the streetcar’s speakers:

                                 ANCHOR (RADIO)
                        ... shocking allegation that Senator 
                        Joseph McCarthy and top aide Roy Cohn 
                        sought preferential treatment for 
                        colleague G. David Schine ...
           EXT. INDIANA FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SAME

           Margaret, holding Rebecca, and her old friend WILLA sit 
           on the porch listening to a portable radio, cornfields 
           undulating behind them:

                                 ANCHOR (RADIO)
                        ... with Army counsel John G. Adams 
                        alleging that Cohn threatened to “wreck 
                        the Army” if their demands were not met. 

           INT. BARBER SHOP - SAME

           Barbers and customers listen in rapt fascination--

                                 ANCHOR (RADIO)
                        McCarthy and Cohn counter-allege that 
                        Adams and Secretary of the Army Robert T. 
                        Stevens sought to prevent the exposure of 
                        Communist infiltrators and spies ...

           INT. CLASSROOM

           The schoolchildren equally rapt--

                                 ANCHOR (RADIO)
                        ... using Schine as a hostage to 
                        blackmail the Subcommittee on 
                        Investigations. Said McCarthy on the 
                        Senate floor ...

           EXT. INDIANA FARMHOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SAME

           Willa glances at Margaret, who cradles Rebecca against 
           herself protectively as:

                                 MCCARTHY (RADIO)
                        The Department of the Army is not doing 
                        this. It is two civilians in the Army, 
                        and they should be so named. These are 
                        not the Army-McCarthy hearings--

           On Margaret RISING TO GO INSIDE -- her expression pained, 
           can’t hear another word--

                                 MCCARTHY (RADIO) (CONT’D)
                        --they are the Stevens-Adams hearings, 
                        and I move we refer to them as such. 

           At the sound of the Senate ROARING ITS APPROVAL, Willa 
           hastily FLICKS OFF THE RADIO. 
           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - SMOKING ROOM - NIGHT

           As McCarthy enters the smoking room, his Republican 
           colleagues, Cohn already ensconced among them, RISE IN 
           UNISON TO APPLAUD. Rising to give McCarthy his place at 
           the prominent center table, in an obsequious tone:

                                 COHN
                        True leadership. That’s what the people 
                        want to see. 

                                 DIRKSEN
                        Roy and I have been talking. We think 
                        1960’s in the bag already. But he had a 
                        brilliant idea to push us over the edge.

           McCarthy cocks his head.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m listening.

                                 COHN
                        You have the support of your colleagues. 
                        The party, the press. Everyone who sees 
                        you speak sees you in the Oval Office. 
                        Why not let the public see it as well?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m not sure what you mean. 

                                 COHN
                        I met a fellow. He works for the American 
                        Broadcasting Company.

           On McCarthy, a GREEDY GLINT in his eye ...

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Adams tosses and turns. Unable to sleep. And then -- the 
           distant sound of SHATTERING GLASS. Sighing, he gives up, 
           drags himself out of bed. 

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           As Adams, bags under his eyes, sleepily pulls the 
           newspaper from where it’s been wedged in the mail slot, 
           his face registers surprise at the headline:

                         ARMY HEARINGS TO BE TELEVISED IN FULL

           Beneath, the subhead:
                   MCCARTHY STATES AMERICAN PUBLIC SHOULD JUDGE ADAMS, 
                             STEVENS “WITH THEIR OWN EYES”

           Beneath is a photo of Adams getting into his car outside 
           the Senate building -- a photo he clearly didn’t know was 
           being taken. 

           Just then, Adams hears it again: GLASS SHATTERING. Cocks 
           his head -- it sounds close ...

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. ADAMS APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

           Adams, in his bathrobe, stands next to his car, parked 
           outside at the curb. The windows have been BUSTED OUT; 
           broken glass is STREWN EVERYWHERE. Someone’s hastily 
           scrawled across the side in DRIPPING RED SPRAYPAINT:

                                       TRAITOR

           On Adams, a lonely, bedraggled figure in the empty 
           street, glancing up and down helplessly--

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. STEVENS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Adams and Stevens, both in uniform, sit on one side of 
           the desk; on the other is a very young LITIGATOR, his 
           eyes flitting back and forth between the men’s military 
           decorations in an intimidated manner. After a moment, 
           delicately:

                                 STEVENS
                        We were hoping your firm might send 
                        someone more senior.

                                 LITIGATOR
                        None of the other guys wanted to do it. 

                                 ADAMS
                        But you do?

                                 LITIGATOR
                        I heard the hearings are gonna be on all 
                        three TV networks at once. That true?

           Stevens and Adams exchange a look. Next. 

                                                               CUT TO:
           SAME SCENE, DIFFERENT CANDIDATE

           This time it’s a middle-aged LAWYER with a combover. 
           Something oily about him, like a used-car salesman.

                                 ADAMS
                        We just want to be sure there’s nothing 
                        in your background McCarthy and Cohn 
                        could zero in on.

                                 LAWYER
                        Nothing. Squeaky clean.

                                 STEVENS
                        You’re sure. No past incidents, anything 
                        that could be perceived as unsavory or 
                        suspicious ...

           The lawyer gets a HUNTED EXPRESSION. 

                                 LAWYER
                        You talked to my ex-wife? 

           On Stevens and Adams, despairing now--

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. ADAMS’ OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Adams stares down at a long list of lawyers’ names and 
           corresponding firms. Every single one CROSSED OFF except 
           for the last. Visibly anxious, Adams dials, listens:

                                 ADAMS
                                (into phone)
                        Yes, hello, Mr. Zucker? My name is John 
                        G. Adams and I’m calling in regards to 
                        the upcoming -- hello?

           A DIAL TONE emits from the phone. Adams SLAMS IT BACK 
           INTO ITS CRADLE, frustrated. 

           Taking a deep breath, he buries his face in his hands--

           --and the phone begins to RING. He swiftly picks it up.

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Zucker, thank you so much for calling 
                        back--
                                (listening)
                        Oh. Sorry. Please put him through -- what 
                        did you say his name was, again?
           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Stevens and Adams sit opposite one another on a train 
           speeding north. 

                                 STEVENS
                        I’ve never heard of Hale and Dorr.

                                 ADAMS
                        They mainly do property law. 

           Stevens bites his lip. Not happy. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Who’d McCarthy and Cohn get for this 
                        display they’ve concocted?

                                 ADAMS
                        They, uh -- they had their pick, I hear. 
                        They went with Ray Jenkins. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Isn’t he the one they call--

                                 ADAMS
                        The Terror of Tellico Plains. Yes, sir.

           That kills the conversation for the rest of the trip.

           INT. HALE AND DORR LAW OFFICES - DAY

           Stevens and Adams sit stiffly on a leather couch in 
           reception. After a moment, a fresh-faced, boyish 
           associate greets them. This is FRED FISHER, 32.  

                                 FISHER
                        I’ll take you to the conference room. 

           As Stevens and Adams trail him down the hall:

                                 FISHER (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you came. I’m the one who 
                        alerted Mr. Welch to this opportunity. 

                                 ADAMS
                        You were? 

                                 FISHER
                        I was a member of the Lawyers’ Guild. 
                        They don’t take kindly to abuse of the 
                        Fifth Amendment. 

           Stevens and Adams exchange a look. 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           A stately conference room lined with legal texts. JOSEPH 
           WELCH, mid-50s, sits across the polished wood table from 
           Stevens and Adams. He’s grandfatherly, patrician, looks 
           like he was born wearing tweeds and a bowtie. 

                                 STEVENS
                        Mr. Welch, I’m curious why a lawyer of 
                        your ... stature would reach out to us 
                        about this case. 

           Welch’s voice is gentle, measured. 

                                 WELCH
                        I’m not sure I have a rousing answer for 
                        that. I’ll merely say that the law has 
                        been my life, and I don’t enjoy seeing it 
                        bent until it breaks. 

                                 ADAMS
                        The lawyer for the opposition--

                                 WELCH
                        Mr. Jenkins. Yes. From what I understand, 
                        his fame derives from his skill at 
                        getting murderers acquitted. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Never lost a case.

                                 WELCH
                        Reveals a bit of a guilty conscience, no? 
                        And tells you something about their 
                        strategy. Mr. Jenkins succeeds by 
                        smearing his clients’ victims. 

                                 STEVENS
                        With that in mind, what do you think your 
                        strategy might be?

                                 WELCH
                        Well, I suppose I’ll come down to DC, 
                        think up some questions to ask, and if I 
                        don’t like the answers, I’ll ask a few 
                        more. 

           Stevens bites his lip. Not liking this at all. Swiftly 
           moving on:

                                 ADAMS
                        The young man who brought us in here--
                                 WELCH
                        One of our most promising associates.

                                 ADAMS
                        He mentioned belonging to a union. 

           Welch peers at Adams over his spectacles. 

                                 WELCH
                        That contagious, is it? 

           When neither Stevens nor Adams replies, Welch gives a 
           courtly nod, rises.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Well, gentlemen, I can’t say I wouldn’t 
                        understand if that disqualified me, given 
                        the tenor of the national conversation. 
                        I’ll give you a moment to confer.

           He departs. As soon as the door is shut behind him:

                                 STEVENS
                        This can’t be the best we can do. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I know what you had in mind -- some 
                        litigator we’d have to keep on a leash so 
                        he didn’t tear out McCarthy’s throat--

                                 STEVENS
                                (heated)
                        Two hundred twenty-five thousand, three-
                        hundred and twelve. That’s how many of 
                        this nation’s sons are currently 
                        stationed in Korea. They believe we can 
                        be trusted. Their families believe we can 
                        be trusted. This isn’t about what I want, 
                        it’s about the compact we’ve made with 
                        the American people.

           Adams fires back, equally heated:

                                 ADAMS
                        And if we get in a barroom brawl with 
                        them in front of the entire country? 
                        Where would that leave our compact with 
                        America? If they win their way, they win. 
                        If we win their way, we’ve still lost.

           Stevens sits back hard at this. Thinks. A tense moment. 
           Then:
                                 STEVENS
                        That liberal -- he can’t be anywhere near 
                        his team.

                                 ADAMS
                        Of course not. 

                                 STEVENS
                        And you’ll prep him. Make sure he 
                        understands he’s not filing deeds in 
                        Boston anymore.

                                 ADAMS
                        Yes, sir. Of course. 

           Stevens goes to the door, cracks it and asks someone 
           O.S.:

                                 STEVENS
                        Could we see Mr. Welch again?

           Then, shutting the door and turning back to Adams:

                                 STEVENS (CONT’D)
                        Jenkins will have eaten us alive by the 
                        time he’s done straightening his bowtie.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ON a china ashtray emblazoned with the slogan:

                        IF IT’S AMERICAN, IT’S WORTH PROTECTING

           Pull back to REVEAL that it’s one of many, all placed at 
           EVEN INTERVALS along a U-shaped configuration of LONG, 
           POLISHED WOODEN DESKS. 

           We’re in an ORNATE SPACE, high-ceilinged and Corinthian-
           columned, with massive oak doors. The only people 
           currently in the room are CAMERAMEN, who quietly, 
           methodically assemble audio and visual equipment amid a 
           GROWING HUBBUB from the

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE

           Where a HUGE CROWD has gathered outside the oak doors. 
           Members of the public and the press MILL AROUND CHATTING 
           in anticipation. Among them we find Ellie, teetering to 
           the side because of her overstuffed shoulder bag. 
           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM

           From a more modest set of doors at the room’s rear, the 
           subjects of the hearing enter: McCarthy and Cohn, trailed 
           by their lawyer RAY JENKINS (50s, jowly, with vicious 
           eyes); Stevens and Adams, trailed by Welch; and then 
           every member of the Senate and their aides, including 
           Dirksen, Potter and Mundt. 

           As the senators take their usual seats, Mundt positions 
           himself at the head of the center desk; McCarthy, Cohn 
           and Jenkins sit on one side, while Adams, Stevens and 
           Welch take the other. 

           Meanwhile, the cameramen rush around training cameras on 
           the witnesses and adjusting desk-mounted microphones. 

           No one says a word until Mundt finally gives the order:

                                 MUNDT
                        Open the doors, please.

           The oak doors are opened and the PUBLIC AND PRESS COME 
           RUSHING IN, all shoving at one another to get the best 
           seats. Ellie chooses one where she has a clear line of 
           sight to Adams, who shuffles his notes nervously. 

           Mundt looks around for a gavel. Finding none, he lifts an 
           ashtray and uses it to RAP ON THE WOODEN TABLE. 
           Immediately, RED LIGHTS ILLUMINATE on all the cameras. 
           They’re rolling. 

           When Mundt speaks again, his tone is dry, almost as if 
           he’s irritated to even be there. 

                                 MUNDT (CONT’D)
                        It is the purpose of this investigation 
                        to make a full and impartial effort to 
                        reveal that which is true and to expose 
                        that which is false. We will begin by 
                        examining the Army’s timeline of--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Chairman, a point of order.

           McCarthy smiles unctuously at the nearest camera.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        The so-called timeline is labeled “filed 
                        by the Department of the Army.” As a 
                        former serviceman myself, I find that 
                        misleading in the extreme. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        The real Army should be deeply resentful 
                        that a few Pentagon politicians 
                        attempting to disrupt our investigation 
                        are calling themselves “the Department of 
                        the Army.” 

                                 MUNDT
                        Noted. Thank you very much, Senator.

           Welch placidly jots down a note. Unconcerned. Stevens 
           shoots Adams a frustrated look. 

                                 MUNDT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Jenkins, you may call your first 
                        witness.

           Jenkins rises, moves to stand so that he’s addressing 
           McCarthy. In a MONEYED, SLOW SOUTHERN DRAWL:

                                 JENKINS
                        Senator McCarthy, perhaps you could 
                        contextualize for us your attempts to 
                        unmask communism within the US Army. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Gladly. The thing we must remember, Mr. 
                        Jenkins, is that this is a war which a 
                        brutalitarian force has won to a greater 
                        extent than any brutalitarian force has 
                        won a war in the history of the world 
                        before. For example, Christianity, which 
                        has been in existence for two-thousand 
                        years, has not converted or convinced 
                        nearly as many people as this Communist 
                        brutalitarianism has enslaved in one 
                        hundred and six years. And they’re not 
                        going to stop. 

           He pauses to leer at the cameras before going on:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I know many of my good friends seem to 
                        feel this is a sort of game you can play, 
                        that you can talk about communism as if 
                        it’s ten-thousand miles away. But it’s 
                        right here with us now. 

           He glances pointedly at Adams and Stevens.
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Unless we make sure there’s no 
                        infiltration of our government, then just 
                        as certain as you sit there, in the 
                        period of our lives, you will see a red 
                        world. There is no remote possibility of 
                        this ending except by victory -- or by 
                        death for this civilization.

           The room is silent. Rapt. 

           INT. GREASY SPOON - NIGHT

           As Adams and Ellie take their usual booth, the TV mounted 
           over the counter blares the news:

                                 NEWSCASTER (T.V.)
                        A riveting first day of the Stevens-Adams 
                        hearings ...

           Ellie wolfs down her cheeseburger with her perpetual 
           brink-of-starvation enthusiasm, but Adams’ burger goes 
           untouched. His expression is hangdog as he asks:

                                 ADAMS
                        I think I already know the answer to 
                        this, but--

                                 ELLIE
                                (mouth full)
                        Not well. Not well at all. And according 
                        to the guys from ABC, it was the most-
                        watched thing on TV.

                                 ADAMS
                        Today?

                                 ELLIE
                        Ever. Where’d you guys find that lawyer? 
                        He acts like a small-town librarian. 
                        Looks like one, too. 

           Adams rubs his temples miserably. 

                                 ADAMS
                        He’s not what I’d hoped he’d be. 
                                (beat)
                        Don’t print that.

                                 ELLIE
                        I won’t. But it would be nice if you had 
                        something to give me that they couldn’t 
                        just as easily deny. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s your word versus theirs that they’re 
                        not the noble crusaders they’ve made 
                        themselves out to be, and Mundt is sure 
                        giving them plenty of airtime to make 
                        their case.

           As if on cue, the TV replays a segment of McCarthy’s 
           speech from earlier that day:

                                 MCCARTHY (T.V.)
                        The average American can do very little 
                        insofar as digging Communist espionage 
                        agents out of our government is 
                        concerned. They must depend on those of 
                        us who they send down here to man the 
                        watchtowers of the nation. 

           The camera cuts to a shot of Adams burying his face in 
           his hands. Across the table from Ellie, real-time Adams 
           has also buried his face in his hands. 

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

           The same packed-to-the-rafters room, red lights on TV 
           cameras shining, smoke drifting upward from hundreds of 
           cigarettes. Jenkins is questioning Stevens:

                                 JENKINS
                        Now, Mr. Secretary, that was not a part 
                        of your pattern to hold this boy David 
                        Schine as a sort of a hostage?

                                 STEVENS
                        Certainly not. And if he was a hostage, 
                        so have hundreds of thousands, if not 
                        millions, of young Americans been 
                        hostages when they’re doing their duty in 
                        the service of their country.

                                 MUNDT
                        You may well just face it: the 
                        implication here is that you were trying 
                        to buy off this committee from 
                        investigating the Army--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Chairman, point of order. 

           Adams’ cheek slumps into his microphone. Welch remains 
           silent, taking notes. 
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I think that question is completely 
                        improper and unfair. The implication is 
                        that this chairman could have been bought 
                        off. All the evidence is that this 
                        chairman could under no circumstances 
                        have been bought off.

                                                               CUT TO:

           SAME ROOM, NEW DAY

           Jenkins is now cross-examining Adams, who speaks 
           carefully, in a controlled tone:

                                 ADAMS
                        Mr. Cohn became extremely agitated, 
                        extremely abusive, about the fact that 
                        the Army was not agreeing to a special 
                        assignment for Schine.

           At his and McCarthy’s table, Cohn is SMIRKING AND SHAKING 
           HIS HEAD as if he’s never heard anything so stupid. 

                                 JENKINS
                        And when you told Mr. Cohn that you were 
                        unwilling to accommodate his requests, 
                        what was his response?

           Doing his best to ignore Cohn, Adams replies:

                                 ADAMS
                        He responded with vigor and force--
                                (beat)
                        “We will wreck the Army.”

           Jenkins slowly turns to face Cohn, who is ROLLING HIS 
           EYES DISMISSIVELY. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Mr. Cohn, do you deny or affirm this?

                                 COHN
                        I’m sure that I did not make that 
                        statement -- and I’m sure that Mr. Adams, 
                        or anybody else with any sense, could not 
                        ever believe that I was threatening to 
                        wreck the Army or that I even could wreck 
                        the Army. I say, sir, that that 
                        accusation is ridiculous. 

           Adams starts to respond, but Jenkins CUTS HIM OFF:
                                 JENKINS
                        Mr. Adams, a charge has been made against 
                        you that in order to pacify the 
                        Subcommittee on Investigations, you 
                        offered up bigger bait from time to time. 
                        To wit, homosexuals in the Army. 

           Adams COLORS. Losing his cool:

                                 ADAMS
                        He did that. That was his idea. He came 
                        to me with some story about the Army 
                        grouping homosexuals on their own base--

                                 JENKINS
                        That base isn’t in Tennessee, is it?

           TITTERING ECHOES through the room. Faintly amused:

                                 ADAMS
                        No, sir. Not in Tennessee. 

           SENATOR MCCLELLAN, seated in the gallery, chimes in:

                                 MCCLELLAN
                        Point of order, let’s exclude Arkansas 
                        too.

           Adams meets eyes with Cohn as the room ERUPTS IN 
           LAUGHTER. Cohn is frozen with a half-smile on his face, 
           his eyes darting around to assess everyone else’s 
           reaction as:

                                 ADAMS
                        I can do that, sir.

                                 MUNDT
                        The chair would like to raise a point of 
                        order on behalf of South Dakota.

           Now Cohn is JOINING IN THE LAUGHTER -- but it doesn’t 
           reach his eyes. Looking right at him:

                                 ADAMS
                        I can exclude all of the states of all of 
                        the members of this committee. 

           APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES RESOUND. When the laughter finally 
           dies down:

                                 MR. JENKINS
                        So it’s your contention that you did not 
                        instigate the investigation into the 
                        lavender boys. 
                                 ADAMS
                        I did not.

                                 MR. JENKINS
                        We got a firm answer on that, didn’t we?

                                 ADAMS
                        That is correct, sir. And you’ll always 
                        get a firm answer on that.

                                 JENKINS
                        You remember it distinctly.

                                 ADAMS
                        Yes. Distinctly.

                                 JENKINS
                        It’s interesting you say that. Because a 
                        memorandum between yourself and Mr. Cohn 
                        from the time period in question 
                        indicates the opposite. Senator McCarthy, 
                        do you have that memo?

           McCarthy pats his briefcase smugly. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        We’ll be entering it into evidence 
                        tomorrow, to give everyone the weekend to 
                        peruse it at their leisure. 

           Adams colors. Cohn raises an eyebrow at him as if to say, 
           your move. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I’d like to see it. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Mr. Adams, as a fellow jurisdoctorate 
                        surely you’re aware of the process for 
                        entering an item into evidence--

                                 ADAMS
                        I don’t care. If he really has it in his 
                        briefcase, he can show it to us.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Chairman, point of order--

           Adams SLAMS A HAND ON THE TABLE, rattling the china 
           ashtrays and causing Welch to STARTLE. Welch opens his 
           mouth to advise him -- don’t -- but Adams DOESN’T SEE, is 
           too busy FIRING BACK:
                                 ADAMS
                        No. No. No more points of order. He’s 
                        refusing to show the memo because it 
                        won’t exist until tonight, when they 
                        write it. They do this all the time. 
                        They’re specialists at it. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I won’t allow you to filibuster these 
                        hearings, Mr. Adams--

                                 ADAMS
                        You’ll see. It won’t be an original, 
                        it’ll be a carbon--

                                 MCCARTHY
                                (thundering)
                        Mr. Chairman!

           Mundt RAPS ON THE TABLE.

                                 MUNDT
                        Mr. Adams, Senator McCarthy has the 
                        floor.

           Adams opens his mouth to respond, but Welch places a 
           warning hand on his shoulder, shakes his head. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Never in my entire political career have 
                        I seen such a combination of salesmanship 
                        and threatening. Mr. Adams clearly told 
                        Mr. Cohn that if we agreed to lay off our 
                        investigation of the Communist 
                        infiltration at Fort Monmouth, he would 
                        give us the homosexuals instead. 

           At this, Adams shoots a look at Cohn, but his facial 
           expression betrays nothing.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Now, Mr. Adams’ exact motivation for this 
                        is not the subject of this hearing, and I 
                        don’t intend for it to be. But Mr. Cohn 
                        and I discussed it, and we agreed that to 
                        give in to his threats would send a 
                        signal to other Communists that these 
                        same kinds of tactics would be effective. 
                        So we decided that under no circumstances 
                        would we accede, and we retained the memo 
                        in case Mr. Adams one day attempted to 
                        deny his backroom double-dealing. Did we 
                        not, Mr. Cohn?
                                 COHN
                        Yes. That’s correct. 

           A SCANDALIZED MURMUR rises from the gallery. Adams FUMES. 
           Cohn STARES HIM DOWN: Not so funny now, are you?

           INT. STEVENS’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           An after-hours strategy session between Stevens and 
           Adams. Whatever Stevens just proposed has left Adams in a 
           nervous silence, chewing his lip. Finally:

                                 ADAMS
                        Do you think he’ll do it? Finally, after 
                        all this time?

                                 STEVENS
                        If I appeal to him as a fellow 
                        serviceman, then yes. I think maybe he 
                        will. 

           INT. GREASY SPOON - LATER

           Adams and Ellie sit hidden in a booth in the back. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m not sure I understand. 

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s constitutional law. The three 
                        branches of the government are forbidden 
                        from exercising power over one another, 
                        to preserve checks and balances.

                                 ELLIE
                        So your hope is that the President--

                                 ADAMS
                        --will invoke his right as Commander in 
                        Chief to protect the Army. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Couldn’t he have done that before?

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s not that simple. If Eisenhower 
                        publicly takes a stand against McCarthy 
                        he’s damaging his relationship with the 
                        Republican majority. He wouldn’t have 
                        thought it was worth it before. He may 
                        not think it’s worth it now. 
                                 ELLIE
                        So you’re betting it all, and on national 
                        TV no less. 
                                (beat)
                        Why are you telling me all of this?

                                 ADAMS
                        I’m a veteran and a Republican, but I 
                        can’t get into the Capitol Hill Club. 
                        You’re the only journalist in this mess 
                        printing retractions, but you can’t get 
                        into the Press Club. 

           He tries on a smile. 

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        It seems only fair that we should get a 
                        club of our own. 

           Ellie tries on a smile too. 

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

           The hearings continue. Jenkins is now “questioning” Roy 
           Cohn as senators and spectators look on intently and red 
           lights on cameras glow.

                                 JENKINS
                        And how did you come to suspect the Army 
                        of sheltering subversives in the first 
                        place, Mr. Cohn?

                                 COHN
                        We were slipped a list of suspected 
                        Communists generated by the Army itself. 

                                 JENKINS
                        “Slipped”?

           A COURIER enters through the wooden doors bearing an 
           envelope. He beelines through the crowd toward Stevens’ 
           and Adams’ table. Meanwhile, not noticing:

                                 COHN
                        By an anonymous source within the FBI.

           The courier hands Adams the envelope. Adams and Stevens 
           exchange a look. 

                                 JENKINS
                        So you did not, as Secretary Stevens and 
                        Mr. Adams have implied, scurrilously 
                        interrogate anyone without due cause.
                                 COHN
                        Absolutely not, sir. We’ll gladly enter 
                        the list into evidence--

           Adams interrupts:

                                 ADAMS
                        If I might, Mr. Chairman, we’d like to 
                        read out a letter from a concerned party 
                        regarding Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarthy’s 
                        items of “evidence.”

           Opening the envelope to remove a typed piece of 
           stationery bearing the PRESIDENTIAL SEAL:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        This is a letter addressed to the 
                        Honorable Secretary of the Army. 

           McCarthy, Cohn and Jenkins all exchange looks -- this 
           feels ominous. Adams goes on:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        “You will instruct employees of your 
                        department that in all of their 
                        appearances before the subcommittee of 
                        the Senate Committee on Government 
                        Operations regarding the inquiry now 
                        before it, they are not to testify to any 
                        confidential conversations or 
                        communications or to produce any 
                        documents or reproductions. I direct this 
                        action so as to maintain the proper 
                        separation of powers between the 
                        executive and legislative branches of the 
                        government, in accordance with my 
                        responsibilities and duties under the 
                        Constitution.”

           He briefly meets eyes with Ellie in the press gallery 
           before finishing:

                                 ADAMS (CONT’D)
                        “Sincerely, Dwight D. Eisenhower.”

           This gets the room HUMMING AGAIN. Cohn whispers in 
           McCarthy’s ear as Mundt HAMMERS HIS GAVEL for silence. 

                                 MUNDT
                        Thank you. The chair will now recognize 
                        Senator McCarthy or Mr. Cohn. 
           McCarthy takes a deep breath. Stevens and Adams glance at 
           one another -- this is it, this is the moment, how can he 
           possibly weasel his way out of this one?

           And then, slowly at first but swiftly gaining momentum:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Chairman, I must admit that I’m 
                        somewhat at a loss as to what to do at 
                        this moment. One of the subjects of this 
                        inquiry is to find out who was 
                        responsible for succeeding in calling off 
                        the hearing of Communist infiltration in 
                        government. At this point, I find out 
                        there’s no way of ever getting at the 
                        truth. The--
                                (with significance)
                        --iron curtain is pulled down, so we 
                        can’t tell what happened. We’ve got a 
                        tremendously important question here, Mr. 
                        Chairman. That is, how far can the 
                        President go? Who all can he order not to 
                        testify? Then any president -- we don’t 
                        know who will be president in 1960, or 
                        for that matter 1956 ...

           McCarthy CHUCKLES MODESTLY as if to say, We all know I’m 
           talking about myself at this point. The room LAUGHS 
           JOVIALLY ALONG WITH HIM. He’s managed to turn even this 
           rebuke to his advantage, and Adams and Stevens know it.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Any president can by an executive order 
                        keep the facts from the American people. 
                        I don’t believe this is the result of 
                        President Eisenhower’s own thinking. I’m 
                        sure if he knew what this was all about, 
                        he would not sign an order saying you 
                        can’t tell the Senate committee what went 
                        on when they cooked up those charges 
                        against Mr. Cohn and myself. 
                                (getting louder)
                        Someone, for his own benefit, should 
                        contact him immediately and point out to 
                        him that he and I and many of us--
                                (theatrical now)
                        --campaigned and promised the American 
                        people that we would no longer engage in 
                        government by secrecy, whitewash and 
                        cover-up. The American people will not 
                        stand for this.

           The room ERUPTS INTO CHEERS, led by prominent Senate 
           Republicans LEAPING TO THEIR FEET AND APPLAUDING. 
           In the press gallery, Ellie looks sick. 

                                 MUNDT
                                (banging gavel)
                        Let’s recess for lunch. These hearings 
                        will resume in one hour. 

           EXT. DC STREETS - LUNCHTIME

           Adams paces the crowded streets, dipping his face into 
           his collar whenever he passes anyone so they won’t be 
           able to recognize him. 

           Arriving at a bridge over the Potomac, he follows the 
           walkway until he’s standing over the deepest part of the 
           river. Stares down at the flowing water, agonized--

           --until he hears a voice from behind him.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Are you okay?

           Startled, Adams spins around to see a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN 
           leaning out the window of her stopped car. In the 
           passenger seat is a TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL who looks on 
           curiously as her mother repeats, worried:

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Are you okay?

           Adams attempts a reassuring smile.

                                 ADAMS
                        Just getting some air. 

           The woman stares at him skeptically a moment longer 
           before putting the car in gear. 

           INT. CAUCUS ROOM ANTECHAMBER - AFTERNOON

           Adams enters--

           --only to FREEZE IN HIS TRACKS at the sight of the room’s 
           lone inhabitant:

           MCCARTHY.

           They’ve never been alone together before. As the man at 
           the center of all this meets eyes with his adversary, 
           Adams really sees him for the first time.

           His THINNING HAIR, slick with product and sweat.
           His REDDENED CHEEKS, crisscrossed by broken capillaries.

           His WATERY EYES, which narrow ever so slightly as he 
           angles them upward -- wincing in the light. 

           He doesn’t look like a monster capable of architecting 
           the death of democracy. He looks like an old drunk. 

           Both wait for the other to speak first. Finally, in a 
           gentle, measured tone completely unlike the bellicose 
           persona he projects in front of the cameras:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s already over, John. 

           Adams is still frozen. Paralyzed. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t want to do those faggots a 
                        favor. Didn’t want to take orders from a 
                        cocksucker. I understand. 

           Adams blinks, manages to stammer out:

                                 ADAMS
                        That’s not -- I didn’t--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        No need to play coy. Everybody knows. He 
                        doesn’t even have the decency to be 
                        embarrassed by it. 

           McCarthy slams his famous briefcase down on a table, 
           flips the latches to open it. Adams is wide-eyed -- 
           trembling -- what’s going to come out of it, what fresh 
           hell is this man about to inflict--

           --and then the lid springs open, revealing:

           A PINT OF WHISKEY, half-empty.

           AND NOTHING ELSE.

           No documents. No folders. No notes. Just a flat glass 
           bottle that McCarthy uncaps, SWIGGING GREEDILY as if 
           renewing his very life force. 

           Noticing Adams watching, McCarthy wipes his lips with the 
           back of his hand, then replaces the bottle. As he re-
           latches the briefcase:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Go on, John, run out and tell all the 
                        cameras--
                                 (MORE)
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                                (feminine voice)
                        “He’s a liar, Joe’s a liar!” 
                                (regular voice)
                        Just like how you ran to Daddy when you 
                        got in over your head. Look where that 
                        got you. You’ve made yourself look 
                        stupid, you’ve made Bob look like a 
                        helpless functionary, you’ve made the 
                        Army look like dithering paper-pushers 
                        whining about this and that technicality 
                        instead of fighting for freedom, and you 
                        still won’t concede?

           Adams wants to shrivel in the face of this invective, but 
           forces himself to reply:

                                 ADAMS
                        What do we have to lose?

           There’s a silence.

           And then McCarthy CHUCKLES SOFTLY. His voice quiet, 
           dangerous, amused as:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So that’s it, is it. You think you have 
                        nothing left to lose. 

           McCarthy turns to go. This is meant to be his ending 
           note, his final threat.

           But then Adams, seeming to surprise even himself, steps 
           forward to BLOCK HIS WAY. Squaring himself against him, 
           locking eyes even as he struggles to control the tremor 
           that’s crept into his tone:

                                 ADAMS
                        Go on, then. Tell me. What are you going 
                        to come for? I want to hear it. Not from 
                        Roy, from you. 

           McCarthy opens his mouth--

           --then SHUTS IT AGAIN. Redness rises into his cheeks. A 
           flush -- is it the booze hitting his bloodstream?

           Or is it embarrassment?

           Adams steps aside as if to say -- your move. Stay and 
           fight, or walk out.

           McCarthy’s silent a moment longer.

           And then he WALKS OUT. 
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Adams BANGS FRANTICALLY on a hotel room door. After a 
           moment, it opens to reveal Welch, jacket off and collar 
           open, blinking in a baffled fashion. Excitedly:

                                 ADAMS
                        Shame.

                                 WELCH
                        I’m sorry?

           Adams pushes past him.

           INT. WELCH’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Adams paces the neatly kept room as Welch watches, wide-
           eyed. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I couldn’t understand why McCarthy put up 
                        with Roy. Why he didn’t cut him loose at 
                        the first sign of trouble. And then I 
                        realized -- Roy’s his ideal weapon, 
                        because Roy feels no shame.

                                 WELCH
                        And you think McCarthy does.

                                 ADAMS
                        It’s all over him, I just never saw it 
                        until now. He’s ashamed of himself, of 
                        his cowardice and his lies and the fact 
                        that he can’t win without cheating. So he 
                        drinks and he bloviates and when he just 
                        can’t stand himself for one moment 
                        longer, he sends Roy in to do what even 
                        he’s too ashamed to. 

           Welch takes a moment to think by removing his glasses and 
           wiping them clean. Then, replacing them:

                                 WELCH
                        So what are you proposing?

           INT. ADAMS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Leaving the stairs, Adams glances down to see that his 
           apartment door is STANDING WIDE OPEN. Light from inside 
           FALLS IN A TRAPEZOID onto the dingy hall carpet. 
           He pales. Advances slowly, cautiously. There’s SOUND 
           COMING FROM INSIDE -- thumping, clinking, rummaging. 

           Tentatively approaching, Adams calls out:

                                 ADAMS
                        Whoever’s in there--

           But he stops short when he comes up even with the door.

           It’s MARGARET, with Rebecca in her arms.

           Both adults’ faces crumple at the sight of one another. 
           In a flash, Adams’ arms are wrapped around his wife and 
           daughter, holding on like he never wants to let go again. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I thought you might be upset with me.

                                 ADAMS
                                (eyes squeezed shut)
                        This is what I didn’t know I needed.

           Between them, Rebecca babbles contentedly. 

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Jenkins is “questioning” Roy Cohn as senators look on 
           intently and red lights on cameras glow.

                                 JENKINS
                        How did you come to focus your 
                        investigation on Fort Monmouth?

                                 COHN
                        I’m sure everyone here is familiar with 
                        the Rosenberg case. 

           At his table, Adams glances into the gallery and meets 
           eyes with Margaret, who’s sitting next to Ellie in the 
           press section. Jenkins goes on:

                                 JENKINS
                        It was your assumption that the Soviet 
                        scheme at this defense plant was more 
                        extensive than anyone knew. 

                                 COHN
                        Not an assumption. A fact revealed in 
                        cross-examination of witnesses. 
                                 JENKINS
                        You’re aware that the Army believes some 
                        of these witnesses to be falsely accused. 

                                 COHN
                        I’m aware that it’s in the Army’s 
                        interest to spread that untruth, yes. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Very well. Thank you, Mr. Cohn.

           As Jenkins retakes his seat:

                                 MUNDT
                        We’ll adjourn for the afternoon’s Senate 
                        vote--

           Just then, Welch surprises the room by RISING. With a 
           courtly half-bow, in an exceedingly polite tone:

                                 WELCH
                        Mr. Chairman, I believe I have the right 
                        to briefly cross-examine the witness?

           Mundt stares down Welch, irritated. With a sigh:

                                 MUNDT
                        You may proceed.

                                 WELCH
                        Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

           Welch steps out from behind his table and approaches 
           Cohn. His manner as courteous and genteel as always -- 
           but from the way he LOCKS EYES with Adams before 
           speaking, it appears they just might have a plan. 

           In the gallery, Margaret shoots Adams an APPROVING SMILE 
           before giving Ellie a nudge, as if alerting her. 

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Cohn, I was wondering if you could 
                        tell us what is the exact number of 
                        Communists or subversives that are loose 
                        today in our defense plants?

           In a DEEPLY REGRETFUL TONE:

                                 COHN
                        I don’t know. 

           Adams gives Welch an encouraging look -- don’t stop 
           there. Welch goes on:
                                 WELCH
                        Roughly, if you don’t mind.

                                 COHN
                        I can only tell you, sir, about those we 
                        know about.

                                 WELCH
                        That’s ...

           Welch paces back to the table. Adams passes him a note. 
           Reading from it: 

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        ... that’s a hundred and thirty, isn’t 
                        that right?

           Clocking this newfound cooperation between them:

                                 COHN
                        I’m going to try to particularize for 
                        you, if I can--

                                 WELCH
                        I’m in a hurry, Mr. Cohn.  

           Off Cohn’s surprised expression:

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want the sun to go down while 
                        they’re still in there. Do you?

           Cohn’s briefly frozen by this shift in tone--

           --and then, seeming to re-calibrate his manner 
           accordingly, he CHUCKLES CONDESCENDINGLY. 

                                 COHN
                        I’m afraid we won’t be able to work that 
                        fast, sir.

           Welch begins to pace. As he does, he seems to GAIN 
           CONFIDENCE, going on incredulously:

                                 WELCH
                        Aren’t you alarmed at the situation?

                                 COHN
                        Yes, sir, I am.

                                 WELCH
                        Nothing could be more alarming, could it?

           With all the earnestness in the world:
                                 COHN
                        It certainly is a very alarming thing.

                                 WELCH
                        So will you now, before the sun goes 
                        down, give those names to the FBI and 
                        have those men put under surveillance?

           McCarthy stands, red-faced. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Point of order. 

                                 MUNDT
                        Senator McCarthy, you have the floor.

           McCarthy rises, attempts to CROWD WELCH with his bulk, 
           edging him away from the cameras. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Welch knows, as I have stated dozens 
                        of times, that the defense plants have 
                        the information. The problem is their 
                        failure to act. Now the only thing we can 
                        do is try and publicly expose these 
                        individuals so that they will be gotten 
                        rid of. And you know that, Mr. Welch.

           Welch holds his ground, replying calmly:

                                 WELCH
                        I don’t know that, Senator McCarthy. If 
                        the evidence against these men is so 
                        undeniable, then can’t the FBI put them 
                        under surveillance before sundown?

           McCarthy opens his mouth to respond, but Cohn SHAKES HIS 
           HEAD AT HIM, indicates with a subtle nod: Sit down, Joe. 

           Adams suddenly looks NERVOUS. Cohn’s on to them. 

           As McCarthy reluctantly takes his seat, Cohn TAKES OVER, 
           his SMOOTH COOL the opposite of McCarthy’s NEAR RAGE. 

                                 COHN
                        Sir, if there is a need for surveillance 
                        I can well assure you that Mr. Hoover and 
                        his men know a lot better than I. 

           He pauses to look into the nearest camera as he 
           concludes:
                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        I do not propose to tell the FBI how to 
                        run its shop. It does it very well. 

           Welch’s tone has gradually shifted from courteous to 
           overly solicitous. 

                                 WELCH
                        It really does, doesn’t it, Mr. Cohn?

           Cohn nods confidently. 

                                 COHN
                        When the need arises, yes, sir. 

                                 WELCH
                        So will you tell the FBI that there is a 
                        case where the need has arisen? 

           As this exchange continues, Adams watches McCarthy 
           closely. The other man’s eyes are now DARTING AT HIS 
           BRIEFCASE LONGINGLY. 

           Meanwhile:

                                 COHN
                        There is no need for me to tell the FBI 
                        what to do about this or anything else. 

           Adams SCRIBBLES SOMETHING on a sheet of memo paper. Tears 
           the paper off, hands it to an aide as Cohn goes on:

                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        And I’d respectfully submit that this 
                        line of questioning is a waste of the 
                        Senate’s time, as well as the American 
                        people’s.

           The aide gives Welch the paper. Welch takes his time 
           reading it, then BALLS IT UP AND DROPS IT ON THE GROUND 
           CARELESSLY. 

           When he speaks again, his cadence is even SLOWER, MORE 
           GENTEEL than ever before. He puts LONG PAUSES between 
           words, almost as if he’s INTENTIONALLY TRYING to take 
           forever. 

                                 WELCH
                        Mr. Cohn -- if you wouldn’t mind telling 
                        me one last time ... whenever you learn 
                        of a Communist -- or a spy -- anywhere 
                        ... is it your policy to get them out   
                        as -- fast -- as -- possible?
           Not even bothering to conceal his annoyance now:

                                 COHN
                        Of course we want them out as fast as 
                        possible.

                                 WELCH
                        So ... from now on -- whenever you learn 
                        of one of them, Mr. Cohn ... I beg of 
                        you, will you -- tell -- somebody -- 
                        about -- them -- quickly?

           McCarthy JUMPS UP, ENRAGED--

           --and Adams can’t help but BREAK INTO A GRIN as he once 
           again utters those familiar words:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Chairman, point of order.

           Mundt opens his mouth to speak, but McCarthy doesn’t 
           bother to wait this time. Moving so he’s in plain view of 
           one of the TV cameras:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        In view of Mr. Welch’s request that the 
                        information be shared once we know of 
                        anyone who might be performing any work 
                        for the Communist Party, I think there’s 
                        something he needs to know.

           Welch spreads his hands out invitingly. 

                                 WELCH
                        By all means.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He has in his law firm a young man named 
                        Fred Fisher -- whom he recently 
                        recommended to join him as an aide in 
                        these hearings-- 

           Adams and Margaret meet eyes. Here it comes. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        --who has been for a number of years a 
                        member of an organization called the 
                        Lawyers’ Guild which has been named the 
                        legal bulwark of the Communist Party. 
                        It’s an organization which always swings 
                        to the defense of anyone who dares to 
                        expose Communists. 
           McCarthy glances around the room to see how this 
           information is being received before continuing in his 
           usual unctuous manner:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Knowing that, Mr. Welch, I just felt that 
                        I had a duty to respond to your “urgent 
                        request.” We are now letting you know 
                        that your man did belong to this 
                        organization for three or four years. And 
                        I don’t think you can find anyplace, 
                        anywhere, an organization which has done 
                        more to defend Communists, to defend 
                        espionage agents, and to aid the 
                        Communist cause, than the man whom you  
                        wanted down here at your right hand. 
                                (beat)
                        Now, I hesitated bringing that up. I did. 
                        But I have been rather bored with your 
                        phony requests to Mr. Cohn here that he 
                        personally get every Communist out of 
                        government before sundown. Therefore, we 
                        will give you information about the young 
                        man in your own organization. I am not 
                        asking you at this time to explain why 
                        you tried to foist him on this committee. 
                        Whether you knew he was a member of that 
                        Communist organization or not, I don’t 
                        know. I assume you did not, Mr. Welch, 
                        because I don’t think you have any 
                        conception of the danger of the Communist 
                        Party. I don’t think you yourself would 
                        ever knowingly aid the Communist cause. I 
                        think you are unknowingly aiding it when 
                        you try to burlesque this hearing in 
                        which we are attempting to bring out the 
                        facts, however. 

                                 WELCH
                        Senator McCarthy ...

           Welch pauses as if to muster the strength to go on. Then, 
           speaking slowly and deliberately:

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        I think until this moment I never really 
                        gauged your cruelty or your recklessness. 

           McCarthy REDDENS as Welch goes on:
                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Fred Fisher is a young man who went to 
                        the Harvard Law School and came into my 
                        firm and is starting what looks to be a 
                        brilliant career with us. When I 
                        requested he join me for these hearings, 
                        I asked him, “I don’t know anything about 
                        you except that I have always liked you, 
                        but if there is anything funny in your 
                        life that would hurt anybody in this 
                        case, you speak up quick.” 

           Welch glances at Adams, who is watching intently.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Fred Fisher said, “Mr. Welch, when I was 
                        in law school and for a period of months 
                        after, I belonged to the Lawyers’ Guild,” 
                        exactly as you have suggested, Senator. 
                        Knowing what Misters Adams and Stevens 
                        had told me about your methods, I asked 
                        him to remain in Boston. Little did I 
                        dream you would be so callous as to do an 
                        injury to him anyway.
                                (beat)
                        It is true he is still with my firm. It 
                        is true that he will continue to be with 
                        my firm. It is, I regret to say, equally 
                        true that he shall always bear a scar 
                        needlessly inflicted by you.

           Every eye in the room is trained on Welch. No one has 
           ever seen anyone respond to McCarthy in this way.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        If this is how you comport yourself with 
                        the eyes of the nation upon you, I 
                        shudder to think what you’ve done behind 
                        closed doors. 

           As Welch says these words, Adams is MOUTHING THEM ALONG 
           WITH HIM. We realize -- he wrote these lines. 

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        I can only hope that your colleagues in 
                        this room were as unaware as the American 
                        people. 

           McCarthy GLANCES AROUND THE ROOM to see how this is going 
           over. EVERY ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES AVOIDS EYE CONTACT. He 
           turns SCARLET WITH HUMILIATION as Welch goes on:
                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        I like to think of myself as a kind man, 
                        but if they knew, then their, and your, 
                        forgiveness will have to come from 
                        someone other than me. 

           The LONG SILENCE that follows this monologue is broken 
           only by the sound of reporters FERVENTLY SCRIBBLING. 
           After a moment, STAMMERING SLIGHTLY:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. -- Mr. Chairman.

           The other senators are now staring at Mundt with enormous 
           interest. Clearly embarrassed:

                                 MUNDT
                        We, uh, do need to get to that vote--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Welch talks about my being “cruel and 
                        reckless.” But the real recklessness was 
                        his, when he covered for this young man. 
                        All I’m doing is giving his record--

                                 WELCH
                        Your knowledge of how he spent his post-
                        collegiate years is remarkably thorough. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        We dug into everyone in your firm.

           A SHOCKED MURMUR echoes through the room. McCarthy 
           REDDENS, realizing he’s made a misstep, as Welch RAISES 
           AN EYEBROW, responds with disdain:

                                 WELCH
                        What a noble use of the taxpayers’ money. 

           Now McCarthy’s fellow senators are SHAKING THEIR HEADS IN 
           DISGUST, either earnestly or in a display for the 
           cameras. Desperate to regain the control:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        This Lawyers’ Guild is the foremost legal 
                        bulwark of the Communist Party--

           His voice DRIPPING WITH DERISION:

                                 WELCH
                        Let us not assassinate this lad further, 
                        Senator. You have done enough. 

           McCarthy OPENS HIS MOUTH to bloviate further--
           --but Welch cuts him off, GOING IN FOR THE KILL. 

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Have you no sense of decency, sir, at 
                        long last? Have you left no sense of 
                        decency?

           The chamber is SILENT ONCE AGAIN as this sets in. After a 
           beat of HUMILIATED MUSTERING, McCarthy attempts:

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch--

                                 WELCH
                        I think it hurts you, sir.

                                 MUNDT
                        We do need to adjourn for the vote--

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’d like to finish this--

           Some of the senators in the chamber have begun to RISE. A 
           quick PUNCH IN reveals that they’re being led by none 
           other than Dirksen and Potter, neither of whom look back 
           as they SWIFTLY MOVE FOR THE DOORS. 

           As other senators begin to GATHER THEIR THINGS, with 
           INCREASING DESPERATION:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Welch talks about “any sense of 
                        decency.” If I’ve, uh, if I’ve said 
                        anything which is not the truth, then I 
                        would like to know about it ...

           McCarthy glances around. Sees more of the senators 
           RISING, TALKING AMONGST THEMSELVES. Ignoring him. 

           Trying once more:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Since its inception the Lawyers’ Guild 
                        has never failed to rally to the legal 
                        defense of the Communist Party--

           Now others are rising -- spectators, members of the 
           press. The operator of the camera nearest McCarthy 
           removes his eye from the viewfinder to light a cigarette.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        --and individual members thereof. Now, 
                        that is not the language of Senator 
                        McCarthy, Mr. Welch--
           The room is EMPTYING NOW. As Margaret is ushered out the 
           door along with the other members of the public, she 
           turns back to search the floor for her husband. When her 
           eyes find Adams’, she SMILES. Proud. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        --that is the language of the House Un-
                        American Activities Committee, a very 
                        esteemed committee ...

           But Welch is POINTEDLY no longer listening either; he 
           turns to Adams and WHISPERS A QUESTION IN HIS EAR. Then, 
           off Adams’ SUCCINCT NOD, they both STAND. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        And I can go on with more citations ...

           Adams and Welch are WALKING AWAY FROM THEIR TABLE now.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        It seems that Mr. Welch is pained so 
                        deeply he thinks it is improper for me to 
                        give the record ...

           Adams looks back at McCarthy one last time before 
           following Welch to the door. He’s STILL TALKING, even 
           though hardly anyone’s left in the room.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        ... the Communist front record of the man 
                        whom he wanted to foist upon this 
                        committee ...

           Adams turns away as McCarthy trails off, defeated:

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Well, uh, I guess now it’s time for all 
                        of us to go and ... vote.

           The camera operator with the cigarette looks McCarthy in 
           the eyes as he takes a LONG, INSOLENT DRAG. 

           Then he extinguishes the red light on his camera. 

           EXT. RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           As Adams and Welch exit the building, Welch is THRONGED 
           BY MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, all shouting questions at once:

                                 PRESS (MULTIPLE)
                        Mr. Welch! Right here, Mr. Welch!/Into 
                        the camera, Mr. Welch!
           Adams descends the steps, passing right by the crowd as 
           if he’s nobody. No one asks him any questions. Popping 
           flashbulbs are aimed elsewhere. 

           At the curb, Margaret’s waiting behind the wheel of their 
           car. Still unnoticed, Adams gets in and shuts the door, 
           and the car PULLS AWAY. The only one to see him go is a 
           beaming, triumphant Ellie. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - AERIAL VIEW - MORNING

           The rising sun washes the city in gold. It’s a new day, 
           not just for Adams, but for everyone. 

           INT. STREETCAR - SAME

           The commuters on the streetcar listen as the radio news 
           renders its final verdict on the hearings:

                                 NEWSCASTER (RADIO)
                        In the end, Senator McCarthy’s absurd 
                        concoction of a plot to thwart his 
                        investigation of Communism in the Army 
                        was supported by nothing save his own 
                        dull recital of it. 

           INT. CLASSROOM

           The students with their teacher listen as:

                                 NEWSCASTER (RADIO)
                        The picture presented of him was sharp 
                        and frightening.

           INT. BARBER SHOP

           On the inhabitants of the barber shop now:

                                 NEWSCASTER (RADIO)
                        His accusations were shown to be 
                        motivated not by national security, but 
                        rather by personal animus and petty 
                        grudges. 

           One of the barbers from before SHAKES HIS HEAD.
           INT. ADAMS KITCHEN

           Adams feeds Rebecca her breakfast as Margaret reads from 
           the Washington Post:

                                 MARGARET
                        “Once considered the favorite to succeed 
                        President Eisenhower in 1960, the man his 
                        party hung their hopes on exposed himself 
                        as the malicious, craven figure DC 
                        insiders have long known him to be.”

           She sets the paper down, revealing the blaring headline:

                 ‘SHOCK AND DISGUST’ AS MCCARTHY’S TRUE NATURE REVEALED

           Beneath is a byline: Eleanor Frank, staff writer.

                                                              FADE TO:

           INT. ADAMS BREAKFAST NOOK - SIX YEARS LATER

           Adams, in a nicer, more tailored suit than before, 
           listens to the radio with Rebecca, who’s now 7, a little 
           girl in pigtails. We’re in the breakfast nook of their 
           suburban home. Margaret, dressed for a job of her own in 
           heels and a skirtsuit, CLACKS IN BUSILY to clear the 
           breakfast dishes as: 

                                 NEWSCASTER (RADIO)
                        The news now, apparently official -- 
                        Senator John F. Kennedy was declared the 
                        winner of the presidential race at 7:19 
                        a.m. Eastern standard time.

                                 REBECCA
                        We have a new President?

                                 MARGARET
                        Finally.  

           Just then, the phone on the wall RINGS. Margaret clicks 
           over to pick it up as Rebecca asks Adams:

                                 REBECCA (B.G.)
                        Did you and Mommy vote for him?

                                 ADAMS (B.G.)
                        We did. 
                                 MARGARET (F.G.)
                        Hello?

                                 REBECCA (B.G.)
                        Why?

                                 MARGARET (F.G.)
                                (frowning)
                        I’m sorry, who?

                                 ADAMS (B.G.)
                        Because the country is changing, and 
                        that’s a good thing--

           Meanwhile, Margaret has placed her hand over the phone 
           receiver and interrupts to say, in a way tone:

                                 MARGARET
                                (to Adams)
                        John. It’s him. 

           Adams narrows his eyes. Takes the phone from Margaret and 
           extends the cord into the

           INT. DINING ROOM

           Shutting the connecting door, Adams says:

                                 ADAMS
                        Hello?

                                 COHN (O.S.)
                        Hello, John. 

           INTERCUT WITH 

           INT. COHN’S NEW YORK APARTMENT

           Opulent bordering on garish. A view of the city just 
           visible between carelessly swept together velvet drapes. 
           Cohn is draped on a Louis Quatorze sofa in a smoking 
           jacket, the remnants of what looks to have been quite a 
           party scattered around him. In a hoarse, hungover voice:

                                 COHN
                        Remember me?

                                 ADAMS
                        Quite well. 

           Cohn raises an eyebrow at the animosity in his tone. 
                                 COHN
                        I just thought I should call to mark the 
                        occasion.

                                 ADAMS
                        What occasion is that?

           REVEAL that Cohn is watching something on the TV opposite 
           his sofa: KENNEDY’S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH. 

                                 COHN
                        This day should have been his. Ours. 

                                 ADAMS
                        That was never going to happen.

                                 COHN
                        Don’t sell yourself short. I’ve been 
                        keeping tabs on you over the years. 
                        There’s a reason you’ve been so 
                        successful. 

                                 ADAMS
                        Your approval means the world to me.

                                 COHN
                        Ever think about trading up? I’ve got a 
                        nice little outfit going here in New 
                        York. 

                                 ADAMS
                        No thanks--

                                 COHN
                        I could start you at forty grand. Do you 
                        know how you can live for forty grand? 
                        Not to mention the doors my name opens. 
                        There’s a whole world you don’t know 
                        about, John. Not yet. 

                                 ADAMS
                        I guess you finally got what you wanted. 

                                 COHN
                        It’s what everyone wants.

                                 ADAMS
                        I’ll stick with what I have. 

                                 COHN
                        Ah. Yes. The little family. David’s 
                        married with kids now too, did you hear?

           Adams can’t help but look slightly saddened by this.
                                 COHN (CONT’D)
                        A beauty queen. She worked fast. 
                                (beat)
                        I know I crossed a line that day in the 
                        men’s room, mentioning your wife and 
                        baby. I regret it.

           Adams is silent a moment. Then:

                                 ADAMS
                        I regret something I said that day as 
                        well. 

                                 COHN
                        Sometimes I think I should get married. 
                        It’s becoming more conspicuous not to. 

           In the dimness behind Cohn, a YOUNG MAN STAGGERS THROUGH, 
           half-naked. Cohn waves him away as:

                                 ADAMS
                        It doesn’t matter what other people 
                        think.

                                 COHN
                        I wasn’t asking for your advice. 

           Cohn ERUPTS INTO A COUGHING FIT. Wincing at the sound:

                                 ADAMS
                        Roy, are you all right?

                                 COHN
                        Overindulged last night. You know how 
                        people drink at wakes. I enjoyed calling 
                        around for your number, though.

                                 ADAMS
                        I really have to--

                                 COHN
                        Alexandria. Three-bedroom colonial?

                                 ADAMS
                        As a matter of fact, yes.

           HOLDING ON COHN NOW, his tone increasingly TAUNTING, the 
           old edge creeping back in:

                                 COHN
                        I can just picture it now. House after 
                        house of happy little families. No 
                        divorcees or, god forbid, bachelors. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COHN (CONT'D)
                        No Jews, I’m guessing, although I’m sure 
                        everyone’s very open-minded. No Negroes, 
                        of course, except maybe as help. What a 
                        noble crusade you undertook, preserving 
                        freedom for all Americans as long as 
                        they’re just like you. 
                                (beat)
                        Hello? John?

           But there’s no answer from the other end. Cohn looks at 
           the receiver. TAPS IT. Nothing.

           Sighing, he HANGS UP THE PHONE. Dials again. This time he 
           gets a BUSY SIGNAL.

           Off his face as it HARDENS--

           INT. ADAMS DINING ROOM

           CLOSE ON the receiver of the phone -- left off the hook 
           on the living room floor. 

           EXT. ADAMS HOUSE - SAME

           Adams and Margaret help Rebecca into the car. Margaret 
           waves hello to the family next door, who are in the midst 
           of the same routine. Lemony sunshine, kids laughing, 
           American flags snapping on porch after porch ... 

           Cohn wasn’t right. But he wasn’t wrong, either. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           THEN:

           John G. Adams had a long and prestigious career in public 
           service, working as a lawyer, consultant and educator. He 
           died in 2003. 

           Joseph McCarthy, who at his peak was supported by fifty 
           percent of Americans, was formally condemned by his 
           Senate colleagues and is now viewed as one of the most 
           shameful and ignominious figures in political history. He 
           died of cirrhosis in 1957. 

           Roy Cohn went on to work for George Steinbrenner, John 
           Gotti, Rupert Murdoch and Roger Stone, amongst many 
           others, but his most famous client was Donald Trump. 

           He died of AIDS in 1986.
