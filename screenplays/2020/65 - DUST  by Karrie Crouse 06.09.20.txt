           A HOWLING DUST STORM.

           Opaque brown air thins to reveal a rundown farmhouse.  Atop
           the roof, a WEATHERVANE spins faster, faster, faster.

           A shutter SMACKS open.  The newly exposed window has been
           boarded up strangely ... FROM THE INSIDE.

           Feet sink, ankle deep in dust.  Grains of sand lodge in barely
           parted eyelashes.

           The hazy outline of a WOMAN against the horizon.  The skirt
           of her dress FLAPS violently as she stumbles away from the
           house, blinded by whipping dust ... LOST.

           A sudden, GASPING INHALE as she is CONSUMED BY THE STORM.

                                 MAN  (O.S.)
                        Margaret?

           TITLE OVER: DUST

                                                                 CUT TO:

           AN OPEN MOUTH

           Straining.  Neck muscles taut like rope.  The woman blinks --
           Then, her POV: dust motes glimmer in the morning light.

           The woman sits up, smooths her hair.  One fluid motion. 
           This is MARGARET BELLUM.  She is pristine, controlled.

           Her husband, HENRY BELLUM, half asleep, turns to her --

                                 HENRY
                        Margaret, they’re fine.

           But it’s too late.  Margaret is up and moving down a

           DARK HALLWAY

           She stops before a closed door.  Dances her fingers across
           the top lip of the DOOR-JAMB, finds a HIDDEN KEY.  The door
           CREAKS open to reveal 

           ROSE (16) and OLLIE (7), 
           Small facsimiles of Margaret, asleep in their beds.

           Margaret fixates on the RISE AND FALL of her daughters’ bodies
           as they SLEEP.  Then, suddenly --

           Henry is behind her, waving a hand in front of her face.

                                 HENRY  (O.S.)
                        You awake?
           Margaret turns, startled.

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course.

                                 HENRY
                        Better get to it.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           CUH-CRACK!  Margaret deftly breaks open a RIFLE; Henry hands
           her two SHELLS to load.

                                 HENRY
                        Take it with you at night.  Coyotes
                        are skittish, unless they’re hungry. 
                        Same with people.  Also --

           He holds up a spool of TWINE.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        -- Keep some by all the doors.

           Margaret crosses to Henry.  Instead of taking the twine, she
           touches his face, smiles.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        You keep saying.  About the twine.

                                 HENRY
                        Just got this knot in my stomach.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re ready.  I just need to keep on
                        top of everything.  Look after the
                        garden and the--

                                 HENRY
                        Will you look after yourself?

           Margaret takes the twine ... she’s heard this before.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        You could come with.

                                 MARGARET
                        I won’t put them in a tent.  Lose
                        what little we have.

           She moves to the WINDOW.
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        And I won’t leave her out there...
                        All alone.

           Outside, beneath a DYING TREE, is a lone GRAVE MARKER.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, PORCH - MORNING

           The front door pushes through a mound of DUST to reveal:

           HENRY.  Opening and closing the door for effect.  Margaret
           looks on, smoothing Rose’s hair, Ollie on her hip.

                                 HENRY
                        Switched the hinges so the wind can’t
                        push the door in, but don’t stay in
                        too long either.  That dust can
                        swallow a house easy.  Understand?

           Margaret looks out and we CUT WIDE to 

           AN OCEAN OF DUST

           Surrounding the farmhouse.  Sand drifts swallow lengths of
           fence, swell towards the front porch.

           TITLE OVER: OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE, 1933.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Margaret carrying water to a homemade, waist-high greenhouse
           in the GARDEN.

           As she moves, Rose and Ollie hop behind her, whipping
           Margaret’s apron strings like reins, matching their own feet
           with their mother’s FOOTPRINTS in the dust.  A homemade game.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Rose!  Still need to show you a few
                        things.

           Margaret watches Ollie trot off to a nearby 

           DUSTY FIELD, 
           And begins spinning in circles ... imitating a Dust Devil.

           INT. BARN, STALL - MORNING

           Rose watches Henry approach the cow, GEORGIA, with a RAG.

                                 HENRY
                        Love on her some while I do this.

           Rose pats Georgia as Henry wipes dust from the cow’s nose.
                                 ROSE
                        Like this?

                                 HENRY
                        That’s it.  Don’t have to be shy
                        with her.  Gotta do this every so
                        often.  Dust turns to mud in their
                        nose.  Drowns ‘em.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom knows.

                                 HENRY
                        Need you to know now too.  Lot more
                        for you to do while I’m gone.

                                 ROSE
                        Like what?

                                 HENRY
                        Like help with chores, and --
                            (quietly)
                        Make sure your mama’s sleeping.

           Rose avoids her father’s stare, watches the cow’s nostrils
           EXPAND with each shallow breath, struggling for air.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Hey ... hey --
                            (when Rose looks up)
                        You know why, right?

           CLANG!  Rose jumps as Georgia SLAMS her hoof into the wall. 
           Henry stops, listens -- the WIND has picked up.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Always feel it before we do.

           EXT. DUSTY FIELD - MORNING

           Ollie stands stock still, DOLL held limply at her side.  She
           stares into the distance, intense, hair dancing in the wind.

           EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

           Margaret looks up, squinting -- the WEATHERVANE changes
           direction.  She turns to the

           DUSTY FIELD,
           But this time ... Ollie is gone.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret scans the horizon for Ollie.  NOTHING.  Strangely,
           though, she doesn’t call out.  
           Instead, she lifts a piece of BROKEN MIRROR, angles it until
           sun GLINTS off the glass.

           Bright flashes of light dance across the dirt near Ollie’s
           ABANDONED DOLL.

           Margaret lowers the mirror.  In the distance, she spots a

           FIGURE APPROACHING, 
           Shimmering in the heat waves.  “Who is that?  WHAT is that?”

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Henry grabs a BUCKET of water, turns to Rose.

                                 HENRY
                        You think a storm’s moving in, wanna
                        get all the food and water you’ll
                        need from the kitchen...  Go ahead.

           Rose opens the PANTRY, grabs a neatly labeled JAR of food.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Carry it around to the main house. 
                        Otherwise you’ll have to go outside
                        during the storm.
                            (then)
                        Shoot.

           Rose follows Henry’s EYELINE to the KITCHEN WALL.

           There’s a CHALK OUTLINE where a DOOR should lead from the
           kitchen to main house, but the renovation was never completed.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Wanted to get that door put in.

           He grabs a ball of TWINE, opens the kitchen door.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Worse comes to worse, tie yourself
                        off here.  Easy to lose your way.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, KITCHEN ENTRANCE - MORNING

           Henry and Rose exit the kitchen.  Lug food and water around
           the SIDE OF THE HOUSE ... towards the FRONT PORCH.

           EXT. DUSTY FIELD - SAME  

           Margaret is still nervously searching for Ollie.  Just as
           she lowers the MIRROR... BAM!  Ollie POUNCES on her from
           behind.  Margaret turns and tickles Ollie.
           Strangely, Ollie SQUIRMS, but doesn’t make a sound. 
           Rudimentary SIGN LANGUAGE accompanies Margaret’s words.

                                 MARGARET
                        Look.

           [NOTE: Italicized dialogue is both spoken and signed.]

           OLLIE FOCUSES, SCANS ACROSS--
           Margaret’s LIPS and POINTING HAND to the horizon.  From
           shimmering heat waves, a LONE COYOTE takes shape.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Don’t wander, Little.  Not safe.

           A strong wind blows and Ollie hides her face in Margaret’s
           dress as we CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           Hands WRENCH water from fabric.  A finger smears VASELINE
           below nostrils.  A WET BANDANA clings to Ollie’s face.

           As Ollie breathes, the material DRAWS into her mouth.

           EXT. DUSTY LANE - DAY

           All donning homemade DUST MASKS, Henry BREAKS THE WIND for
           Margaret and the girls who walk behind him like ducklings. 
           They trudge past an

           ABANDONED FARM
           Where a CHILD stands atop a SAND DUNE.  The ROOF of a
           COLLAPSED BARN barely visible beneath it.

           The child spins the WEATHERVANE like a top.

           EXT. DUSTY CROSSROADS, CHURCH - DAY

           Near a one room CHURCH, a handful of MEN bid farewell to
           their tired WIVES, toss BAGS into the packed bed of an 

           ANCIENT FLATBED TRUCK,
           Which idles at the intersection of two lonely roads.

                                 HENRY  (O.S.)
                        Remember what I said?

           Rose nods.  Steals a look at Margaret as Henry wraps the
           girls in a tight embrace, furtively slips Rose a book:

                        “GHOST TALES OF THE AMERICAN PLAINS”

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t tell your mama.
           Henry stands and removes his HAT, uses it to block the wind
           from his and Margaret’s face.

                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        Kitten for Ollie, books for Rose. 
                        What’s first for us?

                                 MARGARET
                        Just the house.  A passway to the
                        kitchen, curtains.

           Margaret smooths Henry’s worn BLUE CANVAS JACKET, glances
           down at his FEET, laughs --

                                 HENRY
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        And new shoelaces.  Matching ones.

           Henry looks down -- his shoelaces are indeed MISMATCHED. 
           Margaret pulls him close.  Then, quietly --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        I’ll keep them safe.

                                 HENRY
                        I know.

           Margaret squeezes tighter, GRIPS the back of Henry’s neck.

                                 MARGARET
                        I love you.

                                 HENRY
                        Gonna love me to death here,
                        sweetheart.  Sweetheart?

           Margaret finally lets go.  Henry turns to reveal bright red
           CLAW MARKS on the back of his neck.

           Margaret looks down -- finds BLOOD beneath her fingernails. 
           She quickly begins to rub them clean.

                                 MARGARET
                        Must have snagged one in the garden. 
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 HENRY
                        I think I’ll make it.  You’ll stop
                        in on my sister?

           Margaret nods.  As the truck ROARS to life, Henry slips TWO
           COINS into her palm.
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        That’s the last of it.  In case you
                        need the train.

           Henry hops aboard as the truck pulls away.  Ollie runs after
           to wave, but Margaret nervously pulls her back.

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay close.

           Margaret watches WIVES fall apart as they bid their HUSBANDS
           farewell.  She smooths her dress, checks her posture.

           Seeing this, Rose straightens her shoulders too.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Margaret and the girls move past SHERIFF BELL (40s), a big
           man with kind eyes, as he wrestles the wind to hang a POSTER.

           When he stops to wave, wind RIPS the poster from his hands. 
           Sends it tumbling across the ground.

           Margaret plants a foot on the poster.  As he retrieves it --

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Hell, that’s ruined.  Want it, Rose? 
                        Somethin’ to draw on?

           Rose checks in with her mom.  Margaret nods: “Go ahead.” 
           Rose shyly takes the poster, which portrays a DUST-MASKED
           FAMILY waving from behind a window, and features the slogan:

                          “KEEP INSIDE.  FIGHT THE DUST.”

                        So how long’s papa gone for?

                                 MARGARET
                        Three months.

           Sheriff Bell WHISTLES.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        I’ll check in.  I know it can get
                        lonesome out there.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’ll be fine.  Thank you.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Wish all these gals had y’all’s grit. 
                        Anyway, I don’t mind.

                        State’s making me fill out reports,
                        kinda keep track of things since
                        that tragedy in Calabash.

                                 MARGARET
                        Sheriff.

           Sheriff follows Margaret’s EYELINE to Ollie and Rose.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        I’m sorry.  Lord.  Point being, this
                        weather can wear ya down.

                                 MARGARET
                        You can’t blame everything on the
                        dust.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        True, true.  Some people just got
                        rats in their attic.

           He TAPS his temple.  Another POSTER rips from its post.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        Dammit all.  Excuse me.

                                 ROSE
                        What’s “rats in the attic”?

           EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

           Margaret blocks the wind for the girls as they near the
           rundown house.  ESTHER SMITH (weary beyond her years) waves.

           Nearby, Esther’s son JACOB (15) nods, keeps shoveling dust.

                                 ESTHER
                        How’d my brother get off?

                                 MARGARET
                        Well.  There were quite a few heading
                        out.

                                 ESTHER
                        The last men standing.

           INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

           Seated at the table with Esther, Margaret leans her back
           away from the chair, uneasy in this MESSY one-room house.

                                 ESTHER
                        Minnie!  Put your cousin down.  You’ll
                        get her dirty!
           Nearby, Esther’s daughter, MINNIE (8), tries to lift Ollie.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        I don’t see how you keep everyone so
                        nice, Margaret.  Y’all seem to float.

           Margaret forces a smile as Esther’s youngest child, THOMAS
           (3), mid COUGHING FIT, crawls onto Esther’s lap.

                                 MARGARET
                        Will we see you at the sewing circle
                        tomorrow?

                                 ESTHER
                            (yawning)
                        Sorry.  He’s been at it all night.

                                 MARGARET
                        That cold that was going around?

                                 ESTHER
                        Started out like that, but it’s gotten
                        worse.  Pneumonia they say.

           Margaret stiffens, fixates on Thomas’ RED FACE... Then, on
           Rose and Ollie.  Esther notices.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        Oh, it’s not catching.  Doctor says
                        it’s just too much dust in the air.
                            (bemused)
                        What are we meant to do about that?

           Margaret notes the DUST covering EVERY SURFACE of the house.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s a battle.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Margaret watches the girls run to the house.  We slowly PAN
           OFF her face, across the parched field, over the dusty porch,
           and back onto Margaret.  She tightens her jaw, DETERMINED.

           I/E. FARMHOUSE - SERIES OF IMAGES

           - Fibers of a BROOM fling dust across the floorboards.

           - Heavy curtains ripple, snap TIGHT.  Loosened dust SHIMMERS
           in the window light.

           - Margaret performs each chore with steady precision.  She
           whisks her hand across the girls’ bed, smooths pillow cases.

           - Then, she SUDDENLY STOPS... horrified.
                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, my God.

           - A DINGY HALO OF DUST radiates out from a clean WHITE CIRCLE
           where Rose’s head blocked her pillow from dust.

           - RIP!  Margaret STRIPS the sheets.  

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Lips blow dust from a TEACUP.  MILK pours into the cup,
           Margaret quickly places a saucer ON TOP of the cup.  

           Margaret catches Rose MIMICKING the procedure.

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        Heavenly Father, preserve those who
                        travel...

           On the table, NAPKINS are folded OVER the cutlery.  PLATES
           are turned UPSIDE DOWN over the napkins.

           VIEW ON MARGARET 
           And the girls seated at the table, heads bowed --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        ... Bring them in safety to their
                        journey’s end.  Amen.

           Margaret lightly touches Ollie’s back: “Prayer’s over.”

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                            (to Ollie)
                        Hungry?

           Ollie nods eagerly.  They flip over their PLATES, dish out
           food.  Margaret runs her hand over the WHITE CIRCLES where
           the plates protected the cloth from dust.

           EXT. GARDEN - DUSK

           Rose and Ollie bathe in two WOODEN BARRELS.  Margaret tenderly
           scrubs their ears, noses, necks --

                                 MARGARET
                        There we go.

           Margaret dips a BUCKET in the bath water, carries it to:

           THE LONE GRAVE.  Tenderly pours water over the HEADSTONE;
           dust melts away to reveal the inscription:

                                 ADA JUNE BELLUM
                        “I will sleep until you come to me.”
                                 MARGARET
                        There we go.

           The girls watch Margaret, who seems to dote on the grave.

                                 ROSE
                            (re: the grave)
                        Remember her?

           Ollie shakes her head: “No.”  

           INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON the girls as Margaret SQUEEZES them tight.  Then,
           she FREEZES.  Eyes something off-screen.

                                 ROSE
                        What’s wrong?

           Margaret stands.  Wedges a rag into a CRACK beneath the
           windowsill where DUST has seeped in.

                                 MARGARET
                        I asked your daddy to patch this
                        before he left.

                                 ROSE
                        You think he’ll see Pennsylvania?

                                 MARGARET
                        No, too far east.

                                 ROSE
                        Do the building lights twinkle like
                        stars or just... kind of glow?

                                 MARGARET
                        I don't remember.  But the stars
                        here are much brighter.

                                 ROSE
                        I wanna see it.  Meet grandma and--

                                 MARGARET
                        They want to meet you too.  Maybe
                        next summer.  If the crops come in.

           Margaret quickly moves to the door.  Clearly a sore spot.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Lock this behind me.

           CLOSE ON Rose's hand, turning the lock as we CUT TO:
           THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           CLUH-CLANK.  The girls' door LOCKS.  Margaret moves down the
           corridor, melting into DARKNESS as we --

                                                           TRANSITION TO:

           A DARK INK ETCHING.  The OUTLINE OF A MAN is just barely
           discernible in a scrawl of BLACK LINES.

           Rose reads a ghost story aloud by lamplight.  Ollie nestles
           close, half-covering her eyes as she skims the TEXT --

                                 ROSE
                        The Grey Man locked his lovely wife
                        and five children in the bedroom,
                        then gathered embers from the fire. 
                        He wanted to burn the six angels up,
                        but fate had one more victim in mind. 
                        When he dropped the burning embers
                        into the room, his baby girl reached
                        for him, gripping his shirttail before
                        he closed the door.  The flames leaped
                        higher, and the man realized... his
                        shirt was caught.  He grabbed the
                        doorknob, but it seared his palm. 
                        It was no use.  The flames consumed
                        him.  Now, during a dust storm, the
                        Grey Man’s ashes blow back together,
                        and he walks the night.  If you don’t
                        wear your dust mask, you’ll breathe
                        him in and he’ll make you do terrible
                        things.

           Horrified, Ollie SIGNS to Rose.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        We can’t lock him out.
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Because ... he can come apart, and
                        seep in through the cracks.

           Ollie holds her breath, slams the book shut, SIGNS --

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t say that.  Mommy isn’t the
                        Grey Man.
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Because, she didn’t stop you
                        breathing.  She was upset about Ada,
                        and she wasn’t sleeping.
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Stop it!  She was trying to make the
                        bed!
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Seated at her VANITY TABLE, Margaret opens a MEDICINE BOTTLE. 
           Takes two pills with a neat sip of WATER, and moves to the
           bed.  She glances down -- beneath

           HER BARE FEET,
           A thin layer of DUST has begun to collect on the floorboards. 
           She grabs a RAG ... then, FIGHTING AN URGE, she stops ...

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Eyes SNAP OPEN.  Margaret sits up, places her feet on the
           floor ... CRUNCH.  Dust has BUILT UP during the night.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE: 

           Margaret sweeping, dusting, smoothing sheets.  

           INT. BARN, STALL - MORNING

           Margaret heaves water into Georgia’s trough.  She turns over
           the BUCKET to use as a stool as she milks the cow.

           Hearing FOOTSTEPS above, Margaret looks up through a HATCH
           in the ceiling to the HAYLOFT.  Dust wafts down.

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose?

           A beat.  Rose suddenly leans down, through the hayloft.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Toss down some hay, sweetheart.

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           As Margaret knots TWINE around the barn doors, wind whips
           her hair.  She eyes the WEATHERVANE ... it spins faster.

           EXT. DUSTY LANE - DAY

           CLOSE ON the dust-masked faces of Margaret and the girls. 
           They move strangely, seeming to LURCH with each stride.

           CUT WIDE to reveal they are walking BACKWARDS to avoid the
           dust-filled wind.

           EXT. SMITH HOUSE, PORCH - DAY

           As Ollie climbs the porch steps, Margaret and Rose are
           surprised to see Esther’s
           SKINNY WHITE MARE
           Hitched to a SMALL CART overstuffed with belongings.

           Minnie trots onto the porch, barefoot and wearing a grotesque
           homemade HALLOWEEN MASK with dark gaping eye and mouth holes.

                                 MARGARET
                        Minnie, where’s your mother?

           Jacob bustles outside, plucks the mask from Minnie’s face.

                                 JACOB
                        She’s inside.  Been packin’ all night. 
                        Hi, Rose.

                                 ROSE
                        Hi.

           Shy, Rose looks down, tucks in closer to Margaret.

           INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

           Pulling a JAR OF MILK from her bag, Margaret spots Thomas,
           faced away on the bed, COUGHING deeply as Esther packs.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re not leaving?  The wind’s
                        terrible.  Must be a storm coming.

                                 ESTHER
                        There’s always a storm coming.

                                 MARGARET
                        But where will you go?

                                 ESTHER
                        Doesn’t matter.  Anywhere.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’ll be exposed in that cart,
                        Esther.  Unprotected.
                            (then)
                        Listen.  All you need to do is make
                        sure Thomas stays inside.  Seal it
                        up more.

                                 ESTHER
                        Even so, it seeps.  Through
                        everything.  I find it in the oddest
                        places.

           In a daze, Esther rubs her ears, feeling for dust.

           Thomas COUGHS LOUDER.  Margaret fixates on the boy’s sinewy
           back -- muscles constricting with each GASPING COUGH.
                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        Last night, he wouldn’t stop coughing
                        and--

                                 MARGARET
                        Couldn’t.

                                 ESTHER
                        How’s that?

                                 MARGARET
                        He couldn’t stop coughing.

           Esther pours milk into a TEACUP for Thomas.

                                 ESTHER
                        Of course...  And I had this dream
                        where I stuffed handkerchiefs into
                        his mouth, over and over until he...
                            (sotto)
                        ...Stopped.  Margaret, he... I--

                                 MARGARET
                        Here.

           Margaret interrupts to place a saucer ON TOP of Thomas’ cup.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, thank you... I just hope you
                        know all you done to keep us going. 
                        Our very own Seraphim.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s just a bit of milk.

                                 ESTHER
                        Well.  It got us through.

           Just then, Ollie appears and tugs on Esther’s dress.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                            (slowly, loudly)
                        WANNA MAGIC TRICK?

                                 MARGARET
                        Not now, Little.

                                 ESTHER
                        It’s okay.

           Esther takes the HANDKERCHIEF from Thomas’ mouth and makes
           it DISAPPEAR into her hand.  As she moves to make it RE-APPEAR
           behind Ollie’s ear, Margaret SNATCHES the fabric away.
                                 MARGARET
                        We should let you get going.

                                 ESTHER
                        Guess we’d better.  The air... it’s
                        poison.

           EXT. ESTHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Uneasy, Margaret TIGHTENS the bandana around Ollie’s face.

                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        Mom?  Mom.

           Suddenly, Ollie BITES Margaret’s hand through the dust mask.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ow!

                                 ROSE
                        It was too tight.

                                 MARGARET
                        Sorry, Little.

           INT. ONE ROOM CHURCH - DAY

           Bent, arthritic fingers push a NEEDLE through fabric.  Several
           WOMEN, including Margaret, encircle a QUILT-IN-PROGRESS.

           Most of the women seem to have risen from the dust itself --
           tan skin, straw hair, dirty clothes -- while Margaret’s dress,
           speech, posture, stands apart.

           BIRDIE BELL (late 30s, tiny with a PREGNANCY BUMP) and BERTHA
           BELL (70s, sturdy) -- question Margaret in tandem:

                                 BERTHA
                        Just left?

                                 MARGARET
                        Thomas has been poorly--

                                 BIRDIE
                        But still.

                                 BERTHA
                        Well... I’ll be praying for them.

           MURMURS of affirmation from the group.  Margaret glances out
           the window -- Rose and Ollie run by, playing in the cemetery.

                                 BERTHA (CONT'D)
                        It’s good you brought the girls,
                        Margaret.
                                 MARGARET
                        Why is that?

                                 BIRDIE
                        Suppose you haven’t heard about
                        Calabash?

           The women exchange looks.

                                 BERTHA
                        Drifter waltzed into this house while
                        the family were just outside.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Ransacked the pantry.  Found him
                        eating crackers over their baby.

                                 BERTHA
                        No, Birdie, he’d already eaten the
                        crackers.  He was just looking at
                        the baby.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Oh...

           JANIE, a wisp of a woman, timidly chimes in:

                                 JANIE
                        He must’ve been hungry.

                                 BERTHA
                        Hunger doesn’t explain starin’ at a
                        baby like that.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Just starin’.

                                 BERTHA
                        And it certainly doesn’t explain
                        what he did after ... Killed everyone
                        but the mama.  Said he was makin'
                        the children--

                                 BIRDIE
                        Ghosts.

                                 BERTHA
                        No.  He said angels, Birdie.  

                                 JANIE
                        My Lord.  I can’t keep up with chores
                        as it is, how am I supposed to watch
                        out for fiends too?

           Margaret clocks Rose eavesdropping by the OPEN WINDOW.
                                 MARGARET
                        Easy.  You just keep your guard up. 
                        Always.  People are monsters when
                        they’re desperate.

           Beat.  Birdie glances at Margaret’s QUILT SQUARE.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Well I hate you, Margaret!  What a
                        fine hand you have.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh it’s our dream for the house. 
                        I’ll shade it in of course.

           Bertha checks it out -- Margaret has stitched an elegant
           outline of the BELLUM FARMHOUSE in black thread.

                                 BERTHA
                        Fancy.  You learn that stitch in
                        Philadelphia?

           The women trade looks.

                                 MARGARET
                        From my mother.

                                 BIRDIE
                        You should have the center square!

                                 BERTHA
                        We’ll put it to a vote when the time
                        comes.

           A long beat.

                                 JANIE
                        They ever catch him?  That drifter?

                                 BERTHA
                        Not yet.

           BAM!  The window shutter suddenly SLAMS CLOSED.  Margaret
           starts, PRICKING her finger with the sewing NEEDLE.

           A drop of BLOOD mars the pristinely stitched farmhouse.

                                 MARGARET
                        Goodness.

                                 BIRDIE
                            (looking out the window)
                        Goodness is right.
           EXT. DUSTY LANE - DAY

           With Ollie on her hip, and Rose behind her, Margaret RUNS.

           OLLIE NERVOUSLY WATCHES--
           The approaching dust storm BOUNCE with her mother’s strides.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - QUICK MONTAGE

           Rose checks the barn doors.  BAM!  Margaret shutters the
           house.  Ollie grabs laundry, sees the DUST STORM upon them.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Margaret grabs a BUCKET of water.  Rose opens the PANTRY.

                                 ROSE
                        How many?

                                 MARGARET
                        A couple, in case it’s a long one.

           Rose waves a jar of PEACHES next to her smiling face.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        We’re saving those.

                                 ROSE
                        Can’t I just taste one?

                                 MARGARET
                        ROSE!  

                                 ROSE
                        Sorry.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’ll celebrate with the peaches
                        when your daddy’s back, okay?

           Margaret takes the jar, moves to the pantry.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Where’s the other one?

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARGARET
                        There were two jars.

                                 ROSE
                        Maybe dad took one for his trip?
           On Margaret, unconvinced.  She RE-CHECKS THE LOCK.  Loops
           TWINE around the door handle.

           Meanwhile, Rose SIGNS to Ollie --

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Bet the Grey Man ate the peaches. 
                        He’s out here.  Don’t breathe.

           Ollie flings open the door, and takes off... Margaret PANICS --

                                 MARGARET
                        What did you say to her?!

                                 ROSE
                        I was just teasing.

           Margaret unwinds the spindle of TWINE.  Follows Ollie

           OUTSIDE

           The air is opaque, but Margaret spots Ollie rounding the
           side of the house.  Heading inside.  

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret stops in the doorway -- a line of tiny DUSTY
           FOOTPRINTS leads to the STANDING WARDROBE.

           The wardrobe door opens to reveal: OLLIE.  Huddled beneath
           hanging clothes.  Kneeling down, Margaret SIGNS --

                                 MARGARET
                        Hi.
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        I know you want daddy.  Where is he
                        anyway?  Circus?  White House?

           Ollie smiles, makes an ARCH SIGN with her hands.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Work on a bridge.  Right.  Look.

           Margaret unfolds a POCKET KNIFE, carves two NOTCHES on the
           inside of the wardrobe door.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Ninety, okay?  One for every day.

           She hands the knife to Ollie, who sets it down, SIGNS --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Bad guys?  I’ll shoot ‘em.  Coyotes? 
                        I’ll... bite ‘em. 
           Rose reaches past, pulls a WEDDING DRESS from the wardrobe.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Hey.

                                 ROSE
                        Can’t I just try it on?

                                 MARGARET
                        It’ll be yours one day, then you can
                        try it on all you want.

                                 ROSE
                        It's so pretty.

           Rose stands in the mirror, holds up the dress, beaming.  

           Margaret reaches for Ollie, who scoots back, unconvinced.

                                 MARGARET
                        What?  What else is scary?

           Ollie stares at a SMALL HIGH WINDOW on the bedroom wall.

           As Margaret approaches the imperfect glass, her reflection
           MORPHS, becomes GROTESQUE -- eye dripping, mouth contorting.

           Ollie SIGNS again.  Margaret turns to Rose --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Who’s the Grey Man?

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret's HAND runs over the ink etching of THE GREY MAN. 
           Her eyes scan the text:

                      “SEEPS THROUGH CRACKS” “BREATHE HIM IN”

                                 ROSE
                        It's just a ghost story.  I said he
                        ate the peaches.

           Margaret closes the book, tucks SIGNS of Ollie:   

                                 MARGARET
                        Not real, okay?  
                            (then, to Rose)
                        I’m taking this.

           Rose GLARES at Ollie.  The house GROANS like the hull of a
           ship as the storm intensifies.  Windows WHISTLE and CHATTER.

                                 ROSE
                        Tell about the wheat.
           Ollie presses the side of her face against Margaret’s chest,
           feels the PURR of her mother’s voice and watches

           DARK SHADOWS SLITHER 
           Down the walls as Rose slides her fingers down the LANTERN.

                                 MARGARET
                        The first year we planted, it just
                        took hold.  When the wind blew, the
                        wheat would wave like the ocean. 
                        One day your daddy was late coming
                        in, so I went to the field, and in
                        some parts the wheat covered my head. 
                        I got so turned around I had to jump,
                        and try and see the house--

           FLASH TO: Margaret’s JUMPING POV of the house appearing and
           disappearing behind UNDULATING WHEAT.

                                 ROSE
                        Think it’ll be like that again?

                                 MARGARET
                        I do.

                                 ROSE
                        Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        Because it was before.

           On Ollie, signing.  Margaret nods.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Everyone started coming.  They tore
                        all the grasses up to plant.  And it
                        didn’t rain, and it didn’t rain.

                                 ROSE
                        I heard Birdie saying there’s an end
                        of summer dance, but she doesn’t
                        think any families will be left by
                        then ... should we leave too?

                                 MARGARET
                        Like Aunt Esther?
                            (off Rose's nod)
                        Why would we do that?

                                 ROSE
                        ... I think Ollie’s scared.

                                 MARGARET
                        What about you?
                                 ROSE
                        I’m not scared, but...maybe we should? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you remember why Aunt Esther came
                        here?  What happened?

                                 ROSE
                        Uncle John’s sleeve got caught in
                        the machine.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s right.  Ever since Esther’s
                        been sort of ... helpless.  She never
                        made a garden like us.  Let their
                        cow wander off.  Rose, they’re likely
                        headed for a tent.  Crowded in and
                        working for nothing.  It wasn’t smart
                        to go, understand?

           Margaret stands.  Smooths the WET SHEET that now hangs over
           the window --  

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        This should help with the dust, okay? 

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  What about that man?  The
                        drifter?

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t listen to those hens, Rose. 
                        They can make anything into a
                        calamity, given enough time to cluck.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret strides to the front door.  Double checks the lock.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret opens her VANITY DRAWER, moves aside the coins from
           Henry and drops in the BOOK of ghost stories.

           She swipes unseen DUST from the table, eyes the BROOM in the
           corner.  Then, fighting the urge to keep cleaning, she instead
           takes one of her PILLS and climbs into bed.

           MARGARET’S SIDEWAYS POV--
           Of the bedroom door begins to SOFTEN.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MARGARET’S SIDEWAYS POV--
           Of the bedroom door RE-FOCUSES as Rose SHAKES her awake.
                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  Mom!

           Margaret sits up with a SUDDEN GASP.

                                 MARGARET
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 ROSE
                        Someone’s outside.

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - MORNING

           OLLIE NERVOUSLY WATCHES-- 
           As Rose presses her ear to the wall.  Motions for her mother.

           But Margaret is distracted by a DARK STAIN on Rose’s pillow.

                                 MARGARET
                        What is that?  Blood?

                                 ROSE
                        Shhh!

           Just then, a SCRATCH TAP TAP TAP along the outside wall.

           Margaret rips down the WET SHEET covering the shuttered
           window, peers through 

           A SUN-FILLED CRACK in the wall.  SOMETHING DARK strobes past.

           Margaret jumps back.  Rushes to the door.

                                 MARGARET
                        Lock this behind me.  Don’t open it
                        no matter what you hear.

                                 ROSE
                        Wait!  Mom?!

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Margaret cracks open the RIFLE.  Her trembling hands betray
           a calm voice --

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s okay, sweetie.  Probably Sheriff
                        Bell checking on us.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, PORCH - MORNING

           Margaret shoulders the door through a MOUND OF DUST.
           SILENCE.  Hands clenched tight on the rifle, Margaret edges
           along the porch, peers down the side of the house to the
           girl’s bedroom window ... nothing ... then, a CREAK from

           THE BARN

           Margaret approaches nervously.  Touches the TWINE securing
           the door handles ... it’s LOOSE.

           INT. BARN, STALL - MORNING

           Georgia paces anxiously.  As Margaret turns to exit,

           THROUGH CRACKS IN THE WALL,
           We see SOMEONE or SOMETHING outside the barn.

           INT. HAYLOFT - MORNING

           Margaret climbs into the hayloft and scans each... shadowy...
           corner... but the loft is EMPTY.

           EXT. BARN - MORNING

           Margaret turns to find 

           A RIDER-LESS HORSE in her path.  She laughs, relieved, but
           quickly realizes... This is Esther’s WHITE MARE.

           EXT. DUSTY FIELD - MORNING

           Margaret ties Esther’s mare to a fence.  In the distance, a
           small CROWD encircles something UNSEEN.

           On Margaret, arcing around the ONLOOKERS.  Between the spaces
           of their legs, she spots a BODY buried in the dust -- a hand,
           a shoulder... boots with MISMATCHED LACES.

           Margaret pushes closer to the body.  Sheriff Bell uses WIRE
           CUTTERS to untangle it from a barbwire fence.

                                 MARGARET
                        Excuse me.  Sorry...

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Back up, y’all.  Just back on up!

           Everyone moves except for Margaret who fixates on the BOOTS.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        Margaret?  Ya alright?

           Upon closer inspection, Margaret sees that the laces are NOT
           MISMATCHED.  One is simply dustier than the other.
                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry ... I thought his shoelaces
                        were mismatched.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        I’d say he’s got bigger problems
                        than that.

           Bell turns the body’s head -- dust pours from his open mouth. 
           Bertha MURMURS: “It’s Jacob, Esther’s boy.” 

           Near an OVERTURNED CART, Birdie clutches Esther’s CHILDREN,
           turns so they can’t see the body.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        Shoot.  Must’ve got tossed in the
                        storm, hung up in the wire here.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where’s Esther?

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Don’t know.  Little ones were under
                        the cart.  Probably put ‘em there
                        before she went looking for Jacob.

           Bell goes to lift the boy, but Jacob’s hand is entwined with
           ANOTHER HAND.  Suddenly,

           ESTHER IS BIRTHED FROM THE DUST.

           She LURCHES to a sitting position, SUCKS IN AIR, COUGHING...
           Margaret covers her mouth, horrified.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Ollie, a black ARM BAND tied around her sleeve, carves a
           NOTCH in the wardrobe door -- Day 15.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        By the sweat of your brow, you shall
                        eat bread until you return to the
                        ground from which you were taken for
                        you are dust...

           EXT. CHURCH GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Sheriff Bell shovels dust onto Jacob’s COFFIN.

                                 PREACHER
                        ...And to dust you shall return.

           Esther is being held upright by several DISTRAUGHT WOMEN as
           Thomas clings to her leg COUGHING and COUGHING.
           PUSH IN on Margaret as she endures the unceasing sound. 
           COUGH.  She CLENCHES her jaw.  COUGH, COUGH.  Her breath
           quickens.  Thomas HACKS blood onto Esther’s dress.

           Margaret's POV: Blood crawls through the cotton fibers of
           Esther’s dress.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?

           Margaret realizes that her fingers DIG INTO Rose’s shoulder. 
           She loosens her grip, smiles apologetically.

           INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

           A GROUP OF WOMEN encircle Esther; her body is limp with grief
           as Thomas sits in her arms STILL COUGHING.

           As the women console Esther, Margaret busies herself with
           sweeping and re-sweeping --

                                 BERTHA
                        He works in mystery.

                                 BIRDIE
                        But he’s a wise provider.

                                 ESTHER
                        If Thomas goes too ... I’d just...

           Bertha pats Esther’s hand.

                                 BIRDIE
                        All you can do, all anyone can do,
                        is hold faith.

                                 BERTHA
                        Faith that He has a plan for Jacob
                        and Thomas.  A plan more important
                        than we may ever understand.

                                 ESTHER
                        Some things are just out of our hands,
                        I guess?

           Margaret turns her attention to the state of the house --
           DUST in the corners, GAPS in the walls.

                                 MARGARET
                        And some things aren’t.
                            (then)
                        You can’t just have faith that He’ll
                        do something, that it’s “part of the
                        plan” ... or they’ll die.  We’ll all
                        be buried.
                                 BERTHA
                        Sounds like pride to me.

                                 MARGARET
                        Pride can be an admirable quality.

                                 BERTHA
                        Unless you step into God’s realm.

           Margaret sweeps faster.

                                 MARGARET
                        Better than burying another child.

                                 ESTHER
                        I tried to leave--

                                 MARGARET
                        In a storm.

                                 ESTHER
                        I can’t change the weather.  Can’t
                        make it rain.  What should I do?!

                                 MARGARET
                        You might try sweeping.

           Esther is floored -- tears spill over her eyes.  Margaret
           sweeps the pile of dust to the front door.

                                 BERTHA
                        Just look in your wake, Margaret. 
                        Is it any different?

           As Thomas COUGHS, Margaret looks down and we CUT TO --

           MARGARET’S FEET 

           And her DUSTY BEDROOM FLOOR beneath them.  She eyes her
           REFLECTION in the VANITY MIRROR, debating... then --

           She suddenly opens her mouth.  Spits out her SLEEPING PILL.

           I/E.  FARMHOUSE - SERIES OF IMAGES

           Margaret cleans ALL NIGHT.  She sweeps dust past the girls’
           door.  Scrubs the floor.  Flings dust off the porch.  Only
           stopping as the SUN RISES...

           Red-eyed with exhaustion, Margaret once again comes to a
           stop in front of the girls’ BEDROOM DOOR.

           The floor is already dusty again.
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret whips open her VANITY drawer, pushes aside the ghost
           story BOOK to reveal: The COINS that Henry gave her.

           INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose GASPS awake.  Margaret looms over her.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  Are you awake?

                                 MARGARET  (V.O.)
                        We’d better hurry.  We’ll meet up
                        with your father.  Just until the
                        drought breaks, and the dust calms...

           And during the above dialogue we see --

           A QUICK MONTAGE: 

           ROSE closing shutters.  OLLIE gathering hay for Georgia,
           nervously eyeing the DARK CORNERS of the hayloft.  

           As MARGARET cleans Ada's headstone, she continues --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        ...We’ll come back of course.  The
                        train's much safer.  Less exposed.

           EXT. DUSTY LANE - DAY

           Dressed to the nines, travel BAGS in hand, Margaret begins
           to hop.  The girls hop behind her.  Playing their old game. 
           Then, in the far distance, a TRAIN WHISTLE.

                                 ROSE
                        Did you hear that?

           Margaret nods.  Rose SIGNS to Ollie and they take off running.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Careful!

           Margaret eyes a SPEEDING TRUCK approaching the intersection. 
           Then, a light wind tousles her hair, and she looks away to
           the sky, worried. 

           As the girls run, Ollie’s face grows RED; veins BULGE from
           her neck.  Rose tackles her beside the road, SIGNS --

                                 ROSE
                        Don't breathe the Grey Man in.  Or
                        he’ll come with us.  He’s right here. 
                        Look.
           Ollie refuses to inhale as Rose pins down her arms tickles
           her, and we see the

           TRUCK.  Hurdling closer, wheels GRINDING, dust in its wake.

           ON MARGARET, distracted, eyeing the DISTANT TOWN on the
           horizon,the FARM in their wake.  Checking the sky again. 

           Then, as the truck careens past the girls, a SCREAM.  Margaret
           snaps to attention, but... a cloud of DUST, stirred up by
           the truck, obscures her view--

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose?!

           Ollie suddenly slams into Margaret's legs -- her face is
           BLOODY, her dress flecked with red dots.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What’s wrong?!  Where are you hurt?!

           Ollie flails, too rattled to answer as Margaret, increasingly
           FRANTIC, struggles to find the source of blood.

                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        Mom!  MOM!  It’s me.

           Margaret looks up -- Rose moves her hands away from her face
           to reveal ... a NOSE BLEED.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh my God.

           Margaret presses a HANDKERCHIEF to Rose’s nose.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What happened?  Did you fall?

                                 ROSE
                        It just started coming out.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re okay.  You’re okay.  You’re--

           FLASH TO: Thomas hacks blood onto Esther.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!  I can’t breathe!

           Margaret loosens her grip, FIXATES on the handkerchief --
           blood crawls through the fibers of the cloth.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        It’s just a nosebleed.  Let’s go. 
                        Please.
           FLASH TO: Dust pouring from Jacob’s mouth.

           Torn, Margaret gauges their distance: TOWN OR HOME?

           INT. DOCTOR COX’S HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE ON the curve of Rose’s bare back, taking a DEEP INHALE.

           Margaret looks on as DR.  COX (67), cigarette dangling from
           his lips, moves his STETHOSCOPE from Roses’s back to Ollie’s.

                                 DR. COX
                        Fit as a coupla fiddles.

                                 MARGARET
                        It just poured blood.  It wouldn’t
                        stop.

                                 DR. COX
                        Air’s dry.  That’s my guess.

                                 MARGARET
                        Your guess?

                                 ROSE
                        I feel fine, mom.

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose.  Would you mind?

           Once the girls are gone --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Esther mentioned something about the
                        dust making Thomas ill?  The air--

                                 DR. COX
                        That’s a different ballgame with
                        Thomas.  We’re talkin’ about constant
                        exposure.

                                 MARGARET
                        After Ada I just ... I worry.  I
                        told Henry she was feverish, but he
                        said to wait.  It would pass.

           On Dr.  Cox, registering Margaret’s concern.

                                 DR. COX
                        They're pricey, but got some masks
                        for sale might help.  Goggles too.

                                 MARGARET
                        We were going to leave.
                                 DR. COX
                        People packed together in those camps? 
                        I’m tellin’ ya true when I say it’s
                        worse.  Had one family, lost five
                        boys in three days to diphtheria. 
                        You’ve got your garden here, your
                        house.  Some control.  
                            (then)
                        You’re taking the sleep aid?

           Margaret nods.

                                 DR. COX (CONT'D)
                        Good.  Good...  You want my advice? 
                        Keep the house sealed best you can,
                        wear those masks and relax.  

           HOLD on Margaret.  Then, CLINK CLINK.  She places the COINS
           from Henry near a jar of COTTON SWABS, looks up nervously.

           EXT. DOCTOR COX’S HOUSE / DUSTY CROSSROADS - DAY

           Margaret (in her old mask) and the girls (decked out in new
           expensive looking masks) exits.  Rose tugs at the mask --

                                 ROSE
                        It’s sunny.

                                 MARGARET
                        You wear them always now.  Every
                        time we’re outside.  Understand?

           Margaret re-tightens Rose’s mask, feels her forehead.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        How do you feel?

                                 ROSE
                            (muffled)
                        Mom, it’s too tight.

                                 MARGARET
                        It HAS to be tight.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The room is shuttered, dark.  An OIL LAMP illuminates the
           still-packed TRAVEL BAGS on the bed beside Margaret. 

           Sunlight slices through a CRACK IN THE WALL.  Glints off
           Margaret’s eye.  Dust motes flutter in the light beam.  
           Margaret blows out the LAMP.  With no interior light source,
           every crack in the walls GLOWS WITH SUNLIGHT.  An idea occurs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Fabric RIPS.  Margaret wets the cloth, hands it to Rose.

                                 MARGARET
                        Anywhere you see light ... fill it.

           Water drips onto Margaret’s focused face as she patches crack
           after crack in the walls.

           Then, Margaret’s POV: The SPECKS OF LIGHT remain infinite.

                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        Mom, don’t!  PLEASE!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The WARDROBE DOOR lurches back and forth as Rose struggles
           against Margaret to keep it closed.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s the only extra fabric we have.

                                 ROSE
                        Stop!

           Rose jerks back in pain, discovers a SPLINTER in her hand.

                                 MARGARET
                        Let me see.

           Rose runs out.  Margaret takes her WEDDING DRESS from the
           wardrobe ... then bites the lace fabric and RIPS.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Rose scratches at the SPLINTER in her hand.

           Behind her, Margaret single-handedly drags Ollie’s BED across
           the hallway, and into her own bedroom.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           The room is now crammed with Margaret’s AND the girls’ beds. 

           Rose lies awake; Margaret finishes patching walls with LACE.

                                 ROSE
                        Aren't we still going?
                                 MARGARET
                        Not until your father writes.  I
                        spent our travel money.  

                                 ROSE
                        Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        Because you were sick. 

                                 ROSE
                        It was just a nosebleed. 
                            (beat)
                        We’re not even supposed to sleep
                        with you.  

                                 MARGARET
                        I needed to patch the walls, and
                        there was only enough fabric to seal
                        one room.  

                                 ROSE
                        I want to go.  You’re supposed to
                        take your medicine, you’re supposed
                        to be sleeping!

                                 MARGARET
                            (sudden intensity)
                        Don’t you understand?!  We are stuck
                        here.  For now.  And the dust seeps. 
                        Through every opening.  That is why
                        Thomas is sick.  That is why he is
                        dying.  

           Rose is taken aback.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        When your daddy sends more money, we
                        will leave.  Alright?

                                 ROSE
                        Promise?

           INT.  MARGARET'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Margaret nervously smooths Rose’s pillow, STOPS... IT’S CLEAN.  

           She sinks onto the edge of the bed, RELIEVED as we CUT TO:

           OLLIE.  Carving a new NOTCH MARK -- Day 22.

                                 ROSE  (PRE-LAP)
                        Play explorer?  To the church?
           EXT. ONE ROOM CHURCH - DAY

           Ollie SPINS, her eyes covered by a BANDANA.  Rose stops her.

           Feeling the sun on her face, Ollie orients herself, and takes
           tentative steps through the GRAVEYARD ... towards the CHURCH.    

           INT. ONE ROOM CHURCH - DAY

           Margaret quietly stitches with the sewing circle, uneasy.

                                 BERTHA
                        Haven’t you even checked on her?

                                 MARGARET
                        Not since the funeral... we were
                        packing.  

           Birdie interrupts the tension --

                                 BIRDIE
                        Well that’s a vibrant hue!

           -- Peeks at Margaret’s QUILT SQUARE.  She has stitched a
           verdant field of GRASS surrounding the farmhouse.

                                 BERTHA
                        Packing for what?

                                 MARGARET
                        We were hoping to meet Henry, to
                        leave, but... Has anyone had a letter
                        from the work crews?  We haven't had
                        one yet.      

                                 BERTHA
                        Guess you didn’t hear.  
                            (then)
                        Dust built up so much a train in
                        Woodward skipped clear off the tracks. 
                        Kilt everyone aboard ‘cept one donkey
                        in the freight car. 

                                 BIRDIE
                        You're stuck with us, looks like.

           Margaret tries to hide her concern.  Then --

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?!

           EXT. ONE ROOM CHURCH - DAY

           Margaret, followed by the women, rushes outside to find:
           ESTHER'S DAUGHTER, MINNIE,
           Dressed only in filthy underwear and the grotesque HALLOWEEN
           MASK -- dragging a BUCKET half her size towards the church.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Oh my Lord.

                                 BERTHA
                        Birdie.  Go get the sheriff.

                                 MARGARET  (O.S.)
                        Just talk to her?

           I/E.  SHERIFF’S TRUCK / DUSTY LANE - DAY

           Sheriff Bell puts the truck in park.  Margaret, the girls,
           and Minnie (now donning Sheriff Bell's jacket) are squeezed
           into the cab beside him.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Maybe you could get a sense of whether
                        this is short term grief kinda
                        aberration or... more serious.  I’d
                        ask Birdie, but she gets so frazzled. 
                        You’re the only one kept it together
                        at Jacob’s burial.

           Margaret and Bell exit the truck.

           Inside the truck, Rose watches Bell wait on the dust-covered
           porch as Margaret DISAPPEARS into the dark, open front door.

           INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

           Margaret takes in the shuttered, DARK ROOM.  She approaches

           ESTHER,
           Who lies facing away, still as a corpse on a SHEET-LESS BED.

                                 MARGARET
                        Esther?  It’s Margaret.
                            (beat)
                        I know I was... harsh at the wake,
                        and I’m ... I was... it’s so dark.

           Margaret moves to the window.  Opens the shutter illuminating
           the FILTHY ROOM.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Remember when Ada passed?  For a
                        long while, I thought I might just
                        join her.  But you have to think of
                        the other children.  Their health.

           Esther rolls over to face Margaret.
                                 ESTHER
                        The man has been looking after them.

                                 MARGARET
                        The man?

                                 ESTHER
                        Or was that a dream?

           Margaret looks up.  Clocks Sheriff Bell by the door,
           listening, concerned.  She pours a small CUP of water.

                                 MARGARET
                        Have some water.  Just a sip.

           Esther sits up -- she wears a dusty BLACK DRESS.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Are you still ... dressed from Jacob’s
                        funeral?

           Esther tries to speak mid-sip, CHOKES.  As she doubles over,
           the back of her dress OPENS to reveal...

           The beginnings of BED SORES running down her spine.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Margaret getting SICK beside the house.

           Sheriff Bell hands her a HANDKERCHIEF.  Margaret pats her
           lips, spots MINNIE faced away, eating something.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Minnie?

           Minnie turns and smiles.  Brings a handful of DUST to her
           mouth.  Margaret grabs her hand.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        NO!

           Margaret locks eyes with Sheriff Bell.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        She’s not fit.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        You sure?

           Margaret considers -- nearby Thomas continues to COUGH.

           She nods.  Bell picks up Minnie, moves her to the TRUCK.
           Meanwhile, Esther ambles onto the FRONT PORCH, and wraps
           Margaret in a TIGHT EMBRACE.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, Margaret.  Thank you for visiting. 
                        Does me good.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s all right.  You just have to be
                        strong.  That’s all.

                                 ESTHER
                        Right ... strong.  You’re right.

                                 MARGARET
                            (suffocating)
                        Esther?  That’s enough!  Stop!

           Margaret jerks away -- Esther has left DUSTY HAND PRINTS on
           the back of Margaret's dress.

                                 ESTHER
                        Look what I’ve done now.

           Esther tries to clean the spots.  Makes them worse.  She
           follows Margaret’s EYELINE to Bell as he places Thomas in
           the TRUCK with Minnie and the girls.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        It’s just for a little while.

                                 ESTHER
                        What’s for a little while?

                                 MARGARET
                        Until you get back on your feet.

                                 ESTHER
                        You knew, Margaret?  But you’re my
                        kin.  My sister.

           Margaret moves to the truck.  Esther pursues.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        You’re no different than me.  You
                        know that?  No different at all! 
                        You always THOUGHT you were!  That
                        you married down, but you’ll be just
                        like me.

           Bell intercedes, places a hand on Esther’s shoulder --
                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Let’s just take a moment here.

           Rose adjusts the SIDE MIRROR, notes the way Sheriff Bell
           PATS Esther as if she might break.

           Bell and Margaret climb into the truck, briefly making audible
           the sounds of Esther SCREAMING --

                                 ESTHER
                        SHOW YOU WHAT IT’S LIKE, MARG--

           -- Before they SLAM the doors shut.

                                 ROSE
                            (re: the children)
                        Couldn’t they stay with us?

                                 MARGARET
                        I can’t feed them, Rose.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        They’ll be fine, sweetheart.  There’s
                        a real nice home next county over.

           CRACK!  Everyone JUMPS as Esther SLAMS her hand into the
           window, SCREAMING into the glass as the truck pulls away --

                                 ESTHER
                            (muted)
                        YOU’LL BE JUST LIKE ME!

           While Margaret watches Esther in the

           REARVIEW MIRROR,
           SCREAMING, face twisted with rage, dress slipping down ...
           Rose’s eyes dart between her mother and her cousins, who are
           now half crying, as they begin to understand what’s happening.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Margaret scrubs Esther's HANDPRINTS from her dress.  As Rose
           SULKS by, donning her new MASK --

                                 MARGARET
                        Tie the barn doors up for me, okay?  

           Margaret eyes the horizon, scanning for threats.

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           Margaret notices several PLANTS have been damaged.  Then,
           she sees the barn door is open.  CREAKING in the wind.
                                 MARGARET (PRE-LAP)
                        Didn’t I ask you to tie this?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Margaret shows Rose the TWINE that should have held the barn
           doors closed.

                                 ROSE
                        I did.

           Rose starts to move away; Margaret catches her arm.

                                 MARGARET
                        That cow, that garden are keeping us
                        alive.  Understand?  We nearly lost
                        both in one night.

                                 ROSE
                        I did tie it!

                                 MARGARET
                        Then it has to be tighter!

           Ollie tugs on Margaret’s dress, points to the hayloft WINDOW.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        STOP!  No more Grey Man, understand?
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Rose didn't say that.

           Margaret turns to Rose, intense:

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Did you?

                                 ROSE
                        It’s true.  Sheriff Bell could take
                        us away.

                                 MARGARET
                        Sweetheart, Aunt Esther isn’t well--

                                 ROSE
                        Because of Jacob.  I know what “rats
                        in the attic” means.  Aunt Esther
                        went cuckoo, because her child died. 
                        Like yours.

                                 MARGARET
                        I am not Esther.

                                 ROSE
                        But when Ada--
           Margaret SLAPS Rose.  Rose grabs her cheek.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry... But you have to know
                        that I would never let anyone separate
                        us.  Understand?  Never.

                                 ROSE
                        When's he going to write?

                                 MARGARET
                        Soon...  
                            (then)
                        I don't know.  

           Rose pulls her arm away.  Starts off with Ollie at her heels.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Rose!  Stay close!  

           INT. BARN, STALL - DAY

           Margaret leads Georgia to her stall.  Goes to milk her, but
           only manages to EKE OUT a cup or so.  

                                 MARGARET
                        What is it?  You hungry?  

           INT. HAY LOFT - DAY

           Margaret takes a small portion of HAY and divides it in half. 
           Drops it down to Georgia’s stall.

           Before leaving, she notices that the window is SLIGHTLY AJAR.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BANG, BANG, BANG!  Margaret nails the window shut.  When she
           stops hammering, she hears a THUNK on the roof.    

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Margaret exits, stops mid-stride.  Then, her POV: A vibrant,
           incongruous BIRD.  Dead in the dust.  

           Margaret looks skyward, searching for signs of a storm. 
           Looks clear, but Georgia MOOS uneasily in the barn --

                                 MARGARET
                        GIRLS!

           On a nearby SAND DUNE, Margaret sees the girls start towards
           her, and moves off to prepare for the storm.
           EXT. DUSTY FIELD - DAY

           As the girls walk, Rose SIGNS to Ollie --

                                 ROSE
                        You saw The Grey Man?  What’d he
                        look like then?
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Red eyes and bones?  Liar.

           Then, Rose stops, clocks something UNSEEN.  She eyes the sky --

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Nothing's even happening.    

           Rose pulls AWAY from the house despite Ollie desperately
           trying to stop her as we CUT TO: 

           A FULL STORM.

           Margaret rushes from window to window, slamming shutters.  

           She scans the horizon, realizes ... she can’t see the girls --
           the dust is blowing too hard.

                                 MARGARET
                        Please, please, please--

           EXT. DUSTY LANE - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret covers her mouth and nose with her dress.

                                 MARGARET
                            (muffled)
                        Rose?!!

           Unbeknownst to Margaret, a FIGURE MATERIALIZES in the opaque
           air behind her.  As it approaches, we see that it’s Esther,
           walking directly towards Margaret.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        ROSE?!!

           Without breaking her stride, Esther

           RAMS HER SHOULDER
           Into Margaret as she passes.  Margaret turns, startled --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Esther?

           Esther, dead-eyed, continues walking.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Did you see the girls?  Esther?!
           Esther finally stops ... turns back.  The women seem to be
           on opposite sides of an IMMENSE MIRROR.

                                 ESTHER
                        They should be home, Margaret.  The
                        air ... it’s poison.

           On Margaret, terrified, as Esther turns and walks away into
           the ENVELOPING HAZE.  Just then--

           THE GIRLS EMERGE
           From a sand dune behind Margaret.  Margaret is about to walk
           into the storm to search for the girls when Rose calls out:

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DUSK

           Margaret cleans dust from the girls’ ears, scalp, neck.

                                 MARGARET
                        You have to play in my sight from
                        now on.  We can never be separated.

                                 ROSE
                        We were coming right back.

                                 MARGARET
                        I thought you were lost.  Where did
                        you go?

           Ollie points to a pile of clothes that begins to UNDULATE
           and SQUIRM.  Margaret grabs the girls, thinking a SNAKE lies
           in wait until ... out pops a DUSTY KITTEN.

           Margaret tries to lighten up, but she’s shaken.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Name?
                            (beat, watching Ollie)
                        Henry?  Like dad?

           Margaret turns the kitten around, lifts its tail.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Henry’s a Henrietta.
                            (showing Rose)
                        Like an exclamation point, see?

           Rose nods, COUGHS.  Margaret eyes the empty water BUCKET.

           Beat.  Margaret stands, grabs a BANDANA and TWINE.
                                 ROSE
                        Where are you going?

                                 MARGARET
                        I didn’t get the water.  Went looking
                        for you.

           Just then, a shock wave of dust SLAMS into the house.  

                                 ROSE
                        Please don’t go.

                                 MARGARET
                        You need it, Rose.  We all do. 
                        There’s some right in the kitchen.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Unable to see more than a few feet in front of her, Margaret
           un-spools twine as she walks around

           THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

           Georgia begins to MOO and FUSS, obviously distressed. 
           Margaret edges away from the house, tries to focus on the
           BARN.  The dust thins enough for her to see

           A SHADOW PASS
           In the hayloft window.  Margaret COVERS HER MOUTH.  And then
           a realization ... her hands are EMPTY.  The TWINE is gone.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Rose presses her ear to the shared wall with the kitchen. 
           She KNOCKS, waits ... no answer.

           INTERCUT MARGARET / THE GIRLS

           MARGARET takes small steps, arms extended, desperately trying
           to orient herself.

           Inside, ROSE climbs onto the seat of a CHAIR.  Slides up the
           glass on the TOP WINDOW, unlatches the shutter.

           She almost loses her grip on the shutter, catches it JUST in
           time.  Rose squints against the blowing dust, calls out --

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  MOM!

           MARGARET thinks she hears Rose calling out, pulls down her
           MASK to answer, but wind RIPS it from her grasp.
           Inside, the chair SLIPS and ROSE loses her grip on the
           shutter, which flings out, then in, SHATTERING GLASS onto
           the girls.

           The break in the window pane creates a SUCTION EFFECT; dust
           pours into the room.

           MARGARET follows the sound of the whipping shutter -- WHAM,
           WHAM, WHAM -- towards the house.

           As she walks, she trips over something, FALLS.  Margaret
           blindly searches the ground ... finds the ball of TWINE.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret drops the WATER and FOOD, can’t see through the
           WHIRLING DUST --

                                 MARGARET
                        GIRLS!?

           She uprights the chair, and closes the shutters.  MUFFLED
           COUGHING leads her to THE BED.  Where the girls have crawled
           under the sheet, which is now covered in a layer of DUST.

           The outline of their entwined bodies resembles the POMPEII
           LOVERS EMBRACE.

           Margaret whips off the sheet; the girls are huddled beneath,
           shaken, COUGHING.  Rose leaps into Margaret’s arms.

                                 ROSE
                        Sorry.

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay, it’s okay.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A PILL in Margaret's palm.  Before taking it, she surveys
           the room -- everything is covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST.

           In the VANITY MIRROR, Margaret spots Rose watching at her.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Put your nightgown on, sweetheart.

           Rose pulls her NIGHTGOWN over her head.  She turns back to
           the mirror just as Margaret flicks her head back, swallows.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAWN

           Clutching the RIFLE, Margaret shoulders the door through a
           MOUND OF DUST and steps into the amber dawn light.
           I/E.  BARN - QUICK CUTS

           Margaret checks the barn doors -- they’re still TIED TIGHT. 
           She eyes the barn window -- it’s closed and NAILED SHUT.

           Margaret milks Georgia.  She’s drying up, only a cup or so
           in the BUCKET...

           As she stands, Margaret spots a CUT MARK slicing through the
           cartilage of Georgia’s ear... Odd.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Rose wakes with a GASP.  Then, her sideways POV: The room is
           SPOTLESS.  Ollie’s washed DOLL sits on the POLISHED floor.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Rose and Ollie step outside -- THE CHORES ARE DONE.  Clearly
           exhausted, Margaret approaches with the milk.

                                 ROSE
                        How’d you do all this?

                                 MARGARET
                        Just woke up early.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Lost in thought, Margaret divides the scant portion of milk
           between TWO TEACUPS.

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose?  Did you see anyone here
                        yesterday?  During the storm?

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t think so.  Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        I think something’s been getting
                        into the barn.  Maybe a coyote or...

           Instead of placing the saucers ON TOP of the teacups as
           always, Margaret leaves them UNCOVERED.

           Rose follows Margaret’s gaze to the CHALK OUTLINE of the
           door, which should lead to the main house.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  Here.

           Rose covers the teacup with the saucer.
                                 MARGARET
                        Shoot!

           Margaret grabs the cup, tosses the milk out.

           INT. BARN, STALL - DAY

           Margaret desperately tries to milk Georgia again --

                                 MARGARET
                        Come on, girl.  Come on.

           -- But there’s only a DRIBBLE, and she’s SORE from the effort
           as we CUT TO:

           MARGARET dropping the empty bucket, staring down at the AXE
           in the CHOPPING BLOCK --

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Rose and Ollie look up as a frazzled Margaret enters clutching
           the AXE.

                                 ROSE
                        What are you doing?

                                 MARGARET
                        Move back.

           As the girls shuffle backwards, Margaret SLAMS the axe into
           the wall where the door should be.  She chops again.  BANG!

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        This way, we can get to the kitchen
                        when we need to.  We won’t have to
                        go out during the storms.

                                 ROSE
                        But Dad was gonna--

                                 MARGARET
                        Dad’s not here, Rose.

           The girls watch Margaret grimace and CHOP, finally breaking
           through to the HALLWAY.  The last bits of plaster give way
           to reveal Margaret and the girls.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Just makes it easier on us.

           Sweaty and panting, Margaret crosses through to

           THE HALLWAY,

           Reaches back for Ollie and Rose ... 
                                 MARGARET
                        Come on.

           The girls don’t move.  Mother and daughters stand on opposite
           sides of the hole as we CUT TO:

           The flick of a KNIFE.  Slicing open an ENVELOPE.   

           INT. MARGARET'S BEDROOM

           Ollie JUMPS to grab the LETTER, but Margaret hands it to
           Rose instead.

                                 MARGARET
                        Next one, Little.

           Rose empties the envelope.  Blades of DRIED GRASS, a MUSSEL
           SHELL and a COIN spill out along with the LETTER.

                                 ROSE
                            (reading)
                        Dear Girls.  My first hope is that
                        you can de...

           Rose shows the letter to Margaret:

                                 MARGARET
                        Decipher.

                                 ROSE
                            (reading)
                        ...Decipher my chicken scratch.  My
                        second hope is that these blades of
                        grass will still be green by the
                        time they reach you.  Just know that
                        when I picked them, they were the
                        brightest thing you ever saw.

           Ollie pulls blades of DRIED GRASS and a MUSSEL SHELL from
           the envelope.  She ties the grass, which is VERY BROWN by
           now, around her wrist like a BRACELET; Rose helps.  

           Margaret takes over the reading:

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re building a bridge over the
                        river where I found this shell. 
                        Being away, I know even more what
                        I’ve left.  Enough of these smelly
                        men.  Counting the days my Loves.

                                 ROSE
                        Will it be enough?  When the trains
                        start again?
                                 MARGARET
                        ... Not quite.  

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           Just as Margaret finishes sweeping the porch, a gust of WIND
           immediately re-coats it in dust.  

           Wind keeps blowing, and Margaret keeps sweeping until she
           screams through CLENCHED TEETH --

                                 MARGARET
                        Stop it, stop it.

           A tear runs down her cheek.  She slaps the tear away, HARD,
           as we CUT TO:

           THE FRONT ROOM - SAME

           Through distorted glass, Rose watches her mother, worried.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

           The storm ROARS outside.  Margaret pins green fabric, and
           pieces of leftover lace to a SEWING FORM, consoles Rose --  

                                 MARGARET
                        Pretty isn't it?

           Rose nods.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        We'll be fine.  We'll get dressed
                        up, and dance.  Remember how to waltz?

           Ollie jumps onto the bed, and Rose spins her. 

           Margaret fixates on the DUST MOTES rising from the bed.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Stop, stop that!

           Rose freezes, but Ollie is late to catch on.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Where’s it getting in?
                            (beat, to the girls)
                        Put these on!

           Margaret grabs the girls’ DUST MASKS --

                                 ROSE
                        Inside?

           -- Then notices BROWN CIRCLES where they breathed dusty air. 
                                 MARGARET
                        Wait.  Don’t breathe!

           Margaret drops the masks, and RIPS sheets off the bed.  She
           drapes the fabric over the girls’ heads.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?

           Then, feeling it isn’t enough, Margaret pours WATER over the
           fabric.  Rose JUMPS --

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        It’s cold!

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay still.  This will help.

           Rose and Ollie SHUDDER as the fabric becomes transparent,
           clings to their faces.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           TICK, TICK, TICK.  Water drips onto the floor.  

           Rose, Ollie and Margaret each sit with a wet SHEET draped
           over her head ... THREE LITTLE GHOSTS.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        That’s better, isn’t it?

                                 ROSE
                        I can’t breathe.

                                 MARGARET
                        It filters out the dust, sweetie. 
                        The air ... it’s poison.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose, let’s just be--

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!  Help!

           Margaret rips off her own sheet.  Then, her POV: splotches
           of RED STREAK and EXPAND across the wet sheet covering Rose's
           face... Another NOSEBLEED.  

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Get me out!  Please!
           Rose flails, desperately trying to escape the WET SHEET, but
           the more she fights, the more the fabric CLINGS to her.

           Margaret tries to help, but Rose is SUFFOCATING, a vortex of
           fabric swirling into her open, gasping mouth...

           A long beat.  RIP!  Margaret slices open the fabric with the
           KNIFE.  Rose is panting, her nose BLOODY, her hair wet.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret in bed, wide awake.  Then, her POV: Roses’ BACK ...
           breathing in ... breathing out.

           Rose quietly wakes.  Seems to feel Margaret watching her and
           rolls over ... but Margaret quickly closes her eyes.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Rose finds Margaret seated at the kitchen table.  She seems
           to have been awake for some time.

                                 ROSE
                        I can’t hear the storm anymore.

                                 MARGARET
                        It stopped.

           Rose goes to open the door.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Rose.  We’re not going out yet. 
                        We’re going to wait a while.

                                 ROSE
                        Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        Even when you can’t see it, can’t
                        hear it, it’s in the air.

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll wear my mask.

                                 MARGARET
                        No.  We’ll wait.

                                 ROSE
                        For how long?

                                 MARGARET
                        Just ... longer.
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM, WARDROBE - MORNING

           Rose counts as Ollie carves a NOTCH in the wardrobe door.

                                 ROSE
                        Forty-six, forty-seven.

           After checking that the coast is clear, Rose pours Margaret’s
           remaining SLEEPING PILLS onto the vanity table and counts.

           The numbers seem to match.  Rose lets out a SIGH of relief. 
           It seems like Margaret HAS been taking her medicine.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Rose is draped over the side of Margaret’s bed, head hanging
           down, bored and crawling out of her skin.

           HER UPSIDE-DOWN POV: Ollie carving a NOTCH in the door -- 49
           days; Margaret moves past the door, sweeping and sweeping.

                                 ROSE
                        That’s long enough.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MORNING

           Margaret and Ollie follow Rose to the front door.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where are you going?  Hey.

                                 ROSE
                        We have to go out eventually.  Or
                        the garden will die.  The cow. 

           On Margaret, debating...

                                 MARGARET
                        Masks on.

           Rose and Ollie put on their dust masks.

           Margaret unlocks the door.  The wood GROANS when she touches
           the handle, but it won’t open.  She BUMPS into the door a
           few times ... it’s hitting something, stuck.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Must be a sand drift.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE: 

           Margaret and Rose opening various windows, STRUGGLING to
           push open the shutters ... none of them budge.
           Rose tries the kitchen door.  It’s STUCK too.

           INT. MARGARET'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Climbing onto a chair, Margaret pushes open the shutters on
           the top high window.  The girls SQUINT against the sunlight.

           Dust WATERFALLS over the window ledge.  Margaret struggles
           to SQUEEZE through the tiny window, but her shoulders -- no
           matter what angle -- won’t fit. 

           She peeks OUTSIDE -- dust dunes ENGULF the house.  

                                 ROSE
                        We stayed in too long.

                                 MARGARET
                        Just try, will you?

           Rose steps onto the chair, tries to squeeze through the
           window.  It’s closer, but she won’t fit either.

                                 ROSE
                        What about Ollie?  She’d fit.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s over her head by the house. 
                        She could fall right through.  No,
                        somebody will check on us.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom, it’s been days already.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Ollie spinning as TWINE loops around her waist. 

           Margaret DOUBLE-KNOTS the twine encircling Ollie, checks
           that her DUST MASK and GOGGLES are tight. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Love you.

           Ollie SIGNS back, slides easily through the window.

           The twine runs through Margaret’s fingers.  It reaches the
           end of the spool, pulls TAUT.  

           Margaret peeks OUTSIDE -- Ollie is nowhere in sight.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Oh, my God.
           Margaret grips the twine, pulls hard ...  SNAP!  It breaks
           loose, and she falls back ... HARD.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SLAM!  SLAM!  Margaret repeatedly RAMS into the front door.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Come on, come on!

           Rose sees that Margaret's head is WOUNDED, drips BLOOD.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom, your head.

           Margaret keeps SLAMMING into the door.  Over and over.  Rose
           takes off running towards --

           MARGARET’S BEDROOM

           She FLINGS open the vanity drawer.  She spots a clean CLOTH,
           whips it out and PILLS SCATTER EVERYWHERE.

           Rose grabs an ERRANT PILL, realizes -- Margaret’s been hiding
           her sleeping medicine.

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        Rose!  Please, she could be drowning!

           INT. FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose rushes in.  Shoulders the door with Margaret.  It finally
           BUDGES.  Sand spills over their feet as they scramble onto 

           THE FRONT PORCH

           Where Ollie happily digs, moving dust away from the door.

           Margaret scoops Ollie up, pulls her into a desperate embrace,
           smearing her little face with blood. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Sorry, Little.

           Rose hands Margaret the HANDKERCHIEF, but she's more concerned
           with cleaning Ollie’s face, than tending to her own wound.

                                 ROSE
                        You’re bleeding bad, mom.

                                 MARGARET
                        Heads do that, sweetie.

           On Rose, worried, as Margaret moves away.
           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Margaret unties the TWINE.  Glances at the CLOSED WINDOW.

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           The girls unearth PLANTS from the dust.  Nearly all of them
           are CRUSHED, DEAD.

                                 ROSE
                        We killed them.  Let them stay buried.

           Ollie runs to a MOUND OF DUST, and unearths the homemade
           GREENHOUSE.  Inside, a few SPROUTS survive.

           INT. BARN, STALL - DAY

           Margaret sits beside an EMPTY MILK BUCKET.

           She stands.  Woozy.  Leans her own WOUNDED HEAD against
           Georgia.  A NEW CUT slices along Georgia’s flank.

                                 MARGARET
                        What’s getting you, girl?  Hmm?

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret exits the barn, freezes...

           A LINE OF FOOTPRINTS leads directly to the KITCHEN ENTRANCE.     
           Margaret runs to the GARDEN.

                                 MARGARET
                        Girls!  Did you see someone?

                                 ROSE
                        Where?

                                 MARGARET
                        There are footprints leading right--

           Margaret leads Rose to the KITCHEN.  The dust is smooth, NOT
           A FOOTPRINT IN SIGHT.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        The wind must have covered them.

           Margaret follows Rose’s EYELINE to the WEATHERVANE.  It’s
           completely still.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        They were JUST here.  They led right
                        to the door, but not away.  He might
                        be inside.
           Rose checks the door.

                                 ROSE
                        The door’s locked, mom.

           Margaret touches her head -- BLOOD runs down her arm.  She
           squints, scans the HEAT WAVES: Is someone out there?  

                                 MARGARET
                        Cuts on the cow.  Food disappears. 
                        The garden.  Someone has been here.  
                            (then)
                        Rose?  Why are you looking at me
                        like that?

                                 ROSE
                        You need a doctor.

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you mean?

                                 ROSE
                        ...Your cut.  It’s deep.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m saving that money.  In case we
                        can leave.

           Rose turns away.  Mulls over the hidden sleeping pills. 
           Thinking fast, she PINCHES Ollie’s neck HARD.

           Ollie grabs at her neck, pitches a fit.

                                 ROSE
                            (for Margaret)
                        What’s wrong?  Throat hurt?

           INT. DOCTOR COX’S - DAY

           Ollie gives Rose the EVIL EYE, takes a deep breath.  Dr. 
           Cox moves his STETHOSCOPE to a new location on her back.

                                 DR. COX
                        Don’t sound good.

           Margaret swallows.

                                 DR. COX (CONT'D)
                        Sounds great.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ollie was touching her neck like it
                        hurt.  And Rose had another nosebleed.
                                 DR. COX
                        Be my guest.

           He hands Margaret the stethoscope.  Rose watches Margaret
           slide the EARTIPS in --

                                 DR. COX (CONT'D)
                        See how easy the air moves?

           Margaret closes her eyes and LISTENS.  The only sound is her
           DAUGHTER’S BREATH.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.

                                 DR. COX (CONT'D)
                        Fall asleep there?

           Margaret pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                                 ROSE
                            (quietly)
                        She never sleeps.

                                 MARGARET
                        Rose.

                                 ROSE
                        And she cut her head earlier.  Bad.

                                 MARGARET
                        She’s exaggerating.

                                 DR. COX
                        Saddle up, partner.

           Dr.  Cox slaps the table.  He pushes Margaret’s hair back to
           reveal her HEAD WOUND.

                                 DR. COX (CONT'D)
                        Lord, you do need a little mendin’. 
                        Girls, would you mind?

           EXT. DOCTOR COX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ollie SIGNS to Rose, upset.

                                 ROSE
                        I HAD to fib.  Mom's not taking her
                        medicine, Little.  Besides, you fib
                        about Grey Man.

           Ollie freezes ... points over Rose’s shoulder.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Very funny.

           Just then, a DARK SHADOW looms over Rose, and she turns --
           INT. DOCTOR COX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Margaret grimaces as Dr.  Cox stitches her head.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s only some times I don’t take
                        the medicine.

                                 DR. COX
                        What times?

                                 MARGARET
                        When I don’t finish my chores, it
                        can put ... pictures in my head.

                                 DR. COX
                        What kinda pictures?
                            (off her silence)
                        Margaret?

                                 MARGARET
                        Their lungs, struggling for air. 
                        Their hearts slowing down.  Someone
                        trying to hurt them.

                                 DR. COX
                        Don’t get your rest, even one night,
                        it’s easy to feel off.  Let alone
                        multiple days.  Remember?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes, but--

           Suddenly intense, Dr.  Cox stubs out his CIGARETTE.

                                 DR. COX
                        Let me ask you something.  When was
                        your last moon?

                                 MARGARET
                        My moon?

                                 DR. COX
                        Just a question of sensitivity is
                        all.

           EXT. DOCTOR COX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Margaret exits.  The girls are GONE.  From 

           THE CHURCH 

           Across the road, she hears COUGHING.  Margaret starts towards
           a SCRUM OF WOMEN and runs smack into Rose.
                                 MARGARET
                        Where’s your sister?

           Margaret follows Rose’s EYELINE to Ollie, who sits with a
           WOMAN crouched over her.  The crouched woman is...

           ESTHER.  And she’s straining to pull SOMETHING from Ollie’s
           mouth.  Margaret steps closer.  It looks like INTESTINES,
           SLICK WITH BLOOD, UNCOILING FROM OLLIE’S OPEN MOUTH.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Stop.  Stop it!

           Margaret SHOVES Esther.  Tries to CRAM the innards back into
           Ollie’s mouth, which GAGS her...

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!

           Rose intervenes, pulls a HANDKERCHIEF out of Ollie’s mouth.

                                 MARGARET
                        Wait, she was...

           Margaret inspects the handkerchief: It looked like intestines
           moments ago.  Esther touches her shoulder --

                                 ESTHER
                        It’s just magic, Margaret.

           Esther smiles -- HER TEETH ARE PINK WITH BLOOD.

           FLASH TO: The cow’s cut marks.  Margaret GASPS, backs the
           girls away.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s you.  You’re the one sneaking
                        in... You stay away from them, Esther.

                                 BIRDIE
                        Margaret?

                                 MARGARET
                        Something’s wrong with her, she--

                                 BERTHA
                        She's mourning, that's all.  You
                        ought to know what that's like.
                            (then)
                        Imagine if they took the others too. 
                        At your own sister's request.

                                 MARGARET
                        You didn’t see the filth.
                                 BIRDIE
                            (easing the tension)
                        Well I can't judge.  I clean with a
                        shovel most days.

                                 MARGARET
                        Just look at her teeth!

           Esther covers her mouth shyly.

                                 BERTHA
                        Don’t mind her, Esther.  No one’s
                        good enough.

                                 MARGARET 
                            (to Esther)
                        I don’t know what you’re up to, but
                        I won’t let it happen again.

           On Rose, concerned, watching the women WHISPER.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Margaret and the girls watch as Sheriff Bell climbs the ladder
           into the hayloft.

                                 SHERIFF BELL  (O.S.)
                        Ye-llo?  Anybody there?

           A sudden TUSSLE.  Hay dust sprinkles down from the CEILING. 
           Margaret backs the girls up, nervous.

                                 SHERIFF BELL  (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Found this intruder lurking.

           Sheriff Bell emerges with Ollie’s KITTEN.  Suddenly, Henrietta
           claws Bell, scrambles back to the hayloft.

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           As Margaret and Bell move past, Ollie fixates on the WINDOW
           in the barn’s hayloft.  

           She tugs on Rose, who shrugs her off--

                                 ROSE
                        Quit, Little.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Bell dips his arms in water, rinses the cat SCRATCHES.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Feisty little thing ...
                                 MARGARET
                        I told you she wouldn’t be there. 
                        She does it at night.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Just don’t see how anyone could get
                        past tied doors and nailed window.

                                 MARGARET
                        Me either, but--

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        And why would Esther cut the cow?

                                 MARGARET
                        Because she holds it against me. 
                        What we did.  Taking the children.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        So she bit its ear?

                                 MARGARET
                        Maybe she’s finding ways to starve
                        us?  Hurt the girls?  Ask anyone in
                        town.  They saw her.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        What was she doing with Ollie again?

                                 MARGARET
                        A magic trick, but she had blood on
                        her teeth.  And there were footprints. 
                        They led right to our kitchen, but
                        they didn’t lead away.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        And what’s that from?

           Sheriff Bell stares at the CHOPPED HOLE in the wall.

                                 MARGARET
                        I already told you that’s so we don’t
                        have to go out in the storms.
                            (getting his point)
                        Don’t make me seem... Wait, that’s
                        it.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        What?

                                 MARGARET
                        Esther wants me to look crazy like
                        her.  I helped take her children and
                        now she’s coming after mine.  You
                        have to stop her.
                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Let’s just take a moment here.

           Sheriff Bell puts his hand on Margaret’s shoulder.  Rose
           notices -- he did this EXACT GESTURE to Esther.

                                 ROSE
                        I saw them too.  The footprints. 
                        Went right to our kitchen.

           Margaret turns to Rose, surprised.  Bell nods, glances back
           at Margaret ... still concerned.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           RIFLE in hand, Margaret scans the horizon.  Rose approaches.

                                 ROSE
                        Aren't you coming to bed?

                                 MARGARET
                        Not until I figure out how she’s
                        getting in.

           Then, clocking Rose's concern:

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        You didn’t see them, did you?  The
                        footprints?

                                 ROSE
                        No.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why’d you tell Sheriff Bell you did?

                                 ROSE
                        Because.  He talked to you the way
                        he talked to Aunt Esther that time.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Darkness.  The sound of Georgia MOOING.  A lantern GLOWS TO
           LIFE.  Illuminates Margaret’s vigilant face.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Margaret enters, scanning the darkness.  The sound of
           APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS behind her.

           She turns to the open door, spots the dark outline of

           ESTHER, CLUTCHING AN AXE...
                                 MARGARET
                        Esther?!  What are you doing?

           Margaret aims the rifle.  She takes a deep breath, eases her
           finger towards the trigger.

           Just then, Ollie emerges from the darkness and stands DIRECTLY
           NEXT TO ESTHER.

                                 ESTHER
                        You’ll see.  You’ll be JUST like me.

           Esther starts to SWING THE AXE at Ollie.  Ollie speaks --

                                 OLLIE
                        Mom?  Help me.

           On Margaret: Ollie can’t speak.  She tries to run to Ollie,
           but her feet SINK DEEP INTO THE DUST.

           She opens her mouth to YELL, but MUD POURS FROM HER MOUTH as
           we CUT TO:

           MARGARET.  Gasping awake.  Immediately eyeing the BARN.  

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Nothing is out of place.  When Margaret turns back, A GLINT
           OF LIGHT outside catches her attention.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The AXE has been moved from its usual spot on the chopping
           block, and is now half buried near ADA’S GRAVESTONE.  On
           Margaret: Why on earth is it there?

           INT. HAYLOFT - MORNING

           Ollie climbs into the loft, walks towards the eaves.  She
           stares into the BLACK SHADOWS, smiles, steps forward.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Margaret moves the axe aside, wipes down ADA’S GRAVESTONE.

           Just then, the sound of muffled COUGHING.  Margaret leans
           closer to the grave.

           It sounds like the COUGHS are coming from underground ...
           like Ada is choking in her grave.

           Rose trots up to find Margaret oddly posed, kneeling, her
           ear pressed to the ground.
                                 ROSE
                        Mom?

                                 MARGARET
                        Were you coughing?

           Rose shakes her head.  Margaret stands, dusts off her dress. 
           Then, another COUGH.  She checks with Rose --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Did you hear that?

           Rose nods.  Another COUGH.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Ollie.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Margaret and Rose find Ollie on all fours just outside the
           BARN.  Her face REDDENS, and she THRASHES as she coughs.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What’s wrong?!  Are you sick?!

           Tears pour down Ollie’s face as she SIGNS --

                                 ROSE
                        She can’t breathe!

           Margaret HITS Ollie’s back until she COUGHS UP a piece of
           CANDY.  Rose and Margaret stare at the candy, confused.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where’d you get that?!

           Beat.  Ollie slowly points ... to the HAYLOFT.

           INT. BARN, HAY LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

           TRACKING BEHIND Margaret as she climbs into the hayloft,
           RIFLE leading the way...

                                 MARGARET
                        Esther?  Are you there?

           The sound of CRACKLING HAY.  Margaret whips around and --

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!

           -- Lowers the gun at the last possible second.

                                 MARGARET
                        I told you to stay downstairs.
                                 ROSE
                        We’re scared.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where, Little?  Where?

           Ollie points down at her feet.  Margaret looks down, confused. 
           There’s nothing there -- just scraps of hay.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        I’ll burn the whole thing down,
                        Esther.  I swear to God.

           WHAM WHAM WHAM.  There’s a KNOCKING on the floor beneath
           Margaret’s feet.  She backs the girls up as two floorboards
           begin to tremble ... then ... POP UP.

           A dusty hand emerges, then another as WALLACE GRADY (30s,
           malnourished), squeezes out from his hiding place between
           two floorboards.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Who are you?!

           Wallace stands.  His eyes are BRIGHT RED from the dust, his
           lips are covered with VERTICAL CUTS from dehydration.

                                 WALLACE
                        Name’s Brother Wallace Grady.  I
                        don’t mean you any harm.  Truly. 
                        Just needed shelter, and ... Henry
                        said y’all had this barn.

                                 MARGARET
                        ... Henry?

                                 WALLACE
                        Don’t ya recognize his jacket?

           Margaret glances at Wallace’s jacket -- it’s Henry’s.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you hurt him?!

                                 WALLACE
                        Course not.  Got my word on that. 
                        I’m a man of the cloth.  I stopped
                        through the Works detail.  Brother
                        Henry give me this, asked me to check
                        in on y’all.  He’s a good man.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why not just knock on the door?
                                 WALLACE
                        I was gonna.  After I had a chance
                        to recover.  Got caught in that storm
                        on account of my limp.  Thought I
                        looked too poorly.  Might scare your
                        girls, scare you.

           Margaret trembles, her finger still on the TRIGGER.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you cut our cow?

                                 WALLACE
                        You trapped me in here.  Had to drink
                        something when y’all locked me up
                        during the storms, so I just give
                        her a little nick or two.  She’s out
                        of milk, and that’s the only thing
                        that’ll really kill you... Thirst.

           He looks to Rose, who peeks out from behind Margaret.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Rose, right?  And you’re Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        Henry would’ve told me.

                                 WALLACE
                        Mail's slow-going with the weather.  

                                 MARGARET
                        You hid in the floor?

                                 WALLACE
                        First I just kinda followed the
                        shadows around.  Then I made this
                        little hide out.

                                 MARGARET
                        You have to go.  Now.

                                 WALLACE
                        Sorry I gave you a fright, but I
                        could earn my keep.  People need the
                        word of God right now.

                                 MARGARET
                        People need rain.

                                 WALLACE
                        One follows the other.

                                 MARGARET
                        Just get out!
           Wallace gathers his BAG, the BIBLE that sits nearby, and
           limps towards the stairs before pausing --

                                 WALLACE
                        It’s just ... your cow’s starving,
                        which means you’re about to be, right?

           Margaret is shaking now: It’s true.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Specially if that train’s out for a
                        while.  Garden’s gone.  Milk’s dried
                        up.  I could get her producing again--

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you take food?  The pantry?  The
                        garden?

                                 WALLACE
                            (spotting something)
                        Oh, darlin’.

           Margaret follows Wallace’s EYELINE to Rose, who now cups her
           hands beneath a full-fledged NOSE BLEED.

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay, you’re okay.

           Margaret’s torn: Help Rose or keep the gun on Wallace?

                                 WALLACE
                        Ma’am?

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay back!

                                 WALLACE
                        I can help her, but I’d need to touch
                        her.

                                 MARGARET
                            (trembling, desperate)
                        Why?

                                 WALLLACE
                        I lay hands.  Truly.  If you don’t
                        believe ... what could it hurt?

           A beat.  Margaret glances back at Rose, considering...

           She nods and Wallace limps to Rose.  He grips one hand on
           the nape of her neck, hovers the other over her face as blood
           BUBBLES from her nose.

           Wallace SPEAKS IN TONGUES, conjuring some unseen power.
           Rose glances at Margaret, baffled.  Suddenly, Wallace lurches
           Rose back and presses HARD onto her upper lip.

                                 MARGARET
                        You let her go!

           Wallace releases his grip, dropping Rose as they both collapse
           onto the floor.

           Margaret runs to Rose, helps her sit up.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What’d you do to her?!

                                 ROSE
                        Mom, look.

           Rose drops her hands -- the bleeding has CEASED.

           Wallace stands to go, then immediately falls ... swooning,
           drained of energy.

                                 WALLACE
                        I’ll go soon.  Just have to rest.

                                 MARGARET
                        ... You said you could get the cow
                        producing.  How?

                                 WALLACE
                        Just gotta feed her, ma’am.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re running out of hay!

                                 WALLACE
                        I know it.  Everyone is.  But listen,
                        lock me in here, search my bag.  I
                        just wanna help.  Let me stay and
                        I’ll show you how to feed her.  Keep
                        your girls healthy and strong.  I’m
                        not asking for any favors that I
                        can’t match.

           EXT. DUSTY FIELD - DUSK

           SILHOUETTED against the pink sky, Margaret, Rose and Ollie
           chase blowing TUMBLEWEEDS across the dust.

           Nearby, Wallace watches, drawing water from the WELL.

           INT. BARN - DUSK

           Water splashes into a LARGE TUB containing tumbleweeds.
           Margaret eyes Wallace suspiciously as she steps into the
           tub, mashing down the giant brambles with her feet.

                                 WALLACE
                        Tumbleweeds’ll soak that water right
                        up, yield a lot of feed.

           Margaret WOBBLES and Wallace tries to help, but she recoils.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’ve got it.
                            (beat)
                        People will talk if I let you stay.

                                 WALLACE
                        I could keep outta sight for a bit. 
                        Stick to the barn.

                                 MARGARET
                        I sleep with a gun, which I know how
                        to use.  Do you understand?

                                 WALLACE
                        I’ll bear it in mind.

           Ollie looks up to Wallace; he WINKS.

           I/E.  BARN - NIGHT

           Margaret ties the barn doors.  She glances up at the window --
           the DARK OUTLINE of Wallace, head bowed in prayer, looms.

           Inside, chin still lowered, Wallace opens his eyes, watches
           Margaret usher the girls to the house.

                                 ROSE  (PRE-LAP)
                        I thought you were imagining things.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret wedges a chair under the doorknob, joins Rose on
           the bed.

                                 MARGARET
                        No.  I knew someone was here, just
                        not who.

                                 ROSE
                        Did he heal me?

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t know.

           Margaret drinks in the closeness, smooths Rose’s hair.
                                 ROSE
                        Will you sing?

           Margaret sips water.

                                 MARGARET
                            (singing)
                        Gonna build me a-log ca-bin... On
                        the moun-tain so high--

           Margaret’s eyes begin to flutter... lulled by her own lullaby.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A SHRIEK!  Margaret jolts awake -- the girls are gone.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Margaret flings open the door.  It hits something and LURCHES
           BACK.  She pushes slower ... A pile of CHOPPED WOOD blocks
           the door.  Another SQUEAL.  Margaret steps into

           THE YARD

           She watches the girls, confused.  They aren’t distressed,
           but filled with glee.  SOMETHING WET hits Margaret’s face.

           She looks up -- it’s RAINING.

                                 ROSE
                        Come on!

           The girls pull Margaret into the rain.  They run to the
           GREENHOUSE, fling open the top.  Rain WETS the seedlings.

           VIEW ON WALLACE
           Arms extended heaven-ward, seeming to CONJURE THE RAIN.

           EXT. GARDEN - LATER

           Margaret and Rose tend the newly watered plants.  Rose
           concentrates on the TOMATO VINE.

                                 ROSE
                        Like this?

           Margaret watches Rose pull a “sucker” from between the stem
           and main branch on the plant.

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s it.

           Rose waves her hand under her nose.
                                 ROSE
                        Smells funny.

                                 MARGARET
                            (laughing)
                        So don’t smell it!

                                 ROSE
                        But I like it.

           INT. BARN, STALL - DAY

           Margaret enters with WATER.  Wallace hands her a BOWL --

                                 WALLACE
                        Trade ya?

           -- Containing a tiny splash of MILK.  Margaret lights up,
           quickly drapes her APRON over the bowl.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        What else you got for me?

                                 MARGARET
                        I could catch up on some cleaning,
                        work on Rose's dress for the dance
                        if you want to work on a wind break. 
                        Henry meant to.  Just never seemed
                        to be enough hours.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MONTAGE.  Intercutting between Wallace and Margaret -- twine
           looping around WOODEN STAKE, fabric snapping TAUT, the wooden
           stake twisting into dust, broom flinging dust, stopping...

           Margaret inspects her bedroom.  For once, EVERYTHING IS CLEAN.

           She turns to the SEWING MODEL, begins to attach the lace.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Margaret sits in a wooden barrel of water, relishing the
           bath.  She ducks underwater, stays there.

                                                               FLASH TO:

           Margaret dips the diaphanous fabric of her dress into water.

           YOUNG ADA (3) stands below Margaret’s dress.  Water dripping
           onto her like a waterfall.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           Margaret pours her bath water over Ada’s grave.  Eyes the
           new WIND BREAK protecting her garden.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Margaret stitches a seam on Rose’s new GREEN DRESS.

           Just then, Ollie bursts into the room wearing a RED HAT. 
           She flings open the WARDROBE, checks behind the door -- both
           are empty.  Margaret WINKS at Ollie, gestures to the bed.

           Ollie trots forward, finds Rose beneath Margaret’s mattress. 
           Rose reluctantly takes the red hat from Ollie, exits --

                                 ROSE
                        You told her where I was.

           Through the WINDOW, Margaret watches Rose chase Ollie past
           Wallace, who LIMPS to the barn.

           INT. BARN, STALL - DAY

           Wallace cleans dust from Georgia’s nose while Margaret milks
           her.  Rose zips past the window wearing the RED HAT.

                                 WALLACE
                        Why the red hat?

                                 MARGARET
                        Helps Ollie with Hide and Seek.

           Wallace LIMPS to the window.

                                 WALLACE
                        Isn’t that clever?  “...Count it all
                        joy when you fall into various trials,
                        knowing that the testing of your
                        faith produces patience."

                                 MARGARET
                        How’d you get into the church?

                                 WALLACE
                        Daddy was a preacher.  And his daddy
                        before.  Said I had The Touch young.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why don’t you heal your leg?

                                 WALLACE
                        Some injuries are a reminder of past
                        sins.

                                 MARGARET
                        Like?
                                 WALLACE
                        Always had a hard time with people
                        depending on me.  Don’t know if
                        sometimes their faith was lacking or
                        if it was me, but when it didn’t
                        work... I’d turn to drink.  Tried to
                        jump into some water from a bridge
                        once.  I “misjudged” is one way to
                        put it.  Another is that I landed
                        right on the bank, nowhere near the
                        water.  That I was drunk as a skunk.
                            (then)
                        Hadn’t had a sip since.  The ache in
                        my leg reminds me why.

           Ollie bursts into the stall, hides behind Margaret.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        How do I say, “Good hiding spot”?

           She shows Wallace the SIGNS, which he mimics.  Ollie beams.

                                 MARGARET
                        Most people just talk loudly.  You’re
                        good with her.

                                 WALLACE
                        It comes honestly.  Four little
                        sisters.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where are they now?

                                 WALLACE
                        Two are in Texas.  Scarlet Fever
                        took the others while I was off
                        spreading the word.

           This seems to pain him.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ollie had it ... and Ada.  When they
                        went into quarantine, Ada called out
                        for me until her throat bled.  I
                        clawed the door until my nails were
                        left in the wood.

                                 WALLACE
                        Temporary separation is a burden of
                        our earthly lives, but there’s a
                        reunion that lasts for eternity.  Do
                        you believe that?

                                 MARGARET
                        I have to.  Don’t have a choice.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        Funny thing is, after Ada passed I
                        just wanted my mother.

                                 WALLACE
                        Did she come for the service?

           Margaret shakes her head, “No.”

                                 MARGARET
                        She still doesn’t know.  I wrote her
                        when they were sick, and she said I
                        should never have come West.  Married
                        Henry.  That it was my fault.  Maybe
                        it was.

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t think so.  I think those
                        girls are lucky to have you.

           Off Margaret’s disbelieving look --

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        No?

                                 MARGARET
                        After Ada, my sleep was ... fitful. 
                        They say I went into the girls’ room,
                        tried to make the bed while they
                        were in it sleeping.  Pulled the
                        sheets down tight over their heads. 
                        Scared them.

           OLLIE WATCHES--
           Margaret’s PAINED FACE.  She reaches up and touches it.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Could you make her hear again?

                                 WALLACE
                        I don’t know.  I’d need time.  If I
                        tried it all at once ... it could
                        kill me.  There’s a cost.  A balancing
                        that happens.

           Margaret nods.  Then:

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        If I could work with someone.  My
                        father has my gift and more.
                            (then)
                        Course I wouldn’t know how to get
                        him here.
                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        Mail!

           Rose appears at the door, tosses the red hat at Ollie.

           Wallace nervously watches the girls run to the MAILBOX.

                                 MARGARET
                        Let’s pray there’s a letter with
                        money for us.  Travel money.

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls run up as Wallace and Margaret exit.

                                 WALLACE
                        Anything good?

                                 ROSE
                        Not today --

           Wallace seems to relax.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        -- But the letter carrier says a
                        haze is moving in.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           The edges of the house are smudged out by the hazy air.

                                 MARGARET  (O.S.)
                        Wallace?  Care to say the blessing?

           INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

           A CALLOUSED HAND extended palm up, a tiny hand grabs it. 
           Margaret, Wallace and the girls sit at the table, praying.

                                 WALLACE
                        God above, I thank you for the warmth
                        of the Bellums.  You connected us
                        through Henry, and for that I will
                        be eternally grateful.  Thank you
                        for Rose’s continued health and we
                        ask that you hold Ollie in your ever-
                        loving light.  I’m reminded of a
                        verse my father taught me.  John
                        nine.  “Neither this man nor his
                        parents sinned, but this happened so
                        that the works of God would be
                        displayed in him.” 

           Margaret opens her eyes, moved.
                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for this nourishment--

                                 ROSE
                        And thank you for ... this!

           Rose presents a LETTER.

                                 MARGARET
                        When did that come?

                                 ROSE
                        Today.

           Ollie tries to grab the letter, but Rose snatches it back.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s her turn, sweetheart.

                                 ROSE
                        It’ll take a century.

                                 WALLACE
                        Let me give you ladies a little
                        privacy here.

                                 MARGARET
                        Stay.  Hard to see out there.

           Ollie opens the letter, shakes it.  Nothing spills out.

                                 WALLACE
                        But still--

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t be silly.

           Wallace returns to his seat ... edgy.  Ollie SIGNS the letter
           word by word.  Margaret translates --

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        First off, I need to ... apologize
                        for the delay.  This next part’s
                        just for Mama, girls.

           Margaret TAKES the letter.  Ollie descends into TANTRUM.

                                 ROSE
                        Stop! 

           Margaret skims the letter, rattled, then SIGNS to Rose. 
           Confused, Rose SIGNS back.

                                 MARGARET
                        Now, Rose!
           As Rose exits, Wallace waves Ollie towards him.  

                                 WALLACE
                        Y’all telling secrets over there?

           Margaret turns to see Wallace CLUTCHING Ollie in his lap.

                                 MARGARET
                        Put her down!

           Rose re-enters with the SHOTGUN.  Hands it to Margaret who
           trains it on Wallace.  

                                 WALLACE
                        Well, that seems like a bad idea.

                                 MARGARET
                        Who are you?

                                 WALLACE
                        I told ya.  Wallace Grady.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom, stop it!  

                                 MARGARET
                        Read the letter, Rose.  Aloud.

                                 ROSE
                            (reading)
                        I’m fine Margaret, but my jacket was
                        took.  Along with the letter in its
                        pocket, money and sweets for the
                        girls.  There was a preacher hanging
                        around, asked to stay the night. 
                        Next day my bunkmate didn’t come
                        back from lunch.  Found him with his
                        head cracked open like an egg, boots
                        pulled off his feet.  Nobody knows
                        how he got out.  Like he just
                        vanished.

           Margaret cocks the shotgun.

                                 WALLACE
                        I wouldn’t have hurt y’all.  Just
                        wanted the jacket.  The boy walked
                        in.  Wouldn’t quit hollerin’.

                                 MARGARET
                        Where’s the money?

                                 WALLACE
                        Gone.  Where’s your money?  Henry
                        said you had some squirreled away.
                                 MARGARET
                        Gone.  Let her go.

                                 WALLACE
                        I will.  In exchange for that letter
                        there.

                                 MARGARET
                        We’d better hold onto this.  See
                        what the sheriff thinks.

           A beat.  Suddenly, Wallace jumps to grab the LETTER.

           OLLIE’S WATCHES--
           As Margaret pulls the TRIGGER, and the gun muzzle FLASHES. 
           Rose crouches, covering her ears.

           Wallace rips the letter from Rose’s hands, turns to see a
           GAPING HOLE in the door next to him.

           In the chaos, Ollie breaks free, and runs to Margaret.

                                 WALLACE
                        Y’all would’ve starved without me.

                                 MARGARET
                        Without you, his letter would’ve
                        gotten to us.  We could’ve bought
                        feed for Georgia.  We could’ve left.

                                 WALLACE
                        “Do not neglect to show hospitality
                        to strangers, for thereby some have
                        entertained angels unawares.”

                                 MARGARET
                        Angels?

                                 WALLACE
                            (re: Rose)
                        Fixed her didn’t I?  How bout I undo
                        it, put her back the way she was.

                                 MARGARET
                        Fixed her?  You’re a con.  Your father
                        a con too?

                                 WALLACE
                        ... Never met him.

           Margaret pulls back the second hammer on the rifle, motions
           to the door.

                                 MARGARET
                        Get out.
                                 WALLACE
                        Guess I’d be scared too.  Out here
                        all alone.  Knowing a man could come
                        back with friends.  A few locks, bit
                        of twine won’t stop me.  Won’t stop
                        the Grey Man.
                            (a moment)
                        Be seeing you.

           Wallace backs out the door ... melting into the haze.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  Margaret finishes hammering a board over
           the SHOTGUN BLAST in the door.

           Rose turns from the door to the windows, which have been
           boarded up FROM THE INSIDE.

                                 ROSE
                        Will he really come back?

                                 MARGARET
                        I won't let him.

           On Rose, conflicted, wanting to say more as Margaret begins
           BLOCKADING the door with stacked chairs.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - LATER

           As Margaret tucks them in, Rose lets Ollie snuggle into her.  

                                 ROSE
                        We could write dad.  Tell him to
                        come home.  

                                 MARGARET
                        We have two weeks left.  By the time
                        we reach him, he'll be headed back.

           Margaret crosses to the VANITY TABLE and blows out the lamp.  

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           CLOSE ON the door.  A tangle of chairs blockading it.

           The camera PANS to Margaret’s sleep-deprived eyes.  She leans
           the RIFLE against the RIGHT SIDE of her chair.

           The WIND kicks up outside.  Something slides across the roof.

           Her eyes track the sound ...  without cutting, we TILT UP to
           the ceiling, back DOWN to Margaret.  She turns back to the
           door, GASPS as the CAMERA WHIPS back to find:
           THE CHAIRS BLOCKING THE DOOR HAVE BEEN NEATLY CLEARED AWAY.

           Margaret covers her mouth, horrified.  She glances to her
           RIGHT where the gun SHOULD BE, but it’s gone.

           She turns, finds the gun on her LEFT SIDE.  Odd ...

           What just happened?  She never left the room ...  Margaret
           checks, and the door is still LOCKED.  

           INT. FARMHOUSE - IMAGE SERIES

           Lamp lighting the way, Margaret opens her bedroom door to
           reveal: the girls sound asleep.

           Without cutting, Margaret moves past and we TRACK BEHIND her
           as she creeps down the HALLWAY and into the FRONT ROOM.

           The lamp casts STRANGE SHADOWS as she checks that the front
           door is locked.  Then, suddenly:

                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        MOM!

           Margaret sprints down the HALL, bursts into --

           HER BEDROOM

           -- To find... THE CURTAINS ARE ON FIRE.  The girls huddled,
           terrified.  Margaret grabs water, douses the flames.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you knock the lamp over?

                                 ROSE
                        We were asleep.

           Margaret turns -- the lamp is ACROSS THE ROOM on the vanity.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you hear anything?

                                 ROSE
                        When?

                                 MARGARET
                        I was up the whole night.  The doors
                        are locked.  Where is he getting in?

           Ollie opens the book of GHOST STORIES to THE GREY MAN.

           Margaret takes the book, stares at the Grey Man ETCHING.
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                            (reading)
                        During a dust storm, the Grey Man’s
                        ashes blow back together.  He slides
                        in through cracks like dust, takes
                        shape on the other side.  You’ll
                        breathe him in and he’ll make you do
                        terrible things.

           Margaret glances at the girls, the BURNT CURTAINS, then ...
           a LINE OF DUST beneath the door jamb.

           On Margaret, considering ...

                                 ROSE
                        It’s just a story, mom.  I let Wallace
                        read the Grey Man one day.

                                 MARGARET
                        But he healed you, right?  He came
                        into a sealed house.  While I stood
                        watch.

           A sudden KNOCK on the door.  Margaret MOTIONS for quiet.

           Rose goes to pull out a wad of fabric from the windowsill,
           so they can see outside...  Margaret grabs her hand.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        No.  That’s what he wants.

                                 A WOMAN’S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Hello?  Margaret?  It’s Esther.

                                 MARGARET
                        Slide the fabric back back under the
                        door when I leave.  Stay here.  No
                        matter what.  

                                 ROSE
                        But it's just Aunt Esther.

           Margaret exits, and Rose follows directions.  Then, she pulls
           out the POSTER that Sheriff Bell gave her.  Begins to write.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Esther listens for movement inside.  She looks better, more
           lucid than when we saw her last.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Margaret enters the kitchen.
                                 ESTHER  (O.S.)
                        Margaret?  You missed church again. 
                        Everyone’s worried.  Are you okay?

           Margaret smooths her dress and hair, then opens the door
           forcing a smile.  She SQUINTS from the sunlight.

                                 MARGARET
                        We're fine.  Come in.

           Margaret checks to see if Wallace is outside.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The kitchen is DARK again, sealed up from the dust and light. 
           Margaret stitches quickly, glancing around the room.

           Esther angles her SEWING closer to a LANTERN.

                                 ESTHER
                        It’s difficult with such low light.

                                 MARGARET
                        Much easier to breathe though.

                                 ESTHER
                        You’ve been missed at the sewing
                        circle...
                            (then)
                        Oh Margaret I’ve come to apologize. 
                        Sheriff thought I might could show
                        you.  I’m not mad at all. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It's not that.  We’ve just had a
                        bug.  Didn’t want to chance the girls
                        getting worse.

           Margaret nervously eyes a CRACK in the wall.  Stands and
           patches it.

           Esther watches her, glances at the boarded up windows.

                                 ESTHER
                        I wonder if it might help to get out
                        more?  Take it from me, it’s wild
                        what happens up here --
                            (she taps her head)
                        -- When we’re allowed to stew.  Might
                        help to take the lid off, let some
                        of that steam out.

           Margaret sits back down.  Suddenly clear.
                                 MARGARET
                        That’s true, isn’t it?  We really
                        should get out more.

                                 ESTHER
                        You might start with the dance
                        tonight.
                            (then)
                        I've been trying to get out more
                        too.  Working with a preacher. 
                        Praying to get my head right. 
                        Visiting the children...  I hear
                        Thomas is improving.  Margaret, you
                        were right to do what you did.  The
                        things I started thinking... the
                        things I said...

                                 MARGARET
                        I know I could’ve done better too.

                                 ESTHER
                        You’re my sister, and I love you. 
                        That’s all.

                                 MARGARET
                        And I’m glad you’re here.

                                 ESTHER
                        Sheriff Bell’s teaching me some jokes. 
                        Would you like to hear one?
                            (off Margaret’s nod)
                        Guess why we’re going to have to pay
                        taxes in Kansas.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why?

                                 ESTHER
                        Because that’s where our farm has
                        blown.

           This gets a genuine TITTER from Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        Maybe it’ll blow back before planting
                        time.

           They laugh more.  Margaret seems to relax as she sews.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Esther holds her SEWING SUPPLIES as she exits.

                                 ESTHER
                        Girls?  
           No response as we CUT TO:

           MARGARET'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Rose listens at the door.  Unsure what to do.  

                                 ESTHER  (O.S.)
                        Girls!  Come hug my neck!

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Margaret is horrified to see Rose and Ollie run outside, hug
           Esther goodbye.

                                 ESTHER
                        There they are.  
                            (then)
                        Henry’s back soon, right?

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s right.

                                 ESTHER
                        Oh! I ought to take your square for
                        the quilt.  

           Esther takes Margaret's FABRIC and GASPS, dropping it.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        My goodness.

           Rose retrieves the fabric, sneaks a look.  On top of the
           once delicate stitching, Margaret has sewn

           HUNDREDS OF ERRATIC BLACK LINES

           In a chaotic, frenzied pattern.  Rose THINKS, grabs Ollie.

                                 ROSE
                        You sewed over mom’s needle work?!

           Ollie jerks away from Rose, confused.  Margaret is forced to
           attend to Ollie’s TANTRUM --

                                 MARGARET
                        No!  Breathe!

           -- As Esther leads Rose ACROSS THE YARD.  Unable to hear
           Rose and Esther, Margaret watches them, suspicious. 

                                 MARGARET (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                        What did she say?
           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margaret slides fabric under the door jamb.

                                 ROSE
                        Just ...
                            (then)
                        She said we had to come to the dance. 
                        People were talking ... worrying.

                                 MARGARET
                        Worrying?

           On Margaret, mulling this over.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What about Wallace?  What if he gets
                        in while we’re gone?

                                 ROSE
                        Sheriff Bell will be there, we can
                        talk to him.  Tell him what's
                        happening.

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you remember how he looked at me
                        when he was here last?  When I said
                        someone was in the barn?

           On Rose: "Like you were crazy."

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        He already sent her here to check on
                        me.  Without the letter from Wallace,
                        I can’t risk... If the sheriff thought
                        something was wrong.  If he felt
                        that way again, he could take you. 
                        Both.
                            (long beat)
                        No, we won’t mention it.  We’ll go
                        to the dance.  Show them everything’s
                        okay.  Once and for all.  We don’t
                        need them clucking about me being
                        unfit, do we?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Rose modeling her new green and lace DRESS.  Margaret kneels,
           looks for areas that need to be taken in or adjusted.

                                 ROSE
                        It’s so pretty.

                                 MARGARET
                        I think it’s the wearer.
           Margaret nervously touches Rose’s cheek.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Are you flushed?

                                 ROSE
                        No.  I’m just excited.

           Meanwhile, Ollie finishes dressing Henrietta in DOLL CLOTHES. 
           The kitten is NOT HAPPY and takes off.  The girls pursue --

                                 MARGARET
                        Girls!  We stay in here unless you're
                        wearing your mask. 

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Margaret pulls her dress on.  Looks at her slightly-warped
           reflection in the mirror.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Donning a mask, Margaret steps into the main room and sees
           ROSE falling to her knees, her back HEAVING.

           Margaret comes closer -- beneath the fabric of Rose’s new
           dress, a GROTESQUE LUMP seems to burrow across her flesh.

                                 MARGARET
                        What is that?  Rose?

           Margaret looks away, then back -- the SHIFTING LUMP remains. 
           She grabs Rose, RIPS OPEN the back of her new dress.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom, stop!  What’s wrong with you?!

           Rose PUSHES away from her mother.  Reveals that it’s only
           the KITTEN that was crawling under the fabric of her dress.

           Rose steps away, holding her TATTERED DRESS together.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Rose sits on the bed, her dress torn, spirit dampened. 
           Margaret retrieves Rose’s OLD DRESS from the wardrobe.

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t think we should go.

                                 MARGARET
                        You’ll still look perfect.

                                 ROSE
                        It’s not just the dress.
           Margaret eyes the MIRROR -- her face is gaunt, sleepless.

                                 MARGARET
                        I see.
                            (then)
                        But we have to show them we’re okay,
                        right?

           On Rose, not sure that “looking okay” is possible.

           Margaret goes to the WARDROBE, retrieves the KNIFE.

           She lifts her skirt, drags the BLADE across her inner thigh.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom!  Stop!

                                 MARGARET
                        Relax, honey.  Relax.

           Margaret dabs her finger in the BLOOD, pats it onto her CHEEKS
           and LIPS.  Ollie approaches, wanting makeup too.

                                 ROSE
                        Little, no.

                                 MARGARET
                        My perfect girls.

           Rose watches Margaret dab the blood on Ollie’s cheeks.

           She moves to the WARDROBE, stealthily tucks SOMETHING UNSEEN
           in Ollie’s doll.

           EXT. DUSTY LANE - DAY

           Margaret and the girls move through the HAZY AIR wearing
           GOGGLES and DUST MASKS.

           INT. ONE ROOM CHURCH - DAY

           On a makeshift stage, Janie plays an OLD TUNE on piano.  The
           sewing circle’s QUILT hangs behind her for decoration.

           Nearby, several WOMEN waltz in pairs, steal glances at
           MARGARET.  She forces a smile as Bertha and Birdie approach.

                                 BIRDIE
                        So good to see you and the girls,
                        Margaret.

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s good to be here.
                                 BERTHA
                        Feeling better?

           Margaret scans the room -- clocks Rose chatting with Sheriff.

                                 MARGARET
                        Sorry.

           Margaret moves past the women.  They follow.

           Meanwhile, Rose pulls a LETTER from Ollie’s doll and
           clandestinely hands it to the Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Everything alright?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes, sir.  Just trying to surprise
                        Ollie with something.  Her birthday’s
                        coming up.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        You’re a good big sister.  Hope my
                        little one ends up half so good.

           Sheriff Bell turns to Birdie and Margaret.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        How about a spin, Margaret?  My lady
                        claims disability.

           Sheriff Bell winks at Birdie, who touches her pregnant belly. 
           Rose looks on, nervous as Margaret and Bell begin to dance.

           Margaret spins, thinking...

                                 MARGARET 
                        Silly us.  We forgot to put a stamp
                        on Rose’s letter.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        How’s that?

                                 MARGARET
                        The letter Rose gave you.

           A moment.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Well, that won’t do, will it?

           He hands Margaret the LETTER, and she relaxes.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        So how’s things?
                                 MARGARET
                        We had a little bug, but we’re much
                        better now.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Glad to hear it.  No more strange
                        happenings?

                                 MARGARET
                        ...No.  We’re just fine.

           Margaret watches Ollie and Rose whirl in gleeful pirouettes. 
           She LIGHTS UP at the sight.  Then, the music STOPS.

           The dancers stop too, but Ollie’s late to get the memo, bumps
           into Rose, who stares at Margaret.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Oh uh Margaret.  You’re...

           She looks down -- a SPOT OF BLOOD SPREADS across the front
           of her skirt.  Margaret covers the stain, tries to explain --

                                 MARGARET
                        Goodness.  It’s just a cut.
                            (then)
                        It’s just my leg... I...
                            (desperate now)
                        Please keep playing.  Play!

           Rose GRABS Margaret, pulls her to the exit.

           Margaret suddenly GASPS and backs the girls up.

           Then, her POV: The HAZY OUTLINE of ESTHER AND WALLACE. 
           Entering the dance together.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing with him?!

           Confused, Esther steps inside, turns back as Dr.  Cox, the
           town doctor, steps into the light.

                                 ESTHER
                        With Dr.  Cox?  Well I--

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry.  Excuse me.  I better
                        take care of this cut.
                                 ESTHER
                        Oh, Margaret, that healer I mentioned,
                        the one who got me thinking right
                        again?  Helped me with the house. 
                        How about we stop by later?

                                 MARGARET
                        Healer?  You mean Wallace?

                                 ESTHER
                        His name’s Everett Lee.  Why?

                                 MARGARET
                        Does he have a limp?

                                 ESTHER
                        You met him?

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re housing a murderer.

                                 ESTHER
                        I don’t understand.

                                 MARGARET
                        Henry sent me a letter.  Your healer
                        killed a man at his camp.

                                 ESTHER
                        That can’t be.  He’s real nice.

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s not of this world.  He’s been
                        sneaking into our house, moving things
                        at night.  He can get through the
                        locks, closed windows.  Sheriff, he
                        was the one hiding in our loft.  The
                        one who cut our cow.

           Rose sees the townspeople watch and WHISPER.

                                 ROSE
                        She’s telling the truth, Sheriff.  I
                        saw him.

           Margaret is suddenly aware of how she must seem.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t want the girls
                        to miss the dance, but this cut has
                        me a little light headed.

           Margaret moves to exit, hears WHISPERING, stops --
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        I can hear you.
                            (mimics a whisper)
                        Sppspspspsp.  I know what you’re
                        saying.  That I have rats in the
                        attic.  But you’re the ones being
                        buried alive, poisoned!  There is
                        something in the dust, something--

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?  Please?

           Margaret stops.  As she crosses past Esther --

                                 ESTHER
                        We’ll get you.  Won’t be long.

                                 MARGARET
                        What?!

                                 ESTHER
                            (confused)
                        I said you have to be strong.  Like
                        you told me.  Remember?

           As Margaret hurries the girls outside, Sheriff Bell and Esther
           share a concerned look.

                                 ESTHER (CONT'D)
                        Should I--

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Better not.  I wrote Henry a while
                        back.  Due any day now.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret’s lamp barely lights the room as the girls enter.

                                 MARGARET
                        Keep your masks on.  Wallace could
                        be in here right now.

           INT. MARGARET'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret locks the door and wedges fabric beneath the door
           jamb as the girls remove their masks, dress for bed.

                                 MARGARET
                        They’re conspiring, Esther and
                        Wallace.  To make me look... And
                        it’s working, even on you.  

                                 ROSE
                        What do you mean?
           Margaret turns, pulling out Rose’s letter.

                                 MARGARET
                            (reading)
                        “Something’s not right at home.”
                            (to Rose)
                        What's "not right"?

                                 ROSE
                        You...  Sorry.
                            (then)
                        The Sheriff didn’t read it...

           Margaret gestures to her bloody dress.

                                 MARGARET
                        But he saw me like this.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose STARTS awake.  Strangely, the door is WIDE OPEN.

           Margaret’s gone, and so is the GUN.  Rose peers into THE
           HALLWAY.  Hundreds of DUSTY FOOTPRINTS dirty the floor.  As
           though someone has paced all night long.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

           Rose moves through the HAZY AIR to ADA’S GRAVE where she
           finds Margaret facing away, standing EERILY STILL.

           Rose notices -- Margaret’s dress is on BACKWARDS.  The BUTTONS
           run down her back and a BLOOD STAIN marks the fabric.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom?

           Margaret calmly picks up her SHOTGUN, and POINTS IT DIRECTLY
           AT ROSE.  Her eyes are blank, stare right through Rose.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Are you asleep?

           Trembling, Rose gently pushes the gun down.  Margaret blinks.

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you mean?  I’m standing right
                        here.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret re-dresses.  Her hands are nervous.
                                 ROSE
                        It’s you.  You’re doing things at
                        night again.  That’s how the chairs
                        moved.  There’s no Grey Man.  Wallace
                        isn’t haunting us.

           Margaret touches the burnt curtains: Has she really been
           responsible for all of the odd happenings?

           Just then, SCRATCHING on the outside wall.

           Margaret motions for SILENCE.  BANG, BANG, BANG!  Someone
           POUNDS on the kitchen door.

                                 MARGARET
                            (whispering)
                        Stay inside.  No matter what, alright?

                                 ROSE
                        Wait.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Margaret sees the hazy edge of the PORCH RAILING, but
           everything else drops off into a THICKENING FOG OF DUST.

           She un-spools TWINE, steps off the PORCH, and is enveloped
           by the HAZE.

           As she moves, there’s the sense that SOMEONE could be inches
           from her face and she wouldn’t see it.

           SHATTERING GLASS.  Someone’s trying to get in.  Margaret
           quietly moves to the sound.  Behind her, the house CREAKS.

                                 MARGARET
                        Wallace?  Esther?

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Rose paces, anxious.  She opens the front door, touches the
           twine encircling the doorknob, and steps INTO THE DUST.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Margaret is trembling, clutching the rifle, disoriented by
           the haze.  There are FOOTSTEPS, a COUGH.  Suddenly,

           A HAND GRABS HER SHOULDER,

           And she spins, FIRES.  The GUNFIRE illuminates the OUTLINE
           OF SOMEONE.  A body THUDS.

           Margaret kneels to look at the body, brings her shaking hand
           to her mouth.  An excruciating beat: Who’d she shoot?
                                 ROSE  (O.S.)
                        Mom?!

                                 MARGARET
                            (faux calm)
                        Go back in, Sweetheart.  It was
                        Wallace.  I got him.

           She begins to SCRATCH at the dirt with her BARE HANDS.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose looks on as Margaret mends the DRESS with GREAT EFFORT.

                                 ROSE
                        You killed him?

                                 MARGARET
                        He would’ve killed us.

           Rose sees that the green dress fabric is BLOODY.

                                 ROSE
                        Is your leg still bleeding?

           Rose pulls the dress away, but it CATCHES -- Margaret has
           stitched the dress TO HER OWN PALM.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Mom?!

           Rose grabs the KNIFE from the wardrobe, and cuts the
           CONNECTING THREADS.

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m sorry.  That’s...

                                 ROSE
                        Let’s go.  You said we would.

           A tear streaks Margaret’s face; she slaps it away.

                                 MARGARET
                            (as if waking up)
                        We need some help, don’t we?

           Rose nods, starts crying.  There is sudden LUCIDITY in
           Margaret’s voice.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        When the haze clears, we’ll pack and
                        go.  On foot if we have to.  Okay?

           Rose nods, the weight of the world lifted from her shoulders.
                                 ROSE
                        Promise?

                                 MARGARET
                        We will, I promise.  But I could
                        barely see my hand in front of my
                        face out there.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAYS LATER

           Ollie carves a notch mark on the WARDROBE door -- Day 81.

           Most of the room is PACKED.  Margaret enters with WATER.  

                                 ROSE
                        Still bad?

           Margaret nods -- she’s covered in dust, exhausted.

           Nearby, Ollie spins and spins, practicing pirouettes.  She
           loses her balance, and kicks over the BUCKET of water.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Ollie!  I’ll get more.

                                 MARGARET
                        No.  I’ll go.  

           As Margaret hurries out, Rose sees that she forgot the bucket.

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, wait --

           She turns the handle, but the door BUMPS into something and
           she realizes... they’re LOCKED IN.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Mom!?

           Rose climbs onto the seat of a chair by the window.  Pulls
           FABRIC from one of the endless patched cracks.

           The girls SQUINT as UNFILTERED SUNLIGHT streams in.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        What?

           Recovering, Rose peers through the WINDOW -- the sky is
           crystal clear, not a dust cloud in sight.

           OUTSIDE,
           Margaret suddenly steps into view.  She grabs handfuls of
           dust, dirties her face and clothes.
           Rose realizes with horror -- her mother has been lying about
           leaving town.

           As Margaret strides to the house, Rose hurries to patch the
           crack, but it still LEAKS LIGHT.

           She runs to the VANITY TABLE for a handkerchief, spots
           Margaret’s SLEEPING PILLS... An idea occurs.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Margaret enters “COUGHING.”  Rose is seated at the VANITY
           TABLE brushing her hair like nothing’s wrong.

                                 ROSE
                        Is it that bad?

                                 MARGARET
                        Not windy so much, but the air is so
                        thick.

           Rose turns around, offers Margaret a glass of water.

                                 ROSE
                        Here.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, no.  That’s yours.

                                 ROSE
                        You’re coughing.  You were out in
                        the dust, right?

           Margaret ignores her.  Busies herself with packing.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Later.  Rose stares at the untouched GLASS of water, thinks
           ... she puts her arms around Margaret.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Sing us Jack-o-Diamonds, will you?

                                 MARGARET
                        Only if you sing with me.

                                 MARGARET AND ROSE
                        Oh, she’s a pretty bird / she war-
                        bles ... as she flies / She ne-ver,
                        hollers cuckoo / till the fourth day
                        / of Ju-ly.

           Margaret’s voice CRACKS -- she sips water.
                                 MARGARET AND ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Said Jack-o-Diamonds / well Jack-o-
                        Diamonds / oh, I know you ... from--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Margaret tries to focus her eyes.  She looks at the now empty
           glass, then turns to Rose who SUDDENLY BLURS.

           Margaret sinks onto the bed, NODDING OFF.  Ollie pushes her
           mother back and forth, frightened.

                                 ROSE
                        Just asleep, Little.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Rose leads Ollie by the hand as they exit the house.  A wind
           blows across the farm.  Possibly the beginning of a storm.  

                                 ROSE
                        Getting sheriff to get daddy, okay?

           With a strength we’ve never seen from Rose before, she picks
           Ollie up, puts her on her hip.

           Suddenly, Ollie jumps free, runs to a solitary patch of YELLOW
           FLOWERS, the only vibrant color in any direction.

           Ollie goes to pick one as Rose rushes up behind her --

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        We have to go, before she wakes--

           Rose freezes, spotting SOMETHING near Ollie's hand.  She
           thinks quickly:

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Explorer?  To the greenhouse?

           Rose wraps her HANDKERCHIEF around Ollie’s eyes, spins her. 
           Ollie orients herself, steps tentatively towards the GARDEN.

           Then, Rose's POV: A piece of shoelace in the dust.

           Beat.  Rose starts to dig.  She uncovers a SMALL BOOT. 
           Gathers herself.  Digs down further and realizes:

           THIS IS AUNT ESTHER, NOT WALLACE.

           Part of her arm and a large section of her stomach have been
           EVISCERATED by Margaret’s close range shotgun blast.  The
           remaining tatters of her dress are soaked in DRY BLACK BLOOD.

           Rose jerks to her feet, tears leaking from her eyes.
           The weathervane CREAKS as it whips the opposite direction.

           Georgia’s LOW turns her attention to the barn as a low rumble
           pulls her gaze skyward: A sky-high tidal wave of black dust
           towers above the barn.  A black BLIZZARD.  

           Rose makes a decision -- storm or not, she’s ready to grab
           her sister and run, but Ollie is GONE.

           She turns, frantic, finds Ollie IN MARGARET’S ARMS.

                                 MARGARET
                        Have to watch her, sweetheart.  She
                        was halfway to Texas.

           Rose strides towards Margaret, GRABS Ollie's arm and YANKS. 
           Ollie flails, CLAWING to stay with her mom.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Rose, you're hurting her!

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Ollie nestles in Margaret’s lap, shaken.  Outside, the
           worsening storm BATTERS THE HOUSE. 

                                 MARGARET
                        You scared the devil out of her. 
                        What got into you?

                                 ROSE
                        ... I know.

           Margaret turns to face Rose.  A long beat.

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 MARGARET
                        Why?  To protect you.  Us.

                                 ROSE
                        Then we should’ve left.

                                 MARGARET
                        I was trying to keep us all together. 
                        Me, you, your sisters. 

                                 ROSE
                        She is dead!

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t you understand?  You girls are
                        me.  Parts of me.  Cut away.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Separated.  I bleed when you’re sick. 
                        I am alive out there, suffocating
                        under the dirt with your sister... 
                        And you have no idea what I’m capable
                        of to keep us together, to keep us
                        whole.

           BANG!  BANG!  Someone POUNDS on the front door.  Rose starts
           to yell, but Margaret CLAMPS her hand over Rose’s mouth HARD.

           OLLIE WATCHES--
           Rose STRUGGLING AGAINST Margaret.  Her face BRIGHT RED.

           Rose BITES Margaret’s hand.  Margaret swallows a SCREAM, but
           keeps her hand in place.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        They’ll take you away!  PLEASE.

           Rose kicks her feet, starts to go LIMP, growing weaker.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Shh, shh, shh--

           The KNOCKING stops.  Rose is SUDDENLY STILL...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - SAME

           Ollie opens the door for Sheriff Bell.  He steps in --

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Hey, sweet pea.  Margaret?!

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Margaret lets go of Rose who SUCKS IN AIR, recovering.  Rose
           stares at her: “You would’ve killed me.”

           As Rose runs out, Margaret clocks the SHOTGUN in the corner.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY

           Rose enters, kneels to Ollie and SIGNS --

                                 ROSE
                        Thank you.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Your mama back there?

                                 ROSE
                        In the bedroom.

           Bell ducks through the hole in the wall.  Rose follows.
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                            (suddenly remembering)
                        She’s got a gun!

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sheriff Bell enters to find Margaret clutching the RIFLE.  A
           beat.  She hands him the gun.

                                 MARGARET
                        I don’t know what’s gotten into her. 
                        It’s for coyotes.

           Sheriff Bell sniffs the barrel --

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Had one recently?

                                 MARGARET
                        They’re always around.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Y’all mind waitin’ in the kitchen?

           Sheriff Bell hands the gun to Rose, who exits with Ollie.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Esther stop in over here?  She was
                        doing so good, but hadn’t been over
                        to see the kids in a while.

                                 MARGARET
                        Hope she wasn’t lost in the storm.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Girls seem rattled.

                                 MARGARET
                        Stir crazy I guess.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Maybe they should come with me,
                        Margaret.  Just til Henry’s back.

           Margaret slides her hands into her pockets and begins to
           SOB.  Sheriff Bell moves to comfort her.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT'D)
                        Hey.  We’re talkin’ a few days here. 
                        You done good, all I'm--

           Bell is cut off by a SHARP PAIN in his side.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Margaret?
           It takes him a second to realize -- he’s WOUNDED.

                                 SHERIFF BELL (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Why'd you--

           Margaret pulls the KNIFE from Bell’s side, STABS HIM again.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Framed by the hole in the wall, Rose and Ollie listen to the
           SCUFFLE.  Rose raises the rifle, poised to shoot.

           Sheriff Bell stumbles backwards into the hallway.  He SLAMS
           into the wall, slides down, leaving a STREAK OF RED.

                                 ROSE
                        Sheriff?!

           Bell pulls the knife from his ribs with a bloody hand.

                                 SHERIFF BELL
                        Get outta here, girls.

           Rose runs past with Ollie, starts to open the door which the
           wind immediately TEARS open with a BANG!  -- The storm is
           BLINDING.  Dust POURS IN through the open door as Margaret
           approaches and Rose turns, pointing the gun at her mother --

                                 ROSE
                        Stay back.  PLEASE?!

           Margaret walks directly towards Rose, who aims the gun at
           the ceiling, and CLICK ... she tries to fire, but the chamber
           is empty and somewhere in the CHAOS Sheriff Bell belly-crawls
           out the front door and into the STORM.

                                 MARGARET
                        I took the cartridge out before he
                        came in.  Believe it or not, I’m
                        trying to protect us, Rose.

           Margaret manages to shut the door before realizing ... the
           Sheriff is GONE ... a trail of blood leads to the door.

           Margaret opens the door, staring out at the SWIRLING STORM.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Where is he?! 

           Meanwhile, Rose shakily kneels to the CRIMSON PUDDLE where
           Bell collapsed.  She runs her hand though the blood, retrieves
           Margaret’s KNIFE.  Then, turning to Ollie:
                                 ROSE
                        Not Mommy, okay?!  She breathed in
                        the Grey Man.

           Ollie shakes her head, SIGNS --

                                 ROSE (CONT’D) (CONT'D)
                        Not fibbing.  Promise.  Swear.

           INT. MARGARET'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose watches Margaret who sits at the VANITY TABLE in a daze. 
           Calmly combing her hair.

           Outside, as the storm worsens, air rushes through the house
           creating a low WHISTLE... like a train.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Like a train, isn't it?

           Rose nods, afraid.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        If the sheriff makes it home, they’ll
                        hang me.  String me right up...  But
                        there’s a way around it...  A way to
                        stay together.

           Margaret opens the drawer to reveal the SLEEPING PILLS.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        We’d just go to sleep like any other
                        night.  But longer.

                                 ROSE
                        Mom--

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s the only way to stay together,
                        Rose.  It’s okay to be scared.. 
                        Come here.

           Margaret wraps Rose in a TIGHT EMBRACE.  Behind Margaret’s
           back, Rose fiddles with the KNIFE in her sleeve.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        We could be with Ada.

           Rose has the knife in her GRASP, but ... she just can’t.

                                 ROSE
                        I’m just so tired.

                                 MARGARET
                        I know you are, sweetie.
           A long moment -- Rose looks at Ollie.

                                 ROSE
                        ... Okay.

                                 MARGARET
                        Okay?!

           Rose nods, and climbs into bed with Ollie.  Margaret dumps
           out the SLEEPING PILLS, and begins to crush them one by one.

                                 ROSE
                        Will you tell about the wheat?

                                 MARGARET
                        The first year it just took hold. 
                        The field was chest high and when
                        the wind blew, it would sort of ripple
                        and wave like the ocean...

           Meanwhile, we may notice that Rose quietly SIGNS TO OLLIE.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        One day your daddy was late coming
                        in, so I went down to the field, and
                        the wheat covered my head--

                                 ROSE
                        Could we have it in the peaches?

                                 MARGARET
                        That’s a wonderful idea.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Margaret mixes the POWDERED SLEEPING PILLS into the jar of
           PEACHES.  A SLAM from the bedroom.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Margaret rushes in -- DUST blows in from the open TOP WINDOW.

                                 ROSE
                        I couldn’t stop her.  Ollie climbed
                        out!

           Margaret spots a torn piece of OLLIE’S DRESS on the window
           sill, and a CHAIR next to it.

                                 MARGARET
                        She has to be with us!

           Margaret turns to leave.  On second thought, she strides
           back into the room, whips open the WARDROBE DOOR ... no Ollie.
           Rose and Margaret share a look.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Holding twine, Margaret steps into the BLINDING STORM...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Rose stands TREMBLING at the door.  Flicks open the KNIFE...
           And saws through TWINE that connects Margaret to the house.

           Then, Rose stops.  Begins to cry: Can she really do this?

           The twine begins to BOUNCE ... Margaret’s coming back.  Rose
           steels herself, finishes sawing through the twine and ... 

           TOSSES THE LOOSE END INTO THE STORM.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

           The fabric of Margaret’s dress FLAPS violently.  She
           frantically pulls the TWINE ... reaches the FRAYED END.

           MARGARET IS LOST, DISCONNECTED FROM THE HOUSE.  A sharp,
           GASPING INHALE as she is CONSUMED BY THE STORM.

           INT. MARGARET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose covers the OPEN WINDOW, wipes a tear from her face. 
           She HITS the bed ... hits it TWICE MORE.

           Ollie peeks out from beneath the mattress.  Rose SIGNS --

                                 ROSE
                        She’s gone.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A BOUNDLESS OCEAN OF DUST

           With no point of reference, it’s unclear whether this is the
           farmhouse post-storm, a dried up field, even a beach.

           Then, the sound of a lonely TRAIN WHISTLE.  Rose and Ollie
           step into the FOREGROUND, and the dust begins to TRACK
           SIDEWAYS through the frame.

           The girls squint as their hair dances in the wind.  We PULL
           BACK to reveal that the girls are riding an open train car
           with HENRY and their COUSINS.

           Ollie tugs on Rose, points to a GREEN TREE zooming past. 
           Rose picks her little sister up for a better view.

                                                                THE END:
