           FADE IN:

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS - 
           NIGHT - 2002

           The moon illuminates three cars as they turn onto the street, 
           headlights off. 

           CALLIE’S HOUSE

           They park a few houses down and TEENAGERS exit, dressed in 
           black.

           As they approach a particularly large house, BRAD (18, 
           football-handsome) looks up to an electric candle glowing in 
           the second-story window.

           Brad motions and the group begins to silently “roll” the 
           house, tossing rolls of toilet paper over the branches of the 
           trees.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. VARIOUS HOUSES

           Houses all over town get rolled, the rollers expending more 
           effort on some houses than others.

           From inside, younger teenagers watch from their windows, 
           proud and relieved.

           Inside one, a DISGRUNTLED DAD walks into his DAUGHTER’s room 
           and flips on her light.

                                 DISGRUNTLED DAD
                        What the hell are they doing??

                                 DAUGHTER
                             (flipping off the light)
                        Dad, shhhh!

           Dad sticks his head out the window as teens scatter.

                                 DISGRUNTLED DAD
                        Quit that right now! I’m gonna call 
                        the police!

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Dad, stop! It means I’m cool!

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE

           As they finish rolling, Brad blows a kiss to the window with 
           the electric candle, which flashes three times in reply.
           I/E. CALLIE’S BEDROOM

           CALLIE (17, Greek-American, one of the sparkly people) 
           crouches at her window, hand on the candle’s switch.

           As Brad turns and runs to the cars we pull out Callie’s 
           window, up, up, up to reveal a massive curtain of toilet 
           paper blowing in the wind, a more impressive “rolling” than 
           any we’ve seen.

           I/E. MINNIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           MINNIE’S ROOM

           MINNIE (17, one of the mousy people) sits at her window, 
           waiting. Her house is small, a beat-up Chevy Nova in the 
           driveway. 

           The branches of a lone dying tree sit bare and toilet paper-
           free. 

           Minnie’s clock reads 3:12am. She glances out the window with 
           increasing despair.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MINNIE’S ROOM - DAWN

           Minnie lies next to the window, asleep. 

           With a GROAN she wakes to the sound of two dogs BARKING from 
           down the hall. One yaps; the other’s vocal chords have been 
           cut- its barks sounds like a muted trumpet. 

           Minnie hears gentle THUDS outside. She peeks out the window.  
           The first light of dawn illuminates the yard.

           A FIGURE in a bulky coat and lion mask tries to roll the 
           dying tree.

           Minnie crawls quickly to her bedroom door and lets in the two 
           dogs.

                                 MINNIE
                             (whispering)
                        Shhhh, you guys are gonna fuck this 
                        up for me!

           She returns to the window, quieting them as a roll hits a 
           branch and ricochets, hitting the figure in the face.

                                 FIGURE
                        Ow!

           They lift their mask and rub their nose. Minnie cranes to 
           see, but the figure returns to rolling.
           It’s pathetic, but Minnie smiles nonetheless. The figure does 
           one last throw and sprints out of sight, the sound of a CAR 
           STARTING and DRIVING AWAY.

           The dogs start up again. A BABY CRIES from the next room.

                                 BARBARA (O.S.)
                             (from down the hall)
                        Minnie, why are the dogs barking?

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE- MORNING

           BARBARA (Minnie’s mom, 40’s, in a vet tech uniform) pops a 
           Pop Tart into the toaster. 

                                 BARBARA
                             (yelling down the hall)
                        You’re gonna be late!

           BATHROOM - MORNING

           Minnie brushes her teeth and looks at herself in the mirror.

                                 MINNIE
                             (pausing the brushing)
                        Hey, would you sign this? 

           She resumes brushing, then pauses again.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Sure, wanna sign mine?

           She holds a smile for a few seconds, then lets it drop. She 
           spits.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Barbara hurriedly feeds DUSTIN (two years old).

           Various adoption rejects are visible - a large rabbit with 
           one eye, two hissing cats, the two dogs who woke Minnie, and 
           a decrepit Great Dane who watches everything from a recliner 
           in a corner.

           Minnie sits amidst it all, staring at her pop tart.

                                 BARBARA
                        What kind of low-life scum would do 
                        that? 
                             (looking out the window)
                        It’s gonna be there for months, 
                        little bits of paper stuck in the 
                        branches for probably ever. Our 
                        house is gonna look trashy. 
           The house is trashy in every way. On the mantel sits a 
           “glamour shot” of a younger Minnie and Barbara with Texas-
           large hair, blue eye shadow and feather boas.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Clean it up before you go.

                                 MINNIE
                        ...I’m supposed to leave it up the 
                        whole day.
                             (off Barbara’s look)
                        It’s a tradition. On the last day 
                        of school, the seniors roll some of 
                        the juniors as like, a sign of 
                        respect.

                                 BARBARA
                        Only an asshole would do something 
                        mean and call it “respect.” 

                                 DUSTIN
                        “Ass-hole.”

                                 BARBARA
                        He gets it.

           Barbara clocks Minnie’s disappointment.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Just today. Tomorrow, it goes.

           A car HONKS outside. The dogs go crazy (except the Dane).

           I/E. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie opens the door to Donna Summer’s “Last Dance” blaring 
           from Callie’s car speakers. Callie, in effortlessly chic, 
           expensive clothes, does a celebratory dance in the yard. 

           The dogs jump all over her.

                                 CALLIE
                        Last day, bay-bee!

                                 MINNIE
                        Jasper, Roo, stop!

           Callie dances with them.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        They’re gonna get you all dirty.

           Callie dances on, pulling Minnie in and spinning her.

           Barbara steps out onto the porch, followed by Dustin in his 
           diaper.
                                 BARBARA
                             (to Callie)
                        Hey, it’s the star!

                                 CALLIE
                        Hey, Ms. Dunn! Hey, Dustin!

                                 BARBARA
                             (re: the toilet paper)
                        Can you believe this shit? Did they 
                        get your house, too?

                                 CALLIE
                        Not as much, I’m not as cool as 
                        Minnie.

                          MINNIE
           That’s not-
                                                         BARBARA
                                              That can’t be true, Minnie’s 
                                              cute, but she’s not-

           Minnie and Callie stare at Barbara, who catches herself.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Let me get a picture of you girls 
                        before you go.

                          MINNIE
                                                         CALLIE
           Mom, please.
                                              Ok!

           Barbara runs back inside the house. Callie clocks Minnie’s 
           silence.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re fucking gorgeous. Don’t ever 
                        forget it.

           Barbara reenters with a disposable camera.

                                 BARBARA
                        Big smiles!

           Callie throws her arm around Minnie. The camera flashes.  

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - DAY

           Callie’s SUV windows are covered in white painted messages: 
           “NLRHS Rising Senior!” and “Caution: Rising Senior on Board!”

           They pass house after house with toilet paper in its yard.

           A church’s billboard reads: “God Bless the class of 2002! 
           Jesus take their wheels!”
           HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT

           Callie turns into the parking lot of idling teens, music 
           blaring from all of their cars.

           They park and Minnie moves to get out.

                                 CALLIE
                        Hold on.

           She pulls out a sticky roller from the glove compartment. 
           Minnie realizes she’s covered in dog/cat/rabbit hair.

           Minnie self consciously rolls herself clean. Callie nods in 
           approval.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        Fuckin gorgeous.

           Callie hops out. Minnie takes a deep breath and follows.

           The crowd immediately envelopes Callie, Minnie just outside.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           VARIOUS CLASSROOMS

           On the TV Callie and Brad deliver the morning announcements:

                                 CALLIE
                        Good morning, Wildcats! I’m Callie 
                        King-

                                 BRAD
                        --and I’m Brad Hugg.

                                 CALLIE
                        Welcome to the final day of the 
                        school year!

           Classrooms school-wide erupt in CHEERS. 

                                 BRAD
                             (becoming solemn)
                        First, we’re sad to report the 
                        framed photo of Mr. McClendon’s 
                        mother that was taken from his desk 
                        is still at large. This photo is 
                        very meaningful to him, and he 
                        didn’t make any copies for some 
                        reason, so if you have any info 
                        please visit him in room 109.

           Now we see that Minnie is operating the camera. 

                                 BRAD
                        Now, since I’m graduating-

                                 CALLIE
                             (anchor banter)
                        Congrats, Brad.

                                 BRAD
                        Thanks, Callie. I’m off to 
                        Fayetteville next year. 
                             (raising his hands in the

                        Wooooo...

           VARIOUS CLASSROOMS 

           Students and teachers all over the school join, raising their 
           arms in the air.

                                 STUDENTS
                        Pig! Sooie! Razorbacks!

           TV PRODCUTION CLASSROOM

           Brad and other students snort like pigs. 

           Minnie stands behind the camera, unmoved. 

                                 BRAD
                             (looking at Callie)
                        Let me give you rising seniors some 
                        parting advice:
                             (serious, into the 
                              camera:)
                        Senior year is the best of your 
                        lives. 
                             (beat)
                        So fuckin’ live it up!

           Brad lunges and kisses Callie.

           VARIOUS CLASSROOMS

           Kids in every classroom hoot and holler.

           TV PRODUCTION CLASSROOM

           The TV PRODUCTION TEACHER (30s) cuts the broadcast. Brad 
           CACKLES. Callie wipes saliva from her mouth. 
           Minnie rolls her eyes, disgusted. Callie catches it, and 
           reddens. 

           DRAMA CLASSROOM - AN HOUR LATER

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (O.S.)
                        “I work, I feel, I move all the 
                        time. You stay put. You don’t 
                        really live. I make it a rule to 
                        never worry about the future. I 
                        don’t think about aging or dying. 
                        What will be, will be.”

           Photos of the school plays and musicals show Callie front and 
           center - Annie in Annie Get Your Gun, Mama Rose in Gypsy, and 
           (somewhat offensively) Anne in Anne Frank.

           Minnie can be seen in all of them, in the back - ensemble.

           MRS. MURDAUGH (50s, wild hair, serious glasses, an Arkansas 
           Tina Landau) stands at the front of the classroom next to a 
           somewhat yellowed wedding dress. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                             (pivoting to another 
                              character)
                        “And I, I drag my life along like a 
                        dress with an endless train. I feel 
                        a thousand years old--”
                             (pausing for effect)
                        “--and often, I wish I were dead.”

           She holds for a moment, then drops the character.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Who said that?

           Minnie timidly half-raises her hand.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Who is Anton Chekhov.

           Minnie lowers her hand.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        I have lent this dress, which was 
                        my wedding dress, to eleven 
                        different students. I have walked 
                        six students down the aisle and 
                        given eulogies at two funerals. And 
                        if any of you ever need, I will do 
                        the same for you. 

           Except for Minnie and Callie, the girls in the class are 
           rapt.
                                 MRS. MURDAUGH  (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t need to have children 
                        because I consider all of you my 
                        children. I love you as much as 
                        your own mothers-

           Ms. Murdaugh notices Minnie pulling a loose thread in her 
           shirt, which quickly turns into a hole.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                         Maybe even more in some cases...

           SCHOOL COURTYARD - LATER

           Callie and Minnie sit with CARA and BRANDI (17, the in-
           crowd).

                                 CARA
                        You know Mrs. Murdaugh was on 
                        Broadway? 

                                 BRANDI
                             (floored)
                        Stop.

                                 CARA
                        She was in Hello, Dolly! with Carol 
                        Channing, but she quit because it 
                        was too commercial. And I think she 
                        tore her meniscus. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Who’s Carol Channing?

           Cara looks at Brandi like “you philistine.”

                                 CARA
                        Comedian? She had her own show?

           Cara pulls her ear like Carol Burnett. Brandi reddens, 
           embarrassed at her own ignorance.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        I think Ms. Murdaugh’s an artist.

                                 CALLIE
                             (with a shrug)
                        I think she tries too hard.

           Cara and Brandi look at Callie, who takes a bite of her 
           sandwich. 

                                 BRANDI
                             (to Callie)
                        Will you sign my yearbook?

                                 CARA
                             (to Callie)
                        Sign mine when you’re done.
           The girls trade books. Cara opens Callie’s yearbook, pages 
           filled with long messages. Minnie almost asks Brandi to sign 
           her book, then chickens out.

           MATH CLASSROOM

           Minnie looks at the pages of her yearbook, which have just a 
           few short, generic messages: “Stay sweet!” MS. CLEMONS (40s, 
           a decade past burnout) hands out tests. Her shirt sports a 
           logo for “Siemens”. A COOL KID (17) snickers.

                                 COOL KID
                             (whispering to two buds)
                        Y’all see that Ms. C’ loves semen?

           The class chuckles. Ms. Clemons shakes her head.

                                 MS. CLEMONS
                        Mr. Hollis, I think I’ll miss you 
                        most of all.
                             (to the class)
                        You have one hour. 

           Minnie looks down at the test of complex math equations, x’s 
           and y’s. 

                                 MS. CLEMONS (CONT'D)
                             (under her breath)
                        Good luck, dip shits.

           Pencils start to scratch. 

           At Ms. Clemons desk, a giant calendar shows the final day of 
           school circled in red. She pulls out a sailing magazine and 
           begins to read.

           MATH CLASSROOM - LATER

           Minnie finishes the last question and smiles to herself. She 
           fucking killed it. She turns to look at the rest of the 
           class, still working. She sees that Callie is flushed, 
           frustrated and panicked. 

           Minnie glances at Ms. Clemons, busy tearing a picture of a 
           particularly grand sailboat out of the magazine.

           Minnie slides her finished test into Callie’s line of sight. 

           Callie shakes her head. Minnie nods and pushes the test 
           closer. 

                                 CALLIE
                             (whispering)
                        I want to do it myself.

                                 MS. CLEMONS
                        Miss King?
                             (noticing Callie’s tears)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MS. CLEMONS (CONT'D)
                                 MS. CLEMONS (CONT'D)
                        I’ve seen you do enough fake crying  
                        onstage to last a lifetime. Try 
                        using your brain for once.

           Callie tuns even brighter red.

           MATH CLASSROOM - END OF CLASS

           Callie is the last to finish. The Cool Kid starts a countdown 
           to the end of the school year.

                                 COOL KID
                        Ten! Nine!

                                 ALL STUDENTS
                        Eight! Seven!

                                 MS. CLEMONS
                             (bellowing)
                        Quiet!

           The class quiets. Minnie looks at Callie’s test. She’s on the 
           last problem and Minnie sees it’s the correct answer. Callie 
           looks up a smiles at Minnie.

           Suddenly it’s 3pm. The BELL RINGS and students pour out of 
           the classroom, dropping off their tests as they go.

           Ms. Clemons looks at Callie and Minnie’s tests side by side.

                                 MS. CLEMONS (CONT'D)
                             (to Callie)
                        Hm. Unless you’ve had a recent 
                        brain transplant, there’s no way 
                        you did this on your own. 

                                 CALLIE
                        I didn’t cheat...

                                 MINNIE
                        She didn’t. She studied really 
                        hard.

                                 MS. CLEMONS
                             (to Minnie)
                        Miss Dunn, at some point you’re 
                        going to have to develop a 
                        personality of your own...and 
                        realize when you’re being used. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The parking lot is flooded with celebration. Minnie walks 
           slightly behind Callie then stops, watching Callie walk on 
           without her.

           As Callie reaches her car she turns and notices Minnie’s 
           absence.
                                 CALLIE
                             (calling to Minnie)
                        Come on!

           Minnie rushes to the car, and as they drive away, cars file 
           in behind them.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Cars full of TEENAGERS speed down the roads. 

           They pass each other, blaring music, some hanging out the car 
           windows, some mooning each other. Reckless jubilation. 

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They pull into the driveway amidst a sea of other cars and 
           are greeted by HELEN (40s, Callie’s mom, Greek American and 
           the only person in this movie without an Arkansas accent). 

           MARK (40’s, Callie’s dad) stands on a ladder propped against 
           the house, painting Allie’s window frame.

           He climbs down and receives bro hugs from Brad and other 
           boys. 

           FRONT ROOM/KITCHEN

           The house bustles with VOICES and energy. Teens eat snacks 
           and gossip with Helen, who thrives.

           Minnie, on the outskirts, tries to look occupied by scanning 
           photos on the mantel: Callie on homecoming court, in dance 
           recital outfits, and singing in a spotlight onstage.

           There’s a family photo in matching white linen on a sandy 
           beach and a giant abstract self-portrait of Callie, and it’s 
           really fucking good.

           Minnie turns and notices Helen and Callie mid argument. 
           Callie holds a can of red bull. Helen speaks to Callie in 
           Greek, Callie speaks back in English.

           Mark carries a twenty four pack of beer through the back 
           door. He puts an arm around Callie, taking her side. 

           Callie storms off. Minnie watches Helen and Mark have a 
           moment of strained disagreement. 

           Brad breaks the spell by playfully punching Mark. Mark puts 
           him in a headlock.  

                                 MARK
                             (holding up the beer)
                        All right everybody, these are just 
                        for adults.

                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                        So if any of them go missing, I’m 
                        gonna assume adults took them.

           He winks (he’s a winker) and the party LAUGHS and CHEERS. 
           Minnie watches Helen’s smile drop and turns to find Callie in 
           a corner.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Callie)
                        You ok?

                                 CALLIE
                        My mom’s just like, she sees the 
                        danger in everything. She hates 
                        when I have caffeine ‘cause I had a 
                        heart murmur when I was a baby-

           Callie chugs the rest of the can.

                                 MINNIE
                        I thought you hate Red Bull.

           Callie cracks open another can and chugs, eyeing Helen 
           defiantly. Helen looks away. 

           BACKYARD - HOURS LATER

           The teenagers hit the slip and slide. It’s a blast and 
           totally unsafe. Wet bodies and lots of feelings about wet 
           bodies.  

           The teens CHANT for Mark to go down the slide. He does, 
           sweeping Brad’s feet as he goes by. 

           Brad does a scary flip in the air and lands on his neck. 
           Everyone GASPS and they wait for Brad to stand back up.

                                 BRAD
                             (hopping up)
                        I’m good!

           The crowd CHEERS as Mark and Brad high five. Helen picks up 
           her glass and takes a long sip.

           SIDEYARD  - NIGHT

           The guys play basketball with Mark.

           BASEMENT/DANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Music plays and the girls practice a choreographed, 
           occasionally sexual dance in front of a mirror wall. Minnie 
           sits in a corner.

           Mark and the boys enter the basement, shirtless and sweaty. 
           Cara and Brandi eye Mark’s toned body.
                                 MARK
                        All right, ladies, time to say 
                        goodnight to the fellas.

           They say goodbye, some couples cuddling, others pointedly 
           ignoring each other.

                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                             (approaching Minnie)
                        Don’t you have a boyfriend yet?

                                 MINNIE
                        Ha. No.

                                 MARK
                             (all innocence)
                        I just can’t understand that.

           He winks and walks away. Minnie blushes, flattered and 
           unsettled.

           BASEMENT/DANCE ROOM - LATER

           The girls sit in a circle.

                                 CARA
                             (mid-explanation)
                        Ok, so the way this works is we 
                        pick one person, and we go around 
                        taking turns giving them personal 
                        feedback.

                                 GIRL
                        What kind of feedback?

                                 CARA
                        Like, things you like about them, 
                        or things that aren’t serving them 
                        anymore.

                                 GIRL
                        Like bad things?

                                 CARA
                        I’ll go first. What’s some feedback 
                        you can give me?

           Silence.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        The most respectful thing you can 
                        do is be honest.

                                                                CUT TO:
           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The feedback circle has become a bloodbath. Should be 
           improvised and messy, quick cuts of girls annihilating each 
           other. 

           Cara sits in the middle.

                                 CALLIE
                        You’re pretentious.

                                 CARA
                        Expound.

                                 CALLIE
                        You gave Brandi crap for not 
                        knowing Carol Channing, but this?
                             (she pulls her ear)
                        Is Carol Burnett.

                             (emboldened)
                        And you’re a suck up.

                                                          CARA
           Totally.
                                              To who??

                                 GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Ms. Murdaugh.

                                 CARA
                        I admire her.

                                 GIRL
                        No, you want to be the lead. 

                                 GIRL 2
                        But that ain’t gonna happen.

                                 CARA
                             (sincerely hurt)
                        Why not? 

           Everyone looks at Callie. Strained silence. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Callie’s sits in the hot seat:

                                 BRANDI
                        Your hair is perfect, and you’re 
                        dating, like, Brad, and y’all are 
                        probably gonna get married, and 
                        you’re the most talented person in 
                        the school, but you’re also really 
                        nice and likable-

           Cara glares at Brandi.
                                 BRANDI (CONT'D)
                             (self-correcting)
                        --and that’s really unlikable. 

                                 CARA
                             (with the pointed 
                              resentment)
                        You’re not as perfect as you think 
                        you are. 

                                 CALLIE
                        I don’t think-

                                 CARA
                        Just absorbing. 

           Callie shuts up.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        You signed the true love waits 
                        contract at church, but I know Brad 
                        fingered you after Sadie Hawkins, 
                        and any kind of penetration counts.

                                 BRANDI
                        Not any.
                             (beat)
                        Not the...butt...

           All the girls stare at Brandi. She shrinks.

           Callie looks around, relieved.

                                 CARA
                        And you’re not very smart.

           This hits Callie hard. She begins to well up and looks to 
           Minnie for help. Minnie, too scared to speak, looks at the 
           floor.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        Ok, I’m bored with this.

                                 CALLIE
                             (deflecting)
                        Minnie didn’t go.

           Everyone looks at Minnie, remembering her presence. Minnie 
           looks at Callie, betrayed.

           Cara focuses on Minnie, tilts her head, and takes a 
           preparatory inhalation of breath.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Minnie sits alone in Callie’s room, crying on her bed. 

                                 CALLIE (O.S.)
                        Cara’s an asshole. 
           Minnie stifles her tears. Callie sits on the bed. Everything 
           in her room is varying shades of green, Callie’s favorite 
           color.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s not very Christian, but 
                        I seriously wish she would burn to 
                        death in a fiery explosion.

                                 MINNIE
                        She’s right. About me.

                                 CALLIE
                        You’re just shy.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t actually think I am. Just 
                        in comparison...

           Beat.

                                 CALLIE
                        I don’t feel like I’m the person 
                        they described. 

                                 MINNIE
                        You did get fingered at Sadie 
                        Hawkins.

                                 CALLIE
                             (frustrated)
                        That’s, like, the least interesting  
                        thing about me. I have plans. 
                             (off Minnie’s look)
                        I do.

                                 MINNIE
                        Like what? 

                          CALLIE
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
           Like-
                                              Going to the same state 
                                              school as everybody else? 

                          CALLIE (CONT'D)
           Hey, snob-
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
                                              Coming back to high school 
                                              parties on weekends?

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        That state school’s where I can get 
                        in.

           Minnie quiets, shamed.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                             (rallying)
                        But then. I go to New York. And I 
                        struggle. And live on nothing but 
                        ramen in a tiny studio apartment.

           Minnie glances around at the huge room and scoffs.
                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        And I’m like an understudy in a 
                        medium-big-deal show, and nobody 
                        knows who I am, nobody gives a crap 
                        about me. I’m the only one who 
                        knows I’m special. I’m mother- 
                        freakin’ it.

           Minnie understands this on a deep level. 

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        Then one day, I get the call: the 
                        star’s broken her hand. 

                                 MINNIE
                             (like, “so?”)
                        Her hand?

                                 CALLIE
                        Her foot. She’s lost a leg.

           Minnie laughs in spite of herself.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        So it’s up to me. It’s my time. And 
                        all the big wigs are like, “we 
                        can’t put her on, who the hell is 
                        she?” I say, “I can do it.” But 
                        inside, I’m terrified.

           Callie stands on the bed, Minnie looking up at her.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        And I step out onto the stage. I’m 
                        shaking. Everyone’s holding their 
                        breath-

           She pauses for dramatic effect. 

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        -and I. Am. Mesmerizing. That was 
                        me all along, ya know? After that-
                             (she snaps her fingers)
                        -I do one Broadway show, then 
                        another, and the Tony nominations 
                        roll in. 

           Callie basks in the thought.

                                 MINNIE
                        What about me?

           Beat.

                                 CALLIE
                        You’re at every opening night and 
                        awards show as my forever date.

           The bubble is burst for Minnie.
                                 MINNIE
                        You ever worry you’re just high 
                        school good? And that’s not gonna 
                        be true anywhere else? 

           Callie looks at Minnie. 

                                 CALLIE
                        There’s nothing wrong with wanting 
                        a big life.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to herself)
                        I think I’m gonna have a small one

           Callie lies down in bed next to her, both of them looking at 
           a ceiling full of glow-in-the dark stars.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        My mom says I’m going to find 
                        myself in college, that’s what 
                        people like me do.

                                 CALLIE
                        Well, you don’t have to wait ‘til 
                        then.

           Callie shakes Minnie. 

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        Come on! We have one year left 
                        together before you leave to go to 
                        some smarty-pants school and forget 
                        all about me. We gotta fuckin’ live 
                        it up.

                                 MINNIE
                        I could never forget you. 

           Callie smiles. Minnie looks at Callie.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        You take up too much space.

           Callie’s smile fades, genuinely hurt. She waits for Minnie to 
           apologize. Minnie stares at the ceiling. Callie puts her 
           retainer in and rolls over. Minnie almost says more, but 
           doesn’t.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Minnie wakes, Callie still asleep, turned away from her. 
           Minnie quietly grabs her bag.
           INT. HALLWAY

           Minnie stands at the top of the stairs, a sea of sleeping 
           girls in sleeping bags visible below: a minefield. She takes 
           one careful step, and the stair CREAKS. Cara stirs, and 
           Minnie retreats back into the room.

           INT. CALLIE’S ROOM

           Minnie stands in Callie’s room feeling trapped. She spies 
           Mark’s ladder from yesterday still propped against the 
           window.

           INT. BASEMENT/DANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Over more girls in sleeping bags, Minnie’s feet climbing down 
           the ladder are visible out the window.

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Helen jogs up, returning from a run. She sees Minnie climbing 
           down the ladder.

                                 HELEN
                             (calling out)
                        Minnie? Be careful!

           Minnie, startled, slips on the last few rungs and lands on 
           her tailbone, hard. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Shit! 

           Helen runs up, worried.

                           HELEN
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
           You all right??
                                              Sorry. I’m fine.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I told Mark not to leave this here, 
                        somebody’s gonna break their neck.

           Helen helps Minnie stand.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Why didn’t you use the front door?

                                 MINNIE
                        I just wanted to...slip away.

           Helen looks at Minnie pityingly. Minnie sees it, and hates 
           it.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m late to help my mom.
                                 HELEN
                             (good-naturedly)
                        A helpful daughter. I can only 
                        imagine. 

           Minnie smiles politely then starts to limp away.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Want a ride?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m good!

           Helen watches Minnie go, a large grass stain visible on her 
           butt. 

           I/E. STRIP MALL - VETERINARY CLINIC - MORNING

           Minnie enters the front door of a small veterinary clinic.

           Inside, Barbara talks on the phone at the front desk. She 
           waves to Minnie who doesn’t wave back.

           KENNELS

           Minnie sprays out the kennels and picks up piles of dog poop. 

           ADOPTION CENTER

           Minnie feeds a caged bird. It pecks her repeatedly.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - DISCOVERY ZONE - DAY

           She walks out of the clinic, passes a few storefronts and 
           arrives outside an off-brand Discovery Zone.

           INT. DISCOVERY ZONE - BALL PIT 

           In lumpy khakis and a polo Minnie stands in a colorful ball 
           pit surrounded by SCREAMING KIDS. They throw balls at her 
           head. She blows a WHISTLE to no effect.

           LATER

           After closing, Minnie loads colored balls into big mesh bags. 
           She stops when she sees a child’s turd amongst the balls. She 
           finds a paper towel and disposes of the turd.

           CLEANING ROOM

           Minnie sprays down the bags with a big hose.
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DUSK

           Minnie walks home from work. The Cool Kid from Ms. Clemons 
           class jogs by, shirtless. He stares at Minnie as he passes, 
           then doubles back.

                                 COOL KID
                        Hey!

           Minnie looks to see who he’s greeting. She shocked to see 
           it’s her.

                                 COOL KID (CONT'D)
                        You’re Callie’s friend, right?

           She turns, frustrated, and walks away.

                                 COOL KID (CONT'D)
                             (calling after)
                        ...Just wanted to say sorry, or 
                        whatever!

           Off Minnie, turning back...

           EXT. CALLIE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Minnie runs, out of breath, and turns the corner to see 
           Callie’s front yard in the distance where twenty TEENS AND 
           ADULTS, including Cara and Brandi, are assembled. She freezes 
           when she sees that most of the people are crying.

           We track her as she walks through the front yard past small 
           groups of people. We/She hear whispered, “hospital,” 
           “accident,” etc.

           INT. CALLIE'S HOUSE

           Minnie enters the kitchen past two neighborhood moms, BETH 
           AND DIANE (40s), red-eyed. They stop talking when they see 
           Minnie.

                                 MINNIE
                        Did something happen to Mrs. King?

           The women look at each other.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        ..Or...is Mr. King...ok?

           Beat.

                                 BETH
                        Your Callie’s best friend, aren’t 
                        you? Didn’t anybody call?

           Minnie stands in silence.
                                 DIANE
                        I’m so sorry, hon. Callie...passed. 
                        It happened a few hours ago.

           Beat.

                                 BETH
                             (quietly)
                        Always, always wear your seatbelt, 
                        hon.

                                 DIANE
                        Beth, can you not? 

                                                          DIANE (CONT'D)
                           BETH 
           What, she should!
                                              It sounds like you’re 
                                              blaming.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        I’m not blaming-

                                                          DIANE
                           BETH (CONT'D)
                                              -let’s just...
           -she just might have 
           survived.

           Diane resets, and turns back to Minnie.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        The doctors said she passed 
                        instantly, the moment she was 
                        thrown from the car. So at least 
                        that’s...something.

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE

           Minnie walks down the porch stairs and through the front 
           yard. We hear snippets of whispered CONVERSATION as she 
           passes:

                                 SUBURBAN DAD
                        I’m just grateful she was alone.

                                 SUBURBAN MOM
                             (re: her daughter beside 
                              her)
                        Crystal said she was supposed to go 
                        with her, but she changed her mind 
                        at the last second. And that’s God, 
                        sweetie. God saved you.

           And:

                                 CARA
                        She was such a good friend. 

                                 BRANDI
                        The best.
                                 CARA
                        ...but she was my actual best 
                        friend.

           The walk to the sidewalk seems endless.

                                 YOUNG MOM 1
                        Is there anyone else we need to 
                        call?

                                 YOUNG MOM 2
                        I think we got everyone.

           Minnie reaches the edge of the grass just as Mark and Helen 
           pull into the driveway and exit the car. They’re escorted 
           inside, and the yard is suddenly empty, the front door 
           closed.

           Minnie sees that Callie’s bedroom window is dark - the 
           electric candle unlit.

           INT. MINNIE'S HOUSE - LATER

           Barbara feeds Dustin at his high chair as Minnie enters. 
           Barbara notices Minnie’s blank demeanor.

                                 BARBARA
                        What crawled up your butt and died?

           Minnie stares at Barbara and then goes to her bedroom, 
           shutting the door. Barbara resumes feeding Dustin.

           MINNIE’S ROOM

           Minnie lays on her bed. The house phone RINGS.

           LIVING ROOM

           Barbara stands, phone to her ear, hand over her mouth.

                                 BARBARA
                             (whispering)
                        Oh my God. Oh my God. 

           She looks toward Minnie’s closed door. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        ...her poor mother.

           MINNIE’S ROOM/HALLWAY INTERCUT

           Minnie lies on her bed.

                                 BARBARA (O.S.)
                        Minnie?
           Silence.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to say...

           She pauses. Wants to apologize. Instead:

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry about walking the dogs 
                        tonight. I can do that. Or we could 
                        walk ‘em together. 
                             (beat)
                        You just let me know.

           Minnie stares at the ceiling.

           EXT. CHURCH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The parking lot is full of cars. People of all ages file into 
           the church as Barbara’s Chevy Nova pulls up. Minnie, Barbara 
           and Dustin join the throng of mourners.

           Cara hands out purple angel-wings pins at the door.

                                 BARBARA
                             (re: the pin)
                        What’s this?

                                 CARA
                        It’s for Callie, ‘cause she was an 
                        angel on earth, and now she’s one 
                        in heaven. And purple was her 
                        favorite color.

           She hands a pin to Minnie. As they walk in, Minnie stares at 
           it, despising it. 

           INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           A sea of purple angel pins amongst the dark clothing. A 
           closed casket in front of the alter. 

           Helen, Mark, and MARK’S PARENT’S lead the receiving line.

           A few pews seem reserved for Callie’s schoolmates.

                                 BARBARA
                             (whispering)
                        Sit with your friends. We’ll be 
                        back here.

           Barbara watches as Minnie sits silently on the aisle.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Mark stands at the lectern behind a smiling photo of Callie.
                                 MARK
                        For something we never thought we’d 
                        have to plan, I think this turned 
                        out pretty nice. I have some 
                        thoughts I’d like to read, but 
                        first, some of Callie’s friends put 
                        together a slide show. We’re going 
                        show that now. 

           A slideshow of Callie through the years, her friends and her 
           achievements, begins. There’s a photo of Callie as a baby 
           being baptized in a Greek church, Helen smiling, and later, a 
           photo of Callie being “saved” as a teenager in the hip Church 
           we’re in now, Mark smiling. 

           There are many photos of Cara and Brandi with Callie, with 
           Minnie in the background of just a few. 

           Minnie turns to the MALE COUSIN (14) next to her with a 
           whisper.

                                 MINNIE
                        When did they collect pictures for 
                        this?

           A GIRL (13) a few seats over SHUSHES Minnie.

           The slideshow ends with swooping script: “Callie, an angel on 
           earth and now in heaven.” Minnie cringes and glances over at 
           Helen, who hasn’t been watching any of it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Pastor (60s) stands at the pulpit.

                                 PASTOR
                        We cry out for human understanding, 
                        we beg God to tell us why. 

           Mark nods his head throughout. Helen does not.

                                 PASTOR (CONT'D)
                        And in response to our desperate 
                        human questioning, sorrow, and even 
                        anger, because I’m angry, 
                        too...boy, am I angry. God 
                        whispers, “Trust.” God makes no 
                        mistakes.

           Various testimonials are given into a handheld mic:

                                 CARA
                        Callie never said a negative word 
                        about anybody. 

           Minnie stares daggers at Cara.
                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        She was an angel on earth, pure and 
                        perfect, and everyone’s best 
                        friend. I know she was mine.

                        student, in the history of the

                        the lead in the musical as a 
                        freshman.

           Minnie watches Helen, impassive.

                        It was the last picture of my mom 
                        and me that was ever taken. 
                        And...anyway. Callie returned it to 
                        me. Even though I know she wasn’t 
                        the one who took it. Even though we 
                        weren’t particularly close. I think 
                        she knew it was meaningful to me. 
                        And I think small acts like that, 
                        when no one is looking, when you 
                        won’t get any credit, show you who 
                        a person is. And of course, 
                        everyone could see how impressive 
                        Callie was in a lot of obvious 
                        ways. But my impression is that she 
                        was also just, quietly good. 

           Mr. McClendon hands the mic back.

           I/E. BARBARA’S CHEVY NOVA - BEGIN FLASHBACK

           Barbara’s Nova sits stopped at a green light on a very steep 
           hill. Callie sits patiently beside Minnie.

           Minnie tries to operate the stick shift, many cars lined up 
           behind her, HONKING; an ANGRY BMW DRIVER yells openly. 

           Every time she tries to accelerate she slides backward a few 
           more terrifying feet, precariously close to hitting a BMW 
           behind her.

                                 MINNIE
                             (panicked)
                        I can’t do this.

                                 CALLIE
                        Yes, you can. 

                                                         CALLIE (CONT'D)
                          MINNIE
                 (waving out the window)
                                              Clutch down-
           Go around! Go around!

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Switch seats, drive for me.

                                 CALLIE
                        No, you got this!

                                 MINNIE
                             (with tears in her eyes)
                        Please!

           Callie stares at Minnie then jumps out of the car.

           She unbuckles her seatbelt but stops when she sees in the 
           rearview:

           Callie has put her body between Minnie’s car and the BMW.

                                 CALLIE
                        Back up, everybody! 

                          MINNIE
                                                         CALLIE (CONT'D)
           What are you doing??
                                              We’ll all be moving in a 
                                              second, if you just back up!

                                 ANGRY BMW DRIVER
                        Learn how to drive!

                                 CALLIE
                        Fucking working on it!

           The honking drivers slowly back up. Callie remains between.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                        Ok, Minnie. Go!

           Minnie shuts her eyes and puts the car into gear. 
           The Nova sails back a few feet, nearly hitting Callie, then 
           lunges forward, accelerating up the hill.

           Minnie opens her eyes in disbelief/exaltation.

           Callie runs to catch up to the still-moving Nova and jumps 
           in. They cheer and Callie throws her arms around Minnie who 
           hugs her back.

                                 CALLIE (CONT'D)
                             (joyfully)
                        Hands on the wheel!

           INT. CHURCH - END FLASHBACK/PRESENT DAY

           Minnie sees Helen looking back at her. Minnie looks away.

                                 PASTOR
                        Ok, then. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Two TEEN GIRLS sing “For Good” from Wicked as Mrs. Murdaugh 
           conducts, occasionally wiping away tears. At moments they get 
           a little too fancy, riffing where they shouldn’t.

           The congregation stands as the PALL BEARERS, including Mark 
           and Brad, carry the casket down the aisle and out of the 
           church. Callie’s grandparents trail behind.

           Barbara watches Helen pass, tears in her eyes.

           EXT. CALLIE'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

           Barbara pulls up as mourners mill around and arrive. She 
           turns back to look at Dustin. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Smells like he’s got a dirty 
                        diaper. Can you get a ride home?

                                 MINNIE
                        Sure.

           Minnie steps out of the car. Barbara makes eye contact with 
           Helen, who absently nods along to a conversation.

           I/E. CALLIE'S HOUSE

           Minnie inside, uncertain who to talk to. She sees Mark 
           telling a story, surrounded by rapt teenagers.

           BACKYARD

           More cliques have formed outside. Minnie walks by everyone.
           SIDEYARD

           Minnie paces, feeling trapped. 

           She sees the ladder still propped against Callie’s window. 
           She considers climbing up. Instead, she takes the purple pin 
           and throws it in the trash. She looks up to see Helen 
           watching her.

           FRONT YARD

           Helen watches Minnie walk through the front yard, onto the 
           sidewalk and down the street, away from the house.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE BACK UP ON:

           INT. THERAPIST OFFICE

           Helen sits across from JENNIFER (30’s, looks 18, eager). 
           Helen stares into a small trashcan where an accumulation of a 
           previous client’s mascara stained tissues have been 
           discarded.

                                 JENNIFER
                        How long ago was the accident?

                                 HELEN
                        It was May 24th. So six weeks.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Recent. I’m sure time feels very 
                        strange.
                             (beat)
                        How have you been feeling? And FYI, 
                        in here you’re not allowed to say 
                        “fine” or “ok.”

                                 HELEN
                        Ok.

           Jennifer chuckles. Helen wasn’t making a joke. 

           Helen spots an exceptionally realistic looking baby doll 
           sticking out of a box under Jennifer’s desk.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Right about now is the time when 
                        all the attention disappears, and 
                        things can get very quiet. A new 
                        reality starts to set in.
           Helen refocuses on Jennifer, not having heard her last 
           statement.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        How’s your support system?

                                 HELEN
                        My parents died a few years ago-

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HELEN
                        -at the time I thought that was 
                        hard.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well. With losing a parent, at 
                        least that’s in the right order.

           Helen glances back at the doll.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        Other family?

                                 HELEN
                        Extended. All back in Greece.

           Jennifer makes a note.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Friends?

                                 HELEN
                        We have friends at the church, or 
                        other moms who volunteer at the 
                        school. I moved here for Mark, so 
                        most of our friends are more-

                                 JENNIFER
                        Mark’s your husband?

                                 HELEN 
                             (deflecting)
                        I’m sorry, what is that?

           Jennifer looks to the doll.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oopsie.

           Jennifer takes the box and puts it in the closet, half 
           closing the door.
                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        That’s from my previous session. 
                        Some grieving parents find it 
                        helpful, to be able to hold it. Say 
                        anything they didn’t get to say.

           Jennifer returns to her seat. Helen can’t help but look at a 
           sliver of the doll’s face looking back at her through a crack 
           in the door. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        It’s mostly for parents of very 
                        young children. We won’t be using 
                        that with you.

                                 HELEN
                        Is there a restroom I could use?

           EXT. THERAPIST PARKING LOT- DAY

           Helen walks through the parking lot quickly, gets in her car 
           and drives away.

           INT. HELEN’S CAR/EXT. CEMETARY- DAY

           Helen drives through cemetery gates. She slows when she sees, 
           in the distance, Minnie sitting at Callie’s gravesite.

           Helen stops the car behind a tree and watches for a moment. 
           She sees that Minnie is writing a letter several pages long. 

           After a beat, Minnie stands, folds the letter, and hides it 
           under a rock near the headstone. 

           Minnie walks toward the cemetery exit, unaware of Helen.

           Helen pulls close to the gravesite, where new grass has begun 
           to grow, the headstone newly placed: “Caliope Stathos King. 
           Beloved daughter, granddaughter, friend.” 

           Helen removes yesterday’s flowers, and places fresh ones in a 
           stone vase. She spots Minnie’s letter peeking out under a 
           rock. She glances back to where Minnie exited. She picks up 
           the letter. She reads.

           INT. MINNIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Minnie walks inside, dogs jumping all over her. 

                                 MINNIE
                             (calling)
                        Mom?
           She fills the dog bowls with food and fresh water and lets 
           the rabbit out of its pen. It leaps around the kitchen as the 
           PHONE RINGS.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                             (into the receiver)
                        Hello?

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        Minnie? This is Helen.

           Minnie freezes.

                       HELEN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                                                         MINNIE
           ...Callie’s Mom.
                                              Hi.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, I know...

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        How’ve you been, how was your 
                        fourth?

                                 MINNIE
                             (looking at the high 
                              strung dogs)
                        Oh, we don’t really celebrate.

           Beat. 

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        I was wondering if you might want 
                        to come over for dinner tomorrow. 
                        We’re inviting a few of Callie’s 
                        friends. Mark and I thought it 
                        might be nice! It’s been a little 
                        quiet...

           Off Minnie, immediately nervous.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Minnie, Brad, Cara, Mark, and Helen sit, eating. There is way 
           too much food on the table, both Papa John’s pizza and a full 
           home-cooked spread.

                                 BRAD
                             (answering a question)
                        ...Britney Spears, Christina 
                        Aguilera, Jessica Alba. 

                           MARK
           Ok, I think I know who all 
           those people are...
                                                          CARA
                                              Come on, we have to pick guys 
                                              at some point!

                           BRAD
                                                          HELEN
                 (to Cara)
           Pick guys on your turn.
                                              How old are those girls? 
                                              Aren’t they like--
                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        --they’re over 18. 

                                 CARA
                        How do you know?

                                 BRAD
                        There’s a website.

                           HELEN
                                                          CARA
           There is??
                                              You’re disgusting.

                                 MARK
                        Okay, I got it. Kill Britney 
                        Spears...

                           BRAD
                                                          CARA
           Obviously.
                                              No! Marry her! She’s so 
                                              sweet, and she’s waiting ‘til 
                                              she’s married to-

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        There’s no way true.

                                 HELEN
                        I think we should change games.

                                 MARK
                        Marry Jessica Alba.

                                 BRAD
                        Agreed.

                                 MARK
                             (with relish)
                        And screw-

                                 HELEN
                        Can we at least find a different 
                        word? 

                                 BRAD
                        Um, the actual word is a lot worse, 
                        so-

                                 MARK
                        Come on, honey, everybody here’s an 
                        adult.

                                 HELEN
                        No they’re not.

                                 CARA
                        I will be in two months!

           Brad holds out a hand for Mark to high five.

                                 MARK
                        I’d make love to--
                                                          MARK (CONT'D)
                           HELEN
           “Kiss.” Call it “Kiss, Marry, 
           Shove,” we shouldn’t be 
           talking about killing them, 
           either--
                                              --honey, it’s a game. We’re 
                                              not going to do any of those 
                                              things to those nice young 
                                              ladies, it’s an intellectual 
                                              exercise.
                                                (to Brad)
                                              Christina Aguilera!

                           BRAD
                                                          CARA
                 (to Paul)
           Correct. Across the board, 
           correct.
                                              I’d marry Britney for her 
                                              values, and kill Christina 
                                              ‘cause she’s a skank.

                                 MARK
                        What do you think, Minnie?

           Everyone looks at Minnie.

                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                        You can’t just watch, you gotta 
                        play. 

                                 BRAD
                        Yeah, who would you screw?

           Helen eyes Mark, all innocent playfulness. After a beat:

                                 MINNIE
                        Christina. For sure.

                           MARK
           ...and there it is.
                                                          BRAD
                                              Whoa! From the quiet one in 
                                              the back!

                                 CARA
                        Ew, she has a song all about how 
                        dirty she is.

                                 BRAD
                             (to Cara)
                        Ding ding, Cara, that’s the point.

                                 HELEN
                        Okay, game officially over.

           FOYER - LATER

           The teens put on their shoes. Helen closes the lids to 
           Tupperware.

                                 MARK
                        One game of horse before you go. 

                                 BRAD
                        Naw, I’ll kick your butt next time.
                                 HELEN
                        Take some spanikopita and dolmadas 
                        with you. Minnie, would your mom 
                        like moussaka? 

                                 MARK
                        (with an amiable edge)
                        English, honey. No one can 
                        understand you. 

           Mark smiles at the kids. Minnie clocks Helen’s embarrassment. 
           The kids start to walk out the door. 

                                 HELEN
                        Actually...before you all go, I 
                        have something I’d like show you. 
                        Or have you listen to.

           Mark visibly tenses. Helen opens a drawer.

                                 MARK 
                             (quietly, to Helen)
                        I thought we weren’t going to do 
                        this now. 

                                 HELEN
                        But everyone’s all here.

                           HELEN (CONT'D)
           When’s that going to happen 
           again?
                                                          MARK
                                              It’s been such a good night. 
                                              Let them go home.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Five minutes. Please.
                             (to the kids)
                        Five minutes.

           Helen pulls out a blank CD. The teens freeze, unsure of what 
           to do.

           LIVING ROOM

           Helen sits across from the teenagers, watching them closely. 
           Mark stands in the doorway, half out of the room. A recorded 
           scene plays over the sound system.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        I see that you didn’t get to say 
                        goodbye.

           Beat.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        That’s right. It was a car 
                        accident. 

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        There was someone else in the car 
                        with her?
                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        No...

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Or, another driver who caused-?

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        We don’t know exactly what 
                        happened. She might have gotten 
                        distracted, I know she plays her 
                        music too loud. But she lost 
                        control. She hit the median.

           Beat.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        I’m seeing her surrounded by many 
                        friends.

           Helen looks hopefully at Cara and Minnie.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        She knew she was well loved.
                             (beat)
                        She’s telling me...Was there a 
                        person in her life who’s name 
                        started with the letter “B”?

           Brad’s eyes go wide.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Her boyfriend. Brad.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        She wants me to tell him she sees 
                        him. She’s still with him.

           Brad drops his head.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Now I’m getting...is there a 
                        “Sarah?” 

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        ...There’s a Sarah in her class, 
                        but-

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Or “Laura?” “Hannah?” Something 
                        with an “A”?

                                 CARA
                             (whispering)
                        Cara.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Cara?

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        That’s it.
           Cara gasps.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Callie’s waving to her.

           Cara does a tiny near-unconscious wave back.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Did she have siblings?

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        No. We wanted to, but-

                                 MALE  PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        -someone like a sibling?

           Beat.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Minnie? 

           Helen looks at Minnie intently. Minnie reddens under her 
           gaze.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        She’s saying...Minnie....Minnie... 
                        Minnie Mouse? Did Callie ever call 
                        her that?

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        I don’t know.

                                 HELEN
                             (to Minnie, intensely)
                        Did she?

           A beat, then Minnie nods and Helen tears up happily, 
           relieved. Minnie shrinks further into the couch.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Do you think I could talk to her? 

           Helen stands and heads toward the CD player.

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Of course. What would you like to 
                        say?

           Helen presses STOP. She turns and looks at Minnie.

                                 HELEN
                        You see?

           EXT. CALLIE'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           The three teens wave goodbye as Helen and Mark close the 
           front door. As Cara and Brad walk down the front path, Minnie 
           looks back at the house.
                                 CARA
                        K, well, I’m never doing that 
                        again. 

                                 BRAD
                        It was fine, Cara.

                                 CARA
                        Mark was fine, but Mrs. King? It’s 
                        like, when she looks at me she 
                        needs something. Like, what do you 
                        want, lady?

           Cara and Brad get in their cars. 

                                 BRAD (O.S.)
                        Minnie, you want a ride?

                                 CARA
                        Let her walk, it’s like her thing.

           Minnie lifts her chin.

                                 MINNIE
                        Actually, a ride sounds great.

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brad’s car pulls up outside.

                                 MINNIE (O.S.)
                        Thanks.

           I/E. BRAD’S CAR

                                 BRAD
                        No problem.

           Minnie starts to open the door.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                             (suddenly)
                        I never heard Callie call you 
                        Minnie Mouse. Did she really?

           Minnie looks at Brad, then shakes her head. 

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        I haven’t seen you much this 
                        summer. 

                                                         MINNIE
                                              I’ve been working a lot.
                           BRAD (CONT'D)
           I thought you might be at 
           Cooper’s birthday...

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        No, keepin’ busy’s good.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been going out a lot, which is 
                        weird. I’ve been doing a lotta 
                        things I don’t really understand.
                             (beat)
                        The night of the funeral I had sex 
                        with Mallory Dryden. In this car. I 
                        don’t know why I did that. Callie 
                        and I never even had sex.
                             (beat)
                        Do you think Callie saw me do that?

                          MINNIE
           Oh-
                                                          BRAD (CONT'D)
                                              Do you think I’m going to 
                                              hell?

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t believe in hell.

                                 BRAD
                        ...there’s definitely a hell. 
                             (beat)
                        Sorry. I just feel really weird.
                             (beat)
                        I’m not hitting on you.

           Brad starts to cry. Minnie watches him.

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           As Minnie enters, Barbara sits watching TV and eating a TV 
           dinner.

                                 BARBARA
                        How’d it go?

                                 MINNIE
                        Fine.

                                 BARBARA
                        What’d you have for dinner?

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 BARBARA
                        You don’t remember what you had for 
                        dinner?

                                 MINNIE
                        ...She made roast chicken, salad, 
                        like a greek spinach pie-

                                 BARBARA
                        She made all that? 
                             (She shakes her head)
                        I guess if you’ve got the time...

           Minnie looks at Barbara, then walks down the hall.
           She reenters, picks up Barbara’s TV dinner and throws it 
           against the wall.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t want you to say a word 
                        about Mrs. King ever again. Good, 
                        bad, whatever, I don’t care. Don’t 
                        talk about her.

           Minnie leaves the room. Barbara sits, stunned as the dogs 
           lick food off the wall.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           Minnie walks through her neighborhood. She makes a turn down 
           the sidewalk, then doubles back, taking the different 
           direction to...

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE

           Minnie walks by Callie’s house. She sees the candle unlit in 
           the window.

           INT. DISCOVERY ZONE 

           Minnie sings along mindlessly at a kid’s birthday party.

           INT. DISCOVERY ZONE- NIGHT

           Minnie cleans the inside of the colorful tunnels, spraying 
           industrial cleaner and wiping down tubes while inside them. 

           She feels woozy and passes out for a second.

           HAROLD (50s, Minnie’s boss) hits the underside of the tube 
           with a broom handle.

                                 HAROLD
                        No sleeping on the job!

           Minnie startles awake. She crawls backward out of the tunnel.

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Minnie walks down the street and stops when she sees Callie’s 
           SUV, sparkling clean and completely undamaged, in the 
           driveway. The electric candle in Callie’s bedroom window is 
           lit.

           Minnie creeps to the side of house where the ladder still 
           sits, untouched. She ascends the ladder up to Callie’s room.
           I/E. CALLIE’S ROOM

           Minnie stands next to the window. The flickering candle 
           reveals the room exactly as it was the morning of the 
           accident. Clothes strewn on the floor. Bed rumpled. 

           Minnie walks to her side of the bed. In the corner, she sees 
           the lion mask from the rolling night. She picks it up.

                                 HELEN (O.C.)
                        Callie?

           Minnie jumps. Helen SCREAMS.

                          MINNIE
                                                          LINDA
                                              Oh my gosh! Minnie?
           Holy shit! I’m sorry! It’s 
           me, it’s me.

                                 HELEN
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to yell.
                        What are you doing?

                                 MINNIE
                        I just...
                             (beat)
                        ...the light was on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           DINING ROOM

           Minnie eats a plate of delicious food. Helen hasn’t touched 
           hers. Silent awkwardness. 

                                 MINNIE
                        ...where’s Mr. King?

                                 HELEN
                        He’s at a “guy’s weekend” in Hot 
                        Springs.

           Minnie eyes packed boxes in the next room filled with sports 
           memorabilia and men’s shirts. Helen clocks Minnie’s gaze.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Mark and I are separating. We were 
                        going to wait until Callie went to 
                        college...
                             (beat)
                        We’re moving up the timeline.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HELEN
                        Don’t be, he’s a prick.

           Minnie is shocked. Helen smiles at her own brazenness.
           DINING ROOM - LATER

                                 HELEN
                        They pee in there?

                                 MINNIE
                        So much. It’s almost entirely 
                        liquid under the balls.

                                 LINDA
                        Kids can be disgusting.

                                 MINNIE
                        And actually, pee is the least 
                        gross thing. Some kids’ll just, go 
                        to a corner, drop their pants, and-

                                 HELEN
                        No! Where are their parents??

                                 MINNIE
                        The parents expect me to clean it 
                        up, because these moms are rich and 
                        entitled and never worked a day in 
                        their lives, and I’m like, “you are 
                        a shitty person who’s raising 
                        shitty kids who take actual shits 
                        in public.”

           Minnie catches herself. Helen lets it pass.

                                 HELEN
                        I always thought maybe I should’ve 
                        made Callie get a job, so she 
                        doesn’t grow up-

                                 MINNIE
                             (earnestly)
                        -oh, no. Callie’s the least stuck-
                        up person ever. 

                                 HELEN
                        Really? 

           Minnie nods. 

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        That’s nice to know.

           A CLOCK CHIMES in the next room.

                                                          HELEN (CONT'D)
                          MINNIE
                                              You should get home.
           I should..

           They stand and clear plates.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I’ll give you a ride.

                                 MINNIE
                        I like walking.
                                 HELEN
                        It’s too dark, your mom wouldn’t 
                        like it.

                                 MINNIE
                        My mom doesn’t care.

           FOYER

           Helen closes the door behind Minnie. The house feels huge, 
           empty, and quiet.

           FRONT YARD

           Minnie walks down the walkway. She turns toward the lit 
           candle and hesitates.

           The front door opens and Helen sticks her head out.

                                 HELEN
                             (brightly)
                        Hey! I have an idea...

           STAIRCASE

           They walk up the stairs, the walls lined with photos of 
           Callie.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Helen walks in, Minnie trailing behind.

                                 MINNIE
                             (following behind)
                        You sure? 

                                 HELEN
                        Absolutely! Here, let me put on 
                        fresh sheets-

           Helen reaches for the sheets, then stops herself. Minnie sees 
           her hesitation.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s okay. I never change my 
                        sheets.

                                 HELEN
                        I’ll get you pajamas-

                                 MINNIE
                        Callie just lets me wear these.

           She reaches into a familiar drawer and pulls out a t-shirt 
           and boxers.
           Off Helen, already conflicted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie sits on Callie’s bed in her t-shirt and shorts. 

           There’s a gentle KNOCK at the door and Helen pokes her head 
           in.

           Seeing her, Helen feels a million things.

                                 HELEN
                        Goodnight.

           She closes the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY

           Helen hesitates outside the door, then walks down the hall.

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Barbara enters carrying a sleeping Dustin as the dogs BARK. A 
           message is being left on the answering machine.

                                 BARBARA
                             (whispering)
                        Shhh, outside!

           They run outside as Barabara puts Dustin to bed. She 
           reemerges, looks in Minnie’s room, then knocks on the 
           bathroom door.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Minnie?

           She opens the door: empty. She’s suddenly worried.

           The clock reads 11:11pm. She’s not even sure who to call. She 
           sees the answering machine flashing and hits play.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Hi, this is Helen King...Callie’s 
                        mom.
                             (half beat)
                        Minnie stopped over here for 
                        dinner, so sweet of her, and then 
                        it was getting late, and we thought 
                        it might be easier if she stayed 
                        here tonight. So she’s here. Of 
                        course, call if you’d rather- 

           Barbara picks up the phone to call. Then hangs the receiver 
           back up.
                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        So she’s here. Of course, just call 
                        if you’d rather she came home. Ok. 
                        Goodnight.

           Barbara picks up the phone right as Helen hangs up.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CALLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Minnie tries to sleep but the candle light keeps her awake. 
           She tosses and turns, then turns off the candle.

           She gets up again and turns it on again, staring at the 
           ceiling. 

           CALLIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Minnie wakes up on “her” side. She looks at Callie’s empty 
           place next to her. She hears the sounds of COOKING from 
           downstairs.

           KITCHEN

           Helen stands at the stove cooking pancakes as Minnie walks 
           downstairs. There’s also eggs, fresh fruit, bacon, etc - way 
           too much food.

                                 HELEN
                        Hey! How’d you sleep?

           Helen looks even more tired than yesterday. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Good...do you know where my uniform 
                        is?

                                 HELEN
                        There was a bunch of pet hair on 
                        it, so I put it in the wash.
                             (off Minnie’s look)
                        Oh no, do you have to work this 
                        morning?

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s fine, I have more, 
                        just...walking home in this might 
                        be weird.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter and Helen looks through clothes in a few shopping 
           bags.
                                 HELEN
                        Callie rejected these, I have no 
                        idea why. I never got around to 
                        returning them.

           She pulls out a shirt and pants, both very expensive and very 
           foreign to Minnie.

           HALLWAY

           Minnie opens the door and stands in her new outfit. Helen 
           appraises her. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m not sure they fit.

                                 HELEN
                        Well, let’s give ‘em a fighting 
                        chance.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Minnie stands in front of Callie’s full length mirror while 
           Helen safety pins the hem of the pants and rolls the cuffs of 
           the shirt.

           EXT. MINNIE'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Barbara sits on the front porch feeding Dustin in his high 
           chair while the dogs lounge in the yard.

           Helen’s SUV pulls up. Barbara notices Minnie’s clothes as the 
           dogs jump all over her.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to the dogs)
                        No, stop!

           She holds the dirty dogs at arms length.

                                 HELEN
                             (from the car)
                        Thanks for letting Minnie stay over 
                        last night!

                                 BARBARA
                             (yelling)
                        What?

                                 HELEN
                             (unbuckling her seatbelt)
                        Oh, sorry!

           As Helen approaches the dogs run toward her but stop and yelp 
           when they reach the limits of an invisible fence.
                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I was going to say--
                             (to the dogs)
                        Hey there...

                                 BARBARA
                        Don’t mind them. They’re sweet, but 
                        they’re idiots. Their old owner had 
                        one of those invisible fence things 
                        that shocked them when they went 
                        too far. We don’t have one, but old 
                        habits... 

           Helen is unsettled by Roo’s strange bark.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        And he cut her vocal chords. Some 
                        people are just fucked.

           Helen has the tiniest reaction to hearing Barbara cuss so 
           flippantly. The dogs WHINE at the periphery of the 
           nonexistent invisible fence. Helen steps closer.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I’d stay on that side-

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t mind.

           She steps into the yard and pets them lovingly.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (to Barbara)
                        I saw you at the service. It was so 
                        nice of you to come.

                                 BARBARA
                        I wish I coulda stayed longer. I’m 
                        so sorry for your loss.

           Helen nods.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I can’t even imagine.

                                 HELEN
                        Well...

           The moms look at each other.

                                 MINNIE
                        Ok, bye, Helen.

                                 BARBARA
                        Minnie, it’s “Mrs. King.” I’ve told 
                        her- 

                                 HELEN
                        Helen’s fine.

           Barbara dislikes Helen’s familiarity.
                                 MINNIE
                        Thanks for everything, Helen.

                                 HELEN
                        Come over anytime.

           Helen smiles at Barbara and crosses back to her car. The dogs 
           jump against the non-existent invisible fence.

           Helen waves as she drives away. Minnie waves back.

                                 BARBARA
                             (to Minnie)
                        Well don’t you look like a million 
                        bucks.

           Minnie walks inside, ignoring her.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                             (calling after her)
                        We should put you in a pageant!

           I/E. LIBRARY - DAY

           Minnie walks the dogs. She ties their leashes to a post 
           outside the library. They BARK like crazy as she walks 
           inside.

           PUBLIC COMPUTERS

           Minnie googles, “how to get over someone who died.” Sites for 
           psychics and therapists pop up. 

           She becomes distracted by movement to her left. 

           PHIL (60, homeless) stealthily jacks off while watching a 
           Britney Spears music video. He looks at Minnie who turns back 
           to her own computer.

                                 KAT (O.C.)
                        Awwww, come on, Phil.

           KAT (17, grunge vibe) approaches and turns off his monitor.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        You can’t do that here, dude. No 
                        judgement on the act itself, and 
                        I’m sorry if your situation 
                        precludes you from having a 
                        computer on which to do this at 
                        home, but we got kids here. Steal a 
                        magazine from a gas station. Go old 
                        school.

           She ushers him toward the door, then doubles back.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (to Minnie)
                        Didn’t you see what he was doing?
                                 MINNIE
                        Yeah.

                                 KAT
                        Why didn’t you say something?

           Minnie says nothing and walks away, embarrassed.

           Kat reads what Minnie had searched on the computer. She looks 
           after Minnie.

           I/E. DISCOVERY ZONE - LOBBY - EVENING

           Minnie vacuums. Out the big windows she sees a lone car 
           parked in the lot - Callie’s SUV.

           PARKING LOT

           Minnie steps outside, closer and closer to the familiar car.

                                 HELEN (O.C.)
                        Hey, Minnie!

           Minnie jumps. She turns to find Helen sitting near the 
           Discovery Zone’s door.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry! I didn’t want to knock, 
                        thought it might scare you.

                                 MINNIE
                             (shaken)
                        It’s okay...

           Minnie waits for Helen to say more. The moment is awkward.

                                 HELEN
                        ...I looked up how far your walk 
                        home is from here. It’s over two 
                        miles.

                                 MINNIE
                        Uh huh.

                                 HELEN
                        It’s not safe for you to be walking 
                        that far alone at night, something 
                        could happen.

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s okay.

                                 HELEN
                             (nervously)
                        It’s really not.
                             (beat)
                        I want you to use this car. 
           They look at Callie’s SUV. It sits strangely in the lot.

                                 MINNIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 HELEN
                        To get around. I won’t be able to 
                        sleep otherwise-

                                 MINNIE
                        You’re giving me a car?

                                 HELEN
                             (with a smile)
                        Not giving, loaning. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s perfectly safe, the repair 
                        people said the damage wasn’t 
                        actually that bad, which...that’s 
                        the funniest joke I’ve ever heard.
                             (beat)
                        If you don’t use it, it’s going to 
                        Goodwill.

           Off Minnie, revisiting Callie’s SUV.

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - LATER

           Minnie pulls into the driveway and Helen exits with a 
           tentative wave. The candle sits lit in Callie’s window.

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Minnie pulls up outside her house and watches Barbara through 
           the window rocking Dustin, in full breakdown. 

           Minnie drives by.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           She slowly drives through the empty school parking lot.

           EXT. CHURCH - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Except for one car, the lot is empty. Driving closer she 
           realizes it’s Brad’s.

           The windows are fogged and bodies move in the backseat. 
           Minnie quietly drives away.

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Driving through familiar streets, Minnie stops at a red 
           light. Callie’s Mati (evil eye) pendant and cross necklace 
           hang from the mirror, side by side. 
           With a push of a button the song Minnie and Callie were 
           listening to on the last day of school jumps from the 
           speakers. 

           The light turns green but Minnie doesn’t go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie merges onto the highway.

           She passes exit after exit and speeds up. The median sails 
           past her - she’s nearly reached 100 mph.

           Closing her eyes, she imagines she is Callie. The car drifts.

           It hits the median and flips into the air.

           A PASSING HORN BLARES and Minnie opens her eyes just in time 
           to swerve away from the median. Minnie steers into the right 
           lane and slows.

           EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Minnie walks past the library in her DZ uniform. She sees Kat 
           smoking a cigarette and speeds up.

                                 KAT
                             (after her)
                        Hey!

           Kat runs up and touches Minnie’s arm. Minnie turns.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Sorry for what I said the other 
                        day, I’m totally not down with 
                        victim blaming. I don’t think Phil 
                        understands what he’s doing most of 
                        the time, I just try to get him out 
                        of there so he doesn’t get 
                        arrested. I’m Kat.

                                 MINNIE
                        Minnie.

           Minnie walks off and Kat follows.

                                 KAT
                        Who’d you lose?

                        Our culture gets it in on a 
                        foundational level, it’s hard to 
                        unlearn.

           JUDY (50s, a severe-looking librarian) sticks her head out 
           the automatic doors.

                                 JUDY
                        Kat, that’s more than five!

                                 KAT
                        Sorry, Judy!

           Kat takes out a pen.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Gimme your hand.

           Kat notices Minnie’s hand is sweaty and wipes it on her own 
           shirt.

                             (writing her number)
                        My mom died last year, and it 
                        totally fucked me up. I can at 
                        least tell you some things not to 
                        do.

           Kat stubs out her cigarette and runs inside. Off Minnie’s 
           glance down at the number on her hand.

           INT. CALLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Helen sits in her sparkling clean kitchen. She opens the 
           fridge, stares, and closes it. She opens the freezer and sees  
           about a dozen untouched casseroles that people brought months 
           ago. 

           She starts throwing the casseroles in the garbage.

           INT. WALMART

           Helen walks blankly down the aisle, occasionally putting a 
           box of cereal in her cart. 

           She notices a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL (who looks like a younger 
           version of Callie) wandering the aisles alone, lost and 
           scared. Helen glances around for the girl’s parents. No one.

                                 HELEN
                             (to the girl)
                        Hi. Are you ok?

           The girl starts to cry then disappears down an aisle. Helen 
           follows, worried.
           In the next aisle, Helen glimpses the back of the girl’s head 
           as she makes her way farther and farther into the store. The 
           girl picks up her pace, and so does Helen.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (calling to the girl)
                        Hold on. Stay right there!

           The girl, scared, keeps running. Helen catches up to her and 
           grabs her by the arm. The girl WAILS.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        It’s all right, where’s your mom? 
                        Are you lost? Do you know where she 
                        is? You’re ok.

           The girl’s MOTHER suddenly appears.

                                 MOTHER
                        Megan? Megan! 

           The girl reaches for her mom, and the Mother swoops her up.

                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Where’d you go? You can’t run off 
                        like that.

           The girl buries her head in her mom’s chest.

                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                             (to Helen)
                        I’m so sorry, she was right next to 
                        me.

                                 HELEN
                        I think she was just scared.

                                 MOTHER
                        Me too. 
                             (to the girl)
                        You scared me.

                                 HELEN
                             (kindly)
                        That’s happened to me before. 

                          MOTHER
                                                          HELEN (CONT'D)
           Oh yeah?
                                              It’s terrifying.

                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        How old is yours?

           Half beat.

                                 HELEN
                        She’s seventeen.

                                 MOTHER
                             (overwhelmed)
                        It get easier?
                                 HELEN
                             (with a laugh)
                        Definitely not.

           The mother wipes the girl’s tears.

                                 MOTHER
                        And now we’ve got boogies 
                        everywhere, ok...
                             (moving away)
                        Say thank you to the lady?

           The girl sniffles. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                             (with a tired smile)
                        Thanks.

           Helen waves to the girl as the mother walks back to her cart.

           Helen turns and walks back down the aisle, hey eyes filling 
           with hot tears. As she turns the corner, she runs directly 
           into:

           Minnie, who stands in the “Back to School” supplies aisle. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Hey, Helen.
                             (seeing her tears)
                        You ok?

           Helen focuses on a folder in Minnie’s hands.

                                 HELEN
                        That’s the one you’re getting?

           Beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t know which one’s me.

           They stare at the numerous options of folders: brightly 
           colored, boho, sparkly, plain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHECK OUT

           The CASHIER runs SO MANY folders, pens, and notebooks under 
           the scanner. They have chosen every option of multiple 
           supplies. Minnie looks on as Helen swipes her credit card.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE- AFTERNOON

           Helen and Minnie sit chatting at the kitchen table, Helen 
           helping to label Minnie’s school supplies with her name.
           INT. MINNIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Minnie enters carrying her new supplies. Barbara is “dressed 
           up” and Dustin wears a little tie.

                                 MINNIE
                             (re: their outfits)
                        What’s this?

                                 BARBARA
                        Put your nice clothes on, kid, 
                        we’re going out. Made reservations 
                        and everything.
                             (sensing Minnie’s 
                              apprehension)
                        I know you haven’t been in a 
                        celebratory mood, but I want us to 
                        have a nice family night before you 
                        get too busy with school and then 
                        bam, the year’s over and you’re a 
                        million miles away at college and 
                        we never see you again. 
                             (beat)
                        This is where you tell me you’ll 
                        visit all the time.

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m staying at Helen’s tonight.

                                 BARBARA
                        ...when did you decide that?
                        I was gonna take you to school 
                        tomorrow.

                                 MINNIE
                        Since when?

                                 BARBARA
                        Since it’s the first day of your 
                        senior year-

                                 MINNIE
                        You’ve never done that before...

                                 BARBARA
                        Excuse me, I took you to school 
                        everyday for over a decade.

           Minnie sighs, exasperated.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Fine, you can go over after dinner.

                                 MINNIE
                        She’s making dinner--

                                 BARBARA
                        So she’s got an oven, 
                        congratulations, this is our 
                        tradition!
                          MINNIE
                                                         BARBARA (CONT'D)
                                              -and it’s the last year we’ll 
                                              get to do it... 
                                              We do it every year!
           It’s not a tradition. You 
           have to do something every 
           year for it to be a 
           tradition, that’s like, the 
           definition-

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        We’ve done it five times out of 
                        twelve years. That’s less than 
                        fifty percent, or is that math too 
                        advanced for you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MACARONI GRILL - NIGHT

           Minnie, Barbara, and Dustin sit at a table in silence. Minnie 
           pushes her food around her plate. She checks her watch; 
           Barbara notices and it breaks her heart.

           A SERVER (early 20’s, over it) delivers a generic dessert 
           with a candle while half-heartedly singing a birthday song. 
           Minnie glares at Barbara.

                                 BARBARA
                             (singing)
                        And many more! 
                             (sincerely)
                        Make a-

           Minnie blows out the candle quickly without making a wish.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to the server)
                        It’s not my birthday. She just does 
                        this to get free cake.

           The server rolls his eyes and walks off. Barbara’s smile 
           fades.

                                 MINNIE (V.O., PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                        I wish I had a different mom.

           INT. CALLIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Minnie sits on the bed as Helen sits on the foot of the bed, 
           folding laundry. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I know that’s not very Christian, 
                        but like, there are billions of 
                        moms in the world, why’d I have to 
                        get her?

           Helen kind of smiles.
                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        And I know, I’m lucky, some kids 
                        are like sex slaves or chained up 
                        in basements-

                                 HELEN
                        You’re allowed to be frustrated 
                        with your mom. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m not frustrated. I’m horrified.

           Beat.

                                 HELEN
                        I got this book...when Callie 
                        turned thirteen, and she started 
                        leaving the room whenever I walked 
                        in, or walking ahead of me in 
                        public so that people wouldn’t 
                        think we were together. I read that 
                        teenagers are evolutionarily 
                        designed to reject their parents 
                        and go off on their own. To 
                        encourage genetic diversity, for 
                        the survival of the species. So 
                        right now, every part of your body 
                        and brain is making you think you 
                        hate your mom even if you don’t. 
                        Maybe it’s not her fault. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Maybe. Or maybe she’s just a bitch.

           Beat.

                                 HELEN
                        Using language like that makes you 
                        sound cheap.
                             (gently)
                        You’re better than that.

           Minnie tries to hide her embarrassment.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (standing)
                        I got you something.

           She leaves the room and reenters with a small brown bag.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (re: Minnie’s face)
                        Relax, it was a dollar. 

           Minnie opens it. There’s a house key inside.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        This way when I’m not home, you 
                        don’t have to climb through the 
                        window.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Later that night, Minnie sleeps in Callie’s bed. She stirs 
           and opens her eyes. Callie lies next to her, staring at 
           Minnie. Minnie smiles, but Callie doesn’t blink. Minnie 
           realizes Callie is dead - a corpse.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie jolts awake. Callie’s spot next to her is empty.

           BATHROOM

           Minnie splashes water on her face. A SOUND from outside grabs 
           her attention - Helen stains some outdoor furniture, in the 
           middle of the night. Minnie looks on, concerned.

           CALLIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           COOKING SOUNDS from downstairs. Minnie dresses in Callie’s 
           rejected clothes. 

           She looks in the mirror, unsatisfied. She picks up some 
           clothes piled on a chair in the corner, where Callie must 
           have left them. They’re familiar.

           KITCHEN

           Helen cooks breakfast and MUSIC plays.

                                 HELEN 
                        Fifteen minutes! 

           She listens for a response.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        You don’t want to be late on the 
                        first day!

           BATHROOM

                                 MINNIE
                        Ok!

           Minnie wears the shirt Callie wore on the last day of school. 
           It doesn’t quite fit. 

           She surveys Callie’s hair products and makeup on the counter.

           She applies lip gloss, then mascara. She grabs Callie’s 
           hairbrush - hair still on the bristles. She uses it, then 
           spritzes herself with Callie’s perfume. She hides it all 
           under her own frayed jacket.
           KITCHEN

           Helen wraps a breakfast sandwich in a paper towel. She hears 
           footsteps from the staircase and turns.

                                 HELEN
                        I made you this to-go...

           When she sees Minnie coming down the stairs she freezes. 
           Minnie doesn’t exactly look like Callie, but there’s 
           something reminiscent. Callie’s abstract self portrait hangs 
           in the background. 

           Minnie takes the sandwich from her with a nervous smile.

                                 MINNIE
                             (heading for the door.)
                        Thanks.
                             (noticing Helen’s stare)
                        I look ok?

           Helen nods, dazed. Minnie rushes out.

                                 MINNIE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        See you later!

           The door closes behind her. Helen is alone. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Minnie drives into the bustling parking lot. One TEENAGER 
           notices Callie’s car pulling in, and stares.

           Minnie parks and heads inside.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - TV PRODUCTION CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Minnie sits in the back of class.

                                 TV TEACHER
                        Luke. You’re sound, Mallory, camera 
                        A, and Minnie, you want camera B? 
                             (beat)
                        Minnie?

           VARIOUS CLASSROOMS

           Assembled classes look on as the teacher turns on the 
           television for the morning announcements.

           Minnie appears onscreen sitting at the anchor desk next to 
           TYLER (17). She looks into the lens, unsure.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        Good morning, Wildcats! I’m Tyler 
                        Sobel-
           A disbelieving beat as Cara and Brandi exchange a look. 

           TV CLASSROOM

           Minnie is a deer in headlights. Tyler looks at her, then to 
           the teacher for help. Everyone stares at Minnie, waiting.

           VARIOUS CLASSROOMS

           Onscreen, Minnie smiles vacantly, frozen.

           TV CLASSROOM

           She looks at a monitor at her own face then back into the 
           lens, where the teleprompter scrolls.

                                 MINNIE
                             (with effort)
                        ...and I’m Minnie Dunn...welcome to 
                        the first day of the school year!

           BATHROOM - STALL

           Minnie throws up into a toilet, mid panic attack. 

           She emerges from the stall and tries to slow her heart rate. 
           Washing her mouth out with water, she sees her mascara’s run 
           and there’s a spot of puke on Callie’s pristine shirt.

           She tries to wash off the stain to no avail.

           FRESHMEN GIRLS enter the bathroom talking, but stop when they 
           see Minnie. 

                                 FRESHMAN GIRL
                        Was that you on tv just now?

           Minnie nods.

                                 FRESHMAN GIRL (CONT'D)
                             (admiringly)
                        Cool.

           MATH CLASSROOM - LATER

           Mr. McClendon writes “AP CALCULUS” on the board. Minnie takes 
           a seat and notices the desk next to her is empty.

           As Mr. McClendon introduces the lesson a LATE STUDENT rushes 
           in and takes “Callie’s” seat.

                                 LATE STUDENT
                             (re: Minnie’s stare)
                        What?
           Minnie refocuses on Mr. McClendon.

           DRAMA CLASSROOM

           The class is full. Minnie sits near Cara and Brandi.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        “Comparison is the thief of joy.” 
                        Who said that?

           Minnie kind-of-raises her hand.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Who is Theodore Roosevelt. 

           Minnie puts down her hand.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        The fall talent show is just around 
                        the corner, and as you develop your 
                        pieces, I want to remind you that 
                        each of you is uniquely gifted. 
                        Possessing your own passions. 
                        Identities. Souls. Which you will 
                        bare to the audience. And while 
                        there will technically be a winner 
                        decided by a panel of judges, the 
                        real prize is finding your own-

                                 CARA
                        Mrs. Murdaugh? Sorry, I had an idea 
                        for the talent show this year?

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (impatiently)
                        Okay.

                                 CARA
                             (with effortful gravitas)
                        I know I for one feel really weird 
                        coming back to school without 
                        Callie...

           The class becomes solemn. 

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        And I thought, what if we could 
                        dedicate the talent show to her? It 
                        might feel like she’s still with 
                        us.

           Minnie rolls her eyes.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        You mean like a memorial? 

           Cara nods. Mrs. Murdaugh thinks.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        I think that’s a lovely idea.
           Cara beams.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Although, the competition aspect 
                        might be inappropriate-

                                 CARA
                             (ready)
                        --unless we name the prize after 
                        her.

           Minnie looks away, disgusted.

           DRAMA CLASSROOM - END OF CLASS

           The room is empty as Minnie stares at the sign-up sheet: 
           “Callie King Memorial Talent Show” written in bubble letters.

           A few names are already listed, including: “Cara Boddington 
           and Brandi Whitehead- Modern/Contemporary dance.”

           INT.DISCOVERY ZONE - DAY

           Minnie wipes down a counter as kids play in the background. 
           She bends down behind the counter and when she comes back up, 
           Brad is standing right in front of her.  

                                 MINNIE
                             (started)
                        Jesus!

                                 BRAD
                        Whoa, sorry! You ok?

                                 MINNIE
                        Yeah, just, I haven’t been sleeping 
                        well.

           A five year old boy, ANTHONY, holds Brad’s hand.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Can I have pizza?

                                 BRAD
                        After you play, buddy, we don’t 
                        want you throwing up again.

           Anthony runs off to play.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        He gets excited, everything gets 
                        shaken up.

                                 MINNIE
                        That your brother?
                                 BRAD
                        My little. It’s this mentoring 
                        thing with my youth group.

                                 MINNIE
                        I thought you were at 
                        Fayetteville...

                                 BRAD
                        Back for the weekend.

           Minnie kinda laughs, a private joke with Callie.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Watcht this: Anthony!

           Anthony looks at Brad from the ball pit.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Pig Sooie!

                                 ANTHONY
                        Razorbacks!

           They both SNORT like pigs.

                                 BRAD
                             (smiling)
                        See? I’m turning him into a little 
                        me.

           Minnie doesn’t know how to respond.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        So, you coming to Cara’s party 
                        tonight?

                                 MINNIE
                             (oblivous to a party)
                        Um, I have to close.

                           BRAD
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
           But after.
                                              It takes forever.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Can I help?

                           BRAD (CONT'D)
                                                         MINNIE
           I can drop him off and come 
           back.
                                              You don’t want to do that, 
                                              it’s a really gross job.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        I caught Anthony’s vomit last week. 
                        I can take it. 
           BALL PIT- NIGHT

           Brad cleans the inside of a tunnel while Minnie scoops balls 
           into a bag.

                                 BRAD
                        You know there’s no ventilation in 
                        here?

                                 MINNIE
                        Don’t breathe!

           They share a laugh.

           BATHROOM

           Brad scrubs a tiny toilet as Minnie vacuums.

           BACKROOM

           They wear kids-sized birthday hats.Minnie spritzes the floor 
           as Brad steps on paper towels and moonwalks. They’re having 
           fun, a surprisingly good team.

           EXT. DISCOVERY ZONE- NIGHT

           Brad holds a full trash bag as Minnie tries to lock the 
           finicky front door.

                                 BRAD
                        You have your costume with you?

                          MINNIE
                                                          BRAD (CONT'D)
           Um-
                                                (re: trash bag)
                                              Crap, we got a leak.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        The dumpster’s just-

                                 BRAD
                        Be right back.

           Brad dashes around the corner as Minnie locks the door. After 
           a moment she realizes he hasn’t returned.

           SIDE LOT/DUMPSTERS

           She rounds the corner to find Brad, still holding the leaking 
           trash bag, frozen staring at Callie’s car.
                                 BRAD
                        What the hell is this?

           He looks at Minnie.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        This is her car. Right?

           He looks in the window.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Look, that’s her necklace. Holy 
                        shit. This is Callie’s car, the car 
                        that she-

                                 MINNIE
                        -it’s mine.

           Brad stares at Minnie.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Helen gave it to me. I’ve been 
                        driving it.

                                 BRAD
                             (weirded out)
                        Why?

                                 MINNIE
                        Because I don’t have one and it’s 
                        not safe for me to be walking home 
                        alone at night.

           Brad tries to process.

                                 BRAD
                        I’m sorry, but that’s...

                                 MINNIE
                        What?

           Brad realizes he’s still holding the trash bag. He throws it 
           in the dumpster. His eyes return to the car.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I’m tired.

           Minnie hops in the drivers seat.

                           BRAD
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
           No, wait, I’m sorry.
                                              I’m just gonna-

           Brad gets into the passenger seat.
                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        I’m not gonna be coming back much 
                        anymore, and it’s your senior year. 
                        We gotta live it the fuck up.

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Minnie drives. Brad can’t help but glance around the car - 
           familiar bobby pins, an old tube of strawberry lip balm. 
           Minnie notices and turns up the music.

           EXT. CARA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They pull up to a long line of cars down the block. Music 
           BLARES from inside. Brad and Minnie hop out, him pulling a 
           sheet from his back pack. 

                                 BRAD
                        Come here.

           He rips the sheet in half.

           INT. CARA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Brad and Minnie enter the house packed with teens wearing 
           makeshift togas and olive branch crowns. 

           Brad’s toga is tiny, more like a speedo. Minnie wears her 
           full work uniform under her toga. 

           Friends greet Brad but only the freshmen girls from the 
           bathroom wave to Minnie. MALLORY (17) feeds a GUY (17) 
           grapes.

           Cara spots Brad and Minnie and immediately disapproves.

           Brad places a hand on the small of Minnie’s back and guides 
           her into the:

           KITCHEN

           Brad ladles himself a cup of spiked punch from a large bowl, 
           chugs it, then goes for another. He can’t quite shake the 
           car. 

           Minnie ladles a cup full of punch as a DRUNK BRO throws an 
           arm around Brad.

                                 DRUNK BRO
                        Dude, I’m gonna miss you so much!

                           BRAD
                                                        DRUNK BRO (CONT'D)
           Thanks, bro.
                                              I love you like a brother. 
                                              More than a brother.
                                 DRUNK BRO (CONT'D)
                             (to Minnie)
                        This guy is who I want to be. 
                        Loyal, God-fearing, with the 
                        hottest girls...did you know 
                        Callie? 

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, man.

                                 DRUNK BRO
                        They were the ultimate power 
                        couple. And he could have fucked 
                        her and he totally didn’t, that’s 
                        how much he respected her.

           Brad, out of nowhere, pushes the Bro, hard.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. BACKYARD - POOL

           Cara sits with the drunk bro, holding a bag of ice to his 
           head. Minnie and Brad sit across the way on the edge of the  
           pool. A COUPLE makes out nearby.

                                 MINNIE
                             (re: drunk bro)
                        That guy was a friend of yours?

                                 BRAD
                        I’m like, his best friend. He’s not 
                        mine. 

           Minnie thinks about whether she was actually Callie’s best 
           friend. She takes a sip, then chugs her drink. Brad chugs in 
           solidarity. They teeter on the edge of drunk sorrow.

           Instead, Minnie stares at Brad, then leans over and kisses 
           him. She aggressively makes out with him. She reaches for his 
           crotch.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                             (pulling away)
                        Whoa, can we like...slower?

           Minnie stares at Brad, then erupts in laughter, drunk. Brad 
           tries to laugh along, confused. 

           Minnie slides into the pool. He slides after her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           An hour later, Minnie and Brad are both completely wasted. 
           They are playing the pool game “Categories.” Brad stands at 
           one end of the pool with his eyes closed.
           Cara watches from the hot tub as Minnie, Brandi and the 
           Freshmen Girls wait at the other end giddily. The Drunk Bro 
           sits on a deck chair nearby, slipping in and out of 
           consciousness.

           All the girls but Minnie are in bathing suits or underwear. 
           Minnie is in full uniform still, but having a blast.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Missionary!

           He waits then turns back. No one’s moved. He turns back and 
           covers his eyes.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Girl on top!

           No one moves.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Reverse cow girl!

           One of the Freshmen jumps in and swims across.

                                 CARA
                        That’s disgusting! What even is 
                        that?

                                 BRAD
                        How can you be disgusted if you 
                        don’t know what it is?
                             (back to the game)
                        Blow job! 

           The other Freshman and Brandi jump in.

                                 CARA
                        You’re all going to hell!

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Brad, re: the girls)
                        They’re already swimming, you gotta 
                        go after them!

                                 BRAD
                             (slurring)
                        Nuh-uh. I’m waiting for my Moby 
                        Dick.

                        DRUNK BRO
                                                      FRESHMAN GIRL
                                                (reaching the end)
           I am Ishmael!
                                              What happened? Sorry, did I 
                                              do it wrong?

                          MINNIE
                                                          BRAD
                                                (rapid-fire)
                                              Eating a girl out! Doggy-
                                              style!
           I’m not gonna play if you 
           don’t uphold the integrity of 
           the game!
                                 CARA
                        Try “scissoring!”

           Everyone looks at Cara, then Minnie.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        I bet that’s what Minnie likes.

           The Drunk Bro laughs. Minnie’s vision starts to blur.

           UNDERWATER - BEGIN FLASHBACK

           Minnie opens her eyes. She and Callie are nine-years old. 

           They have an underwater tea party, play washer-dryer, 
           alternating underwater flips while holding hands.

           Callie kicks above the water to breathe then rejoins Minnie 
           below. She puts her mouth on Minnie’s and exhales into 
           Minnie’s lungs as Minnie inhales. 

           Minnie passes the breath back but Callie coughs. She tries to 
           pull Callie to the surface, but Callie is stuck at the 
           bottom, like a nightmare. 

           Suddenly she’s yanked out and her vision of Callie rushes 
           away.

           BACKYARD/POOL - END FLASHBACK

           Minnie, drenched, opens her eyes to Brad giving her mouth to 
           mouth. She spits up water violently and sits up to the 
           terrified group.

                                 MINNIE
                        Get off! What are you doing?? 

                                 BRAD
                        Ok, just, the sheet got wrapped 
                        around your head-

                                                          BRAD (CONT'D)
                                              You weren’t breathing!
                          MINNIE
           I’m not- I don’t want to kiss 
           you-

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m not-

           Minnie throws up into the grass. Everyone is embarrassed 
           by/for her. 

                                 CARA
                        Pathetic. Get her out of here.

                                 BRAD
                        I can’t drive her home, I’m too 
                        messed up.
           Minnie MUMBLES to herself. 

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Minnie, who do you want us to call?

           EXT. CARA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Minnie leans drunkenly on Brad as Helen pulls up and walks to 
           the porch. 

                                 BRAD
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. King-

                                 LINDA
                        -it’s fine-

                                 BRAD
                        -she insisted.

                                 MINNIE
                             (slurred, unintelligible)
                        ...I took her air...

                                 HELEN
                        You did what?

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t feel good.

                                 HELEN
                        I bet not.

           Helen unwraps Minnie from the wet toga.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (re: the sheet)
                        What’s this?

                                 BRAD
                        Greek night.

           Helen gives Brad a look. 

                                 HELEN
                        Do you have a way to get home?

                                 BRAD
                        I’m gonna crash here.

           Helen looks up a the porch where Cara stands; suddenly, Helen 
           feels betrayed for Callie.

           She walks toward the car with Minnie. 

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        Don’t be mad, Helen, we were just 
                        having fun.

           Helen turns back.
                                 HELEN
                        I know your brain is biologically 
                        incapable of grasping consequences 
                        yet, and will be for a few more 
                        terrifying years, but this girl is 
                        half your size and trying to out-
                        drink you. Do you think that’s a 
                        good idea?

                                 BRAD
                        No.
                             (With a shrug:)
                        But I’m not in charge of her, am I? 
                        Not my job to keep her safe.

           He turns and stumbles back to the house. Helen stares, then 
           steers Minnie into the passenger seat. 

           I/E. HELEN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie watches the streets and trees sail by out the window.

                                 HELEN
                        If you’re going to be sick, tell me 
                        and I’ll pull over.

           Minnie’s head nods against the window.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Here...

           She rolls Minnie’s window down.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Get some fresh air on your face.

           Minnie leans her head out the window.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CALLIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Minnie lies in Callie’s bed as Helen talks on the phone just 
           outside the door.

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        She fell asleep doing homework, I 
                        didn’t want to wake her.

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT

           Barbara leans against the sink.

                                 BARBARA
                        Oh. Ok...

           Beat.
                           HELEN
                                                         BARBARA (CONT'D)
           I can bring her home early 
           tomorrow-
                                              Does she want....sorry, I 
                                              interrupted-

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        -no, what were you-

                                 BARBARA
                        Just, she has to babysit her 
                        brother in the morning, so I can go 
                        to work.

                                 HELEN
                        I can have her home by eight?

           Barbara considers it, conflicted.

                                 BARBARA
                        I don’t know if she has a 
                        toothbrush-

                                 HELEN
                        She has everything she needs over 
                        here.

           Minnie lets out a quiet GROAN in the background. 

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        We’ll see you in the morning, then?

                                 BARBARA
                        All right.
                             (beat)
                        Thanks.

           Helen has hung up. 

           Now we see the table Barbara stands next to: a simple but 
           carefully prepared home-cooked dinner with two place settings 
           laid out. Barbara looks at the food; she starts to put it in 
           tupperware.

           INT. CALLIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Helen enters carrying a full glass of water.

                                 HELEN
                             (sitting down)
                        That’s the only time I’m ever going 
                        to lie for you. Understood?

           Minnie nods. Helen hands her the water.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Drink it all.

           Minnie shakes her head.
                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Yes. 
                             (moving Callie’s trashcan 
                              closer)
                        Use that if you need to.

           She watches Minnie try to drink the water.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever gotten drunk like 
                        this before?

           Minnie shakes her head and hands the glass back to Helen.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I believe you. 

           Minnie closes her eyes. Helen shakes her head.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Once, in high school...I got so 
                        drunk that I made out with a guy 
                        I’d met that night outside of a gas 
                        station. He had a feather earring. 
                        He must’ve been close to 40. 
                             (realizing)
                        ...and then I think I got on his 
                        motorcycle.

           Helen shakes her head. She maternally strokes Minnie’s hair. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CALLIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           The DOORBELL CHIMES.

           Minnie and Helen are asleep next to each other, Helen in her 
           clothes from the night before, in Callie’s spot. The clock 
           reads 9:47am. The DOORBELL CHIMES again. Minnie stirs first, 
           then Helen.

           I/E. CALLIE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Helen opens the door to Barbara in uniform, Dustin on her 
           hip. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Good morning.

                                 HELEN
                        Oh my gosh, it’s late-

                                 BARBARA
                        It just became take your daughter 
                        to work day. I’m gonna need my 
                        daughter for that.
           Minnie walks down the stairs and sees Barbara. Minnie 
           immediately sprints for the bathroom. AUDIBLE VOMITTING.

           INT. BARBARA’S CAR - MORNING

           Barbara smells the stale booze on Minnie as she drives.

                                 BARBARA
                        You want to skip over any lying 
                        you’re considering doing, tell me 
                        how you actually got this fucked 
                        up?

           Minnie says nothing.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Did that woman give you alcohol?

                                 MINNIE
                        Of course not, Helen’s not like 
                        that.

                          MINNIE (CONT'D)
                                                         BARBARA
           She took care of me.
                                              I have no idea what she’s 
                                              like.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I know she’s a liar.

           Minnie rolls her eyes.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        She knew I needed you home to 
                        babysit your brother, but she 
                        doesn’t have a job-

                                                         MINNIE
                          BARBARA (CONT'D)
                                                (under her breath)
                                              He’s not my brother.
           -so she probably doesn’t get 
           that.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        What was that?

           Minnie looks straight at Barbara.

                                 MINNIE
                             (pointed)
                        He’s not my brother. He’s just 
                        another stray with a sob story, who 
                        you decided to take in-

           Barbara veers the car to the side of the road and hits the 
           brakes. 

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        What the hell! I’m already 
                        nauseous!
           Barbara gets out and opens Minnie’s door, unbuckling her seat 
           belt and pulling her out of the car.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        Mom, what are you doing??

                                 BARBARA
                        What’d you just call me?

                                 MINNIE
                        Mom!

                                 BARBARA
                        That’s right. Seems like you’ve 
                        been forgetting that-

           Barbara holds onto Minnie’s arm.

                                 MINNIE
                        Ow, stop!

                                 BARBARA
                        I’m your family. He’s your family. 
                        And while you were off pretending 
                        you’re better than us, he’s started 
                        understanding words, really 
                        understanding them, and I won’t let 
                        him hear his sister talk about him 
                        like he’s fucking less than.

                                 MINNIE
                        You use language like that because 
                        you’re cheap.

           Barbara stands, dumbfounded.

                                 BARBARA
                        My mom would have slapped the shit 
                        out of me for that.

           A WEALTHY WOMAN pulls up and rolls down her window. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Honey, everything ok? 

           Minnie looks at Barbara who has no fight left.

                                 MINNIE
                             (to the Woman)
                        I’m fine.

           The driver waits a second then drives on. Barbara gets back 
           in and comforts Dustin.

           INT. VETERINARY CLINIC - DAY

           Barbara counsels a WOMAN WITH A CAT on how to administer a 
           vial of antibiotics.
           Minnie sits on the floor as Dustin plays with her face. She 
           looks at him with guilt and love.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CO-WORKER stands up behind the counter and grabs her purse.

                                 CO-WORKER
                             (to Barbara)
                        I’m gonna take lunch. Want me to 
                        take Dustin, Minnie? 
                             (to Dustin)
                        How do chicken nuggets sound?

           Dustin SQUEALS in delight. Barbara smiles in thanks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie sweeps the lobby as a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (50s) walks in 
           with puffy red eyes, carefully carrying a crate and a dog 
           bed.

           She has a quiet conversation with Barbara at the counter.

           Barbara pokes her head into the lobby area.

                                 BARBARA
                        Minnie, would you help me with 
                        something?

           HALLWAY

           Minnie, in scrubs, stands in the hallway outside the exam 
           room. Barbara leans against a wall and Minnie looks into the 
           exam room through the window in the door.

           The woman’s dog lies shaking on the exam table, in its bed 
           from home. The owner gently pets it and cries, speaking to it 
           softly.

           After a last moment, she exits the room, nods at Barbara, and 
           heads toward the lobby.

           EXAM ROOM

           Barbara walks inside and Minnie follows. Barbara goes to the 
           dog and rubs behind its ears. Through this scene Barbara is 
           as gentle and quietly capable as we’ve seen her.

                                 BARBARA
                        You’re all right, sweet pea. You’re 
                        ok.
                             (to Minnie)
                        Here. Hold her like this.

           Barbara demonstrates how to hold the dog gently but firmly. 
           Minnie tries but is too hesitant and the dog shakes harder.
                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        You can be firmer. Show her you’ve 
                        got her.

           Minnie does so and the dog calms slightly.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Good.

           Barbara prepares two injections across the room.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        They like it when you talk to them.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 BARBARA
                        It’s more about how you say it.

           Minnie looks at the dog, who looks back at Minnie.

           Barely audibly, Minnie hums a song. She’s not a good singer, 
           but it doesn’t matter.  

           Barbara is incredibly moved to hear Minnie sing but doesn’t 
           show it. She brings the injections over and inserts one 
           needle in the dog’s leg, depressing the plunger. Minnie stops 
           singing, scared.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                             (to the dog, but also to 
                              Minnie)
                        It’s ok. It’s ok.

           The dog twitches harder. They hold it as it slowly relaxes, 
           twitching less and less.

           Barbara injects the dog with a second shot. They wait. Its 
           eyes close halfway, and the dog grows still.

           HALLWAY

           Minnie watches as Barbara informs the woman. The woman cries. 

           LOBBY

           Minnie helps settle the bill. She nods toward the pet supply 
           and rescue adoption area.

                                 MINNIE
                        We just got some new rescue puppies 
                        in, if you want to take a look.

           The woman glances at the puppies playing. She turns back.

                                 WOMAN
                        No thanks.
           EXAM ROOM

           Barbara cleans the room. The bed is urine stained; she drops 
           it in a trash bag. She wipes up a small puddle of urine that 
           seeped through onto the table. 

           Minnie picks up a towel and helps clean. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DRAMA CLASSROOM - DAY

           The talent show sign up sheet now has many entries.

           Minnie enters and sits close to Cara and Brandi. 

                                 BRANDI
                             (mid-argument)
                        I thought you were gonna to play 
                        yourself and I was gonna be Callie.

                                 CARA
                        The piece is evolving, we have to 
                        evolve with it.

                                 BRANDI
                        Doesn’t it make the most sense for 
                        you to play yourself?

                                 CARA
                        We have to subvert expectations.

           Mrs. Murdaugh leads the class in Viewpoints acting exercises. 
           The students walk around the space.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        There is no such thing as 
                        “character,” there is simply you 
                        under different circumstances. In 
                        order to bring yourselves to your 
                        roles, you must first know who you 
                        are.

           The face the walls at different spots.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        In public, this is who I am.

           They hit solo tableaus. Most hit outgoing, exaggerated poses. 
           Minnie makes her body very small.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        This is who I am in private.

           Most hit introspective, pensive poses. Minnie stays in a 
           similar posture to her first pose- very small. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        This is who I actually am.
           They hit some middle ground version of their public and 
           private selves.

           Minnie, however, stretches her arms wide and lifts her head 
           to the sky. She takes up the most space of anyone. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Cara and Minnie stand opposite each other at the front of the 
           class. They’re mid Meisner exercise.

                                 CARA
                        You feel nothing. You’re dead

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Hold. Stay with each other.

           The girls maintain eye contact.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Cara, your job is to see past the 
                        facade. Minnie, as much as she 
                        tries to hide it, has a complex, 
                        simmering internal life. Go deeper.

                                 CARA
                        Ugggh.

           Cara shakes it out and refocuses. She narrows her eyes at  
           Minnie.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        You’re...

           Cara narrows her gaze. Then she lets out a little gasp.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        You’re happy.

           Minnie is taken aback. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m happy?

                                 CARA
                        You’re happy.

           I’m happy??
                                                (quietly)
                                              Good, Cara.

                                 CARA
                             (invigorated)
                        Ohhh, you’re angry!

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m angry?

           Minnie begins to tear up.

                                 CARA
                        You’re angry!

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m angry!

                                 CARA
                        You’re tearing up! 

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m-

                           CARA
           You’re sad! You’re 
           embarrassed!
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
                                                (overwhelmed by her own 
                                                emotion)
                                              I’m...

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Yes, Minnie, use your voice! Follow 
                        your instincts!

           Minnie shoves Cara. The whole class gasps.

                                                                CUT TO:

           At the back of the classroom, Mrs. Murdaugh talks to Cara in 
           hushed tones. Minnie stands at the front of the classroom 
           looking at the talent show sign up sheet.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                             (whispered)
                        I know, but that reaction means you 
                        were right. 

           Minnie writes her name on the sign up sheet, and next to it: 
           “TBD.”

           EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Minnie parks in the library parking lot and walks inside.
           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           She looks to see if Kat is working - no Kat in sight.

           In the “Holds” section, she finds the book waiting under her 
           name: “Finding Your Voice.” 

           On the shelf above, she sees holds for “Helen Stathos.” There 
           are over a dozen books on grief and mourning. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie stands in the check out line. 

           Just as Minnie steps to the front, Kat relieves Judy. Minnie 
           panics and peels out of line.

                                 KAT
                             (after her)
                        Hey Minnie!

           Caught, Minnie turns back to the desk.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (quietly)
                        I’ve been waiting by the phone, you 
                        never called.

                                 MINNIE
                        I washed my hands.

           Kat reaches for Minnie’s book. Minnie hands it over, 
           reluctantly.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                             (re: the book)
                        There’s a talent show at my school. 
                        I’m trying to figure out what to 
                        do.

           An man in his 80’s, DAN, pokes his head out from the line.

                                 DAN
                             (good-naturedly)
                        Sorry, Kat, I’m gonna miss my bus.

                                 KAT
                        No prob, give ‘em here.

           She scans his books she talks to Minnie.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        You could dance.

                                 MINNIE
                        Ha, no.

                                 KAT
                        Play an instrument?
           Minnie shakes her head.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (turning to Dan)
                        Dan, you ever been in a talent 
                        show?

                                 DAN
                        Oh yeah. When I was ten I did a 
                        vaudeville routine at the Izard 
                        county fair. Abbot and Costello. I 
                        played both parts.

                                 KAT
                        Did you win?

                                 DAN
                        Went to a farmer who trained his 
                        pig to blow bubbles with its own 
                        saliva. But I felt like the winner. 

                                 KAT
                        Minnie here’s gonna be in a talent 
                        show, what do you think she should 
                        do?

                                 DAN
                             (turning to go)
                        Whatever makes you feel alive, 
                        doll.

                                 KAT
                        Hey Dan!

           He turns back.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Who’s on first?

           Dan winks at Kat and shuffles away. Minnie is charmed by Kat. 

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Minnie does her calculus homework as Helen completes a thank 
           you note for the funeral. She places it on a stack of fifty 
           completed notes. 

           Overwhelmed, she shifts her focus to Minnie. 

                                 HELEN
                        Need help? 

           Minnie looks up, surprised.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I was a straight A student in high 
                        school.
                                 MINNIE
                        Um, sure. My mom couldn’t even help 
                        me with trig.

           Helen takes the book.

                                 HELEN
                        Ok...so...

           She stares at the page, smile fading. 

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Wow, this is...

           Minnie becomes embarrassed for her.

                                 MINNIE
                        Actually, there’s something else I 
                        could use your help with. I signed 
                        up for the school talent show-

                                 HELEN
                             (thrilled)
                        You did?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m already a lost cause.

                                 HELEN
                        You have tons of talent.

                                 MINNIE
                        Uh huh...Like, what, would you 
                        think?

                                 HELEN
                        I’ve heard you sing in the 
                        musicals.

                                 MINNIE
                        Always with a group. A big group. 
                        For a reason.

                                 HELEN
                        Come on, I’m sure you’re great!

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Helen plays the beginning chords of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” 
           on piano while Minnie holds the sheet music. 

           When it gets to where when Minnie should sing, she freezes.

                                 HELEN
                        So that’s your cue.

           Beat. Minnie holds the sheet music out for Helen to take 
           back.
                                 MINNIE
                        Maybe I shouldn’t sing.

                                 HELEN
                        You haven’t even tried.

           Helen takes the sheet music.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Well, what else are you good at?

                                 MINNIE
                        Math.

                                 HELEN
                        But what do you love?

                                 MINNIE
                        Math.

           Beat.

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t think you can do math for a 
                        talent show. 

           Minnie glances to a framed photo on the piano - Helen and 
           Callie smiling with a talent show trophy. Three physical 
           trophies line a shelf behind. 

           When Minnie looks back at Helen, she sees Helen looking down 
           at the sheet music.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                             (with a shrug)
                        I love this song.

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           The sheet music sits on the passenger seat as Minnie drives. 
           The evil eye necklace around the rearview mirror TAPS 
           annoyingly against the windshield. On impulse, she stuffs it 
           in the glove box.

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Minnie parks at the end of the block where the SUV can’t be 
           seen and walks inside.

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie walks in to an empty house.

                                 MINNIE
                        Mom?
           Through the sliding door she can see Barbara, Dustin and all 
           the animals in the backyard. 

           Barbara throws a ball for Jasper while Dustin chases after 
           him. The toddler and dog play tug of war while Barbara looks 
           on. 

           It’s a nice family scene. Minnie misses them suddenly, but 
           turns toward her room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Later, the dogs pile inside, Barbara and Dustin following. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Dustin, you want pizza for dinner?

           Barbara picks up the phone, and hears voices already talking.

                                 MINNIE (V.O.)
                        It’s gonna be a disaster. I feel 
                        sick just thinking about it.

                                 KAT (V.O.)
                        Then don’t do it.

           MINNIE’S ROOM

           Minnie lies in bed with the cordless.

                                 MINNIE
                        I have to.

                                 KAT (V.O.)
                        ...as long as you’re doing it for 
                        you.

           INT. KAT’S HOUSE - KAT’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT

           Kat sits on the floor, shuffling a deck of cards.

           MINNIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Barbara listens more closely. Dustin SQUEALS and Barbara 
           covers the receiver, putting her finger to her lips.

           MINNIE’S ROOM

                                 MINNIE
                        You said...your mom died last year?

                                 KAT
                        Yeah, she did.

                                 MINNIE
                        What happened, if you don’t mind me-
                                 KAT
                        It’s ok. She was on vacation with 
                        my dad in like, the English 
                        countryside, and she saw a turtle 
                        in the road, so she stopped to move 
                        it, and an old lady hit her with 
                        her car.

                                 MINNIE
                        Oh my god.

                                 KAT
                        I know, so random. She was in a 
                        coma for like, two days. My dad got 
                        me a plane ticket, to try to get me 
                        there before, but she died while I 
                        was in the air. I think I was 
                        watching Legally Blonde.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s awful.

                                 KAT
                        I know, it totally ruined that 
                        movie for me. (beat) My therapist 
                        says I use humor as a coping 
                        mechanism. 

           Beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        Your mom sounded like an amazing 
                        person, to stop to save a turtle.

                                 KAT
                        Yeah. (beat) I don’t know if that 
                        story is totally representative. 
                        It’s nice, but she was complicated. 
                        We fought a lot. My parents were on 
                        that trip as a kind of last effort, 
                        I guess my mom had cheated-

                                 MINNIE
                        Wow.

                                 KAT
                        Yeah. And she didn’t even like 
                        animals... 
                             (beat)
                        At the funeral, all anybody did was 
                        tell that turtle story, over and 
                        over.

           Minnie nods.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        I know it’s fucked up, but there’s 
                        a girl in my class who’s dad died 
                        of lung cancer, really drawn 
                        out...Sometimes I get jealous of 
                        her. ‘Cause she got to say goodbye.

                        Annnnnd now you think I’m a 
                        terrible person.

                                 MINNIE
                        I don’t think that. At all.

           Beat.

                                 KAT
                        Did you lose a parent? 

                                 MINNIE
                        No.

                        Do you mind if we don’t talk about 
                        it now?

                            KAT
                                                         MINNIE (CONT'D)
           Sure.
                                              I’m just thinking about this 
                                              performance-

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        You gonna let me come to the show?

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m gonna be terrible.

                                 KAT
                        I don’t care about that.

                                 MINNIE
                        What if I puke?

                                 KAT
                        I’ll hold your hair back.
                             (beat)
                        Besides, you’re cute when you’re 
                        embarrassed. 

           Barbara’s eye grow wider. Minnie freezes.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I couldn’t tell if...I’m 
                        like, totally down for just being 
                        friends. I don’t want to weird you 
                        out-

                                 MINNIE
                        No, I...I think you’re cute, too.

           Minnie SCREAMS into a pillow. 

           KAT’S HOUSE - KAT’S ROOM

           Kat throws the deck of cards in the air like confetti. 
           MINNIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN 

           Barbara covers her mouth and sits on the floor. The dogs GO 
           WILD and jump all over. Barbara hangs up and hears Minnie’s 
           door open. 

           She stands and quickly busies herself with dishes.

           Minnie enters, still holding the phone in her hand.

                                 MINNIE
                             (terrified)
                        Mom, were you just-

                                 BARBARA
                        Hm? Did you need something?

                                 MINNIE
                        ...never mind.

           Minnie retreats. Barbara looks at Dustin who SQUEALS with 
           delight.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Minnie carries herself with more confidence then we’ve seen 
           before. A few YOUNGER GIRLS watch her with admiration.

           TV PRODUCTION CLASSROOM

           Minnie reads from the teleprompter competently, smiling into 
           the camera.

           MATH CLASSROOM

           Minnie tries to pay attention but finds herself doodling the 
           name “Kat” on her notebook over and over next to half-
           completed calculus equations. 

           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - DAY

           Minnie drives. At a red light, she replaces Callie’s music 
           with a CD from her own backpack and turns it up.

           EXT. CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Kat sits on a bench in her uniform. Minnie pulls up and Kat 
           gets in.
           I/E. CALLIE’S CAR - DAY

           They drive, putting their hands out of the window and feel 
           the wind, listening to music. Kat pops an Atomic Fireball in 
           her mouth.

           EXT. KAT’S HOUSE- DAY

           They walk to the front door of Kat’s small house.

           INT. KAT’S HOUSE

           Kat opens the front door and walks inside.

                                 KAT
                        My dad’s working ‘til seven, so we 
                        got the place all to ourselves.

           Minnie scans the house. There are pictures of Kat and her 
           parents on the mantel. Minnie studies the pic of Kat’s mom. 

           One picture is of Kat and her parents in very accurate Star 
           Trek uniforms, Kat dressed as Spock with pointy ears.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (off Minnie’s look)
                        You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.

           INT. STAR TREK ROOM

           Kat opens the door to reveal a guest bedroom that has been 
           converted into a Star Trek memorabilia room. Figurines in 
           unopened boxes cover the walls, top to bottom. A life-sized 
           cardboard cutout of Worf brandishing a phaser stands in the 
           corner. A thousand piece model of the Starship Enterprise, 
           assembly in process, sits on a table.

                                 MINNIE
                        So your dad likes Star Trek.

                                 KAT
                        My mom. When they started dating, 
                        she got him this as a joke-
                             (she points to a Picard 
                              figurine)
                        Then he got her Data, then she got 
                        him Troy. On and on for years.
                             (beat)
                        He still gets her things.

           We scan over all the little figurines. 

           Minnie studies the intricate model of the enterprise with a 
           bottle of glue sitting next to it, hundreds of pieces yet to 
           add. 
           INT. KAT’S ROOM

           Kat opens the door to her room which is decked out with magic 
           gear. A top hat, numerous decks of cards, ropes in knots, 
           rings, etc.

           Minnie picks up a rabbit puppet.

                                 MINNIE
                             (delighted)
                        Stop.

                                 KAT
                             (proud)
                        I will not.

                                                                CUT TO:

           As Kat performs a mini close-up magic show: 

                                 MINNIE
                        How many hours of your life have 
                        you spent doing this?

                                 KAT
                        What’s three hours a day for nine 
                        years?

           Minnie does some quick mental calculations.

                                 MINNIE
                        9,855 hours.

                                 KAT
                             (impressed)
                        Is that right?

           Minnie nods, bashful, proud. Then:

                                 MINNIE
                        Is all this another coping 
                        mechanism?

                                 KAT
                        Hell no, dude, this is a vocation. 
                        I’ve been doing this since third 
                        grade, since dumb ass Doug Thatcher 
                        showed me some totally obvious 
                        trick, and when I figured it out 
                        right away and thought up six 
                        different ways to improve it, he 
                        said I could be his assistant. Like 
                        wearing a skimpy outfit to be sawed 
                        in half is an honor.  

           Minnie looks at a framed photo of a 5th grade Kat dressed in 
           tails and white gloves, looking intently mysterious. 

           Kat notices Minnie staring at the pic.
                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        I understand if you don’t want to 
                        date me now, I guess it’s not the 
                        sexiest--

           Minnie kisses Kat. Kat kisses her back. They break apart.

                                 MINNIE
                        Why does your mouth taste hot?

                                 KAT
                        I was worried about my breath so I 
                        popped a fire ball.

           She sticks out her tongue, which is fireball-red. Minnie 
           playfully licks her tongue. Kat laughs. They kiss. 

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Helen sits on the porch, a cordless phone in her lap.

           She checks her watch and hears LOUD MUSIC.  Callie’s car 
           approaches from around the corner. 

           Helen walks into the lawn and freezes when she sees the 
           silhouette of a girl in the passenger seat.

           Minnie parks the car and turns off the ignition. She and Kat 
           exit.

                                 HELEN
                        Where were you? 

                                 MINNIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 HELEN
                        I’ve been waiting since four.

                          MINNIE
                                                          HELEN (CONT'D)
           We were studying at Kat’s 
           house-
                                              -I called your mom, she 
                                              didn’t know where you were.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        You called my mom?
                             (beat)
                        I’m fine.
                             (beat)
                        Helen, this is Kat. Kat, Helen. 

                                 KAT
                        Hey.

           Kat smiles at Helen, Helen studies Kat somewhat cooly.

                                 HELEN
                             (to Minnie)
                        You ready to rehearse?
                                 MINNIE
                             (proudly)
                        No need, we got it figured out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE- LIVING ROOM

           Helen sits uncomfortably on the couch as she watches Minnie 
           and Kat perform, pictures of Callie visible on the walls 
           around them.

           Minnie and Kat giggle throughout.

                                 KAT
                             (with a flourish)
                        Mein Damen und Herren! Mesdames et 
                        Messieurs! 

                          MINNIE
                                                           KAT (CONT'D)
                 (to Helen)
                                              Ladies and Gentlemen!
           We haven’t worked this part 
           out yet.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        We are...

           Kat lights a burst of fire paper in her hand.

                            KAT (CONT'D)
           The Mathmagicians!
                                                         MINNIE
                                              The Mathmagicians!

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (dramatic beat)
                        How many of you here love the 
                        ancient art of mathematics?

           Minnie quickly raises her hand. Kat pretends to scan the 
           crowd.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        I don’t need numerical skills to 
                        see that Minnie is the only one. 
                        But what if I could transform you 
                        all into instant math prodigies? 

           Minnie gasps dramatically. 

                                 MINNIE
                        “She can’t!” “She can!” “We’ll 
                        see!” “Let’s watch!”

           Helen is unamused. Kat pulls a sealed envelope from up her 
           sleeve. 

                                 KAT
                        This sealed envelope contains a 
                        numerical prediction.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        A view into the future, if you 
                        will. We don’t claim to be mediums, 
                        psychics, or mind readers- con 
                        artists who feed on desperate souls- 

           Minnie clocks Helen’s discomfort.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Oh no, you see we-

                                 MINNIE
                             (interrupting Kat)
                        Can we get a volunteer from the 
                        audience?

           Minnie and Kat look at Helen. She doesn’t raise her hand.

                                 KAT
                        How about you, ma’am! Come on up 
                        here.

                                 HELEN
                             (politely)
                        No, thank you.

                                 KAT
                             (still in character)
                        Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a 
                        math genius. 

           Minnie holds out a blank card and pen to Helen.

                                 MIINIE
                             (in character)
                        Just write a number between one 
                        hundred and a thousand.

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t want to play.

           Minnie, worried, doesn’t know what to do.

                                 KAT
                        Aw, she’s shy! Audience, let’s give 
                        her some bravery!

           Kat applauds uproariously. 

                                 MINNIE
                             (breaking character)
                        You won’t actually have to do it in 
                        the show, it’s just for now.

           Minnie holds out the card to Helen. Helen doesn’t take it.

                                 HELEN
                             (to Minnie, betrayed)
                        This is what you’re doing?

           Minnie is silent.
           Helen looks down at her hands. Kat looks to Minnie, confused.

                                 KAT
                        It’s just a first draft...

           Minnie looks like she might cry, but she doesn’t. 

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (to Minnie)
                        I guess... we should get going...

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Kat)
                        You go ahead.

                                 HELEN
                        No, it’s late. Go home.
                             (beat)
                        Nice to meet you, Kat.

                                 KAT
                        Yeah, you too-

                                 HELEN
                        Mrs. King.

           Kat exits the front door.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Minnie? 

           Minnie turns back, hopeful.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        I forgot, I have to get Callie’s 
                        car serviced tomorrow. I’m going to 
                        need the key.

           EXT. CALLIE'S HOUSE

           Kat waits by the car. Minnie emerges.

                                 MINNIE
                        Let’s walk.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE

           Helen watches out the window as Minnie and Kat walk down the 
           sidewalk together. 

           Helen sits at the piano, fingers on the keys. She plays a few 
           chords from “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” She stops mid song.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Helen watches a home video on the tv screen: A five year old 
           Callie opens Christmas presents while YIA YIA and PAPOU 
           (Helen’s parents who speak only in Greek) watch, delighted. A 
           much younger Helen watches while Mark operates the camera. 
           Helen pauses on an image of her family intact, happy.

           INT. MINNIE’S HOUSE- LIVING ROOM

           Sheet music haltingly spits out of a noisy printer, which 
           jolts to a stop halfway down the page.

           INT. MINNIE’S ROOM

           Minnie sits studying the half page of sheet music. Barbara 
           opens the door.

                                 BARBARA
                        It’s confirmed, the printer’s 
                        fucked. 
                             (she catches herself)
                        I mean broken.

           Barbara on the floor next to Minnie’s bed. She gets a glimpse 
           of the paper. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        That for the talent show?

           Minnie stares at the paper, brow furrowed.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        You know you don’t have to do that 
                        if you don’t want.

                                 MINNIE
                        I wished you believed in me.

                                 BARBARA
                             (earnest)
                        I do. I just know the way you’re 
                        talented can’t be summed up in some 
                        little two minute performance. Your 
                        talent’s too big for that stage. 

           Minnie rolls her eyes. Barbara is clumsy but sincere:

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t claim to understand you, 
                        Minnie, and I have no idea where 
                        you got your brain ‘cause I’m no 
                        Einstein, and your dad was the 
                        dumbest piece ‘a shit I ever met-

                                 MINNIE
                        Mom.
                                 BARBARA
                        -but you’re good, just as you are. 
                        You don’t have to prove a thing.

           Minnie doesn’t know what to say; she stares at the music.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Did you have a fight with your 
                        girlfriend? 

           Barbara looks patiently at Minnie. Minnie tried to hide her 
           panic.

                                 MINNIE
                        ...I don’t have a girlfriend.

           Barbara stands.

                                 BARBARA
                        Well, when you do, I’d love to meet 
                        her.

           She gently shuts the door behind her.

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE- DAY

           Helen sets a carved jack o’lantern on the front porch as kids 
           in costume walk by. 

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE

           Helen sets a full bowl of candy by the front door. She sits 
           on the couch and waits.

           She sees an empty box in the corner.

           CALLIE’S ROOM

           Helen stands with the empty box in front of Callie’s closet. 
           She takes a few shirts off the hangers and folds them. She 
           stops. 

           She hangs the shirts back up and puts them back in the 
           closet. 

           The doorbell rings. Helen goes downstairs, while we stay in 
           Callie’s room, still unchanged.

                                 KIDS (O.S.)
                        Trick or Treat!

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        Oh my gosh, look at you! I love 
                        your sparkly dress!
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - THEATRE - DAY

           Everyone is dressed in various Halloween costumes, except for 
           Minnie. 

           Minnie sits in the house studying her half sheet of music as 
           other students tech their pieces, a rock band playing 
           onstage. 

           Cara and Brandi sit behind her, arguing.

                                 BRANDI
                        I don’t know if the masks are 
                        appropriate.

                                 CARA
                        How’s else’ll the audience know 
                        you’re me?

                                 BRANDI
                        Maybe it’s not crucial they know 
                        it’s you, maybe you’re not the most 
                        important part.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (from the God Mic, also in 
                              costume)
                        Students!
                             (after they settle)
                        No talking in the house! If you are 
                        in the audience, all your energy is 
                        to be directed up on that stage! 
                        Ensemble!

           The rock band begins again. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minnie stands on the stage in front of a full house. The mic 
           shakes in her hand as the accompaniment for “You’ll Never 
           Walk Alone” starts to play. 

           Minnie freezes, misses her cue. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                             (from the God Mic)
                        Hold! Diego, can you...?

           The STAGE MANAGER stops the music.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                             (from the God Mic)
                        You missed it Minnie! Start again.

           The accompaniment starts from the top. At her cue:

                                 MINNIE
                        -and this is when I’ll sing-
                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (from the God Mic)
                        -into the mic-

                                 MINNIE
                             (into the mic)
                        -I said this is when I’ll sing.

           Beat.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (from the God Mic)
                        When?

                                 MINNIE
                        In the show. I’ll sing in the show.

           Beat. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Practice now, Minnie, that’s the 
                        point of rehearsal.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s not my process. I have to 
                        respect my process.

                                 CARA
                        She’s not gonna do it.

           Minnie glares at Cara.

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        Are you?

           Minnie is silent. 

                                 CARA (CONT'D)
                        Yup. Thought not.

           Minnie walks off the stage.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (from the God Mic)
                        Ok. Let’s move on.

           DRESSING ROOM - END OF REHEARSAL

           Minnie packs her bag. The walls of the dressing room are 
           covered in handwritten quotes from previous productions 
           signed by the student performers. 

           Minnie sees: “Anything you can do, I can do better,” Callie’s 
           swooping signature huge underneath. Minnie uncaps a Sharpie 
           and raises it to Callie’s quote.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (O.S.)
                        I wonder what you’re doing- 
           Minnie caps the Sharpie as Mrs. Murdaugh stands in the 
           doorway.

                                 MINNIE
                        Nothing. I was just-

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        -putting so much pressure on 
                        yourself to perform when you’ve 
                        never shown any interest before.

                                 MINNIE
                        ...Interests change, I’m changing.

           Mrs. Murdaugh studies Minnie.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        You know I don’t just teach 
                        Meisner, I practice it. At seeing 
                        past the bullcrap into people’s 
                        deepest truths.

           Minnie looks away.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        And I think your deepest truth...

           Minnie tries to look away. Mrs. Murdaugh holds her gaze.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        -is that you’re not doing this for 
                        you.

                                 MINNIE
                        I am. This is my chance to prove 
                        I’m special, I’m talented, I’m 
                        mother-freakin’ it.  

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Of course you are, but you can’t 
                        sing.

           Mrs. Murdaugh shrugs: “so, who cares?” Minnie looks at the 
           floor. 

                                 MINNIE
                        Helen likes that song.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        You’ve been hanging out with her a 
                        lot, huh?

                                 MINNIE
                        Someone needs to, she’s all alone.
                             (beat)
                        And we’re going through the same 
                        thing.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (gently)
                        No, you’re not.
           Minnie looks at Mrs. Murdaugh.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        I’m not saying that what you’re 
                        going through isn’t terrible, 
                        losing a friend at any age-

                                 MINNIE
                        -not friend. Best friend. Not 
                        Cara’s, or Brandi’s, or anyone else 
                        pretending to like, to I don’t 
                        know, win the Grief Olympics-

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        We know that. No matter how loudly 
                        anyone else claims it, we saw you 
                        and Callie together for years. Your 
                        heartbreak isn’t for show, it’s 
                        real. But it’s not the same as 
                        losing a child. 
                             (beat)
                        In less than a year, you’re going 
                        to go away to college.

                                 MINNIE
                        Not far, just to Fayetteville.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        ...since when?

           Minnie looks at the ground. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Minnie. Helen is grieving Callie’s 
                        future. You still have one. But if 
                        you stay here to try to take 
                        Callie’s place in any way-

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s not what I’m doing.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        -you’re going to fail. And you’ll 
                        hurt Helen and yourself in the 
                        process.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL- DAY

           Minnie bursts through the doors, where Kat waits outside.

                                 KAT
                        How’d it go?

           Minnie doesn’t break stride, heading for Callie’s car in the 
           lot. Kat rushes to catch up.
           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Helen steps out of the backdoor and puts on her running 
           shoes, the first time she’s attempted a run since the 
           accident. 

           She stretches, warms up her ankles. She starts at a gentle 
           jog down a path that leads from behind her house.

           I/E. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The DOORBELL RINGS. Another ring. Minnie holds down the 
           doorbell.

                                 KAT
                             (eager to leave)
                        Looks like nobody’s home...

           Minnie puts the key Helen gave her in the lock. Kat clocks 
           the key, weirded out.

                                 MINNIE
                             (off Kat’s look)
                        I just need to talk to her.

           Minnie steps inside.

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                             (calling out)
                        Helen?

           Kat hesitantly follows.

                                 KAT
                        Mrs. King?

           EXT. RUNNING PATH - CONTINUOUS

           Helen picks up speed, enjoying this more than she expected.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Kat clocks the framed photo of the family on a beach.

                                 KAT
                        Bet there’s some serious 
                        dysfunction under those smiles.

           Minnie heads upstairs.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                             (whispered)
                        Hurry up! I don’t want her to catch 
                        me here alone!
           Minnie vanishes out of sight. Kat begins to snoop.

           HELEN’S BEDROOM

           Minnie enters Helen’s bedroom tentatively.

                                 MINNIE
                        Helen?

           Minnie looks around the room. It’s the first time we/she has 
           seen it. Family pictures, a Greek icon of the Virgin Mary. 

           On a book shelf, Minnie sees a row of children’s books: from 
           “Goodnight Moon” to “Bunnicula”. Below them, a long line of 
           parenting books, including “Reviving Ophelia” and “Get Out of 
           My Life But First Could You Drive Me and Cheryl To The Mall”.

           On the nightstand: “The Unspeakable Loss. How Do You Live 
           After a Child Dies.” 

           Helen’s journal sits beside it, open, with Minnie’s note from 
           the gravesite tucked in. 

           RUNNING PATH

           Helen picks up speed. 

           KITCHEN

           Kat spots a pic of Minnie and Callie on the fridge. It’s the 
           one from the last day of school.

           HELEN’S BEDROOM

           Minnie sits on the bed, journal open in her lap. She’s 
           suddenly overwhelmed by Helen’s grief.

           LIVING ROOM

           Kat stands in front of Callie’s self portrait. She studies 
           it.

           She opens the fancy CD player and sees a blank CD. She pushes 
           play. The CD player lights up.

           RUNNING PATH

           Helen runs as fast as she possibly can, until she’s stopped 
           by:
           BACKYARD

           From Helen’s POV, a girl’s silhouette standing in the living 
           room. Helen stands, frozen.

           LIVING ROOM

           Kat steps back as the sound system comes to life.

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Minnie?

                                 MALE PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Did she ever call her Minnie Mouse?

           HELEN’S BEDROOM

           Minnie’s reading is interrupted by the voices playing 
           downstairs.

                                 HELEN (O.S.)
                        Do you think I could talk to her?

           LIVING ROOM

           Kat stands listening, confused, as the backdoor opens.

                                 MALE  PSYCHIC (V.O.)
                        Of course, what would you like to 
                        say?

           Minnie walks down the stairs. Helen stands in the doorway as 
           sounds of crying play overhead. 

                                 HELEN (V.O.)
                        Callie, honey...I don’t know if you 
                        can hear me...please come back. 
                        Come home. I’ll wait. I’ll be 
                        waiting-

           Helen hits stop on the CD player. She looks at Minnie, deeply 
           betrayed. 

           INT. CALLIE’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Minnie and Kat drive in silence.

                                 KAT
                        That was your friend in the 
                        pictures? The one who-?

                                 MINNIE
                        Callie.

           Beat.
                                 KAT
                        And Helen’s Callie’s mom?

           Minnie nods.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Kinda wish you had told me 
                        that. (beat) Actually, really wish 
                        you had told me.

                                 MINNIE 
                        What do you want to know?

           Beat.

                                 KAT
                        How’d she die?

                                 MINNIE
                        Car accident. 

           Kat nods. 

                                 MINNIE.
                        This car, actually. Flew through 
                        this windshield.

           Kat’s eyes go wide.

                                 KAT
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MINNIE
                        We don’t know why she crashed, but 
                        she wasn’t wearing a seat belt-

                                 KAT
                        -no, why are you driving her car?

                                 MINNIE
                        Helen gave it to me.

                                 KAT
                        Does your mom know that?

                                 MINNIE
                        No, she’d think it’s weird.

           Beat. 

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        What??

                                 KAT
                        Nothing! I just, I didn’t even know 
                        you were friends with this woman,
                        I just thought she was your music 
                        teacher.
                                 MINNIE
                        Well, she’s not, she’s Callie’s 
                        mom. 

                                 KAT
                        Got that.

                                 MINNIE
                        And now she’s kind of like... 

           Beat.

                                 KAT
                        Dude. Your mom sounds great.

           Minnie scoffs.

                                 MINNIE
                        No, she sucks. Just like yours.

           Silence.

                                 KAT
                        My mom doesn’t suck.

                                 MINNIE
                        Kinda sounds like she did.

                                 MINNI
                        ...She was a dick sometimes, but 
                        she’s like, the most important 
                        person-

                                 MINNIE
                        -why do you do that? You keep 
                        switching back and forth between 
                        past and present tense. 

                                 KAT
                        Because I don’t think of her as 
                        gone.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry you think that’s weird.

           Silence.

                                 KAT (CONT'D)
                        Pull over.

           Minnie looks at Kat, Kat stares forward. Minnie pulls over 
           the car. Kat opens the door and gets out.

                                 MINNIE
                        You’re just gonna leave?
                                 KAT
                        I know you’re in the lashing out 
                        phase, but I’m still fresh, dude. 

                                 MINNIE
                        It’s been over a year.

                                 KAT
                        That’s fresh. You’ll see.

           Kat shuts the door and walks away. Minnie hits the gas.

           INT. MINNIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM- NIGHT

           Minnie lies on the floor, staring into space. She hears keys 
           in the door and pretends to be asleep

           Barbara walks in, exhausted, carrying a sleeping Dustin. She 
           goes into Dustin’s room, then reappears after putting him to 
           bed. 

           Barbara carefully drapes a blanket over Minnie, then lies on 
           the couch to be close to her. Barbara closes her eyes.

           Minnie opens hers.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Minnie approaches the theatre as students hang a banner.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie walks through the theatre as different acts warm up.

           DRESSING ROOM

           She enters the dressing room and freezes. 

           Callie stands before her in a white dress and angel wings. 

           Minnie blinks. This is not a dream. She looks again, and 
           realizes that the face isn’t moving.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (O.S.)
                        Are you insane??

           Mrs. Murdaugh stands in front of Cara and Brandi - Cara wears 
           a mask of Callie’s face, Brandi is dressed in purple wearing 
           a mask of Cara.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        You thought this was a good idea?
                                 BRANDI
                             (meekly)
                        I didn’t.

                                 CARA
                        Shut up, Brandi! We wanted to make 
                        it clear that Brandi is me, and I’m 
                        Callie-

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        -so you thought, why don’t I wear 
                        the face of my dead friend when her 
                        mother is going to be here-

                                 CARA
                        -best friend. It’s a piece about 
                        best friends, ‘cause that’s what 
                        Callie and I were.

           Beat.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Cara, I’ve never said this in my 30 
                        year teaching career, but if you 
                        don’t do some serious self-
                        examination soon, you’re going to 
                        calcify into a putrid person and 
                        lead a selfish, desperate, hateful 
                        little life. 

           The room is speechless. 

           Cara throws her mask down and runs from the room. Brandi 
           throws both the masks in the trash and follows out the door.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna get fired for that. 

           Mrs. Murdaugh looks at Minnie.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Sure you want to do this?

           Minnie nods. 

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get this show on the road.

           PRELAP of AUDIENCE APPLAUDING over:

           PARKING LOT

           Families, students and teachers file into the theatre doors, 
           carrying bouquets of flowers.

           Helen parks and walks toward the front doors, parents and 
           students making room for her along the way. 
                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (V.O., PRE-LAP)
                        Good evening, everyone, welcome!

           She stops when she sees the banner overhead: “The Callie King 
           Memorial Talent Show: Remembering Our Shining Star.”

           Helen steadies herself.

           DRESSING ROOM

           Students put on makeup in front of brightly lit mirrors.  
           Minnie’s hand shakes. She tries to steady it.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (V.O., PRELAP)
                        Thank you for coming, dear friends 
                        and family. We’re so glad that 
                        you’re here.

           THEATER

           Mr. McClendon escorts Helen to a seat, “Reserved: Family.” 
           Mark sits a few seats down. Helen and Mark nod to each other 
           civilly.

           Brad sits in the back, cozy with a NEW GIRL in a Razorbacks 
           sweatshirt. 

           Kat sits near the front, alone. 

           THEATER WINGS

           Students in costumes, including Cara and Brandi, stand in the 
           wings listening.

           THEATER

           Mrs Murdaugh stands in a spotlight onstage in front of the 
           darkened house. Barbara rushes in with Dustin on her hip and 
           shimmies past sitting parents to take a seat.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (into a mic)
                        Now, the past three talent shows, 
                        something unprecedented happened: 
                        The same student won all three 
                        years.

           Mrs. Murdaugh looks at Helen; Helen smiles bashfully. 
           GREENROOM

           Minnie stares at herself in the mirror. 

           Mrs. Murdaugh’s voice carries through the speaker overhead.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH (V.O.)
                        Maybe all this was just Callie’s 
                        way of letting someone else win for 
                        a change.

           Minnie looks at Callie’s signature above.

           THEATER

           Mrs. Murdaugh makes eye contact with Helen, who looks away.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        No, that’s not true...

           DRESSING ROOM

           Minnie puts a hand on Callie’s signature, and closes her 
           eyes. She prays.

           THEATER

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                        Without further ado, I give you 
                        your multi-talented Charging 
                        Wildcats!

           Mrs. Murdaugh exits as a group of teens take their places 
           with instruments. A BOY WITH A GUITAR grabs the standing mic.

                                 BOY WITH GUITAR
                             (solemnly:)
                        This is for Callie.
                             (yelling:)
                        One, two, three!

           They play an assaulting, loud, metal “song”. They SCREAM into 
           the mics and bang their heads. Helen grimaces.

                                 BOY WITH GUITAR (CONT'D)
                             (scream-singing)
                        I want to hit you with a hammer, 
                        watch your brain drip down your 
                        spine!...

           THEATER - BEGIN MONTAGE

           A student tap dances, throwing kisses up to heaven. 
           A male magician clumsily makes pictures of Callie disappear 
           in small bursts of flames across the stage. His scantily clad 
           female assistant stands next to him and smiles. Kat watches 
           disapprovingly from the audience.

           A female student in a ballgown sings, “L is for the way you 
           look...at me...Callie, O...is for the only one....I See, 
           Callie...”

           The audience APPLAUDS intermittently. Helen tries to smile.

           A coed duo play an acoustic cover of “Time After Time.” It’s 
           simple and lovely. 

           After the first verse, lights come up on Brandi and Cara 
           center stage. No masks.

           They begin to move. At first it’s just a dance, but it 
           becomes beautiful - they’re exceptional dancers, but it’s 
           more than that. They move with longing and sincere grief. 

           As the song ends, Cara exits in a pool of light and Brandi 
           stands alone.

           After a pause, the audience rises in earnest applause. 
           Everyone - Barbara and Helen, too - cries.

           WINGS

           Minnie watches the dancers bow. As Cara exits into the wings 
           Mrs. Murdaugh envelops her in a sincere, maternal hug.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (to Minnie)
                        Go on.

           Minnie takes a breath, and walks onstage into the dark.

           THEATER

           Helen wipes her eyes as parents all through the theater 
           SNIFFLE and pull it together. 

           The lights go down, and the first few notes of “You’ll Never 
           Walk Alone” begin. Onstage, a light fades up, Minnie 
           resembling Callie’s silhouette. 

           Minnie hears her cue and begins to sing.

           She’s not tone deaf, but it’s close. This is an act of raw 
           bravery and catharsis that is ultimately awkward and painful 
           for everyone.

           Minnie begins to falter but then spots Helen in the audience. 
           Her commitment level rises while her talent level does not. 
           WINGS

           Mrs. Murdaugh watches with Cara and Brandi.

                                 MRS. MURDAUGH
                             (to  Cara)
                        Don’t say a word. 

                                 CARA
                        I didn’t.

           THEATER

           All the key players have a different reaction. Barbara wants 
           to look away but forces herself to watch.

           Helen watches with a journey of disbelief, disappointment, 
           and guilt. Suddenly, she stands and walks up the aisle.

           Minnie sees and her heart breaks. Barbara watches.

           She finishes to polite applause. Barbara applauds loudly. 
           Minnie leaves as a group of cloggers crowd the stage and 
           jaunty country music begins to play.

           Barbara stands and hurries up the aisle with Dustin.

           LOBBY

           Barbara tries to catch Helen as she moves to the doors.

                                 BARBARA
                        Helen? Are you leaving?

                                 HELEN
                        Yes, I don’t feel well.

                                 BARBARA
                        Can you wait a few minutes? I’m 
                        sure Minnie will want to see you.

                                 HELEN
                        I’d love to, but this is all a bit-

                                                          HELEN (CONT'D)
                          BARBARA
           -a lot, I can’t even imagine.
                                              -overwhelming.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        I’ll go get her, you wait here. 

                                 HELEN
                        I can’t. Please tell her she did a 
                        beautiful job.

                                 BARBARA
                        But she didn’t.
                             (beat)
                        She sucked.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        She can’t sing, she knows that, 
                        she’s not delusional. She did it to 
                        please you-

                           HELEN
                                                         BARBARA (CONT'D)
           That’s not-
                                              -to make you happy.

           Helen stares at Barbara.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Nothing can make me happy right 
                        now.

                                 BARBARA
                        I know, but she’s a kid.

                                 HELEN
                        Barbara, put yourself in my place 
                        for one second.

                                 BARBARA
                        I’ve been doing that, I’ve been 
                        trying to understand-

                                 HELEN
                        -well, you can’t, you have your 
                        kids, you have two. I’m sorry if 
                        Minnie misunderstood-

                                 BARBARA
                        Please stay. She saw you walk out, 
                        it’ll break her heart.

                                 HELEN
                        I can’t.

                                 BARBARA
                        Okay, then you’re an asshole.

                                 HELEN
                        What?

           An USHER pokes his head out from the theater.

                                 USHER
                             (whispering)
                        Excuse me, ladies?

                           LINDA
                                                         BARBARA
           Not now!
                                              Get out!

           He ducks back in.

           THEATER

           The cloggers enthusiastically clog on. Barbara and Helen’s 
           VOICES can be heard slightly over the music. A few audience-
           members notice.
           LOBBY

           Barbara puts Dustin down and points to a can on the floor.

                                 BARBARA
                        Hey, go play with that-

                                 HELEN
                             (to herself)
                        And the fantastic parenting 
                        continues.

                                 BARBARA
                        You’re the one abandoning-

                                 HELEN
                        -she’s your child, it’s your job to 
                        take care of her.

                                 BARBARA
                        She won’t let me anymore! She’s 
                        found an upgrade, she doesn’t want 
                        me.

                                 HELEN
                        That’s not my problem-

                                 BARBARA
                        -you created the problem!

                                 HELEN
                        Well, I screwed up, she’s not my 
                        kid!

           Beat. 

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        She’s not...

           Helen cries. Barbara softens.

                                 BARBARA
                        I know. 

           Barbara places a hand on Helen’s back. 

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t know what I’m doing.
                        I don’t know what to do.

           Barbara holds Helen; Helen lets her.

           DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Other performers giddily trade compliments. Minnie wipes off 
           her makeup, and stares at herself in the mirror, face bare. 
           Back to herself.
           LOBBY - LATER

           The lobby bustles with post-show energy. Parents present kids 
           with flowers. Cara and Brandi pose with a huge trophy, but 
           Cara doesn’t look happy. Winning didn’t help.

           Mark stands in a corner, alone. Brad approaches him and 
           shakes his hand. Mark’s smile fades as Brad introduces him to 
           the new girl.

           Barbara and Dustin wait in a corner, Kat nearby. 

           Minnie enters from the theater doors. A few boys WHISPER and 
           LAUGH.

           Barbara pulls her into a hug.

                                 BARBARA
                        Great job, honey.

                                 MINNIE
                        Where’s Helen?

                                 BARBARA
                        She had to go home. But she told me 
                        to tell you-

           Dustin tries to hand Minnie a rose.

                                 DUSTIN
                        -Min, look! 

                                 BARBARA
                             (to Minnie)
                        He’s got something for you.

           Minnie takes the rose, distracted.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Good job, Min!

                                 BARBARA
                        You gonna tell him thank you?

           Minnie hands the rose to Barbara and heads toward the door. 

                                 KAT
                        Minnie!

                                 MINNIE
                             (to Kat)
                        I have to go. 

           And she’s gone. Barbara watches Kat’s face fall.

                                 BARBARA
                        Sorry about that.
                                 KAT
                        That’s okay.
                             (beat)
                        Your Minnie’s mom?

                                 BARBARA
                        That’s right.

                                 KAT
                        I’m Kat.

                                 BARBARA
                        Holy crap, I recognize your voice.

                            KAT
                                                         BARBARA (CONT'D)
           What?
                                              Name. Recognize your name.

           Barbara takes her in.

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        It’s very nice to meet you.

           Kat smiles warmly. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        Dustin and me are gonna go back to 
                        the house, treat ourselves to some 
                        homemade root beer floats. I can’t 
                        guarantee Minnie will join, but 
                        you’re welcome to come. 

                                 KAT
                        Oh...
                             (beat)
                        Sure. That sounds fun.

           EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Minnie approaches the front door. She looks to Callie’s 
           window where the electric candle glows. MUSIC plays inside.

           She walks to the base of the ladder and climbs.

           INT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - CALLIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Minnie reaches the top as Callie’s voice, from a CD player, 
           sings “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” Callie’s voice is, of 
           course, lovely, but it should sound different than what we’ve 
           imagined. Not quite as exceptional.

           Helen sits on the bed. When she sees Minnie, she shuts off 
           the CD player.

                                 MINNIE
                        That’s what it’s supposed to sound 
                        like? 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)

                                 MINNIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re sitting by yourself in the 
                        dark.

                                 HELEN
                        Come in from the window, you might 
                        fall off that thing-

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m not going to fall, look. 

           Minnie shakes the ladder roughly. It almost tips over.

                                 HELEN
                        QUIT THAT AND GET IN HERE RIGHT 
                        NOW.

           Minnie climbs in. 

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        Teenagers are emotional terrorists, 
                        I swear.

           They sit on the bed together.

                                 MINNIE
                        What are you doing?

           Helen looks at the candle. 

                                 HELEN
                        It’s strange, I feel like two 
                        people: There’s the me that’s out 
                        in the world, and I’m “handling 
                        things very well.” Then there’s the 
                        other me. And the other me thinks 
                        she’s coming back.
                             (beat)
                        I know how that sounds.

           Beat.

                                 MINNIE
                        Tonight, I thought, I mean not 
                        really, not in my brain, but I 
                        thought I was going to open my
                        mouth onstage and that Callie’s 
                        voice was gonna come out. Or not 
                        her voice exactly, but something 
                        special. Not like mine. ‘Cause she 
                        was gonna, like, help.

                                 HELEN
                        I feel like I can’t give her
                        clothes away, because she’ll need 
                        them when she comes back. And I 
                        can’t move houses because she won’t 
                        know my new address.
                                 MINNIE
                        I think God’s pretend, but I’ve
                        been praying since she died. 

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t think I believe in God 
                        anymore.

                                 MINNIE
                        Everything I see is a sign.

                                 HELEN
                             (nodding)
                        I looked at my watch the other day, 
                        at 12:05-

                                 MINNIE
                        Her birthday, I did that, too.

                                 HELEN
                        Then I saw this little girl who 
                        looked so much like her.
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to pick her up and carry 
                        her home.

           The clock downstair chimes. They sit for the full ten chimes. 

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m going to go home now.

           Helen nods. Minnie heads for the window.

                        Do you want to come over? I could 
                        ask my mom. She’s mortifying, but 
                        sometimes she’s cool.

                                 HELEN
                        I want to stay here. But thank you. 

           Minnie climbs out the window and starts to descend down the 
           ladder. Helen averts her eyes.

                                 HELEN (CONT'D)
                        If you fall-

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m not going to.

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Minnie walks down her street and stands outside her house. 
           Through the window, she sees Kat performing the mentalism 
           math trick act for Barbara, Dustin, and the pets. 
           Minnie walks inside. We watch her join in.

                                                               FADE TO:

           BLACK

                                                               FADE UP:

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Minnie and Kat load Barbara’s car with suitcases and boxes, 
           The dogs jump all around them. There’s a new dog - it has 
           three legs.

           Barbara wears a “University of Chicago Mom” sweatshirt. 
           Dustin chases Minnie, and they chatter back and forth.

           Kat’s eyes are red and puffy. She kisses Minnie and Minnie 
           kisses her back. Barbara lets it go on for a minute.

                                 BARBARA
                        Ok, I’m right here, break it up. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Barbara shoves the last box in the car. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT'D)
                        We got two hours left ‘til we gotta 
                        go. Anything left you want to do?

           INT. NOVA/EXT. CALLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Minnie drives the stick shift Nova and parks a little way 
           down from Callie’s house. The ladder is gone. The house has 
           been repainted light green. The electric candle sits lit in 
           Callie’s window.

           Just then, Helen backs her car (not Callie’s car) out of the 
           garage, not seeing Minnie. 

           As Helen pulls away, Minnie follows.

           INT. NOVA/EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS

           Minnie drives, following Helen. They pass the high school, 
           where cheerleaders and the football team practice. The 
           scoreboard reads, “Welcome back, Wildcats!”

           They pass houses with a few pieces of toilet paper still 
           stuck up in the trees.
           EXT. SAINT ATHANASIUS CHURCH

           Helen parks her car in the full lot and Minnie watches her 
           hurry inside.

           INT. SAINT ATHANASIUS CHURCH - DAY

           Minnie slips through the door. This is a Greek Orthodox 
           church. It’s not hip, it’s ancient in its traditions and 
           aesthetic. 

           Minnie watches Helen take a seat, warmly greeting the WOMAN 
           who’d saved it for her.

           A PRIEST stands at the alter. His back is turned to the 
           congregation and he speaks only in Greek.

           Minnie listens to the sermon. She tries to understand at 
           first but then gives herself over to making the meaning 
           herself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           After the service, Minnie watches as Helen talks easily to 
           people who mill about. Minnie realizes Helen has friends.  

           Minnie sees a row of candles on the side of the church and 
           walks over to them. She lights one.

           Helen notices Minnie for the first time. She watches Minnie 
           light the candle, then leave.

           EXT. MINNIE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 

           Barbara sits on the porch with Kat, Dustin, and the dogs. 
           Dustin runs up to Minnie, and she picks him up.

                                 BARBARA
                        All set?

                                 MINNIE
                        Yeah, I’m ready.

           Barbara, Dustin, and Minnie load into the car, Minnie 
           driving. Kat waves as they drive down the block and out of 
           sight.

           FADE TO BLACK.
