                                 For my love, Kenny -
                           Thank you for making me feel understood
                                                                    iii.

          SCREENWRITER'S NOTE:

          As you're reading, you'll be introduced to 2 different fonts:

          1) All action lines written in this font indicate that we are 
          seeing the world as "normal" people see it. 

          2) All action lines written in this font indicate that we are seeing the world as Annalise sees 
          it: "Annalise's POV - Special Vision" 

          Don't you worry too much about this now. 

          I'll walk you through it.  
           OVER BLACK:
                                    A clock’s steady tick... tick... tick...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1967

           Tick... tick... tick... continues from a GRANDFATHER CLOCK...

           ...which is being intently watched by a GIRL: ANNALISE (17). 

           Hm. Annalise looks to be an exceedingly ordinary girl. 

           An embodiment of unremarkable. The epitome of plain. 

           She perches-- expressionless-- on a stiff-backed chair in her 
           family’s pristine (yet bland) 1960s living room. 

           Tick... Tick... Tick... Her EYES set on that clock... Until--

           Annalise abruptly latches her sharp GAZE onto us instead.  

           And here, a sage STORYTELLER draws us into our FAIRY TALE: 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise had always seen things 
                        differently from her peers... 

           Suddenly we move around the side of Annalise-- Curving behind 
           her until the back of her head BLOCKS our view of the world-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Be not mistaken: This was not a 
                        metaphorical difference... 

           --and as we emerge from the other side of Annalise, our view 
           of the world is now TRANSFORMED into Annalise’s Vision.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This was quite a literal one. 

           Through Annalise’s eyes, the world indeed looks entirely, radically different. 

           For one, the colors in the room have changed; the previously restrained scene is now 
           composed of VIBRANT HUES. Some colors are merely more saturated versions of 
           normal vision, and other colors have changed completely. 

           For another, half of all the objects in the room look like completely different objects 
           in Annalise’s eyes. The COUCH now looks to be a slumbering TIGER; the CARPET 
           now a blanket of LILY PADS; the CURTAINS a cascade of LIGHTBULBS; the 
           RADIO a ROAST TURKEY; the LAMP a BIRTHDAY BALLOON.
            And that GRANDFATHER CLOCK is now a TRAFFIC LIGHT. Tick--tick--ticking 
           from red... to yellow... to green... and back... 

           We continue to rotate around Annalise-- And as we face her once more, we find that 
           Annalise herself actually looks quite the same as she did to the “normal” eye: same 
           plain hair, plain face, plain disposition. 

           But her clothes have drastically changed. Her once prim dress is now a garment 
           made of COOKIES, and the lop-sided HAIR RIBBON that had been tied in her hair 
           is now a large, writhing WORM. 

           The worm’s tail FLOPS onto Annalise’s forehead. She reaches to move it just as-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Indeed, it may seem an absurd and 
                        peculiar vision--

           We rotate behind Annalise’s head-- her hair BLOCKING our view once more--  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --but to Annalise this was the 
                        natural state of the world. 

           --and when we emerge back out the other side, we again see 
           the world normally. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It always had been. 
                        And it always would be.

           Annalise finishes adjusting the PINK RIBBON in her hair, 
           which is no longer a worm to our eyes. 

           Throughout it all, Annalise’s gaze remains on the grandfather 
           CLOCK. Throughout it all, the clock soldiers on...

           Tick... tick... tick... 

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        It’s almost time! 

           Annalise’s eyes flit from the CLOCK to the WOMAN whisking 
           into the room. This is Annalise’s MOTHER (40s). 

           Mother is preened with such a precision it verges on 
           unsettling. She keeps her home in a similar condition. 

           Mother swoops to the coffee table, placing a serving TRAY 
           onto it. She jabbers at an alarming pace: 
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Never have I had such a bother in 
                        the kitchen! I tell you, Annalise, 
                        it was simply impossible to decide 
                        what to serve today! 

           On the tray: Mother rotates a plate ever-so-slightly--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Brisket! ...Is what I thought at 
                        first. Who doesn’t love a brisket? 

           On the tray: Mother adjusts a napkin’s fold ever-so-slightly-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        But then I wondered: What kind of 
                        meats do Chinese people like 
                        anyhow? Some of those meats I see 
                        hanging around Chinatown-- those 
                        duck heads and whatnot-- I don’t 
                        know about those. Turns my stomach, 
                        to be perfectly honest. Who knows? 
                        Maybe brisket is to them like duck 
                        heads are to me!

           On the tray: Mother aligns each fork ever-so-slightly-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        So I thought: How about a nice Jell-
                        O? Colorful, fun, low in calories-- 
                        But then I remembered I heard from 
                        Mrs. Schwartz that she read in Time 
                        Magazine that many Asian cultures 
                        don’t eat much sugar, they have 
                        things like nuts for dessert. So of 
                        course I canned the Jell-O idea-- 

           On the tray: Mother plucks the last stray crumb away-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        And then I really went down the 
                        rabbit hole. Chopped liver? Too 
                        fatty. Pickles? Too salty. Deviled 
                        eggs? Too boring. Martinis? Not 
                        boring enough! 

           Mother SMILES down at the tray on the coffee table. 
           Everything in its place.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Finally I thought to myself: TOAST! 

           Mother moves aside to reveal that on the tray is, indeed, a 
           stack of DRY TOAST. 
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Plain old toast: no fuss, no 
                        frills. Surely that’d be 
                        unobjectionable! 

           Mother’s smile falters ever-so-slightly...

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        ... Right? 

           Annalise has not said a single word. Has not even opened her 
           lips. Instead, she’s STARING at that Grandfather CLOCK... 

           Tick... tick... tick... 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Annalise? Don’t you think...? 

           Mother turns to Annalise and FROWNS. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, now Annalise--  You’ve gone and 
                        mussed up your hair again! What did 
                        I say about touching your ribbon? 

           Annalise doesn’t respond. Blank face. Eyes on the clock. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                             (as if Annalise had 
                              answered)
                        That’s right! We don’t touch it. We 
                        don’t touch it, or move it, or-- or 
                        anything, we just sit still. 
                        Perfectly still, alright? 

           Mother scurries up to Annalise and begins primping her-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Not to worry-- We’ll get you fixed 
                        up, quick as a bunny. 

           Mother finishes fiddling with Annalise’s hair. She brushes 
           aside a final strand and admires her daughter. 

           Mother KISSES Annalise on the forehead affectionately. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        There we are. Now sit up straight, 
                        darling. 

           Mother goes to the couch and seats herself just so. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        They’ll be here any minute... 
           Mother turns her attention to the grandfather clock as well.

           The two sit, stock-still, silent... Watching... Waiting...

           And it’s then that Annalise’s EYES (still steadfast in their 
           stare) gloss ever-so-slightly--

           --with TEARS. 

           Tick... tick... tick--! 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                        It wouldn’t be until 1969 that 
                        Kübler-Ross would publish her model 
                        on the Five Stages of Grief-- 

           INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

           SUPER: 1950 

           Mother (now 20s) is in the midst of giving birth. FATHER 
           (20s) frets by her side. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --but Annalise had experienced each 
                        Stage with utmost agony throughout 
                        the 1950s and 60s in her youth.

           Finally-- WAHHHH! A baby’s cry! Annalise is born! A NURSE 
           lowers baby Annalise into Mother’s arms. Mother BEAMS 
           tearfully down at her newborn daughter: 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh. She’s just perfect. 

           Clock sound: Tick--! 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 

           SUPER: 1953-1955: Denial

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        At first, little Annalise was lost 
                        in the confusing fog of Denial. 

           Mother (20s) and Annalise (3) huddle with other MOMS and 
           TODDLERS in a cozy Public Library story circle.  

           Mother points to a picture of a GIRAFFE in the children’s 
           book she’s showing to Annalise-- 
                                 MOTHER
                        Giraffe. See? Can you say giraffe?  

           Little Annalise squints at the picture, then points excitedly 
           out the window at a MAPLE TREE.  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Giraffe! 

                                 MOTHER
                        No, Annalise, that’s a tree...

           Annalise furrows her brow in confusion at the book-- while we 
           rotate behind little Annalise’s head--

           --to find that in Annalise’s Special Vision, the maple tree outside the window is 
           indeed a GIRAFFE. Annalise peeks over to find that Giraffe is peeking right back at 
           her! Annalise shyly waves “hi” to the Giraffe. The Giraffe almost seems to GRIN...

                                 ANNALISE
                             (soft smile)
                        Giraffe... 

           --We rotate behind Annalise, back to normal vision. With a 
           HUFF, Mother pulls the Picture Book closer to Annalise’s 
           face. Annalise’s smile VANISHES. 

                                 MOTHER
                        No-- No! Annalise, focus! Giraffe! 

           Mother offers a strained SMILE to the disapproving MOM 
           sitting next to her. Annalise POUTS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Little Annalise had come to the 
                        conclusion that surely there must 
                        be some miscommunication afoot... 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           INT. MOTHER’S CAR - DAY

           Father (20s) drives the family CAR wearing his yarmulke. 
           Mother (20s) perches in the passenger seat with Annalise (4) 
           on her lap. All dressed in their Bar-Mitzvah-Attending-Best. 

           It’s POURING RAIN outside, splattering the windshield. Little 
           Annalise is dazzled by how it looks.  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Look, Mommy! Money! 
                                 MOTHER
                        Where, darling? 

           We move around behind Annalise-- to find that in Annalise’s Vision the 
           RAINDROPS outside instead look like glittering COINS. Each one explodes into 
           silvery DUST when they hit the windshield. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Money! Money! All over the place! 

           --as we return to Normal, Mother looks pointedly over at 
           Father. Father avoids Mother’s eyes. 

                          MOTHER
                                                         FATHER
                 (hiss)
                                                (hushed)
           Honestly, Harold! Listen--
                                              I know! I know, dear... 

           Little Annalise’s enthusiasm wilts. She can tell she’s upset 
           her parents somehow... What did she do!?  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Surely it couldn’t be that 
                        something was wrong with her... 

           Unsure Annalise burrows further into Mother’s sure arms... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...could it? 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY

           Annalise (5) squirms as a DOCTOR shines a LIGHT directly into 
           her eye. Mother (20s) watches the examination worriedly. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Alas, no doctor had ever 
                        encountered anything like 
                        Annalise’s unique sight. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           MOTHER and FATHER sit opposite the Doctor at his desk. They 
           clasp each others hands as they wait for the doctor to speak. 

           Doctor SIGHS, takes off his glasses before explaining to 
           them. But we can’t hear what the Doctor is saying. All we can 
           see is Mother and Father absorbing his words, filling with a 
           sickening DREAD... 
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And so Annalise’s doting parents 
                        were left only with the grim 
                        diagnosis that Annalise was what 
                        they classified then as...

           Doctor’s lips move in sync with Storyteller’s voice: 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...mentally disturbed.

           Mother and Father are utterly DEVASTATED. Broken.  

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           INT. ANNALISE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           SUPER: 1956-1959: Anger

           Annalise (6) throws an all-out TANTRUM on her bedroom floor. 

                    STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                                                        ANNALISE
                 (shouting over 
                 Annalise’s screaming)
                                              NO!!! MOMMY NO!!!! PLEASE 
                                              DON’T!!!!
           By Annalise’s 6th birthday, 
           her patience with the 
           misunderstandings had run its 
           course, and she instead 
           simmered constantly in the 
           Anger phase.

           Mother in curlers, a housecoat, and no make-up (not her usual 
           presentable self) approaches Annalise with a PINK HAIR 
           RIBBON. As she does, Mother CRIES passively. TEARS drip from 
           her eyes, but her hollow expression is heartbreakingly BLANK.

                     ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                                                         MOTHER
                                                (whisper)
           THE WORM’S ICKY!!! I WON’T 
           WEAR IT, I WON’T!!! 
                                              Please... 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Annalise wears a birthday HAT, sits in front of a birthday 
           CUPCAKE, and SCREAMS! Mother and Father watch her, deadpan. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        She screamed--

           TEACHER lugs KICKING Annalise (6) down the school hallway.

           Father wrestles with Annalise (7) to buckle her car lap belt. 
           Annalise sinks her TEETH into Father’s hand-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)

           Annalise (8) STRUGGLES in Mother’s grip, dragged along for

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --she fought. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Annalise (8) scribbles on the classroom’s blackboard. Teacher 
           scrutinizes her writing.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Every correction served her-- 

                                 TEACHER
                             (pointing to a world map)
                        No, this is blue!

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Annalise (7) curiously lifts a ROTTEN APPLE out of the 
           kitchen garbage. Mother notices--

                                 MOTHER
                        No, that is old!

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           In swimsuits, Neighbor KID and Annalise (6) argue by a 
           SPRINKLER they’re playing in. 

                                 KID
                        Yes, you are wrong!
           INT./EXT. CLASSROOM / KITCHEN / NEIGHBORHOOD - VARIOUS

           Split Screen: In all 3 scenarios (Teacher/Classroom, Mother/ 
           Kitchen, Kid/Neighborhood) Annalise opens her mouth--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --was met with battle cries. 

           --and SCREECHES!!!! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This happened at home to the result 
                        of punishment--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Father SPANKS Annalise (7) on the behind. 

                                 FATHER
                        Don’t treat your mother like that! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This happened in the school yard to 
                        the result of ostracism--

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           A gang of KIDS surround Annalise (8) on the playground. 

                                 KID
                        You can’t play with us, moron! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It even happened in her mind-- 

           INT. ANNALISE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Annalise (9) stews in bed, unable to sleep. FURY in her eyes. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --in the dark of her room, far past 
                        when the house had grown still, 
                        when she internally berated herself 
                        for being so alien. 

           Annalise suddenly PUNCHES her pillow with RAGE! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Why couldn’t she be a normal girl!? 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And then came the Bargaining. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

           SUPER: 1959: Bargaining

           Annalise (9) and ALL her extended family-- Aunts, Uncles, 
           Grandparents, Cousins-- cram around the dining room table for 
           Passover Seder. The room BUZZES with energy.

           But Annalise is not buzzing with energy. She slumps at the 
           table, lost in her own world... gazing at her Grandpa’s TOUPEE, which is a 
               plump TARANTULA in her eyes. Each of its 8 legs takes turns itching his scalp, until 
           Grandpa reaches up and SCRATCHES it roughly. The tarantula winces in pain...  

           ...Annalise tunes back into reality just as Father proclaims:

                                 FATHER
                        Time to find the afikoman! 

           All the other little kids in the room SQUEAL and go racing 
           out of the room. Father CHUCKLES at their excitement. 

           But Annalise stays put at the table. She zones out once more.

           Father notices; his smile slips right off his face. He places 
           a ginger hand on Annalise’s shoulder. 

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you join the others? 

           Annalise doesn’t respond. She simply holds her father’s gaze 
           without a trace of emotion. 

           Then Annalise slides out of her seat without a word. 

           Annalise trudges slowly through the house. Family members 
           flit and flounce around her. Children go peeping under 
           furniture and behind curtains for the afikoman. 

           But Annalise makes a beeline for the front door--

           EXT. ANNALISE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Annalise shuts the house’s front door behind her. She plops 
           down onto the porch’s steps, wraps her arms around her knees. 

           She SIGHS. Alone. 

           Suddenly-- She perks up! What’s that? She hears something... 
           someone MUTTERING? 
                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        No! I-- I-- get off me! Get off me! 

           Annalise hesitantly rises to her feet, inches toward the 
           sound of the voice... It seems to be coming from the well-
           manicured BUSHES lining the house... 

           But it’s DARK... Annalise must squint to make anything out... 

           And then the muttering CEASES. Huh? Annalise cocks her head. 
           Listens with all her might. UNTIL-- 

                                 UNCLE GERRY
                        STOP IT! DON’T-- TOUCH-- ME! 

           UNCLE GERRY (30s) LEAPS out of the bushes toward Annalise! 

           Annalise stumbles backwards, falls on her butt! She SCREAMS! 

           But Uncle Gerry barely notices Annalise as he rolls on the 
           front lawn. He writhes, YANKING his SHIRT off over his head--

                                 UNCLE GERRY (CONT’D)
                        AH! Strangle, strangle me to death!

           Annalise scrambles to her feet, backs HORRIFIED toward the 
           front door-- just as MOTHER opens it! 

                                 MOTHER
                             (panicked)
                        Annalise!? 

           Mother takes in the scene: Uncle Gerry’s now frantically 
           removing his PANTS as well, underwear on display to Suburbia. 
           Mother’s face goes from PANIC to-- utmost PITY. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh-- Gerry... 

           Mother covers Annalise’s eyes with her hand just as Uncle 
           Gerry JUMPS to his feet. 

                                                       UNCLE GERRY
                                                (to Mother, tearful)
                      MOTHER (CONT’D)
           HAROLD! DAVID! NOAM! Get out 
           here! 
                                              Clementine-- Clemmie-- don’t 
                                              come any closer-- I can’t 
                                              protect you!

           Uncle Gerry spins around-- WIELDING something SHINY in his 
           hand. A POCKET KNIFE. 

                         ANNALISE
                                                         MOTHER
                 (scared)
                                              Oy-- HAROLD! 
           Mother!?
           Annalise CLINGS to Mother’s legs as Father and UNCLES DAVID 
           (20s) and NOAM (20s) stampede onto the porch. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Another episode--

                                 FATHER
                        Not again... 

           Annalise is TERRIFIED as she watches Father, David, and Noam 
           surround Uncle Gerry. Uncle Gerry spins wildly in circles, 
           pointing his pocket knife at God-knows-what. 

                                                       UNCLE DAVID
                        UNCLE NOAM
           Gerry-- Gerry, take it easy! 
                                              Hey! Buddy! Put the knife 
                                              down, will ya? 

           Uncle Gerry begins to BLUBBER. Utterly LOST. 

                                                         FATHER
                                              There’s nothing out to get 
                                              ya, Gerry!
                        UNCLE GERRY
           Fellas, please, I-- I can’t 
           protect all of you at once! I 
           can’t-- I can’t!

           Uncle Gerry abruptly LUNGES toward Uncle David-- 

                        UNCLE DAVID
                                                       UNCLE NOAM
           AHHH!
                                              Whoa-- whoa-- get his arm! 

           Mother GASPS and SHIELDS Annalise while Father, David, Noam 
           TACKLE Uncle Gerry. They PIN him down. Uncle Gerry HOWLS!  

                                 MOTHER
                             (breathless, to Annalise)
                        Oh! Don’t worry, darling-- Don’t-- 
                        Don’t worry. Uncle Gerry’s okay, he-
                        - he just-- 
                             (sigh)
                        Sometimes he sees things that 
                        aren’t there... 

           At that, Annalise’s eyes WIDEN. 

           She looks up to her Mother, voice SHAKING: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        ...What sorts of things?

           But Mother doesn’t respond. She’s too choked up. 

                                 FATHER 
                        We’ve gotta make the call!
           EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           RED and BLUE lights flash across Annalise’s face. She-- along 
           with the rest of her ENTIRE FAMILY-- gawk from the front 
           porch as EMTs and COPS wrangle frightened (and nearly-naked) 
           Uncle Gerry onto a GURNEY. 

           Uncle Gerry WAILS as EMTs tighten RESTRAINTS around him. 

           Mother’s mortified as NEIGHBORS emerge from their homes to 
           take a peek at the hubbub. Mother ushers the rest of the 
           family back inside the house to save face. 

           But Annalise remains. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This is when Annalise made the deal 
                        with herself:

           Annalise’s gaze is UNWAVERING as Uncle Gerry’s loaded into 
           the back of the ambulance. LOCKED AWAY. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Never tell anyone your secret, and 
                        you’ll maintain your freedom at 
                        least. 

           Annalise presses her lips TIGHTLY together as the ambulance’s 
           SIRENS rev up--  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Thus her silence was solidified.

           Throughout this MONTAGE, the WORLD around Annalise moves in 
           FAST MOTION, while Annalise herself moves in SLOW MOTION.

           A) INT. ANNALISE’S ROOM - DAY/NIGHT 

           Annalise (13) lies listlessly in bed. The sun rises and sets. 
           Concerned Mother and Father enter and exit.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Once Annalise stopped speaking 
                        altogether, her real loneliness 
                        calcified. And with that loneliness 
                        came Depression, the heaviest and 
                        most crushing kind. 
           B) INT. BATHROOM - DAY  

           Mother (30s) flutters around Annalise (14) in the bathroom. 
           Mother brushes Annalise’s teeth for her, combs Annalise’s 
           hair for her, dresses Annalise in clothes for her. Annalise 
           stares vacantly at herself in the mirror throughout. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise struggled to grasp at any 
                        motivation to keep going. There was 
                        no point to her life at home, the 
                        burden of her existence 
                        beleaguering her parents.

           C) INT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Annalise (15) plods through the sea of STUDENTS-- in a 
           classroom, in the hallway, in the cafeteria. Ignored by all. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        There was no point to her life at 
                        school-- a queen pariah, an outcast 
                        to the outcasts. 

           D) INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Sitting at a booth in a DINER, Annalise (16) scribbles in a 
           JOURNAL. She’s incredibly focused on her scrawling. Diner 
           PATRONS and WAITRESSES dart around her: coming and going, 
           eating and cleaning, talking and laughing. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And finally, there was no point to 
                        her future. Who would hire a dumb 
                        mute? Who would marry a social dud? 
                        Who would eventually replace her 
                        parent’s unyielding affection? What 
                        was the point of it all!?

           Suddenly-- the FAST MOTION of the world around Annalise 
           SLOWS. Annalise’s SLOW MOTION catches up. The world and 
           Annalise both move at the same NORMAL PACE once more. 

           Annalise stares down at something she’s written in the 
           journal. She’s circled it: 

                                    THERE IS NO POINT.

           Annalise reads it once more... then sits back in her seat. 

           Satisfied. 
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Annalise (17) strolls down the sunny sidewalk, looking quite 
           lovely in a delicate dress and curled hair. The trace of a 
           SMILE lingers on her lips...

           Annalise pauses-- takes off one SHOE-- and places it 
           deliberately on the ground. She then turns off the sidewalk’s 
           path and heads into the FOREST lining it... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...It felt almost peaceful when the 
                        thought struck Annalise that she 
                        could end her life. 

           INT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Annalise breathes in the fresh air as she meanders through 
           this lush forest. Taking her time. Savoring... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        She plotted it quite carefully, 
                        leaving a shoe of hers behind so 
                        they could find her remains and 
                        grant her family some closure. She 
                        even selected her second-best dress 
                        to wear for the occasion. 

           Finally, Annalise stops. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Second best, of course, so her 
                        mother could put her in the best 
                        one for the burial. 

           Annalise neatly seats herself in the dirt, taking care to fan 
           her beautiful skirts out around her. As she does so-- We 
           circle behind Annalise, her head BLOCKING our view--

           --and when we pass to the other side of her, we see everything in Annalise’s Vision. 

           The forest is truly an extraordinary sight to behold, in Annalise’s eyes: 

           It’s a kaleidoscope of vibrant COLORS. Half of all the FOLIAGE has transformed 
           into strange and wondrous objects: a regal OSTRICH, a handsome GREEK STATUE, 
           a towering stack of MUSIC BOXES, a cluster of DRAGON FRUIT. Annalise’s dress is 
           now made of opaque STAINED GLASS. 

           But we can barely focus on these charming details-- because Annalise has reached 
           into her skirt pocket and pulled out a GUN. 
           Annalise’s hand trembles, but she presses the gun FIRMLY to her temple. Resolute. 

           Annalise sharply INHALES-- COCKS THE GUN--! 

               And hesitates... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                             (whisper)
                        There was one last voice inside her 
                        that begged Annalise not to shoot--

           RAPID FLASHES OF MEMORIES: 
           - Mother tucking Annalise snugly into bed 
           - Annalise bopping to an UPBEAT SONG on the RADIO
           - Annalise relishing the taste of fresh-baked cookies

           Back to Annalise in this very moment, the gorgeous SUNSHINE warming her face... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...But she soothed it away by 
                        acknowledging that, while it was 
                        difficult... it was ultimately the 
                        only choice she had.

           Annalise CLOSES her teary eyes with finality. She SWALLOWS. 

           Her whole body TENSES as she PULLS THE GUN’S TRIGGER!

           JUST as she does this, we SPIN behind her head-- passing 
           RIGHT THROUGH the spot where the bullet soon will EXPLODE out 
           of Annalise’s SKULL--! 

           But--!!

           There’s no CRACK of the GUNSHOT... 

           ...in fact, there’s barely any sound at all... 

           ...and as we circle around to face Annalise, back to normal 
           vision again, we find out why: 

           THE GUN in Annalise’s hand is NOT A GUN at all. In normal 
           vision, it is instead a tube of TOOTHPASTE. 

           Annalise’s fingers GRIP it tightly. A dollop of toothpaste 
           slimes itself down Annalise’s temple... 

           And as Annalise realizes that she is not dead... she slowly 
           opens her eyes once more... 
           BEWILDERMENT-- then HORROR-- fills her face... as she lowers 
           the TUBE of toothpaste into her lap... as she brushes her 
           fingers over the TOOTHPASTE dripping down her cheek... 

           ...and slowly, the awful REALIZATION that her cruel vision 
           has once again TRICKED HER sinks in... 

           Until finally, Annalise crumples in her spot and WEEPS. 

           We are forced to bear witness to her UNRELENTING WEEPING as 
           the afternoon gradually wanes into dusk...

           Eventually, Annalise has no more tears to weep. 

           It’s nearly dark now. Annalise’s eyes are devoid of emotion. 
           Her body completely INERT. 

           Finally, Annalise drags her palms to the ground, and PUSHES 
           herself to STAND. 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD / ANNALISE’S HOUSE - DUSK

           SUPER: 1967: Acceptance

           Annalise trudges home in the last rays of the sun. She’s so 
           lacking in luster, she appears zombie-like. Her one SHOE-LESS 
           foot is caked in DIRT.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        By the time 1967 rolled around, 
                        Annalise found herself at her final 
                        destination, the last stage of 
                        grief: Acceptance.

           When Annalise reaches her house, Mother is outside, 
           impatiently waiting for her. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Annalise, where have you been!? 
                        Your father’s already back in from 
                        the city! Dinner’s getting cold!

           Annalise-- as always-- doesn’t respond, doesn’t react in any 
           way. She simply continues her trudge up the porch steps. 
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh-- Annalise! What happened to 
                        your shoe, darling? Your foot is 
                        positively filthy! 

           Mother shepherds Annalise inside the house--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        No bother, we’ll get you fixed up, 
                        quick as a bunny. 

           Mother SHUTS the front door. And we are left in the 
           twilight... In the QUIET of the neighborhood... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...Acceptance is such a funny 
                        descriptor for where Annalise found 
                        herself. 

           Clock sound: Tick--!

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Annalise-- freshly washed with wet hair-- sits at the dinner 
           table. Her parents chatter to each other, but Annalise gazes 
           blankly at her untouched FOOD, which looks like a pile of BROKEN 
           CHILDREN’S TOYS in her eyes. A severed DOLL HEAD gazes blankly back at her...   

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Acceptance conjures the sentiment 
                        of embrace, or peacefulness. 
                        That there’s been some triumph. 
                        That the worst is over.

           Clock sound: Tick--!
                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But no. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1967

           Back to where we first met Annalise: In the LIVING ROOM 
           watching the GRANDFATHER CLOCK with MOTHER. Waiting...  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        For Annalise, Acceptance was a 
                        begrudging resignation
                            an abandonment of hope
                                a giving up 
                        as she patiently waited for her 
                        life to tick... away...
           Annalise BLINKS-- and the TEARS we momentarily saw in her 
           eyes before CLEAR. She STARES into the face of the clock. 

           The CLOCK’S minute hand inches CLOSER and CLOSER to the top 
           of the hour: Tick... tick... tick... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        By now, Annalise had not spoken a 
                        single word in over 7 years.

           We slowly inch toward Annalise, getting closer and closer and 
           CLOSER to her... Tick... tick... tick... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        In all that time, she had never 
                        wavered in her muteness.

           Tick--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Had never strayed from her facade 
                        of simpleness. 

           Tick--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Had never escaped her tomb of 
                        loneliness.

           Tick--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Not once. 

           Tick--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Not ever. 

           TICK!

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        That is, until she met Peter Song.

           DONG! DONG! DONG! The grandfather clock CHIMES on the hour! 

           And just after it-- 

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK coming from the front door--

           Mother leaps to her feet with a brilliant SMILE!
                                 MOTHER
                        Ah! Right on time! 

           Mother plucks up a full TEACUP from the tray on the coffee 
           table and hands it to Annalise-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Here-- Offer this to Mrs. Song when 
                        she comes in!

           Annalise takes the teacup, still deeply unenthused. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Alright, now let me see that 
                        dazzling smile! 

           Annalise forces an especially underwhelming SMILE. Mother 
           practically BOUNCES with glee.  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Perfect!

           Mother hastens to answer the door-- And that smile plops 
           right off of Annalise’s face--

           INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR/PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Mother flings the front door open with a flourish! Revealing 
           that behind it stands: MRS. SONG (40s) and her son, PETER 
           SONG (17). 

           Mrs. Song rivals Mother’s fastidious appearance. She wears a 
           rather fashionable qipao (Chinese dress) and holds a small 
           porcelain dish in her manicured hands. A GOLD RING gleams 
           from one of her fingers.

           Peter Song, well. He looks to be an exceedingly ordinary boy--

           --save for the swath of BURN SCARS marring one side of his 
           face. Peter slumps next to Mrs. Song, attempting to hide his 
           scars from view. 

           Actually, it looks as though Peter’s attempting to hide his 
           entire self from view-- hunching, leaning, shrinking. Peter 
           is the type that prefers to go altogether unnoticed. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Mrs. Song! How lovely of you to 
                        visit. 

           Mrs. Song has a Chinese accent. She enunciates each English 
           word carefully to mitigate it:
                                 MRS. SONG
                        Thank you for having us.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, nonsense, it’s my pleasure. And 
                        you must be Peter!

           Peter peeks bashfully up through his eyelashes, head bowed. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        So nice to finally meet you! 

           Mother and Mrs. Song exchange knowing grins before Mother 
           steps aside to welcome them in: 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Come in, come in! Make yourselves 
                        comfortable, don’t be shy--!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Mother steers Mrs. Song toward the Living Room couch. Mrs. 
           Song hands Mother the porcelain bowl: 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        I have boiled peanuts to share. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Aw, how very thoughtful! 
                             (I-told-you-so)
                        See? Annalise? Nuts. 

           Annalise ignores her mother, instead rising languidly from 
           her seat and offering the TEACUP to Mrs. Song-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Ah, yes! Mrs. Song, this is 
                        Annalise! She’s made you some tea--

                                 MRS. SONG 
                        Thank you very much, Annalise. 
                             (in MANDARIN, to Peter)
                        Bide (Peter)! Hurry up! 

           Mrs. Song GLARES over at Peter who’s shuffling into the room-- 

           That’s when Annalise TURNS-- 

           --and Annalise sees PETER SONG for the very first time. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Of course, Annalise did not see him 
                        the way the rest of the world did--
           Annalise GASPS involuntarily! 

           Her hands loosen, DROPPING the teacup to the floor where it 
           CRACKS into two pieces! TEA splashes on the pristine carpet!  

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh! Annalise! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But even Annalise had never seen 
                        anyone like Peter Song before. 

                                                  MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                                                (in MANDARIN, to Peter)
                          MOTHER
           Silly girl-- she, um. She’s a 
           dainty thing-- 
                                              Look what you’ve done, you’ve 
                                              startled the girl! 

           Peter’s bewildered by Annalise’s SHOCKED gawking at him. What 
           did he do!? Mrs. Song hastily grabs Peter by the arm and 
           seats him on the couch next to her. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, not to worry! Annalise will get 
                        that fixed up, quick as a bunny! 

           Mother tosses a wad of napkins at Annalise, serving Annalise 
           a death glare (which Annalise doesn’t notice).

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Now who wants some toast?

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Oh, yes please!

           As Mother plies Mrs. Song and Peter with toast, the sound of 
           their eager CHIT-CHAT fades to the background... 

           All the while, Annalise gets LOST in GAZING at Peter...

           Even as she kneels to pick up the pieces of the broken 
           teacup, Annalise’s jaw remains dropped in AWE, her eyes 
           remain LOCKED on Peter. 

           However Annalise is seeing him has rendered her completely 
           THUNDERSTRUCK.

           Peter, meanwhile, remains befuddled and increasingly 
           uncomfortable by all of Annalise’s direct eye contact. 

           Peter averts his eyes. Slumps his shoulders. Bows his head. 
           Slowly raises his piece of TOAST... so as to pitifully HIDE 
           behind it (as if that might temper Annalise’s ogling). 
           But Annalise still doesn’t look away from him. Breathless, 
           she rises into her chair again, broken teacup in her lap. 

           Once more, we move behind Annalise’s head-- transferring from 
           normal vision into Annalise’s--

           And when we FINALLY see what Annalise does, we find that Peter Song is NOT a 
           scar-faced boy in her eyes. 

           Instead, to Annalise, PETER SONG is a scar-free, GORGEOUS GIRL. 

           In a DAZE, Annalise touches her fingertips to her  thrumming HEART-- Ba-dum, 
           BA-DUM, BA-DUM!

           The wriggling WORM (hair ribbon) in her hair flops back onto her forehead, but she 
           barely notices. A BLUSH creeps up her cheeks to kiss the worm’s tail. 

           Suffice it to say, someone’s got a CRUSH.

           We rotate back around Annalise into normal vision again-- and once 
           we face Annalise, for the first time since we’ve met her, we 
           finally see Annalise 

                                                          genuinely SMILE! 

           Peter balks at Annalise’s goofy GRIN. He’s at a complete loss 
           for what to do or say to such a bizarre girl...

           Finally, we can HEAR Mother and Mrs. Song’s CHATTERING again--

                                 MOTHER
                        HA! Oh you are a hoot, Mrs. Song! I 
                        must say, it is so nice to finally 
                        meet you!

                                 MRS. SONG
                        I agree! I have been looking 
                        forward to it all week! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        In fact, Annalise’s Mother and Mrs. 
                        Song had already met-- Not once, 
                        but thrice before-- 

           EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - PORCH - AFTERNOON

           Mother and Father sit in rocking chairs on their front porch. 
           Father’s buried in a NEWSPAPER. 
           Mother’s eagle-eyed on the HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET. There, a 
           MOVING VAN is parked out front, MOVERS shuttling belongings 
           into the house. 

           A FAMILY CAR pulls up behind the moving van. Mother eagerly 
           nudges Father with her elbow:

                                 MOTHER
                        Harold! They’re here!

           Father just barely peeps over the top of his newspaper to spy 
           alongside her. 

           From out of the car climbs: MR. SONG and MRS. SONG, both 
           Chinese-American. Father’s eyes sink back below his newspaper 
           so he can mutter to Mother from behind it:

                                 FATHER
                        Oh! My-- they’re, um... 

                          MOTHER
                                                     FATHER (CONT'D)
                 (scolding)
                                                (sheepish)
           Oh-- really Harold! 
                                              ... What?

                                 MOTHER
                        Remember when we were the first 
                        Jewish family to move into the 
                        neighborhood? 

           PETER SONG finally emerges from the family car. Mother 
           narrows her eyes at him... SCHEME a-brewin’...

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        The times they are a-changin’...

           INT. POST OFFICE - DAY 

           Mother stands in the back of the line at the Post Office. She 
           PERKS when she notices Mrs. Song standing near the front. 
           Mother nudges not-so-tactfully ahead of the OTHERS in line--

           Mother finally reaches Mrs. Song. TAPS her on the shoulder. 

                                 MOTHER
                        NEE HOW!  

           Mrs. Song is startled by this outburst of poorly articulated 
           Chinese. She blinks a few times to compose herself. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        NEE-- nee ha! Am-- am I saying that 
                        right? Nee... ha-ow... 
                                 MRS. SONG 
                        Yes, hello. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, you speak English! Thank 
                        goodness, I only learned one more 
                        Chinese phrase, and I was told if I 
                        pronounced it wrong I’d be at risk 
                        of calling you a horse. 

           Mrs. Song GRINS despite herself. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Your pronunciation is quite good 
                        for Americans. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Why, thank you. It’s probably 
                        because I’m bilingual myself-- 
                        Yiddish. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Ah! Schmendrick! Meshuggeneh! Oy 
                        vey!

                                 MOTHER
                             (impressed)
                        Where’d you learn that!? 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        When I first move to America, I 
                        played mahjong with a Jewish lady. 
                        She’s always yelling these things 
                        at me when I beat her, but I don’t 
                        know what they mean... 

                                 MOTHER
                        HA! She was cursing you up and 
                        down! You must be one heck of a 
                        mahjong player.

                                 MRS. SONG
                             (smirking)
                        No. She was a terrible one. 

           Mrs. Song sticks her hand out for a shake--

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        I’m Mrs. Song. 

                                 MOTHER
                             (taking her hand)
                        Oh, trust me, I know. I’ve been 
                        dying to meet you--
           INT. SONG FAMILY HOME - DAY

           Mother perches on a couch in the Song living room. Half-
           unpacked MOVING BOXES are scattered about. Mrs. Song pours 
           them both cups of TEA from an intricate Chinese Tea Set. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                             (RE: Tea)
                        Honey? Sugar? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t tempt me, I’ve been trying to 
                        resist my devious sweet tooth. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        ...What is “devious”?

                                 MOTHER
                        It means sneaky. It gets me into 
                        trouble. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Ah...

           ...Mrs. Song coyly presents a bottle of WHISKEY instead. 

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        Then how about this? 

           Mother’s eyebrows raise... Mrs. Song GRINS playfully. 

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        It may still get you into trouble, 
                        but it’s not sweet...

           Mother chuckles, shrugs. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Sure, why not! 

           Mrs. Song dumps a healthy dose of liquor into each of their 
           teacups and-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        So I noticed you have a son--

           A FEW HOURS LATER - 

           Mother and Mrs. Song are now TIPSY, SILLY, guards down. They 
           nurse their teacups. Lean close together. Kindred Spirits. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Really!? I was starting to think I 
                        am the only one-- 
                                 MOTHER
                        I promise you, I’m in the very same 
                        boat! 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        I have tried everything to help 
                        him! I don’t know what else to do! 

                                 MOTHER
                             (nodding)
                        There’s not much you can do when 
                        your child turns out so strange... 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        So strange and so sad... 
                        My Bide (Peter) has not truly 
                        smiled since he was a baby. Always 
                        with a pout, like this--

           Mrs. Song dons an exaggerated FROWN. 

           Mother plays along, FROWNS exaggeratedly too. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Same with my Annalise. Always 
                        sulking around... Alone...  

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Always alone... 

                                 MOTHER
                        And Harold’s no help. He’s off 
                        working all day. By the time he 
                        comes home he’s exhausted--

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Mm, yes, my husband is the same. He 
                        just wants to pretend Bide is a 
                        normal boy! I tell him, what kind 
                        of normal boy has no friend!?

           Both of the mothers SIGH, exchanging their exaggerated frowns 
           for real ones. They take SWIGS of Whiskey Tea... 

           Slowly... simultaneously... the very same thought dawns on 
           them both... They side-eye each other.

                                 MOTHER
                        You don’t suppose they could... 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        ...frown together? 

           Their frowns slink into conspiratorial GRINS... 
                                 MOTHER
                        It won’t work if they know we 
                        planned it. We have to be sneaky. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Sneaky... so this is “devious”? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, yes, Mrs. Song. It sure is.

           Rosy-cheeked, they CLINK their teacups together as a toast-- 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           BACK TO ANNALISE GAWKING AT PETER IN THE LIVING ROOM. Mother 
           and Mrs. Song exchange sly, sidelong glances--

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, I’ve got a marvelous idea! Why 
                        don’t you two walk to school 
                        together tomorrow? 

                                 MRS. SONG
                             (too quickly)
                        I agree! 

                                 MOTHER
                             (too quickly)
                        It’s settled then! 

           Annalise SMILES at her Mother-- NODS! Yes, yes! Mother BEAMS 
           at seeing Annalise so happy! 

           BUT-- when Annalise returns her infatuated gaze to Peter 
           Song, her smile falters ever-so-slightly-- 

           Because Peter is NOT smiling. He turns to SCOWL openly at 
           Mrs. Song, suddenly privy to her SCHEMING. 

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                             (in MANDARIN, hissed)
                        What? You needed a friend! 

           Peter rolls his eyes-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Indeed, Peter Song had never had 
                        any friends--

           EXT. CALIFORNIAN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           We hover above a CROWD of High Schoolers eating lunch in a 
           sunny CALIFORNIAN SCHOOLYARD. But Peter Song is nowhere to be 
           seen amongst them...  
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --but Peter had never had any 
                        bullies either. 

           Even as we move closer and closer to the scene, we still 
           can’t find Peter. It’s like a WHERE’S WALDO we can’t solve... 

           ...finally we’ve narrowed in on a small CLUSTER of TEENS. But 
           Peter isn’t one of them. Huh... Wait, we’re moving even past 
           the teens... Now it seems like there’s no one in the frame...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        For years he had managed to make 
                        himself nearly invisible.

           Oh-- There! Half of Peter’s FACE emerges from behind the PALM 
           TREE he’s leaning against, eating his lunch with CHOPSTICKS.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           We’re looking at a CLASSROOM filled with seated STUDENTS. But 
           again, Peter doesn’t seem to be one of them. We slowly push 
           in on one STUDENT in particular, whose hand is raised...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Laying low had worked well for 
                        Peter before his family had moved 
                        across the country... 

           Teacher CALLS on this STUDENT. As he begins to speak we 
           notice-- there seems to be something behind him--

           PETER is lined up behind this student so exactly that he’s 
           perfectly hidden. Only when the student shifts in his seat 
           while gesticulating do we catch GLIMPSES of Peter. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        So he had planned to do the very 
                        same here: Lay low. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING 

           Now, Peter is in PLAIN SIGHT of everyone as he treks through 
           the neighborhood to his new school. He’s wearing a rather 
           DISTURBED expression as he peeks over at:

           Annalise, trailing beside him. GAWKING OPENLY at him. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Unfortunately for Peter, it looked 
                        as though Annalise was not adept at 
                        laying low... 
           As we rotate around behind Annalise into Annalise’s Vision, of course Peter Song is 
           once again a GIRL of unmatched BEAUTY.  Annalise’s girl Peter looks just as 
           PERTURBED as-- the Peter in normal vision does. In fact, his 
           concern is morphing into DISDAIN. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Yes, Annalise was going to be a 
                        problem. Peter was sure of it. 

                                 PETER
                        Can’t you talk? 

           Annalise just OGLES him wordlessly... Peter’s FROWN deepens. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Can you even hear me? 

           At this, Annalise slowly grows... a SMILE. Peter almost 
           RECOILS from such a peculiar response. Annalise finally NODS 
           at Peter in a daze-- yes, I can hear. 

           They’ve reached the looming HIGH SCHOOL, swarming with PEERS. 
           Peter glances between the school and GRINNING Annalise...

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (mutter, sarcasm)
                        Terrific...   

           INT. SCHOOL ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter’s FINGERNAILS bite into his PALMS-- a nervous tick as 
           he clenches his fist with rising ANXIETY... 

           He’s doing his best to become invisible behind Annalise as 
           they enter the school. But Peter’s quickly learning that 
           these students have made a pastime of SPECTATING Annalise. 

                                 PETER
                        Do they always stare at you like 
                        this!? 

           Annalise SHRUGS, NODS, without even taking her eyes off of 
           Peter, without even taking her lovesick GRIN off her lips. 

           Peter notices a few peers POINTING at them and SNICKERING. He 
           skulks even lower... nails CUT even deeper into his palm...  

           School Bell RINGS--!

           INT. HOMEROOM CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Peter and Annalise are the last two STUDENTS to enter their 
           homeroom. Annalise PLOPS into an empty desk. 
           Annalise PATS the empty desk in front of hers, inviting Peter 
           to sit. Peter desperately SCANS the rest of the room, finding 
           NO other empty seat, and instead finding that his PEERS have 
           already begun STARING at him and WHISPERING. 

           Just then, their bird-like teacher, MRS. RADCLIFF (50s), 
           scurries to the front of the class. 

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF
                        Take a seat! Quickly, quickly! 
                        Homeroom is still a class-- We’ve 
                        got a lot to get through today-- 

           Peter GULPS before resigning himself to the desk in front of 
           Annalise’s. Peter sinks down into it, almost as if he wishes 
           he could hide beneath it... 

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF (CONT’D)
                        First and foremost is a reminder of 
                        our dress code. Ladies, I don’t 
                        care how fashionable these 
                        “miniskirts” are. These are not the 
                        streets of Paris, this is a school--  

           As Mrs. Radcliff LECTURES the class, Peter SETTLES in behind 
           the STUDENT sitting in front of him... until he is indeed 
           perfectly invisible, just as he had been in California... 

           Finally, Peter unwinds, SIGHS with relief. Phew. Maybe his 
           signature Laying Low can be salvaged after all... 

           But then-- NUDGE, NUDGE! Annalise JABS Peter’s elbow with a 
           FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.  

           Peter does his best to IGNORE Annalise. TENSING his whole 
           body with irritation... 

           But Annalise does not let up-- steadily and unrelentingly 
           shoving the piece of paper into Peter’s elbow:

           NUDGE... NUDGE... NUDGE... NUDGE... 

           Peter’s face screws up in MOUNTING frustration until-- He 
           SNAPS! SPINS to Annalise, SNATCHES the note! He CRUMPLES it 
           up in front of her face! 

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Song! 

           Mrs. Radcliff swoops by, PLUCKS the note from Peter’s hand! 

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Passing notes your first day, I 
                        mean really!
           Peter FILLS with abject HORROR as ALL EYES narrow in on him. 

           Students SMIRK and TITTER as Mrs. Radcliff unfurls the note. 
           She takes a momentous BREATH before reading it aloud: 

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF (CONT’D)
                        “I can write notes.”

           Mrs. Radcliff furrows her brow... For a moment, no one knows 
           how to react... 

           And then-- everyone BURSTS out LAUGHING. Even Mrs. Radcliff 
           struggles to stifle a CHUCKLE as she hands Peter the note--

                                 MRS. RADCLIFF (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Song, just because we can 
                        doesn’t mean we should. Let’s keep 
                        our thoughts to ourselves, shall 
                        we?  

           Peter BURNS with shame. He does his best to MURDER Annalise 
           with a GLARE as Mrs. Radcliff returns to the front--   

           But Peter finds that Annalise is not burning with shame in 
           the least. Instead, there she is, still dreamily gazing at 
           Peter and SMILING. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        There it was again! Annalise was 
                        smiling-- smiling! A madwoman!

           Peter SPINS to face the front of the room, CLENCHING his fist 
           around the crumpled NOTE-- His fingernails DIG into his PALM-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Well at this point, Peter knew that 
                        Annalise wasn’t going to be shaken 
                        off easily-- 

           PRE-LAP: SCHOOL BELL RING! 

           INT. HOMEROOM CLASSROOM - LATER

           Peter SHOVES off his desk and BOLTS out of Homeroom! Annalise 
           watches Peter go... her smile WILTING... 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Peter PANTS as he SPRINTS through the hallways! He DODGES 
           fellow STUDENTS as they pour out of classrooms. 

           Peter’s eyes dart from looking over his shoulder, to glancing 
           at his class schedule, to reading the classroom numbers 
           beside the doors. 
           Finally, Peter SKIDS to a stop in front of one classroom, 
           SLIPS into it--

           INT. CALCULUS CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           Peter quickly surveys the scene: There’s ONE open desk near 
           the front, and TWO open desks near the back. Peter hustles to 
           the SOLE open desk, but just as he’s about to drop into it--

                                 LUCY
                        You can’t sit there! 

           Peter hesitates. LUCY (17), a snide-faced Queen Bee, is 
           seated in the desk behind the open one. Her sour face turns 
           even sourer as she gets a good look at Peter’s SCARRED face.  

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Um, you’re new here right? That’s 
                        Randall’s seat. 

           Peter PANICS as he looks at the PAIR of open desks in the 
           back. He glances at the open DOORWAY, where Annalise could 
           come barreling through at any second! 

           So Peter GULPS and then-- PLOPS into the solo seat! 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Uh! Hello? Didn’t you hear me? 

           Peter keeps his nervous eyes on the door. Lucy TAPS him--

                                                          PETER
                       LUCY (CONT’D)
           I said  you can’t sit there! 
                                              Um-- uh-- 

           Peter SPINS to Lucy and loudly proclaims with a WAVE: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (Mandarin Chinese)
                        Ni hao! 

           SCHOOL BELL RINGS! Lucy can only give Peter a befuddled look 
           as poor RANDALL enters the room and is relegated to the BACK.  

                                 TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Okay, class! Who’s ready for some 
                        integrals?

           Peter’s eyes are fixed anxiously on the open classroom 
           door... but as the TEACHER drones on, and it becomes clear 
           Annalise isn’t coming... Peter SIGHS. Can finally relax... 

                                 RHONDA (O.S.)
                        Lucy!
           Lucy and another girl, RHONDA, whisper to each other behind 
           Peter’s back-- just loudly enough for Peter to hear--

                                 RHONDA (CONT’D)
                             (pointing to Peter)
                        What...?

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know, it’s like he doesn’t 
                        even understand English! 

                                 RHONDA
                        What happened to his face? 

                                 LUCY
                        Beats me... whatever it was musta 
                        messed with his brain.... 

           Peter BLUSHES. He lifts his thin PENCIL to his cheek as if he 
           could hide his large SCAR behind it... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Now, Annalise--

           INT. HOMEROOM CLASSROOM - EARLIER

           Back to Annalise in HOMEROOM, her smile WILTING as Peter 
           makes his swift escape-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --She felt utterly sorry.

           MONTAGE - SCHOOL - VARIOUS

           A) Annalise floats contemplatively in her own world through the school hallways... 
           passing students wearing PUMPKINS for shoes, and doors made of static 
           TELEVISIONS, and lockers composed of hundreds of BUTTERFLIES... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        No, not sorry for herself-- quite 
                        sorry for Peter. 

           B) We barely catch a glimpse of PETER as he escapes into the 
           hallway, hiding behind the rest of his Calculus class. His 
           eyes are PEELED for Annalise... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It didn’t occur to Annalise that 
                        Peter might want to get rid of her. 
                        Instead, Annalise assumed Peter was 
                        ashamed for getting them in 
                        trouble. 
           C) Annalise watches her Art Classroom’s door expectantly for Peter until-- the 
           school bell that she sees as a big ol’ BULLFROG, opens his mouth to emit a RING! 
           Annalise slumps with disappointment; Peter’s not coming. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise wanted desperately to find 
                        Peter, to make it clear that she 
                        didn’t blame him one bit! 

           D) Peter hides in the BOYS BATHROOM as he peeks out into the 
           SWARM of STUDENTS passing-- is Annalise among them? 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        To insist that she still very much 
                        wanted to be friends! 

           E) Annalise JOGS with the rest of her gym class around an outdoor track made of 
           MOLTEN LAVA. She gets sidetracked as she passes one of the school’s WINDOWS... 
           is that Peter in there? Annalise peers inside-- but she can’t find Peter. Gym teacher 
           BLOWS A WHISLE and Annalise begrudgingly JOGS away--  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But alas, Annalise could not find 
                        Peter all morning...  

           ...(Girl) Peter shifts slightly in her seat... emerging from behind the STUDENT she’s 
           perfectly hidden herself behind. Phew, close call! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Until lunch time dawned.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 

           Peter moves through the lunch line, GRIPPING his lunch tray 
           anxiously and surveying the CROWD. Peter FILLS with 
           immeasurable DREAD. The world  s l o w s  as Peter SPOTS:

           ANNALISE. 

           On her tip-toes. Scanning the CAFETERIA for Peter. And then--

           LOCKING her EYES on him. Annalise waves at Peter excitedly! 

           The world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Annalise fast 
           approaches! Peter reflexively cringes away from her-- causing 
           Peter to accidentally STEP on the foot of the girl standing 
           beside him in line: LUCY. 

           Peter BALKS as Lucy YELPS and spins around! 
                                 LUCY
                        OW!

           Lucy GRIMACES, shrinks away from Peter with disgust upon 
           getting a good, close look at his SCARRED face. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                             (rubbing her foot 
                              dramatically)
                        Ugh! What is wrong with you!? 

           Lucy’s SHRILLNESS summons a group of ONLOOKERS to gather just 
           as Annalise arrives like an eager puppy at Peter’s side.  
           Lucy soaks up the power of her growing AUDIENCE, staring 
           Peter directly in the eye as she SHOUTS: 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Stay away from me, you FREAK! 

           Instantly Annalise transforms from GIDDY-- to INCENSED.

           Annalise pivots slowly toward Lucy, MALICE in her eyes...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        That word... Annalise had heard 
                        that word whispered behind her 
                        back... Had heard it bandied about 
                        casually... Had felt it about her 
                        own self, deep down in her marrow.

           Onlookers are starting to notice and point toward Annalise’s 
           palpable RAGE-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise did not like that word.

           --we move behind Annalise’s head into Annalise’s Vision, just in time to catch (girl) 
           Peter’s deeply ASHAMED reaction to being called a FREAK so publicly.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But whereas she normally absorbed 
                        it silently and unmoving, today was 
                        different. 

               Annalise raises a single, shaking FIST up in front of her, as if she’s about to PUNCH 
           Lucy in the face--!

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Today the sound of that word, well. 
                        It cracked her. 
           --as we return to normal vision, Annalise screws up her face 
           in pure contempt, GRABS a handful of MASHED POTATOES from 
           Lucy’s lunch tray, and--

           CHUCKS them directly into Lucy’s smug face! SPLAT!!! 

           For a moment, there’s nothing but STUNNED SILENCE: 
           - Splatted Lucy is FROZEN in SHOCK! 
           - The ONLOOKERS are SPEECHLESS, unbelieving! 
           - And Peter- Peter can’t help but look at Annalise in... AWE. 

           Annalise is quite pleased with herself. This time, the SMILE 
           the grows across Annalise’s lips is quite... MANIACAL. 

                                 ONLOOKER (O.S.)
                        FOOD FIGHT! 

           With that declaration, a full-fledged FOOD FIGHT erupts in 
           the cafeteria! Students take COVER, and food goes FLYING! 

           But Peter barely notices, still transfixed by Annalise and 
           her devious SMIRK.

           A HOT DOG just barely misses smacking Peter in the head! 
           Seeing this, Annalise grabs Peter by the hand-- leads him to 
           take cover under a LUNCH TABLE-- 

           Annalise and Peter huddle together under the lunch table, 
           watching scoops of mushy PEAS and hunks of MEAT and dollops 
           of JELL-O SOAR through the air and SMACK victims with 
           satisfying SPLATS! 

           But of course, when we shift into Annalise’s Vision, the FOOD FIGHT looks quite 
           different. It’s a storm of mishmashed items: squawking CHICKENS and revving 
           CHAINSAWS and potted PLANTS and puffy TEDDY BEARS whizzing every-which-
           way through the air! 

           CHAOTIC and ABSURD and GLORIOUS.

           Annalise turns to GRIN devilishly at Peter. (Girl) Peter looks at Annalise in turn, 
           slack-jaw at the massive food fight she’s witnessing-- 

           --and finally, for the very first time, (girl) Peter BEAMS at Annalise. 

           Annalise is downright breathless at the sight. 

           Despite the wild scene surrounding them, Annalise & (girl) Peter’s eyes connect like 
           magnets, unable to look away from each other.

           Their matching SMILES are positively LUMINOUS. 
           PRE-LAP: SCHOOL BELL RINGS!

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL / NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON

           All the food-stained TEENAGERS spout of the High School’s 
           entrance, CHATTERING excitedly about the fallout from the 
           food fight. Annalise and Peter are two of the last to leave. 

           They amble down the sidewalk home together. The SKYLINE of 
           the BIG CITY looms on the horizon beyond SUBURBIA. 

           Annalise is still GLOWING from this afternoon. She can’t 
           suppress her GRIN as she sneaks peeks over at Peter. 

           But Peter’s smile has VANISHED, signature BROODING returned. 
           His sight is on his shoes as he ruminates. His hands CLENCH 
           into FISTS, his nervous tick. 

           Peter is TORN from his thoughts as Annalise TAPS on his HAND. 

           Peter glances at Annalise to find that her SMILE is GONE now 
           too. Instead, she’s is giving Peter’s hand a CONCERNED look. 

           Peter lifts his HAND to inspect it. 

                                 PETER
                        What? 

           We finally see: There are dark SCARS all along Peter’s PALM 
           where his fingernails have repeatedly SLICED into them. 

           Annalise gently brushes her pointer finger over the scars... 

           Peter SNATCHES his hand away from her, embarrassed. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh. That. Just a bad habit. 

           Even now, Peter’s already back to CLENCHING his fists. 
           Fingernails finding their old WOUNDS. 

           Annalise’s concern deepens. She reaches into her SATCHEL and 
           pulls out a PEN and PAPER. She SCRIBBLES a note and passes it 
           to Peter. Peter SIGHS before opening it:

                                      What’s wrong? 

           Peter STARES at the note, EMOTION rising against his will... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Perhaps it was the fact that 
                        Annalise was a mute and could never 
                        betray his secrets. 
           Annalise HANDS Peter the pen, her eyes encouraging him--

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Perhaps it was the earnestness that 
                        shone from every pore of Annalise’s 
                        face. 

           --Peter hesitantly takes the pen from her.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Perhaps it was simply because Peter 
                        had been ambushed by the glow of 
                        friendship for the very first time 
                        in his life. Whatever the reason, 
                        Peter decided to do something very 
                        uncharacteristic that day: Be seen. 

           Peter SCRATCHES out the question mark on the note and ADDS: 

                                  What’s wrong with me?

           Peter hands the note back to Annalise.

           Annalise reads Peter’s message several times over, truly 
           PUZZLED. She looks from the note, up to Peter, and back down 
           to the note. She SHRUGS, shakes her head NO-- No, nothing. 

                                 PETER
                        Pft. You can’t know that. You don’t 
                        even know me. 

           Peter returns his sulking eyes to the ground. 

           Annalise screws up her face in determination. She pries her 
           pen out of Peter’s hand and writes a new note on the back: 

                             Then tell me about yourself     

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What kind of question is that? 

           Annalise rolls her eyes-- gestures at him: Come on! 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Well, I don’t know what to say! 

           Annalise STOPS walking. Crosses her arms. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Fine! What do you wanna know? 

           Annalise thinks... then writes another note: 

                              Tell me about your last home   
           Peter considers this... and then:

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Well... I guess that’s actually 
                        kind of an interesting story... My 
                        family used to live in California-- 
                        in Hollywood.
                             (off Annalise’s 
                              excitement)
                        Yeah, Hollywood. I could even see 
                        the Hollywood sign from my window. 
                        But it wasn’t all that glamorous 
                        like the movies make you think. My 
                        parents were nuts about saving 
                        money for a better home, so we 
                        lived in a real dump--

           As Annalise listens to Peter... her SMILE slowly RETURNS... 

           EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - LATER

           Peter is ANIMATED as he finishes another anecdote on their 
           walk home. Annalise listens, completely rapt. 

                                 PETER
                        --but on the hundredth-try, I stood 
                        up, and I stayed up! No one saw me, 
                        but I swear, I taught myself to 
                        surf, I really did! I just never 
                        really told anyone about it because-
                        - well. I don’t know. I didn’t know 
                        who to tell, I guess. My mother 
                        would’ve been furious if she found 
                        out I was in the dirty ocean-- 

           Suddenly, Annalise STOPS walking. Peter is almost surprised 
           by her halt... until he takes a look around him. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh... we’re home already? 

           Annalise SHRUGS. Yeah. Peter seems almost disappointed... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                         Huh. Well... See you tomorrow?

           Annalise smiles, savoring this question. She NODS. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Alright then. Well. Bye. 

           Peter turns to cross the street to his house, but Annalise 
           hooks a hand around his elbow-- wait!  
           Peter faces her, expectant. Annalise TEARS another slip of 
           paper from her notebook, SCRAWLS a note inside. She has to 
           shield her writing with her other hand to keep Peter from 
           reading it too soon. 

           When she’s done, Annalise FOLDS the note, presses it into 
           Peter’s hand. Peter barely catches Annalise’s SMILE before 
           she spins and skips into her family’s home--

           INT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Breathless, Annalise presses her back into her front door as 
           she shuts it. She’s BEAMING with joy. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise could not remember a 
                        better day in her life than this 
                        one. 

           EXT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Peter stares at Annalise’s front door, behind which Annalise 
           has just disappeared... 

           Alone on the sidewalk, Peter turns his attention to the note. 
           He opens it and reads: 

                        There’s nothing wrong with you. I promise. 

           Despite himself, Peter GRINS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Peter’s happiness, however, was 
                        short-lived-- 

           INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Late at night, Peter stands in front of a full-length MIRROR 
           in his bedroom. He GLOWERS at his reflection... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Inside, he felt as rotten as he 
                        always did, as rotten as rotten can 
                        be. 

           TEARS WELL in Peter’s eyes, SCORN brimming behind them... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Because Peter, like Annalise, was 
                        also grappling with a painful 
                        secret. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        One he had never told a soul. One 
                        he had never even uttered aloud to 
                        himself. 

           Peter’s FISTS TIGHTEN... FINGERNAILS pressing harder and 
           harder into the flesh of his palm... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        You see, there was indeed something 
                        wrong with Peter...

           His fingernails BREAK SKIN, BLOOD drips down his knuckles! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...and Peter knew exactly what it 
                        was. 

           With an angry GRUNT-- Peter SWIPES his hand across his 
           reflection in the mirror! A smear of BLOOD obscures him 
           ominously... 

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Annalise-- wearing her PINK HAIR RIBBON-- munches on her 
           breakfast cheerily. She’s bopping in her seat to the SONG 
           playing on the RADIO. She’s all SMILES. 

           Across the table, Father’s staring at her suspiciously. Who 
           is this girl, and what has she done with his mopey daughter!?

           Mother swoops in with some more eggs for the table. Father 
           gives her a pointed look, nodding toward Annalise. What’s 
           with her!? Mother SHRUGS with a coy smile. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Annalise, you’re wearing your hair 
                        ribbon? I thought you hated that 
                        thing. 

           Annalise picks up a piece of CHALK and a well-worn SLATE that 
           she uses to communicate with her parents at the table. On it 
           she writes: You always say it makes me look pretty...?  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh... yes, well it does! Doesn’t it 
                        Harold? 

           Father’s still in disbelief. Annalise GRINS at him as she 
           takes another BITE of her breakfast-- 
           EXT. ANNALISE’S HOUSE - MORNING 

           Annalise BRIGHTENS as she exits her house and bounds down the 
           porch stairs. Peter is waiting for her on the sidewalk, ready 
           for their walk to school. Once Annalise reaches him: 

                                 PETER
                        Okay, I told you about my surfing, 
                        now I wanna hear something that 
                        you’ve never told anyone. 

           Annalise thinks... Pulls out her notebook, begins writing... 

           INT. SCHOOL ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

           This time, when Peter and Annalise enter the school atrium, 
           they don’t even notice the multitudes of students GAWKING at 
           and GOSSIPING about them. 

           Peter is too busy reading the long note that Annalise has 
           written to him to pay them any mind. Annalise watches Peter 
           read with anticipation... 

                                 PETER
                             (finished reading)
                        Wow... is-- is this true? 

           Annalise NODS. Peter absorbs this... and then SNORTS with 
           laughter. Annalise GRINS too. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Jeez, Annalise! You’re kind of a 
                        rebel, huh? 
                             (lowers voice)
                        Did the school ever figure out who 
                        did it? 

           Annalise shakes her head NO with a smirk. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        So all these people have no idea 
                        that you’re the secret graffiti 
                        artist... 

           Peter consults the note again-- then: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a question--?  

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - A NEW DAY 

           Annalise and Peter eat LUNCH together at their own table: 
                                 PETER
                        You really never talk? ...Ever?

           Annalise NODS, writes on the notebook between them: I can’t. 

           Peter mulls this over... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Did you just forget how? 

           Annalise rolls her eyes and shakes her head NO-- 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - A NEW AFTERNOON

           It’s late Autumn now, the leaves changed into vibrant hues. 
           Peter and Annalise KICK at fallen leaves as they walk home 
           from school. BIG CITY looms on the horizon. 

                                 PETER
                        You don’t even talk to your 
                        parents? 

           Annalise shakes her head NO-- 

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - A NEW DAY 

           Annalise has just BOWLED a gutter ball. Peter approaches her 
           holding his own BOWLING BALL. 

                                 PETER
                        You don’t even talk to yourself 
                        when you’re alone?

           Annalise shakes her head NO--

           INT. ANNALISE’S LIVING ROOM - A NEW DAY 

           Mother brings a try of fresh-baked COOKIES into the living 
           room for Peter and Annalise as they STUDY. 

                                 PETER
                             (taking bite of cookie)
                        What if you talk in your sleep?   

           Annalise shakes her head NO-- 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME - A NEW NIGHT

           Annalise and Peter SHIVER in the snowy bleachers as they 
           CHEER on their school’s FOOTBALL TEAM. 

                                 PETER
                        What if I paid you ten bucks to say 
                        something? 
           Annalise shakes her head NO-- 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Peter and Annalise munch on POPCORN as they watch the JAMES 
           BOND film YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Peter leans over to Annalise: 

                                 PETER
                             (hiss)
                        What if someone held a gun to my 
                        head and they demanded you say 
                        something or they’ll shoot!

           Annalise SMACKS his shoulder, holds a finger up to her 
           smiling lips: Shhh! Peter returns his attention to James Bond 
           on screen for only a second before: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        ...You’d be a good spy-- 

           INT. HOMEROOM CLASSROOM - A NEW DAY 

           Peter keeps one eye on Mrs. Radcliff as he furtively passes a 
           NOTE back to Annalise. Annalise opens it and reads: 

                So what do you do with all that time you spend not talking?

           Annalise picks up her pen to respond, but thinks better of it 
           and instead-- 

           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM - A NEW AFTERNOON

           Annalise DUMPS a pile of BOOKS onto Peter’s lap. 

                                 PETER
                        Annalise, you’re gonna crush me! 

           Annalise responds by DUMPING another hefty pile of BOOKS onto 
           Peter’s lap. She goes to her overflowing BOOKCASE for more--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Annalise! Alright, I get it! You 
                        like to read! 

           Peter’s sitting on Annalise’s bed in her room. He spreads the 
           books across the quilt, looks them over one-by-one: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm... Pride & Prejudice, never 
                        read it. The Lord of the Rings, 
                        never read that one either. 
           Annalise seats herself next to Peter to watch his assessment. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh! Catcher in the Rye. This one I 
                        have read. Didn’t like it though-- 
                        the main character was so annoying. 

           Annalise snatches the book away from Peter with a pout! 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sorry, you like it? Well I 
                        suppose you’ll think I’m a ‘phony’ 
                        then, huh? 

           Annalise shoves Peter’s shoulder playfully while Peter sifts 
           through the massive pile of books on the bed: Anne of Green 
           Gables; Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland; And Then There Were 
           None; Jane Eyre; To Kill A Mockingbird... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you’ve read all of 
                        these... Which one’s your favorite? 

           Annalise considers all the options... finally selects one and 
           hands it to Peter. The Diary of Anne Frank.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Mm. Sorry, I haven’t read this one 
                        either. 

           Peter offers the book back to Annalise. She takes a pen and 
           writes on the inside cover: To the phony. 

           Peter SNORTS with a grin. Annalise hands it back. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        For me?  

           Annalise NODS. Peter is genuinely touched. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Well thanks... Tell me what you 
                        like so much about it.  

           Annalise starts writing a response in her NOTEBOOK--

           INT. HOMEROOM CLASSROOM - A NEW DAY 

           --Annalise FINISHES writing and furtively RIPS a page out of 
           her notebook. Careful not to catch Mrs. Radcliff’s eye, she 
           passes it up to Peter:

                 So what do you do with all the time you spend not talking?
           Peter GRINS and-- 

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        Okay, don’t tell anyone... 

           INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - A NEW AFTERNOON

           In Peter’s bedroom now, Annalise gives Peter a sarcastic 
           look: Of course I won’t tell anyone... 

                                 PETER
                             (chuckle)
                        Well-- don’t write anyone then. 

           Annalise NODS, sits on the bed, watches him expectantly. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Alright... it’s not really a hobby-- 
                        well I suppose you could call it a 
                        hobby. I just do it sometimes when 
                        I’m... when I can’t fall asleep 
                        or... when I feel... 

           Peter SIGHS, pulls out a RECORD from its sheath and places it 
           onto a RECORD PLAYER. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just show you... 

           When the needle hits the vinyl, it begins to play “MOON 
           RIVER” sung by Audrey Hepburn. As the first verse flows, 
           Peter’s nerves are palpable. He TIGHTENS his fist, 
           fingernails digging into his palm... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Can you... can you turn around? 

           Annalise gives Peter a quizzical look--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Please?

           Annalise does so, facing the foot of the bed. But unbeknownst 
           to Peter, Annalise can still spot him through the full-length 
           MIRROR. She watches as Peter takes in a shaking breath... and 
           ever-so-quietly begins to sing in falsetto: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (singing softly)
                        Two drifters, off to see the world
                        There's such a lot of world to see
           As Peter sings, we move into Annalise’s Vision: (Girl) Peter practically 
           trembles as she sings. Peter’s falsetto matches her angelic face perfectly.  Annalise is 
           incredibly moved by the song. Her jaw slacks. Her eyes well. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (singing softly)
                        We're after the same rainbow's end 
                        / waitin' 'round the bend / My 
                        huckleberry friend / Moon river, 
                        and me...

           The record ends... STATIC crackling as it loops... 

           Annalise-- back still turned to Peter-- struggles to wrangle 
           in her emotion. She covertly dabs the moisture from her eyes. 

                                 PETER (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                             (whisper)
                        Sorry... sorry I-- 

           Annalise spins around, shaking her head no, no, no! 

           Annalise searches around for a pen-- Can’t find one in her 
           pocket-- Can’t find one in her satchel-- finally gives up. 

           She stands and places one hand on either of Peter’s 
           shoulders. She looks Peter in the eyes. She nods softly... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        ...You liked it? 

           Annalise answers by turning around and starting the RECORD 
           playing over again. Annalise seats herself on the bed once 
           more, her back facing Peter as the song starts up. 

           She gives Peter a THUMBS UP over her shoulder: Again! 

           Despite himself, Peter grins. OPENS his mouth to sing again-- 

           PRE-LAP: TELEPHONE RIIIING!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Annalise ANSWERS the phone ringing in her living room. Behind 
           her, Mother and Father watch THE 1968 NEW YEARS BALL DROP on 
           TV. There’s a pause as Annalise waits for someone to speak... 

                                 PETER (ON PHONE) 
                        ...Annalise? 

           Annalise doesn’t answer. 
                                 PETER (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hi, it’s Peter. But you probably 
                        could tell that-- um. How’s your 
                        Christmas break going? 

           Annalise SMILES, but of course doesn’t answer. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh right... You’re Jewish. Well, 
                        it’s still nice not having school, 
                        huh? Listen, I called ‘cause-- Do 
                        me a favor and go look out your 
                        bedroom window. Okay? 

           Peter HANGS UP the phone. Annalise is intrigued...

           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annalise peers out her bedroom window: Outside it’s dark, the 
           neighborhood blanketed with SNOW, neighbors’ CHRISTMAS LIGHTS 
           twinkle along the block. 

           Across the street: There’s PETER standing in his bedroom 
           window. He holds up a big SIGN, lights it with a FLASHLIGHT: 

                                  I CAN WRITE NOTES TOO 

           Annalise stifles a giggle! Peter’s grinning goofily across 
           the street. Annalise holds up a finger-- One second!  

           She quickly pulls a MARKER and CONSTRUCTION PAPER out of her 
           ART SUPPLIES BIN. SCRIBBLES on it-- 

           Annalise holds a SIGN to her window; it’s got elegant 
           handwriting and artful DESIGNS along the edges: 

                                  NOT AS WELL AS I CAN 

           Peter is visibly CHUCKLING across the street in his window. 
           Annalise relishes the sight...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        As the school year wore on, 
                        something quite extraordinary was 
                        happening to Annalise... 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           It’s SPRINGTIME now. The snow has melted, and this FOREST has 
           begun to flourish with green regrowth. Annalise and Peter 
           stroll through it idly. 
                                 PETER
                        ...the thing is, I don’t want to 
                        learn to write it! I speak Chinese 
                        just fine, so I don’t see why I 
                        have to go to school on Saturdays 
                        just to learn more Chinese. 
                             (sigh)
                        Ma wants me to be able to write to 
                        my Grandparents without her 
                        translating... but I’ve never even 
                        met my Grandparents in person! Why 
                        should I have to learn thousands of 
                        characters just for them?  

           Annalise is barely listening to what Peter’s saying... She’s 
           looking around herself at the forest, growing uneasy... 

           ...When we finally look at the forest as Annalise sees it, her unique vision makes this 
           place unmistakeable for us: This is exactly where Annalise attempted suicide. 

           Annalise’s chin quivers. She slows to a stop as she 
           desperately tries to rein in her spiraling despair. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no... Annalise? What’s wrong? 

           Peter rubs her arms awkwardly, as if he’s trying to warm her 
           up. Concern all over his face. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hey-- hey! What’s the matter? 

           Annalise opens her mouth, but of course can’t say anything. 
           Instead, tears leak onto her cheeks. She SNIFFS them back. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Here, here-- let me-- 

           Peter pulls a pencil and a scrap of paper out of his pocket. 
           Hands it urgently to Annalise-- desperate to understand! 

           Annalise takes the pencil and paper uncertainly. She stares 
           down at them, unsure what to say... Finally writes: 

                                    A bad memory here

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        ... What happened? 

           Annalise CAN’T LOOK AT HIM... She finally answers: 

                                    I tried to give up
           Peter stares at the note... Soaking in what it means...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                             (whisper)
                        The closer Annalise got to Peter... 

           ...Peter gently takes the pencil from Annalise. Writes: 

                                   I’m glad you didn’t

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...the lighter she felt her secret 
                        become.

           After reading this, Annalise finally summons the courage to 
           LOOK UP at Peter--

           INT. ANNALISE’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           --(Girl) Peter looks FLAWLESS in Annalise’s Eyes as they sit next to each other on 
           Annalise’s bed. A strand of (girl) Peter’s LONG HAIR falls into Peter’s face. 

            Annalise hesitantly... reaches up, brushes Peter’s hair aside. Annalise’s fingers graze 
           Peter’s CHEEK... 

           (Girl) Peter’s eyes fall to her feet, embarrassed. Annalise quickly drops her hand-- 
           Oh no... did she go too far? 

                                 PETER
                        I appreciate-- you know... that 
                        you’ve never asked... 

           Annalise furrows her brow, confused. Peter points to his 
           SCARRED CHEEK, where Annalise had just touched him. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        About my scar. 
                             (sigh)
                        It’s not even an interesting story. 
                        I pulled a pan of hot oil off the 
                        stove when I was really little. I 
                        don’t even have any memory of it...
                             (beat)
                        But that’s the thing about having a 
                        scar everyone can stare at... 
                        They’ll never let me forget what I 
                        can’t even remember in the first 
                        place...

           ...Annalise pulls out her NOTEBOOK... She’s DEBATING writing 
           this... but finally decides to do it:  
                        When I look at you, I don’t see your scar 

           Annalise hands it to him, NERVOUS. It’s a sliver of the 
           TRUTH... Peter reads the note... and then FROWNS even DEEPER-- 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (annoyed)
                        Annalise--

           Suddenly, Peter stands up from the bed, moving toward the 
           door, not even looking at Annalise--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        That’s nice and all, but I’d rather 
                        you not pretend I’m-- I’m perfect 
                        or something... 

           Peter pauses at the door, flustered: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m not. I’m not perf-- I’m-- 

           Annalise is TAKEN ABACK by Peter’s irritation--  

                                 PETER (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                             (hasty)
                        Nevermind-- I better get home, I’ll 
                        see you tomorrow.

           Peter leaves Annalise confused... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...But as Peter got closer to 
                        Annalise, his secret was becoming 
                        unbearably heavy--

           INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Annalise sits on Peter’s bed, her back to Peter as he again 
           SINGS in FALSETTO to a RECORD playing. 

           Annalise studies Peter surreptitiously through the MIRROR. 
           This time, Peter is less shy performing, EMOTING as he sings. 

           Because (girl) Peter doesn’t know Annalise is watching through the mirror, Peter 
           doesn’t hide her sorrow. And that sorrow DEEPENS as (girl) Peter reaches the 
           climax of the SONG; TEARS well and threaten to FALL down her cheeks...  

           Seeing Peter’s tears, Annalise tears up herself... She 
           reaches a comforting hand out to him, but just as Annalise’s 
           fingertips are about to brush his shoulder--
           Peter moves away from her. Rips the needle from the record. 
           Annalise is consumed with worry for him... 

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        Here, I’ve got something for you--

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON

           While walking home from school, Annalise accepts yet another 
           NOTE from Peter. She opens it and reads: 

                                          PROM?

           Annalise stops walking. 

           It’s like she can’t believe what she’s reading. She glances 
           up at Peter-- Really!? 

           Peter’s anxious... 

                                 PETER
                        ... Well!? 

           Annalise can’t help it-- she tears up, happy tears. She 
           SNIFFS them back hastily, pulls out her PEN, flips the paper 
           over to reply-- 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You know, this is one of those 
                        times we talked about where I’d 
                        rather you just nod or something, 
                        ‘cause the suspense is-- 

           --Annalise notices that Peter is NERVOUSLY clenching his 
           fingernails into his palm again. So Annalise ditches the 
           paper and instead reaches out for Peter’s hand-- 

           Peter shuts up. Annalise flips Peter’s hand over, revealing 
           his FINGERNAIL SCARS. Annalise writes in pen directly onto 
           his skin, arcing along the edge of the scars: 

                                   I would be honored 

           The two friends GAZE into each other’s eyes... 

                                 MOTHER (PRE-LAP)
                        Oooooh, we are good... 

           INT. SONG FAMILY HOME - AFTERNOON 

           Mother and Mrs. Song GIGGLE in the Song living room, sipping 
           from TEACUPS and well on their way to DRUNK. 
                                 MRS. SONG 
                        We are very good. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You know, Mei... Annalise’s father 
                        and I went to Prom together back in 
                        our day... 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Oh, really? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Yes, and you know what else? I do  
                        believe I managed to hook him that 
                        very night. It’s a magical thing, 
                        Prom... it could lead to... you 
                        know... 

           Mother TAPS the WEDDING RING on her finger... Mrs. Song 
           finally understands her meaning-- GASPS!  

                                 MRS. SONG
                        You think!? 

                                 MOTHER
                        It’s possible! 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        We should be so lucky! I’d lost 
                        hope that my Peter would ever-- 

                                 MOTHER
                        I know. Me too... 

           Mother grows very serious: 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        If it has any chance of happening, 
                        we’ll have to do everything in our 
                        power to make sure Prom is simply 
                        perfect for them. 

           Mrs. Song and Mother SMIRK at each other, partners in crime. 
           Mrs. Song CLINKS her teacup to Mother’s--

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Deal. 

           The two women DOWN the rest of their drinks. Mrs. Song 
           reaches toward the tea tray in front of them-- Picks up a 
           plate of DRY TOAST and offers it to Mother.
                                 MOTHER
                        Oh-- No, thanks. If I’m honest, I 
                        don’t really care for toast. 

           Mrs. Song’s jaw DROPS. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        You don’t!? Why do you cook it all 
                        the time!? 

                                 MOTHER
                        I make it for you! 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        I don’t like toast! 

                                 MOTHER
                        But you make it all the time!

                                 MRS. SONG
                        I make it for you!

           They both BUST into drunken GIGGLES-- Mrs. Song TOSSES the 
           plate of toast over her shoulder where it all goes TUMBLING 
           to the ground. This CRACKS them up even more! 

           Mrs. Song lifts up the big bottle of WHISKEY: 

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        How about this one? 

                                 MOTHER
                        Now that I like! 

           Mrs. Song lifts the lid of the TEAPOT and pours the liquor 
           directly inside-- causing Mother to GIGGLE even more-- 

           Just then-- Peter comes in the front door! Mrs. Song GASPS 
           and hastily chucks the bottle of WHISKEY under the couch. 

           Mrs. Song and Mother sit up straight, feigning sobriety. 

                                 PETER
                        Hi Ma. Hi Mrs. Gold. 

           Peter trudges over to them. He reaches for the TEAPOT to pour 
           himself a cup-- But Mrs. Song SMACKS his hands away! 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Aiya! 

           Peter is startled backwards. Mother SNORTS back her laughter--
                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        No, um. This is-- this is our 
                        special... Friday tea... 

           At this, Mother LOSES it. Mrs. Song can’t keep it together 
           any more either. 

                           PETER
                                                      MOTHER (O.S.)
           O-kay... 
                                                (laughing)
                                              Friday tea! 

           Peter just shakes his head, retreats to his room upstairs--  

           INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Peter picks up the PHONE in his room and dials a number he 
           knows by heart. He WRITES on a piece of paper as he does so--

                                 PETER
                             (into phone)
                        ... Annalise? It’s Peter.  

           Peter HANGS up the phone. He goes to his window and holds up 
           the SIGN he’s just made: 

                                 OUR MOTHERS ARE STRANGE 

           Across the street, Annalise peers out her bedroom window, 
           reads his sign. She GRINS. Writes a sign in response: 

                               MUST BE WHERE WE GOT IT FROM

           Peter smiles softly. He WAVES goodbye at Annalise before 
           dropping his curtain and withdrawing back into his room. 

           But as he does so, there are TEARS forming in his eyes... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Indeed, by the end of his senior 
                        year, Peter could barely endure his 
                        secret any longer--

           INT. TAILOR’S SHOP - DAY

           Mrs. Song and a TAILOR flutter around Peter. They MEASURE and 
           PIN the PROM SUIT he’s wearing, fitting it to his body. 

           But Peter barely notices them, transfixed by his own 
           reflection in the mirror... Disgusted by it... 
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Every time he looked in the mirror, 
                        he saw a monster. Every time he 
                        tried to smile, he felt a fraud. 

           Finally, Peter looks away from himself. 

           INT. DRESS SHOP - DAY 

           Annalise is GIDDY as she bursts from behind a DRESSING ROOM 
           DOOR! Mother is waiting eagerly on the other side of it.

                        And Annalise, well. Peter felt even 
                        more miserable when he looked at 
                        her. 

           Annalise is wearing a GORGEOUS GOWN: a dreamy blue, with a 
           fitted bodice and layered tiers of romantic tulle. Annalise 
           surveys herself in the MIRROR and positively GLOWS. 

           In Annalise’s Eyes, the GOWN is truly DAZZLING: The fitted bodice has the 
           appearance of rippling WATER; the tiered tulle skirt is instead a mesmerizing array 
           of lit SPARKLERS. Sprays of flame GLITTER at the tips.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        The way Annalise’s eyes shone when 
                        they landed on him. The way she 
                        grinned, no matter what Peter wrote 
                        in his notes. The way she 
                        complimented him and praised him 
                        and cherished him. 

           Mother is overcome with bittersweet emotion at seeing her 
           little girl now a young woman. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Where those things should have made 
                        Peter feel loved, they only made 
                        him feel a colossal phony. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh Annalise... You’re simply 
                        perfect. 

           Annalise uncharacteristically TACKLES her Mother in a HUG. 
           Mother is surprised by it, then MELTS around Annalise. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        By Prom night, Peter had never felt 
                        more out of place--
           INT. PETER'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Peter-- in his PROM SUIT-- does his best to BANDAGE his 
           palm’s bleeding fingernail WOUNDS while fighting back TEARS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        He’d never felt uglier... 

           INT. ANNALISE’S LIVING ROOM

           Annalise’s Grandfather CLOCK tick.. tick... ticks... Peter 
           watches it morosely as he waits on the couch... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...He’d never felt more like giving 
                        up.

           Peter glances up to see ANNALISE coming down the stairs in 
           her spectacular PROM DRESS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise, on the other hand-- 

           Annalise is clearly on CLOUD NINE. (Girl) Peter FORCES a smile for her. 

           INT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           Annalise is BLISSFUL in Peter’s arms as their PARENTS fawn 
           over them, snapping PHOTOS on the front porch.  

           INT. MR. SONG’S CAR - NIGHT

           Annalise GLOWS in the passenger seat as Peter drives his 
           father’s CAR to Prom. Annalise glances at him, BEAMING! 

           But Annalise finds that Peter doesn’t smile back at her... In 
           fact, he won’t even look at her, his STOIC eyes on the road.  

           Annalise DEFLATES... her expression CLOUDS with WORRY...  

                                 PETER
                             (half-hearted)
                        ...You look nice. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Peter and Annalise trudge toward the school. Peter’s eyes are 
           downcast; Annalise’s are intent on Peter. 

           Annalise sets her jaw. She reaches out-- and HOLDS HIS HAND.

           Determined, Annalise SMILES at him again, PULLS him along--
           MONTAGE - HIGH SCHOOL GYM - PROM

           The school gymnasium is charmingly decorated. All the kids 
           are gussied up and jubilant. A LIVE BAND plays Sinatra’s The 
           Way You Look Tonight. 

           Annalise PLASTERS on an encouraging SMILE throughout; Peter 
           AVOIDS her gaze, grows increasingly blue:

           - Annalise scoops cups of colorful PUNCH for them to sip. 

           - Annalise passes Peter a note: You look nice too! 

           - Annalise playfully drapes STREAMERS on Peter’s shoulders. 

           - Annalise pulls Peter onto the DANCE FLOOR. She latches both 
           of their hands together and TWIRLS Peter in circles until the 
           whole world is spinning around them... But it’s no use...  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - PROM - LATER

           Annalise and Peter are smack-dab in the middle of the DANCE 
           FLOOR, engulfed by wildly dancing Prom-goers. By now, Peter’s 
           disengaged fully, in his own world as Annalise tries to get 
           him to dance. Annalise is growing discouraged... desperate...  

                                 BAND MEMBER
                             (as current song ends)
                        Alright, guys and gals, this is the 
                        last dance of the night! Be sure to 
                        share it with someone special-- 

           The Band strikes up the song: Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

           All the couples in the room embrace for a SLOW DANCE. 
           Annalise takes the lead, wrapping her arms around Peter’s 
           shoulders. Peter hesitantly raises his hands to her hips. 

                                 BAND SINGER
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, way up 
                        high / There's a land that I've 
                        heard of once in a lullaby.

           Annalise steps CLOSER to Peter. TOUCHES her forehead to his--

           And finally, for the first time that night, their eyes 
           CONNECT. Annalise’s fake smile is gone now, earnestness in 
           its place. 

           Annalise peers so deeply into Peter’s eyes he’s left feeling 
           naked. And yet, he cannot bring himself to pull his eyes 
           away, seized by her gaze. 
                                 BAND SINGER (CONT’D)
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, skies 
                        are blue / And the dreams that you 
                        dare to dream, really do come true.

           Peter’s eyes brim with TEARS, but this time, he doesn’t 
           blink, doesn’t hide. This time, he shows them to Annalise. It 
           breaks Annalise’s heart, but she doesn’t look away.   

           She sees him. 

           Sees her. 

                                 BAND SINGER (CONT’D)
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, blue 
                        birds fly / Birds fly over the 
                        rainbow, Why then, oh why can't I?

           (Girl) Peter opens her mouth-- as if she’s finally about to say something! Annalise 
           listens with all her might, on pins and needles! 

           But-- It’s too much for Peter. He rips his eyes away, casts 
           them to the floor. Turns his head to hide his burning tears. 

                                 BAND SINGER (CONT’D)
                        If happy little bluebirds fly 
                        beyond the rainbow / Why, oh why 
                        can't I?

           As the song ENDS, Peter hurriedly pulls himself out of 
           Annalise’s arms. He retreats from the dance floor, leaving 
           Annalise behind. Alone. Heartbroken. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise knew what she saw behind 
                        Peter’s eyes--

           INT. MR. SONG'S CAR - NIGHT

           Now Annalise is upset too, trying to hide her melancholy from 
           Peter as he drives them home in SILENCE. Annalise’s breath 
           HITCHES with rising, untamable DESPERATION.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --she had felt it once before too. 
                        Whatever Peter was hiding... it was 
                        killing him.

           Suddenly-- Annalise GRABS a scrap of paper and pen from her 
           purse! She FURIOUSLY scribbles as she succumbs to her tears--

           Annalise SHAKES Peter’s shoulder urgently. She points to the 
           side of the road emphatically-- 
                                 PETER
                        Annalise--! Don’t push me!  

           Annalise is ANGRY as she shoves his shoulder again-- pointing 
           at the side of the road-- 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, okay! Fine! 

           Peter pulls the car over as Annalise SNIFFLES. Even after the 
           car is in park and idling, Peter doesn’t face her. 

           Annalise SHOVES the NOTE she wrote into his lap: 

                                      What’s wrong? 

           Peter doesn’t even pick the note up. Doesn’t answer. 

           Annalise SCRAWLS another note-- SHOVES it into his lap:

                                      WHAT’S WRONG? 

           Again, no response. So another: 

                                      WHAT’S WRONG!?

           Suddenly-- Peter GASPS in DESPAIR!

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        ME! 

           It’s like this has uncorked all of Peter’s emotion. He BURSTS 
           into SOBS-- body-wracking, breathless, SOBS. He hunches over, 
           buries his face in his hands. 

           Annalise softens... She can’t bear to witness (girl) Peter so upset! Annalise scoots 
           across the seat-- closing the wide gap between them. She EMBRACES Peter. 

           (Girl) Peter deteriorates at her touch, folding into Annalise’s chest and allowing all 
           of the much-needed weeping to be wept. 

           Annalise tries to catch Peter’s gaze again, the way they had during the dance. When 
           their pupils do connect, Annalise implores (girl) Peter with her eyes, with everything 
           she has: Please... tell me... 

           Peter is slowly swayed... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (through tears)
                        Annalise... I... 
           Peter’s voice catches in her throat. Her chin trembles as she tries again: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (barely audible)
                        ...I have a secret.

           Annalise doesn’t break her gaze with Peter, doesn’t even blink. She waits patiently. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        You’ll think I’m insane... but... I 
                        feel inside... that...

           (Girl) Peter takes in a shaky breath-- she’s terrified: 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (whispered)
                        I’m a woman. 

           Annalise GASPS! SHOCKED!  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Peter-- you are!

           Peter is STUNNED right back!

           For a moment, neither Annalise nor Peter can talk, can move, can breathe! Finally: 

                                 PETER
                        Y-- Y-- You can talk!?

           They GAPE at each other some more! This is unbelievable! Peter SMILES!

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Annalise-- you have a lovely voice! 

           And now Annalise is SMILING right back! She takes a DEEP, MOMENTOUS 
           BREATH-- and she TALKS.

           We don’t hear what she says, we only watch as Annalise talks a-mile-a-minute. The 
           longer Annalise talks, the lighter and freer Peter becomes. Tears DRYING. Spirits 
           LIFTING. The two of them GLOWING in the WONDER they have for each other. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Just as Peter had told Annalise, 
                        Annalise told Peter. She told Peter 
                        of her special vision. She told 
                        Peter of her poor Uncle’s 
                        imprisonment and of her resulting 
                        promise to herself.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But most importantly, Annalise told 
                        Peter, in no uncertain terms: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        I see you-- I’ve always seen you-- 
                        as a woman. 

           Annalise’s words HANG in the air as Peter silently SOAKS this in, unreadable... For 
           a brief moment, Annalise grows CONCERNED: Oh no, does Peter think she’s insane? 

           But then-- Peter HUGS Annalise. CLINGS to her. Pure RELIEF. Annalise wraps 
           herself protectively around Peter, relieved as well. This moment lasts a lifetime. 

           Until finally-- Annalise pulls away from Peter ever-so-slightly. Annalise carefully 
           places her fingertips beneath Peter’s chin, brushes her thumb against Peter’s lips--

           Peter’s breath catches in her chest at Annalise’s touch. The two are closer than 
           they’ve ever been-- and then finally--

           Their lips CONNECT. 

           It’s a KISS so magnetic, so urgent, so intimate-- that the both of them GASP. 

           Peter pulls Annalise closer by her waist. As they KISS DEEPER, Annalise opens her 
           eyes just slightly-- and she’s delighted to find that in her Special Vision, millions of 
           little SPARKLES float through the air around them, as if they were in a luminous 
           SNOW GLOBE. 

           Annalise GRINS as she closes her eyes again, giving herself fully to their KISS--

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                             (whisper)
                        What do I look like? 

           INT. MR. SONG'S CAR - LATER

           After their kissing, (girl) Peter’s arms are wrapped tightly around Annalise’s 
           shoulders. Annalise leans into Peter’s chest, so Peter is whispering into her hair.  

                                 PETER
                        Describe me. Please. 

           Annalise has a dreamy look on her face as she speaks. Annalise doesn’t even have to 
           look at Peter to recall what she looks like; Annalise knows it by heart. And of course, 
           everything Annalise says is true about the Peter we can see in her eyes.  
                                 ANNALISE
                        You have long black hair, curled in 
                        at the ends.

                                 PETER
                             (wistful)
                        I have long hair? 

           Peter touches her own hair gingerly... longingly... 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Mm-hm. And you have such long 
                        eyelashes too... And full lips... 
                        and the cutest nose... 

           Peter rests her chin comfortably on the crown of Annalise’s head, daydreaming off of 
           Annalise’s words... 

                                 PETER
                        What about my skin? Is it scarred? 
                        Is it burned?

           Annalise reaches up and traces a finger down Peter’s flawless cheek, the side that we 
           usually see scarred. Annalise SIGHS warmly. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        No. But it wouldn’t matter anyway 
                        if it were. You are radiant. 

           This-- this look on Peter’s face-- this is true happiness. 

           Annalise glances up at Peter, HOPE shining on her face. 

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        You believe me, then? What I see? 

           Peter looks down at Annalise, HOPE shining on her face too. 

                                 PETER
                        How could I not? 
                             (beat)
                        It’s what I’ve always felt. 

           INT. ANNALISE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annalise practically FLOATS through the front door in her 
           PROM DRESS. She FLIPS off the light before she glides up the 
           stairs to her room... Leaving the living room in DARKNESS... 
           ...Mother inches into view, holding the phone to her CHEST. 
           She’s been watching Annalise from the kitchen where the 
           phone’s cord has kept her tethered. 

           Mother’s giddy as she lifts the phone receiver to her ear:

                                 MOTHER
                             (whisper into phone)
                        Looks promising over here! You? 

                                 MRS. SONG (ON PHONE)
                        One moment-- 

           INT. SONG FAMILY HOME - NIGHT 

           Mrs. Song wears curlers and a bathrobe as she IRONS Mr. 
           Song’s shirt in the living room. She feigns nonchalance, 
           sneaks peeks over her shoulder where-- 

           Peter HUMS happily to himself, taking shoes off by the door-- 

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Did you have a nice night, Baobao?

                                 PETER (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Mm... The best. 

           As Peter disappears up the stairs, thrilled Mrs. Song pulls 
           the phone up from where it’s been HIDDEN behind the iron--

                                 MRS. SONG
                             (whisper into phone)
                        I think it is a success! 

           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM / PETER’S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Split Screen: Dreamy Annalise and Dreamy Peter both lay on 
           their beds, still in their Prom gown and tux respectively, 
           still basking in the magic of the evening... 

           At the very same time, as if they were being pulled, they 
           rise from their beds-- go to their bedroom windows. They look 
           out to see each other appear in their windows across the 
           street. Both GIGGLE a bit to find the other one there too.  

           Peter scribbles on paper, lifts it up to show her: 

                                 Sweet dreams, Annalise 

           Annalise blushes. She presses her palm to the glass of her 
           window. Peter does the same, a smile lingering on his lips...  
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise and Peter decided not to 
                        tell anyone else their secrets-- 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Annalise blows out the candles of her BIRTHDAY CAKE at the 
           kitchen table. Her parents and the Songs surround her and 
           CHEER! Annalise scribbles with chalk on her kitchen SLATE-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        To the rest of the world, Annalise 
                        was still every bit the mute she 
                        had always been--

           Annalise lifts the slate: Thank you all! 

           INT. BOYS’ LOCKER ROOM - DAY 

           Peter changes out of his GYM CLOTHES into his BOY CLOTHES 
           with the other boys in the locker room--  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        To the rest of the world, Peter was 
                        still every bit the boy he had 
                        always been--

           Peter studies himself in the mirror as he fixes his hair. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But alone, together... 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY 

           Annalise and (girl) Peter lounge on a blanket in the midst of the neighborhood 
           FOREST, their surroundings festooned with WHIMSY thanks to Annalise’s Vision.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...they were free. 

           Annalise’s head rests on Peter’s stomach. She READS ALOUD from the copy of The 
           Diary of Anne Frank she had lent to Peter. Peter savors every word Annalise says... 

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        Try it again--! 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Annalise SCREAMS at the top of her lungs! When she’s done, she’s BEAMING. (Girl) 
           Peter laughs at Annalise’s adorable expression--
                                 PETER
                        See? Doesn’t it feel... so...

                                 ANNALISE
                        Electrifying! 

                                 PETER
                        Exactly! 

                                 ANNALISE
                        It hurts my throat a little. 

                                 PETER
                        Oh no, in a bad way? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (shaking head no)
                        In the best way-- 

           Annalise takes in another breath and-- SHRIEKS again! With all of her might!  

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        I forgot how good it feels! 

           Peter is overwhelmed with adoration for her-- EMBRACES Annalise. Annalise 
           buries herself in Peter’s chest, practically bouncing with excitement.  

                                 PETER
                        Ready to try some more? 

           MONTAGE - FOREST - DAY

           - Annalise WHISPERS as softly as she can, to Peter’s amusement.  

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whispering)
                        Can you still hear me? 

                                 PETER
                        Sort of...

                                 ANNALISE
                             (even softer)
                        ...How about now?

                                 PETER
                        Just barely... 

           - Annalise GIGGLES. Then CHUCKLES. Then full-on LAUGHS! She can’t control it 
               anymore, she’s overcome with laughter--DOUBLING OVER!  Peter CRACKS UP-- 
                         ANNALISE
                                                     PETER (CONT'D)
                                              Your laugh is so cute! 
                 (laughing, tearing up)
           Oh, no! It’s-- I can’t stop 
           now! It’s addicting! 

           - Annalise tests out different PITCHES for her voice: 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (low pitch)
                        Maybe I should talk like this? 

                                 PETER
                        I don’t think so... 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (high pitch)
                        How about I talk like this? 

                                 PETER
                             (chuckling)
                        That’s even worse.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Now you try!

                                 PETER
                        ...Me?

           - Nervous, (girl) Peter speaks in a higher-than-normal voice-- in the range of the 
           falsetto Peter uses when singing:

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Um... how-- how is this? Is-- does 
                        this seem right? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (grinning)
                        Mm. It suits you. 

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        You know what we should do--? 

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Annalise and (girl) Peter laze on the blanket in the sun dappled forest, snacking on 
           foods from their lunch pail-- a PICNIC. 

                                 PETER
                        We should investigate. 
           Annalise’s Vision makes some of the snacks look like inedible things: Grapes look like 
           DICE, a sandwich looks like a PENNY LOAFER, a banana looks like a GERBER 
           DAISY. Annalise happily munches on these.

                                 ANNALISE
                             (mouth full)
                        Investigate what? 

                                 PETER
                        Investigate you! You say there’s no 
                        rhyme or reason to your sight, 
                        right? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Yes...? 

                                 PETER
                        Well, how do you know that? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        I guess... I simply realized it. 
                        After failing to make sense of it 
                        for so long.  

                                 PETER
                        Yes-- but-- you never had a 
                        translator before, did you? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Translator?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah! Translator! Interpreter! I 
                        can be that for you-- You tell me 
                        what you see, I’ll tell you what I 
                        see, and we’ll go over all the 
                        evidence to find the pattern. Break 
                        the code! 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (sigh)
                        ...what if there is no code? 

                                 PETER
                        How could there not be? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Trust me... I’ve tried. You’re 
                        setting yourself up for 
                        disappointment, Peter. 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t make sense... 
           Annalise dims. But Peter’s determination doesn’t. Peter leans CLOSE to Annalise:

                                 PETER
                        It can’t be a coincidence, 
                        Annalise. That we feel the same 
                        thing. Don’t you believe that? 

           Annalise SHRUGS... 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I believe it. 

           Peter is so close, Annalise goes almost cross-eyed to look at her. Peter SHINES with 
           so much conviction that Annalise can’t help but GRIN. She gives Peter a soft KISS... 

                                 ANNALISE (PRE-LAP)
                        I didn’t realize how good it would 
                        feel--

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           The sun is SETTING as Annalise and (girl) Peter finish packing up their PICNIC. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        --to see you listening to me... 

                                 PETER
                        What do you mean? 

           Annalise and Peter set off, strolling through the woods back home. All the while, 
           Peter studies Annalise’s face, Peter’s whole attention is placed on her: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Before, when I wrote something to 
                        you, you’d be looking down at the 
                        words when you understood me. But 
                        now, you look right at me when 
                        you... when you understand me... I 
                        didn’t even realize how much I 
                        wanted that...

                                 PETER
                        ...I didn’t realize before just how 
                        much I longed to hear your voice...

           Annalise slows to a stop... We return to normal vision.

           They’ve reached the edge of the forest. Their neighborhood 
           and everyone else in the world LOOMS on the other side... 
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        ...Say something again. Before we 
                        have to go back. 

           Annalise KISSES Peter tenderly.  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Peter... 

           With her pointer finger, Annalise traces Peter’s scarred 
           cheek... lips... chin... 

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        I was thinking... I don’t think the 
                        name Peter quite fits you...  

                                 PETER
                        No...?

                                 ANNALISE
                        Mm-mm. It’s much too... 

           Peter grows a little sad... 

                                 PETER
                        I know... 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (quickly)
                        So I was thinking-- how about we 
                        call you-- Song? 

           Peter considers this...  

                                 PETER
                             (testing out)
                        Song... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It felt right. 

           Peter GRINS at Annalise. NODS.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It felt like herself. 

                                 SONG
                        Song.

           [From here on out, Peter Song will be referred to only as 
           Song, and her pronoun will be she, even when we see her 
           appearing as a “boy” in normal vision.]
           With that, Annalise & Song walk back out into the world-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        When Annalise & Song crossed their 
                        high school graduation stage, they 
                        felt as if it was also a graduation 
                        from the worst phase of their lives-

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - GRADUATION - DAY 

           Song SMILES in a GRADUATION CAP and GOWN as she strides 
           toward the school PRINCIPAL to accept her DIPLOMA. Song and 
           Annalise’s PARENTS CHEER in the crowd!

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Never before did the future look as 
                        bright as it did now. 

           Song reaches the other side of the stage, where she joins 
           BEAMING Annalise, DIPLOMA already in hand--

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Annalise and Song POSE in front of the school in their 
           GRADUATION GARB. Their PARENTS snap photos-- FLASH! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But at the same time, the 
                        brightness of possibility was 
                        almost blinding... 

           Annalise and Song BLINK the flash spots out of their eyes, 
           photos finished. Their PARENTS move to get into their CARS--

                                 SONG
                        We’ll meet you at home.

                                 MRS. SONG
                        You don’t want to ride? 

                                 SONG
                        Nah, we’ll take one last walk home 
                        from school. For old times’ sake.  

           Song GRINS at Annalise. Their mothers swap knowing looks.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Annalise and Song meander their well-worn path home from 
           school. But their GRINS are GONE. Now they’re RUMINATING... 

           NUDGE at Song’s elbow. A NOTE. Song accepts it from Annalise:  
                                       What now...?

           Song SIGHS weightily... She speaks in her higher-pitched 
           voice when it’s just her and Annalise: 

                                 SONG
                        I don’t know. Before Prom, I didn’t 
                        even think I’d make it this far... 

           Annalise sobers at this thought, that Song might not have 
           been here... But Song is beginning to perk up: 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Well, I suppose we could start our 
                        investigation? Maybe that can be 
                        our summer mission: solve the 
                        mystery of your sight! Besides, we 
                        should probably know the answer to 
                        that before we decide what to do 
                        with the rest of our lives...

           Annalise seems hesitant. She starts SCRIBBLING her reply, a 
           LONGER message in her notebook, which FRUSTRATES Song--

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Writing takes so long-- Can’t you 
                        just tell me? Whisper it! 

           With a HUFF, Annalise jots a smaller response: 

                           Too dangerous!! Someone might see!!  

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        I know, but it’s like we’re 
                        still...!

           Song SIGHS again, frustrated... Annalise wilts. 

           Song gazes out at the horizon pensively. The SKYLINE of the 
           BIG CITY looms beyond the suburbs... 

           Gradually... Song BRIGHTENS: 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Annalise... What if we go where no 
                        one knows us? 

           EXT. ANNALISE’S BACKYARD - DAY 

           Wearing sunglasses and bathing suits, Mother and Mrs. Song 
           stretch out on lawn chairs in the backyard. They alternate 
           sunbathing, smoking, sipping iced tea. 

           Annalise and Song approach them nervously... 
                                 SONG
                        Hey-- Ma? 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Mm? 

                                 SONG
                        Um. Annalise and I are going to 
                        take the train into the city. To 
                        search for jobs.  

           Mother and Mrs. Song simultaneously pull down their shades to 
           squint at their kids. 

                                 MOTHER
                        But you just graduated! Don’t you 
                        want a little summer vacation 
                        before getting into all that nitty-
                        gritty of employment? 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Yes, why not have some fun first? 
                        The rest can be dealt with come the 
                        Fall.

           Annalise and Song glance to each other, then return 
           DETERMINED looks to their mothers. 

                                 SONG
                        We’d rather get a head start. I 
                        mean, who knows how long it might 
                        take to find a good job? 

           Mother and Mrs. Song stare incredulously at them. 

                                 MOTHER
                        You too, Annalise? 

           Annalise NODS. Mother and Mrs. Song exchange looks... SHRUG. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Well... alright then. 

           Annalise and Song BEAM. Yes! They spin eagerly to go--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Wait! When will you be back? 

                                 SONG
                             (as they’re leaving)
                        Oh-- Late. Probably late--r. After 
                        dinner-- We’ll just eat something 
                        in the city. Okay? Thanks-- thank 
                        you Ma! Bye! 
           Annalise and Song disappear into the house. Mother and Mrs. 
           Song stare after them, deadpan... 

                                 MOTHER
                        ...There’s no way in hell those two 
                        are really job searching. 

                                 MRS. SONG
                        Hell no. 

           Mother and Mrs. Song simultaneously push their shades back up 
           their noses. Cool as cucumbers. 

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        Let them have their summer fun. 

           MONTAGE - CITY - VARIOUS

           Each moment is a DIFFERENT DAY; throughout all of this, 
           Annalise and Song GAB NONSTOP:

           A) Annalise and Song scoot close together, excitedly peer out 
           of the TRAIN WINDOW as they ENTER the BIG, BUSTLING CITY. The 
           deeper their train snakes into the metropolis, the brighter 
           their eyes GLEAM with CURIOSITY and AWE!  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Once they were in the privacy of 
                        the urban jungle, Annalise & Song 
                        were finally free to talk to their 
                        hearts’ content. 

           B) Annalise and Song emerge from the underground train 
           station into the heart of the CITY. They are overwhelmed by 
           the vastness, tilting their heads up to take in the TOWERING 
           SKYSCRAPERS surrounding them. In Annalise’s Vision: several of the 
           SKYSCRAPERS are made of billowing SILKS and twinkling STARS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Though they chattered constantly, 
                        there was one conversation to which 
                        they always returned-- 

           C) Annalise and Song venture through an ART MUSEUM. Song is 
           enraptured by a piece of MODERN ART. Annalise, however, is enraptured 
           by a fellow PATRON who appears to have POLKA-DOTTED SKIN in her vision. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        They wondered together what they 
                        had wondered privately for so long: 
                        Why were they the way they were? 
           D) Annalise and Song saunter along the city’s WATERFRONT 
           lined with SHOPS and RESTAURANTS. In Annalise’s Vision: One of the 
           FOUNTAINS they pass SPEWS DIAMONDS into the air. The flock of PIGEONS 
           taking flight around them are instead soaring CUPCAKES. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        They suspected that maybe the 
                        answers to their life-long 
                        questions-- Why did Annalise see 
                        the way she did? Why did Song feel 
                        the way she did?-- had been found 
                        within each other... 

           E) Annalise and Song board a CITY BUS where-- Annalise is bewildered 
           to see that the bus DRIVER’S hands are SNAKES in her eyes. In fact, many of the bus 
           PASSENGERS look very DIFFERENT to Annalise... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...Could it be that Annalise saw 
                        the truth? And could it be that 
                        Song felt it? 

                                 SONG (PRE-LAP)
                        We’re gonna need a new notebook-- 

           INT. QUAINT BOOKSTORE - DAY 

           In a cozy bookshop in the city, Song peeks at Annalise over 
           the top of a PULP DETECTIVE NOVEL: 

                                 SONG
                        --for our investigation. 

           Annalise is a kid in a candy shop in here, bright-eyed at the 
           multitude of things to read. She adds the detective novel to 
           the tall stack of books Song carries for her--

                                 ANNALISE
                        Better get the biggest notebook you 
                        can find. It’s going to take a lot 
                        of investigating to solve me... 

                                 SONG
                             (teasing)
                        You don’t think I have what it 
                        takes to crack the curious case of 
                        Annalise? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Of course not, I think you’re a 
                        regular Nancy Drew. 
           Annalise gives Song a SMOOCH whilst adding a GIANT TOME to 
           the pile, weighing Song down--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        But I also still think I’m a wild 
                        goose chase. 

                                 SONG
                             (chuckling)
                        Jeez, Annalise! How many books are 
                        we buying you? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Depends... How many can we carry? 

                                 SONG
                        You ever thought about writing a 
                        book of your own? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (scoff)
                        What? No. 

                                 SONG
                        Why not!? You love books! 

                                 ANNALISE
                        I wouldn’t know how.

                                 SONG
                        Oh come on, yes you would. You’ve 
                        read a million of them-- And you’ve 
                        written more than a million notes. 
                        Perhaps enough for a book already! 
                        Why not write one yourself? 

           Annalise averts her eyes from Song. Feigns focus on the 
           bookshelf nearest her... 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Because... 

           Song can see she’s struck a nerve with Annalise... Song 
           reaches out and tenderly touches Annalise’s arm...

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                             (soft)
                        Song... If I wrote a book, no one 
                        would understand it. How can I 
                        write books about the world when I 
                        don’t even know what the world 
                        sees? 
                                 SONG
                        Don’t write about their world. 
                        Write about yours. 

           Annalise finally glances at Song. Song offers her an 
           encouraging smile. Suddenly, Song points over Annalise’s 
           shoulder, to a NOTEBOOK on display behind her: 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Is that notebook big enough?  

           Annalise inspects, then picks up the notebook. She plops it 
           on top of the pile of books in Song’s arms:

                                 ANNALISE
                             (shrug)
                        It’s a start-- 

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           A new day: Song wraps her arms around Annalise as they sprawl 
           in the grass of the CITY PARK. Song POINTS to a HOT AIR 
           BALLOON, hovering in the distance. 

                                 SONG
                        What about that? 

           We see it along with her as Annalise describes what she’s observing:

                                 ANNALISE
                        That thing in the air? It’s a big 
                        blue whale. Swimming in the sky...

                                 SONG
                        Hm. Interesting... 

           Song records this in a long LIST they’ve compiled in their 
           INVESTIGATION NOTEBOOK, comparing Song’s sight to Annalise’s.

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (pointing)
                        Alright, what about that-- there?

           Song’s watching a DOG playing FETCH with a TENNIS BALL. But 
           Annalise, she’s watching something entirely different: 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (squinting)
                        Hm, well it’s a lawn mower. Chasing 
                        a-- a--- oh, what’s it called. A 
                        penguin! A tiny, running penguin--

           Song BURSTS out laughing! 
                                 SONG
                        You see a lawn mower chasing a 
                        penguin!? How are you not laughing 
                        all the time!?

           But Annalise isn’t laughing, not at all. Annalise is HURT by 
           Song’s amusement. Song sobers quickly--

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Oh-- Annalise. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        sorry, I shouldn’t have--

           Annalise SHOVES the NOTEBOOK out of Song’s hands. Dejected. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        None of this makes any sense...

                                 SONG
                        Aw, come on. We can’t give up that 
                        easy... 

           Annalise SIGHS. Song KISSES Annalise’s temple encouragingly, 
           then picks up the NOTEBOOK to resume their investigation. 

                                 SONG (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea--

           EXT./INT. - PARK / TUNNEL - EVENING

           Annalise and Song meander through the city park at DUSK, 
           making their way to the park’s exit. Annalise is still glum 
           from their “investigation.” Song’s got her eye on something 
           in the distance-- 

                                 SONG
                        It won’t take long, come on! 

           Song LEADS Annalise into a nearby TUNNEL in the walking path. 
           Inside the tunnel it’s DARK. Song pulls Annalise close... 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Okay, now yell. 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whisper)
                        Yell what? 

                                 SONG
                        I don’t know, anything-- Yell 
                        anything you’d like. Trust me. 

           Annalise playfully POUTS, but gives in to Song’s eager smile. 
                                 ANNALISE
                        Fine... 

           Annalise scrunches up her eyes, takes a deep breath, and--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        HELLO!!!!

           HELLO! Hello! Hello... hello... her voice ECHOES back to her, 
           bouncing off the tunnel’s walls and returning to them. 
           Annalise brightens, turns to Song, who’s already beaming. 

                                 SONG
                        Try it again!

           Annalise thinks for a brief second-- then INHALES and: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        MY NAME IS ANNALISE! 

           Annalise can’t help but GIGGLE as her voice returns in a 
           CHORUS at them, circling around them from every angle. 
           Annalise BASKS in it. Song HUGS her, squeezing her TIGHT. 

                                 SONG
                        Listen to you! See? Don’t you sound 
                        lovely? 

           Annalise opens her mouth to respond, but she CHOKES UP...

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (murmur in Annalise’s ear)
                        We’ll figure you out. I promise.
                             (beat)
                        Now try it once more, really loud 
                        so it rings in my ears. 

           Annalise SNIFFS back her bittersweet TEARS, summoning the 
           words for this moment: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        HERE I AM!

           Her voice RICOCHETS around them, ENVELOPING them fully. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And oh, how lovely it sounded 
                        indeed. 

           EXT. ANNALISE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           BOOM! Fireworks EXPLODE in the sky! ILLUMINATING Annalise’s 
           backyard in technicolor flashes. 
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        By the 4th of July that summer, 
                        never had either felt so alive. 

           Mother, Father, Mrs. Song, and Mr. Song laugh DRUNKENLY, 
           sipping on Chinese LIQUOR and chomping on American BBQ. 
           Annalise and Song lurk behind them, watching the fireworks. 

           Mrs. Song RISES from her seat, empty LIQUOR BOTTLE in hand--

                                 MRS. SONG
                        We need more baijiu! 

           As Mrs. Song passes them, Annalise hands Song a tiny NOTE: 

                                           Now?

           Reading this note SUCKS the air out of Song. Breathless, Song 
           looks from the note back up to Annalise. Song just barely 
           NODS. Annalise grabs Song’s hand-- 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        That night, they felt a crackling 
                        anticipation--

           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           BOOOOM! Another firework’s EXPLOSION resonates in Annalise’s 
           room as Annalise and Song slip inside. Annalise takes care to 
           LOCK the door behind her... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --a lightning nervousness-- 

           Annalise pulls Song further into the room... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        --their hearts pounding with with 
                        each bang! of a firecracker.

           BANG! Another FLASH of colorful illumination spills inside 
           the window, highlighting both of their NERVOUS expressions... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        They had been talking about doing 
                        this for a few weeks now... 

           ...Song UNDRESSES slowly in front of Annalise... unbuttoning 
           her men’s shirt and unbuckling her men’s belt... 

           As the clothes fall away, leaving Song only in loose-fitting 
           underwear, Annalise moves toward her CLOSET. 
           Annalise rummages inside only a moment before re-emerging 
           with one of her DRESSES. It’s pretty, delicate, UNDERSTATED. 
           A rather ordinary dress for a rather ordinary girl. 

           Song bites her lip anxiously as she steps into the dress, 
           sliding it up her thighs and over her hips easily. 

           Annalise stands behind Song; both of them watch themselves in 
           the full-length mirror as Annalise zips Song into it. The 
           dress fits as if it had been specially tailored for Song.

                                 SONG
                             (breathless)
                        How do I look? 

           Annalise scrutinizes Song’s reflection... Strangely, in Annalise’s Vision, this dress still 
           looks quite normal. Powder BLUE, airy fabric, freshly ironed. Song GLOWS in it. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Happy.
                             (grinning)
                        You look happy. 

           Song smiles softly, turning toward Annalise--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to have it. It’s yours. 

           Song’s moved by her gift. They share a tender KISS-- the two 
           of them beautifully SILHOUETTED in Annalise’s bedroom WINDOW--

           EXT. SONG FAMILY HOME - SIMULTANEOUS

           --which is easily SEEN from down below in the Song’s front 
           yard, where MRS. SONG stands, a new bottle of baijiu in hand. 

           Mrs. Song STARES up at Annalise & Song. DUMBSTRUCK. 

           FEAR-- tears-- fill Mrs. Song’s eyes as she watches Annalise 
           and Song’s kiss break apart. As she watches her child twirl 
           in Annalise’s DRESS up in the window... 

           It looks as though Mrs. Song is going to fully break down 
           CRYING-- but just as her trembling chin and glossing eyes are 
           about to give way-- 

           Mrs. Song SWALLOWS back her emotion forcefully. SETS her jaw. 
           AVERTS her eyes from what she’s seen in the window--

           --in time with another firework’s BOOM! 
           INT. SONG FAMILY HOME - MORNING

           BRIGHT morning light. Mrs. Song slumps at her kitchen table, 
           HUNGOVER. Smoking. She finishes POURING WHISKEY into her cup 
           of tea... HIDES the bottle of liquor again. 

           Mrs. Song perks as she hears Song trying to slip out of the 
           front door unnoticed-- Mrs. Song calls out to her--

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Bide (Peter)! Come here... 

           Song begrudgingly appears in the kitchen. Antsy. Mrs. Song 
           doesn’t even look at her. EXHALES a drag of her cigarette...  

                                 SONG
                        ... What? 

           Mrs. Song simply PATS the place next to her at the table. 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go meet Annalise, our train 
                        leaves at--

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Surely you can give your mother one 
                        minute... 

           Song SCOFFS. Drops into the seat by her Mother.

           Mrs. Song SIGHS, struggles to find the words to say. She 
           fiddles with the GOLD RING on her finger. There are two 
           CHINESE CHARACTERS engraved on it. 

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        You see this? ...My grandmother 
                        gave me this ring when I left 
                        China... You see those characters? 
                        Can you read them? 

           Song looks closer... but shakes her head NO. She can’t 
           recognize them. Mrs. Song grows emotional, voice cracking--

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Mm, you cannot-- cannot read 
                        them... This is “Ruyi.” It means:
                             (in English)
                        “Live as you desire.”
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Bide... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                        For so long, I believed that I 
                        desired to live in this country. To 
                        be American. Even after I arrived 
                        and it was far more difficult than 
                        I had dreamed, I still believed 
                        that this was what I wanted. But 
                        Bide, I did not know the nature of 
                        what I desired. I believed that I 
                        desired a chance at prosperity, 
                        that I desired that prosperity for 
                        you, my son-- 
                             (fighting back emotion)
                        Baobao, the longer I am here, the 
                        more I see what I desired for what 
                        it really is. That to be American 
                        means I am a thousand miles away 
                        from my parents’ deathbed. That to 
                        be American means I am not fully 
                        Chinese, not fully American, but 
                        nationless in the eyes of both my 
                        countrymen. That to be American is 
                        to have a son that cannot even 
                        recognize “desire” in my 
                        language... Now I--

           Mrs. Song takes a long, shaky DRAG of her cigarette. 

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        I got what I desired.  

           Mrs. Song EXHALES her smoke, TEARS in her eyes. Song is 
           DISTURBED by the amount of emotion she’s seeing from her 
           mother... Mrs. Song grows very serious:  

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Bide, you must see your desires for 
                        what they really are... You must 
                        look past them... you must look 
                        through them... you must look 
                        beneath them... and you must find 
                        what trap is hiding there for you.

           Mrs. Song STANDS abruptly-- dabbing at her eyes. She exits 
           the room without looking back at Song:

                                 MRS. SONG (CONT’D)
                        Go. Catch your train. 

           Song is left behind in the kitchen. Alone. Unsure...

           Annalise and Song hike through the city at NIGHT. Annalise 
           POINTS out things and records what she sees in the COMPARISON 
           NOTEBOOK. But Song’s distracted, barely listens to her... 

           Instead, Song’s ANALYZING every little thing they pass, as if 
           she’s SEARCHING for something in particular... 

           Song looks BEHIND herself... 

                                                        ANNALISE
                    STORYTELLER (V.O.)
           How is one supposed to look 
           past a desire...?
                                                (quiet in background)
                                              What about that? It looks 
                                              like an igloo to me...

           Song looks to her LEFT...

                                                    ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                                                (quiet in background)
                    STORYTELLER (V.O.)
           How is one supposed to look 
           through a desire...? 
                                              Oh-- no wait, what about that 
                                              one! I see a carrot--

           Song looks to her RIGHT... 

                                                    ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                                                (quiet in background)
                    STORYTELLER (V.O.)
           How is one supposed to look 
           beneath a desi--!?
                                              Song...? Are you listening to 
                                              me...?

           Suddenly-- Song abruptly STOPS, her eyes WIDE. Annalise STOPS 
           too, seeing that something has MESMERIZED Song... 

           Song’s transfixed by a delicate PAINTING of a ROSE adorning a 
           nondescript DOOR... It’s as if Song’s HYPNOTIZED by it... 

                                 SONG
                        Annalise, do you see this painting? 

           Annalise SQUINTS at the door... then NODS: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Mm-hm... To me, it’s a Rose. 

                                 SONG
                        ...it’s a Rose to me too... 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (surprised)
                        You too!? Oh! 

           Annalise turns to scrutinize it alongside Song... Now they’re 
           BOTH spellbound by it... 
                     ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                                                          SONG
           ...What d’ya think--? 
                                              I feel--

                                 GRUFF MAN (O.S.)
                        You two lookin’ for The Rose? 

           Annalise & Song GASP! STARTLED when A GRUFF MAN (40s) emerges 
           from the shadows near the ROSE DOOR. He looks them up-and-
           down expectantly...

           Annalise and Song glance at each other... An unspoken 
           decision passing between them. They SHRUG... NOD. 

           Gruff Man NODS in return... unlatches the rose-painted 
           door... and USHERS them inside... 

           INT. METAL STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s almost as if they’re in a DREAM... Annalise reaches to 
           hold Song’s hand as they descend dingy METAL STAIRS... The 
           muffled plinking of an OLD PIANO wafts to their ears...

           The stairs deposit Annalise and Song at yet another door with 
           a ROSE painted on it. They exchange apprehensive GLANCES... 
           take a COLLECTIVE breath and-- OPEN THE DOOR-- 

           INT. THE ROSE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Annalise and Song find a lively but ragtag BAND and a 
           lively but ragtag CROWD. A SPEAKEASY. A lone SINGER commands 
           the room from the stage, belting a fiery rendition of Don’t 
           Rain on My Parade. 

           This SINGER wears a sparkly DRESS. This singer wears 
           elaborate MAKE UP and a WIG. This singer is A MAN. 

           Song is flabbergasted! She takes an astonished look around 
           the room to find that: MANY of the PATRONS in this speakeasy 
           are MEN dressed as WOMEN. 

           Song can barely breathe through her AWE. Annalise notices, is 
           amused by Song’s pure excitement. But when Annalise looks 
           around, of course she doesn’t see the room the same as Song.  

                                 ANNALISE
                             (over music)
                        What-- what are you seeing!? 

                                 SONG
                        Is this real!?
           Weak-kneed, Song takes a seat at a nearby little table for 
           two. Annalise joins her--

                                 ANNALISE
                        Song, what are you seeing!? Where 
                        are we!?  

                                 SONG
                        Annalise... the men here-- they’re-- 
                        they’re wearing dresses and-- and 
                        make up-- and-- and high heels! 

           Annalise takes another look around, CONFUSION setting in... 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Do you think... Do you think 
                        they’re like me!?  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Perhaps... You should ask! 

                                 SONG
                        Oh, no, no, no, I couldn’t-- 

                       SONG (CONT’D)
                                                        ANNALISE
           What if they think I--?
                                              Here, I’ll ask for you--

                                 SONG
                        Annalise--!

           Annalise scoots toward the nearest PATRON-- An elegant man 
           dressed akin to JACKIE KENNEDY.  

                                 ANNALISE
                        Pardon me-- Is this a club for men 
                        who are women? 

           The patron SMILES, LIPSTICK smudging on her crooked teeth--

                                 PATRON
                        Why-- yes, darlin’. I suppose it 
                        is. 

           The patron returns her attention to the SINGER who brings the 
           house down with the rousing climax of the MUSICAL NUMBER. 
           Song is utterly enraptured by the SINGER!

           But Annalise-- Annalise is distracted... She’s studying her 
           surroundings closer... and growing more and more UNEASY... 

                                 SONG (PRE-LAP)
                        Annalise, can you believe it--!?
           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Song BEAMS on the train ride home, can’t sit still she’s so 
           jazzed! 

                                 SONG
                        There are others like me! 

           Annalise is barely paying attention to Song; instead she 
           hunches over their INVESTIGATION NOTEBOOK, pouring over the 
           list of what Song sees VS what Annalise sees... 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        How many of them do you think were 
                        in there?

                                 ANNALISE
                             (writing in notebook)
                        Song-- Did that singer’s dress look 
                        floor-length to you? 

                                 SONG
                        What? I don’t remember-- But did 
                        you see that some of them had-- um--

           Song gestures to her chest, pantomiming BREASTS. 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (hushed)
                        How do you think they made them 
                        look so real!? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (writing in notebook)
                        What about the band-- what did they 
                        look like to you? 

           Song puts her hand over the comparison notebook--

                                 SONG
                        Annalise-- could you-- just forget 
                        the list for a moment? I’m-- this-- 
                        this changes everything! I mean, I--

           But Annalise can’t hide her look of DISAPPOINTMENT from 
           Song... Song thinks she understands: 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (comforting)
                        Oh, Annalise... Don’t worry! Maybe 
                        this means there’s a club out there 
                        somewhere with people just like you 
                        too!
           But this doesn’t cheer Annalise up, not a bit...

                                 ANNALISE
                             (hesitant)
                        Song, no. I... 
                             (sigh)
                        Those other people in there...?

           Annalise finally looks to Song. Song NODS: Go on... 

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t see them all as women... 

           Song’s face falls as this sinks in... 

                                 SONG
                        Then what did you...?

           Annalise looks back down to the list of sight comparisons...

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whisper)
                        ...They just looked like men in 
                        dresses. 

           For a long moment, Song just stares at Annalise... and then 
           Song turns her back to Annalise. 

                                 SONG
                        Well... well, that doesn’t... that 
                        doesn’t really mean anything... 

           Annalise shoots Song a reproachful look, HURT. But Song is 
           focused on her own REFLECTION in the train’s window...

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        I know what I saw... 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           THE ROSE PAINTING. 

           Conspicuously placed on its inconspicuous DOOR. 

           Song faces it with trepidation. She and Annalise loiter on 
           the bustling sidewalk outside The Rose in broad daylight. But 
           this time, the Gruff Man doesn’t greet them... 

           So Song raises an apprehensive fist... KNOCKS on the door... 

           ...no response. No one’s here. 

           Song’s palpably crestfallen. Annalise brims with IMPATIENCE. 
                                 ANNALISE
                        I told you, they probably aren’t 
                        open during the day. 

           Song glances around herself, as if the patrons from last 
           night are hiding just out of sight.

                                 SONG
                        But then... where do they all go? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Probably back to pretending to be 
                        normal, like we do! 

           Song droops, eyes falling to the ground. Annalise SIGHS... 
           places a tender hand on Song’s shoulder... 

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Song... Come on, let’s just-- 

                                 BABS (O.S.)
                        Weren’t you two here last night? 

           Song and Annalise spin to find BABS (30s) emerging from the 
           alley, smoking a cigarette. This is the Jackie Kennedy 
           impersonator they had met the night before. 

           But now, Babs isn’t dressed as Jackie, she’s instead wearing 
           androgynous shorts and shirt. She no longer wears a wig, her 
           hair instead cropped in a men’s style. 

           Song is STAR-STRUCK. 

                                 SONG
                        Y-- Yes. We were. 

           Babs gives Song a skeptical once-over while taking the last 
           drag on her cigarette. Babs flicks the cig butt away, 
           EXHALING the smoke with a GRIN. She offers Song her hand: 

                                 BABS
                        Welcome back. The name’s Babs.  

           INT. THE ROSE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           The Rose Club appears more run-down in the daytime with all 
           the lights on. The singer from last night, POPPY (30s), flits 
           about behind the BAR, restocking liquor. CARMEN (20s) is back 
           there with Poppy, wiping down the CUPS with a RAG. 

           Babs, Poppy, and Carmen are all THREE (as Annalise put it): 
           MEN WHO ARE WOMEN. In here, they can be THEMSELVES. 
           Babs leads eager Song into the room. Annalise cautiously 
           trails a few steps behind them. 

                                 BABS
                        Ladies! We’ve got company. 

           Everyone sidles up to their respective sides of the bar. 

                                 POPPY
                        More of your strays? 

                                 BABS
                             (to Song)
                        This is Poppy. 

                                 SONG
                        I saw you sing last night-- you 
                        were-- incredible. 

                                 POPPY
                             (nodding to Babs)
                        Did she tell you to say that?

                                 BABS
                             (to Song)
                        And this is Carmelita. 

                                 CARMEN
                        Call me Carmen. 

                                 SONG
                        Nice to meet you. I’m Pe-- Song. 
                        I’m Song. 

                                 POPPY
                             (to Annalise)
                        And you, dear? 

           Song looks to Annalise, who subtly shakes her head NO. Not 
           talking. 

                                 SONG
                        ...this is Annalise.

                                 BABS
                        Mm. So. Annalise and Song. What 
                        brings you two back to the Rose? 

                                 SONG
                             (embarrassed)
                        Oh-- Um... I... 

           Song peeks at Annalise for help. Annalise doesn’t offer any.  
                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        I... don’t...

           Carmen, Poppy, and Babs look KNOWINGLY to each other; it’s a 
           BITTERSWEET look. They close in around Song.  

                                 BABS
                        Tell you what I think. I think you 
                        look like you...

           Song grows nervous, flinching at the impending answer...

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        ...can sing.

                           POPPY
                                                          SONG
           Ooo- yes! 
                                              Sing...?

           Poppy, Babs, and Carmen shepherd Song up to the stage-- 
           LEAVING Annalise awkward by the bar-- 

                                 CARMEN
                        Trust me, querida, Babs’s got an 
                        eye for these things. 

                                                          BABS
                                              Mm-hm... mm-hm... I see it-- 
                           POPPY
           Step up to the microphone-- 
           like-- yes like that--

                                 SONG
                        Well... I do sing sometimes... by 
                        myself--

                          CARMEN
                                                          POPPY
           How does she always know!?
                                              Every. Time.

                                 BABS
                             (shrug)
                        I have the gift.

           The three step back and APPRAISE Song... Song’s nervous 
           behind the microphone on stage, still wearing BOYS CLOTHES...

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        ...we’re gonna need a better 
                        costume. 

                           POPPY
           Absolutely. 
                                                         CARMEN
                                              I’ll get my case--

                                 SONG
                        ...costume?
           INT. THE ROSE CLUB - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Annalise SCOWLS on the sidelines as Babs, Carmen, and Poppy 
           flutter around Song. They’re BACKSTAGE in a dressing room. 
           Carmen brushes dramatic MAKE-UP across Song’s complexion--

                                 CARMEN
                        Hand me the rouge, bomboncita-- 

           Poppy hands a COMPACT to Carmen while affixing a BLACK WIG 
           atop Song’s head--

                                 POPPY
                        What do we think? More curls?

                                 BABS
                        And higher, please-- Higher the 
                        hair, closer to God--

           Babs holds up two DRESS options: In Annalise’s eyes, one dress looks like 
           it’s made entirely of PEARLS, the other looks to be made of USED CHEWING GUM. 

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        Which dress do we think? 

           Annalise points to the one she sees as PEARLS, but everyone 
           else in the room points to the OTHER DRESS. 

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        Perfect! 

           Babs ZIPS the not-Annalise-approved DRESS up Song’s back. The 
           chest of the dress SAGS, nothing to fill it. 

           Babs pulls out a set of FAKE BREASTS. Displays them to Song--

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           Song can only NOD... Babs carefully maneuvers the breasts 
           into the dress, filling it out. Song scrutinizes herself in 
           the mirror, SPEECHLESS...

           When it all comes together, it’s a flashier take on the 
           iconic Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffany’s look. 

           Frankly, it’s quite fabulous.

           But behind them, Annalise GLOWERS. 

           In her eyes, it’s not a sparkly black dress on Song, it’s a garment made of USED 
           CHEWING GUM. It’s not fake breasts stuffed inside, it’s a pair of BAGUETTES. 
           It’s not a wig atop her head, it’s a very confused POMERANIAN. It’s not make-up 
           smeared along her cheeks, it’s grotesque POND SCUM. 

           Frankly, it’s quite ridiculous. 

           But even Annalise can plainly see: Song is taken with her reflection...  

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        So... What d’ya think, Miss Song? 

                                 SONG
                        I... I love it! 

           INT. THE ROSE CLUB - STAGE - DAY

           Song takes her place behind the mic on stage. She stands 
           TALL, emboldened by her new outfit. Babs, Poppy, Carmen 
               survey her proudly. Annalise grows grumpier by the second. 

                                 POPPY 
                        There we are, that’s better. 

                                 SONG
                        Can I... can I really sing up here? 

                                 CARMEN
                        Of course you can! 

                                 BABS
                        Even better, you can come back 
                        tomorrow night-- should have a full 
                        house on a Friday. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        She doesn’t sing in front of 
                        people. 

           Poppy, Babs, Carmen turn to give Annalise stink eyes... 

                                 POPPY
                             (mutter, RE: Annalise)
                        Oh... she talks--

                                 SONG
                        Well, I haven’t sung in front of 
                        people before... but... I think I’d 
                        like to try...

                                 CARMEN
                        You sing your heart out, querida. 
                        With a name like yours, how could 
                        you not? 
           Song BEAMS from their encouragement.

                                 ANNALISE (PRE-LAP)
                        Let’s go home... 

           INT. METAL STAIRCASE - EVENING

           Annalise POUTS on the metal staircase outside The Rose. Song-- 
           still in the wig, make-up, sparkly dress, fake breasts-- 
           slouches next to her. They speak in HUSHED tones:

                                   SONG
                         Now? Can’t we stay a little longer? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whine)
                        I’m tired. 

                                 SONG
                        What’s the matter with you? You’ve 
                        been sour all day! 

           Annalise SCOFFS. 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Oh, don’t pretend you haven’t been-- 
                        Why are you acting so glum!? 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (gesturing to Song’s 
                              accessories)
                        Well--! If I’m honest, I don’t 
                        think you need any of this stuff! 

                                 SONG
                        Why!? What do you mean!? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Well-- ‘Cause--!

                           SONG
           Why not!?
                                                    ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                                              ‘Cause it makes you look like 
                                              a fr--! 

           Annalise cuts herself off. Song’s expression DARKENS. 

                           SONG
                                                    ANNALISE (CONT'D)
           What? 
                                              I-- don’t--

                                 SONG
                        Like a freak!?
                         ANNALISE
           No! I-- just think--
                                                      SONG (CONT'D)
                                              Is that what you were going 
                                              to say? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        You looked fine how you were! 

                                 SONG
                        Well, I like how I look in this 
                        stuff! 

           Annalise HUFFS--

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        What? You think I look ugly? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Song-- I don’t think you’re ugly, I 
                        just think...
                             (sigh)
                        Before you looked more yourself-- 

                                 SONG
                        --to you! 
                             (beat)
                        To you, Annalise... Only to you. 

           Annalise’s face falls... Song’s eyes plead for understanding:

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        If I wear this stuff... then 
                        everyone else can see me too.

           Song steps closer to her, reaches to hold Annalise’s hands--

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you want others to see me 
                        too?

                                 ANNALISE
                             (pulling her hands away)
                        No! 

           Song is taken aback, STUNG. It’s painful enough to strike 
           TEARS into Song’s eyes:

                                 SONG
                        I don’t want to be just your 
                        fantasy, Annalise! 

           Now it’s Annalise’s turn to be STUNG. A small SOB escapes her 
           as she turns away from Song, flees up the stairs--
                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Wait-- Annalise! 

           Song moves to follow after Annalise-- But-- Song YELPS as she 
           TRIPS on the hem of her dress-- FALLS HARD to the metal 
           stairs with a CLANGGGGG! 

           The NOISE summons concerned Babs from within The Rose-- 

                                 BABS
                        Song!? 

           TEARS spring to Song’s eyes as she checks her now bleeding 
           KNEE. But Song SMUDGES her tears roughly away, PULLS herself 
           back to her feet to go after Annalise--

           BABS hooks Song’s elbow-- holds her back--

                           SONG
                                                      BABS (CONT'D)
           ANNALISE!
                                              No! Don’t! 

           Song turns back to Babs-- impatient to yank her arm free--

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t go out there! Like 
                        that... It’s... It’s not safe.

           Song looks down at the fabulous dress she’s wearing... sees 
           the heavy make-up SMUDGED atop her palm scars from where she 
           wiped her tears...  

           And suddenly, it’s like an enormous weight has settled on 
           Song’s shoulders. She lowers to sit on the stairs... Babs 
           squats next to her, gently circles an arm around her... 

                                 BABS (CONT’D)
                        You know, dear... a lot of people, 
                        they... they just don’t understand 
                        people like us... 

                                 SONG
                        But Annalise does... 

           Babs gives her a skeptical look... The same Annalise that 
           just ran away from you? 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        She does! She just-- she just 
                        needed some space-- just needed 
                        some air. She’ll come back... 

           Song looks up to the top of the metal stairs, at The Rose’s 
           front door behind which Annalise has disappeared... 
           A LONG, PAINFUL PAUSE... as Song waits expectantly for her... 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (soft)
                        Annalise wouldn’t leave me...

           ...But she has.

           Babs studies Song’s face with PITY. Watches Song’s expression 
           FALL into DESPONDENCY... Finally: 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        Do you... ever go out in the world 
                        like this? Let others see you? 

           Song lifts her tearful eyes to Babs. Pleading.

                                 BABS
                        Some do... I don’t. 

           Song looks almost HURT by this reply...

                                 SONG
                             (whisper)
                        Don’t you want to? 

           Babs SIGHS. CUPS Song’s cheek. Like a mother and child. 

                                 BABS
                        More than anything. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Annalise WEEPS while trudging home in the POURING RAIN. 

           She RIPS pages out of her NOTEBOOK-- the lists comparing what 
           Song sees vs Annalise sees-- and CRUMPLES them into balls. 
           The notebook’s soggy remains litter the sidewalk behind her.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        That night, Annalise saw something 
                        she thought she’d never have to see 
                        again, something she thought she’d 
                        left far in her past:

           Annalise finally arrives outside her home. DRIPPING with 
           rainwater. Illuminated by a SINGULAR porch light... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Herself. Alone.

                                 MOTHER (PRE-LAP)
                        Oh! Annalise--!
           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Worried Mother ushers SOPPING WET Annalise into the kitchen--

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re positively soaking! Here-- 
                        here-- onto the linoleum--

           Annalise SLUMPS at the kitchen table, SILENTLY sobbing. 
           Mother fishes a FRESH TOWEL out of a basket of laundry, wraps 
           Annalise SNUGLY in it--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What’s happened!? What’s wrong!? 

           Annalise doesn’t provide any clue. Mother sinks to her knees, 
           to Annalise’s level. Looks in her daughter’s eyes:

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Did something happen with Peter? 

           Annalise looks away. And Mother understands. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        Oh dear... Is he upset with you? 

           Annalise SHRUGS. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh darling... Look at you... Just 
                        look at you... 

           Mother reaches up... tenderly brushes messy hair from 
           Annalise’s eyes... wipes bleeding MASCARA from her cheeks... 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Not to worry... We’ll get you fixed 
                        up, quick as a bunny. 

           At this, Annalise SNAPS. She SWATS her Mother’s hands away. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Annalise! 

           Annalise snatches her SLATE and CHALK up from the table-- 
           SCRAWLS furiously on it! Her eyes shine with CONVICTION as 
           she raises the message she’s written for her Mother:  

                                 I DON’T WANT TO BE FIXED
           EXT. SONG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Song-- back in her BOY CLOTHES-- loiters on her front lawn in 
           the DOWNPOUR. She GLARES over at Annalise’s house, up at 
           Annalise’s bedroom window. 

           But the window is DARK. Dejected, Song turns away from it--

           INT. SONG FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Song enters her dark home, soaked to the bone from the rain. 
           She creeps through the living room without turning on any 
           lights, but-- 

                                 MRS. SONG (O.S.)
                        Baobao? 

           Mrs. Song emerges from the shadows, flicking on a LAMP. 

           Song FREEZES as Mrs. Song slowly approaches... HALTS only a 
           foot away. Neither speaks. It’s a stand off... Finally: 

                                 MRS. SONG  (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        Do you know tomorrow’s date?

           Song slowly... nods her head yes... Suspicious...

                                 SONG
                        September first...?

           Mrs. Song nods knowingly. She pries the GOLDEN RUYI RING off 
           of her finger... places it gently into Song’s scarred PALM...

                                 MRS. SONG (SUBTITLE)
                             (in Mandarin Chinese)
                        ...Summer is over.

           Mrs. Song SMILES sadly at Song before leaving room... 

           Song stares down at the RING... 

           INT. SONG’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Song’s still studying the GOLD RUYI RING while laying in her 
           bed, in the darkness of midnight... 

           Finally, Song places the ring on her bedside table. As she 
           does so, her fingers BRUSH against a scrap of PAPER laying 
           there. Song picks it up. It’s a NOTE. One of the first 
           Annalise ever gave Song:
                        There’s nothing wrong with you. I promise. 

           This is it-- this note BREAKS her. Song’s eyes BRIM with 
           tears as she stares at it, and suddenly--  

           Song sits up in bed! Stares at her bedroom window. It’s as if 
           she’s being DRAWN to it... Just like after PROM...  

           Song gets up, goes to her window. With an INTAKE OF BREATH-- 
           Song pulls her curtain aside-- Looks out across the street, 
           at Annalise’s bedroom window, to find that--! 

           Annalise isn’t there. 

           The neighborhood is empty. Quiet. The calm after the 
           rainstorm. Song looks so small in her darkened window... 

           Song completely deflates... and now the TEARS fall. She tries 
           to SNIFF them back, but she can’t stop them. She presses her 
           palm to the glass wistfully... 

                                 SONG
                             (whisper)
                        Annalise... 

           Song bows her head... takes a step back, about to drop the  
           curtain again-- but just then--

           Movement in the window across the street! 

           Annalise APPEARS in her window. Song GASPS at the sight! 
           Steps as close to the glass as she can! 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        Annalise! 

           Annalise has tears in her eyes too. 

           Annalise & Song simply stare at each other across the 
           street... Unmoving... Dream-like in the darkness and SILENCE.

           Finally Annalise holds up one finger-- one moment... 

           Annalise disappears behind her curtain again. Song HOLDS HER 
           BREATH anxiously... doesn’t want to see Annalise go. 

           But thankfully-- Annalise REAPPEARS in her window. This time, 
           holding up a SIGN: 

                             I WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE YOU

           Upon reading it-- a soft SOB escapes Song’s lips. And at the 
           very same time-- Annalise & Song vanish from their windows--
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           --go RACING out their front doors-- down their front porches-- 
           across their front lawns-- 

           And collide in an EMBRACE in the middle of the street! 

           They CLING to each other desperately. SOBBING with relief. 

           When they finally pull apart, Song takes Annalise’s face in 
           her hands. She searches Annalise’s face. 

                                 SONG
                        Only you do, Annalise. Only you.  

           Annalise NODS her head. Understanding. 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whisper)
                        Then I won’t look away. 

           INT. THE ROSE CLUB - NIGHT

           Annalise sits expectantly in the midst of the packed AUDIENCE 
           at The Rose. She LIGHTS UP as Song takes the stage to 
           uproarious APPLAUSE. 

           Song’s wearing the DRESS that Annalise had gifted her on the 
           4th of July. No wig. No make-up. Song grips the microphone 
           nervously as the PIANO PLAYER begins the song MOON RIVER. 

           Song’s eyes lock on Annalise as she SINGS. And this time, 
           instead of turning her back like she normally would, Annalise 
           keeps her promise: She doesn’t look away the entire time.

                                 SONG
                             (singing)
                        Moon river, wider than a mile
                        I'm crossing you in style some day 
                        Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker 
                        Wherever you're goin’, I'm goin’ 
                        your way

           In Annalise’s eyes... in the very best way... Song looks to be a rather ordinary GIRL. 
           Annalise is CAPTIVATED by Song. Bittersweet TEARS linger in Annalise’s eyes. 

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Two drifters, off to see the world
                                 (MORE)
                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        There's such a lot of world to see 
                        We're after the same rainbow's end, 
                        Waitin’ ‘round the bend, My 
                        huckleberry friend, moon river and 
                        me

           Babs, Poppy, and Carmen are amongst the spectators, their 
           reactions an amalgamation of pride, hope, and melancholy. 

           As the song ends, the room FILLS with cheers and applause! 
           But it’s like Annalise & Song can’t even hear them. 

           Without breaking eye contact, Song descends the stage. She 
           seats herself in Annalise’s lap; she wraps her arms around 
           Annalise’s shoulders; she takes a DEEP BREATH--

           And at the very same time: 

                       SONG (CONT’D)
                                                        ANNALISE
           I love you. 
                                              I love you. 

           Their LIPS CONNECT in a KISS-- like FATE, like HOME.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This is the part of the story where 
                        I should tell you that Annalise & 
                        Song lived happily ever after... 

           When they pull apart, Song strokes Annalise’s cheek with her 
           thumb. Song implores her with her eyes. 

                                 SONG
                        Will you marry me? 

           Song REVEALS the golden RUYI RING. Annalise can only manage a 
           NOD, emotions filling her the to the brim. Song’s hands SHAKE 
           as she pushes the ring onto Annalise’s FINGER. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        This is the part of the story where 
                        I want to say “The End”... 

           In Annalise’s eyes the entire room FILLS with millions of BUBBLES-- iridescent and 
           weightless. ENVELOPING THEM COMPLETELY. In their own world. It’s almost as 
           if Annalise & Song themselves are turning iridescent and weightless... Floating, 
           cocooned in each other’s arms...  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                             (whisper)
                        ...This is the part of the story 
                        that hurts the most. 
                                 GRUFF MAN  (O.S.)
                        THERE’S BEEN A RAT! 

           SUDDENLY-- All of the BUBBLES begin to POP around them-- Annalise & Song 
           are torn out of their own world as-- 

           The CROWD around them begins to ERUPT with PANIC-- STAMPEDING-
           - CONFUSION-- SHRIEKING! The GRUFF MAN guarding the Club’s 
           door has BURST into The Rose-- 

                                 GRUFF MAN (CONT’D)
                        RUN!

           Moments later, a DOZEN POLICEMEN pour inside behind him! 

           Annalise & Song CLING to each other-- utterly TERRIFIED-- as 
           they witness THE RAID descending around them! 

           The POLICE WIELD their batons. They CURSE in people’s faces. 
           They SMASH alcohol bottles and FLIP over chairs and BLOCK off 
           the door. They set to work ARRESTING every person dressed in-- 
           to their eyes-- the wrong clothes. 

           But the patrons fight back-- Babs, Poppy, and Carmen among 
           them. They KICK and they HIT and they FLEE. 

           BANG! The CLOUD of A SMOKE BOMB spreads across the room, 
           obscuring their vision! Annalise & Song look to each other 
           desperately--Annalise CLINGS to Song-- just as a BURLY 
           POLICEMAN grabs Song by the bicep! 

                                 SONG
                        Annalise! 

           Annalise opens her mouth to scream back--! BUT--! Nothing 
           comes out! She CHOKES violently on her own WORDS! 

           Annalise CLUTCHES at her own throat, as if trying to push her 
           voice out manually-- but it’s no use! All Annalise can do is 
           HANG ON to Song-- Even as Song is DRAGGED out of The Rose--

           EXT. THE ROSE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           --all the way to the POLICE WAGON’S OPEN DOORS, waiting 
           outside on the street. The Policeman finally SHOVES Annalise 
           roughly off Song. Annalise reaches out frantically, GRABBING 
           for Song once more-- but the Policeman SPITS in her face! 

           All Annalise can do is watch HELPLESSLY as Song-- SOBBING-- 
           is corralled into the Police Wagon with the rest. 
           Through her tears, Annalise OPENS HER MOUTH AGAIN-- but this 
           time, she PUSHES with all of her MIGHT to get her voice out: 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (louder than we’ve ever 
                              heard her)
                        SONG!!!

           In Annalise’s Vision: Along with her VOICE, her actual HEART escapes out through 
           her lips! It floats macabrely toward Song through the smoke-suffused air, still 
           dripping with BLOOD and spasming with PULSE. It DISAPPEARS into Song’s chest!

           Annalise watches it go with a mixture of HORROR and AWE. And 
           then-- the police SHUT SONG AWAY. The WAGON DEPARTS. 

           Annalise CHASES after the police wagon for as long as she 
           can... until she’s ROBBED of breath... Until her LEGS can’t 
           hold her up any more... Until she CRUMPLES in the STREET-- 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           --Mother CATCHES WEEPING Annalise in her arms as she 
           collapses across the threshold into the house.  

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh! Annalise! 

           Mother CRADLES Annalise in her lap on the floor. Stroking 
           Annalise’s hair SOOTHINGLY. Steady. Sure. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Shhh... Shhh... I’m so sorry, 
                        darling... I’m so sorry... I’m 
                        here... I understand... I’m here... 

           Annalise CLINGS to her Mother. Annalise SHAKES with SOBS.  
           Mother smears Annalise’s tears from her cheeks. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What a terrible thing... Mrs. Song 
                        told me what happened. Peter called 
                        her from the police station--

           At Song’s name, Annalise bursts into a fresh set of tears-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, darling, you couldn’t have 
                        known! Mrs. Song is quite upset 
                        too, of course. Who knew that Peter 
                        was capable of being so-- so-- 
                        unnatural.
           At that, Annalise furrows her brow... Grows UNEASY...

           It’s as if the world tilts sickening to one side. Annalise’s tears HALT and instead a 
           stiff dread pools over her... she WRIGGLES out of her Mother’s grasping arms--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        The poor boy is utterly disturbed! 
                        I would have never guessed Peter 
                        had such a perversion--

           Annalise backs away from her mother with HORROR. Mother 
           misreads Annalise’s REVULSION-- 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no, it’s not your fault, 
                        Annalise! I promise, you never have 
                        to see him again--

           Annalise shakes her head NO. No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no--

           An expression of RAGE comes over Annalise. She blasts a glare 
           of FURY at her mother. Annalise stumbles backward, reaching 
           for the handle of the front door--

           Mother is overcome by a SUDDEN PANIC--

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        No! Annalise--!

           Mother LUNGES toward Annalise! TACKLING her! Annalise 
           STRUGGLES to break free! 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I know this must be heartbreaking 
                        for you-- You have fallen for that 
                        boy, that much is clear. But he’s 
                        been deceiving you, Annalise. He’s 
                        been deceiving all of us!

           Annalise KICKS and GROANS and HOLLERS as she pries herself 
           away from her mother! It looks as though Mother’s strength is 
           going to win out, her arms sinewy and vice-like, but--

           One of Annalise’s flailing elbows CONNECTS with Mother’s eye. 
           Mother YELPS in pain! Releases Annalise and clutches at her 
           already-bruising SOCKET.

           Annalise stands up, TOWERING over Mother, who KNEELS on the 
           floor. Annalise reaches for the front door’s knob, TWISTS it.

           Mother looks up at her daughter. Mother looks BETRAYED. 
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You’ll follow this boy instead of 
                        me!?

           And now Mother is CRYING, nearly two decades full of tears:

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I have loved you your whole life, 
                        Annalise! I have loved you through 
                        everything!

           Annalise softens a bit at the sight. But her resolve is 
           strong as she opens her mouth to respond:

                                 ANNALISE
                        You have loved me despite who I am. 
                        Song loves me because of it.

           And with that, Annalise spins out the door, leaving her 
           bruised and SHOCKED MOTHER behind...   

           Mother FOLDS into herself, CURLING up in a BALL and WAILING. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Annalise runs WILDLY across the street-- BAREFOOT and 
           SHIVERING. When she reaches the Song’s front door, she POUNDS 
           on it with her fists RELENTLESSLY--

           --until MRS. SONG answers. She’s disheveled, swaying, eyes 
           bloodshot. DRUNK from Biajiu. 

           The two STARE at each other. Each with their own pain. 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Which police station? 

           Mrs. Song doesn’t even look stunned to hear Annalise’s voice. 
           She instead trains her eyes on the GOLD RUYI RING on 
           Annalise’s finger. She’s SICKENED to see it. 

           Mrs. Song begins closing the door in Annalise’s face. But not 
           before saying--

                                 MRS. SONG 
                        Forty Avenue.

           INT./EXT.  TRAIN STATION / TRAIN - LATER

           Annalise DASHES through the station, SOBBING with abandon. 
           She barely catches a train before the doors SEAL SHUT-- 
           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Annalise RUSHES through the city streets-- squinting to read 
           street signs, to remember her way. She WINCES as her BARE 
           FEET are sliced by GRAVEL and stray street DEBRIS. 

           Finally, she turns a corner and REACHES A POLICE STATION. 
           Annalise BARRELS INSIDE--

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Among the swarm of other people waiting to be booked is SONG. 
           Handcuffed. Slumped in a chair. Still in the gifted dress. 

           Annalise collapses at Song’s feet. She grips Song’s shins. 
           She BAWLS. But Song doesn’t even raise her head. Song REFUSES 
           to look at her. To even acknowledge her. 

           Finally, Annalise SHAKES Song’s leg for her attention: 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Song! 

                                 SONG
                        Don’t call me that!! 

           It’s as if Song slapped Annalise in the face! She’s STUNNED. 

           Song GESTURES out at the police station-- at the situation at 
           large. Her voice RAGGED with unfettered sorrow--

                                 SONG (CONT’D)
                        This is how the rest of the world 
                        sees us, Annalise! 

                                 ANNALISE
                        But... But they’re-- they’re wrong-- 

                                 SONG
                        They’ll never see what you see! 
                        They’ll never see Song, they only 
                        see Peter. And they barely even 
                        want to see him--

                                 ANNALISE
                        I want to see Song, I want to see 
                        Peter, I want to see you--

                                 SONG
                        Why am I like this!? 

                                 ANNALISE
                        Because-- because it’s who you are--
                                 SONG
                        No, why!? ... Why was I born in the 
                        wrong body? ... Why do you see the 
                        way you do?  

                                 ANNALISE
                        I... I don’t know... But-- you said 
                        it yourself-- it can’t be a 
                        coincidence! What we-- what the two 
                        of us together-- Don’t you still 
                        believe that!? 

           Song still has not looked at Annalise. It’s like she didn’t 
           even hear what Annalise just said... Lost in her own 
           thoughts...

                                 SONG
                             (whisper)
                        Maybe we are freaks... 

                                 ANNALISE
                        No-- Don’t. Song-- I once thought 
                        that was true, that I was a freak 
                        and nothing more. But-- but then-- 
                        then I met you-- 

                           SONG
           Stop--
                                                    ANNALISE (CONT'D)
                                              You are the only thing that 
                                              makes sense to me-- you are 
                                              the only one who sees what I 
                                              see. So what if I can’t 
                                              explain why!?  

                                 SONG
                        Annalise, you need to leave. 

                         ANNALISE
                                                      SONG (CONT'D)
           No! Never--
                                              I can’t see you anymore!

                                 ANNALISE
                        I can’t stop seeing you! I-- I see 
                        your face in my dreams! 

                                 SONG
                        Stop!

                                 ANNALISE
                        I feel your hair between my 
                        fingers!

                                 SONG
                        Annalise-- stop it! 
                                 ANNALISE
                        I smell your scent, even when 
                        you’re far away! 

           Now Song can only CRY--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you smell me too?

           Song’s breath HITCHES--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you feel me too?

           Song’s chest SHUDDERS--

                                 ANNALISE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you see me too!?

                                 SONG
                        Please.

           This one word HALTS Annalise. And now, Song finally looks up 
           to Annalise. Her eyes BEGGING Annalise... Stop... 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (whisper)
                        ...You truly want me to leave you?

                                 SONG
                             (barely audible)
                        Yes.

                                 ANNALISE
                        Why?

           Song’s handcuffs JINGLE as she reaches up-- takes Annalise’s 
           hands into hers... 

                                 SONG
                        Because it’s too painful to hear 
                        you describe that version of me... 
                        a me that I want so desperately... 
                        a me that I can’t have.

           They both fall quiet. 

           Though she doesn’t want to... Annalise NODS. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise understood. 

           Song leans forward, touching her forehead to Annalise’s. 
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Better than anyone. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        I wish I could tell you it ended 
                        like this: 

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS - All of this RAPID: 

           A) Annalise & Song in the police station, foreheads still 
           touching. Annalise SHAKES HER HEAD NO. No, she won’t leave! 
           Unable to resist, they passionately give in to a KISS-- 

           B) The Next Day: Annalise & Song stoically ride the TRAIN 
           into the CITY, in each other’s arms. SUITCASES at their feet.  

           C) Annalise & Song cuddle together in bed in their humble 
           APARTMENT. They pull each other CLOSER, holding on TIGHT. 

           D) Annalise & Song SMILE at each other in an intimate 
           COURTHOUSE wedding ceremony-- BOTH wearing DRESSES--

           E) OLDER Annalise & Song lay on their floor side-by-side 
           SINGING along to a RECORD PLAYING... 

           F) EVEN OLDER Annalise & Song walk hand-in-hand through the 
           CITY PARK... Pointing out to each other what they SEE... 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        ...I really wish I could. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

           Back in the police station, Annalise and Song’s foreheads 
           touching... Annalise leans forward and KISSES Song softly...

           When they part, Annalise pulls the GOLD RUYI RING off of her 
           finger and places it delicately in Song’s hand. Annalise 
           rises to her feet and trudges out of the station...

           EXT. CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Annalise WEEPS passively as she drags herself home through the city. Through her 
           eyes, the whole world looks like the color has been drained of it, like the focus has 
           been pulled blurry, like the liveliness, the vividness has been stolen away. 

           Annalise SUCKS in a BREATH for yet another SOB but-- 
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        When Song left, so too did 
                        Annalise’s voice. 

           --when she continues SOBBING NO SOUND COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH. 

           In fact, it is ENTIRELY QUIET. So SILENT it deeply disturbs us. So utterly 
           DEVOID of SOUND we can feel it in our bones, we can hear our own blood flowing... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                             (all whispered:)
                        It dried up and evaporated from her 
                        throat without a trace. She lost 
                        all of it. 
                             (long beat)
                        No more feeling of laughter 
                        bubbling in her chest. 
                             (long beat)
                        No more vibration in her teeth as 
                        she chit-chatted. 
                             (long beat)
                        No more rawness in her windpipe as 
                        she screamed. 
                             (long beat)
                        Nothing. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Still in that TOTAL SILENCE, Annalise bursts in her family’s 
           front door. She’s met by Mother, still bruised, wary of 
           Annalise. They face each other... FRACTURED... 

           But when Annalise’s quivering chin gives way into a SOB-- 
           Mother is there by her side in a heartbeat. EMBRACING her 
           again. A buoy in this sea of sorrow. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Song, Mr. Song, and Mrs. Song finish PACKING their family car 
           in the driveway of their HOME. A FOR SALE sign stands in the 
           lawn, a sticker slapped over top proudly proclaiming: SOLD! 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Afterwards, the Song family moved 
                        far away, so that Song could have 
                        what they saw as a fresh start. 
           INT. SONG FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Each member of the Song family ruminates in their own world 
           as their car speeds down a highway... but Mrs. Song sneaks 
           peeks at Song in the backseat through the rearview MIRROR:

           Song (in boy clothes again) looks forlorn out her window. She 
           fiddles with the GOLD RUYI RING on her finger...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t that Mrs. Song didn’t 
                        want Song to be happy, it was just 
                        that Mrs. Song had her own unique 
                        way of looking at the world, and 
                        sadly that sight couldn’t see the 
                        real Song. 

           INT. NEW SONG HOUSE - DAY

           Song unpacks BOXES in her new room. From within one box, she 
           unearths the copy of The Diary of Anne Frank from Annalise.

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And Song? Well... For now she would 
                        lie low once more... 

           Song HIDES the BOOK from Annalise in the very back of her 
           closet. So far back, it’s clear she won’t be seeing it again 
           for a long, long time... 

           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM - DAY

           Annalise stares despondently out her bedroom window... at 
           Song’s EMPTY bedroom window across the street... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise, of course-- she was 
                        heartbroken.

           Annalise looks down at her desk, where a FRESH NOTEBOOK 
           waits... And in her eyes, we can see... an IDEA is brewing... 

                                 STORYTELLER
                        But at the same time, Annalise saw 
                        things differently than she had 
                        before. 

           Annalise picks up a pen and begins SCRIBBLING--
           INT. ANNALISE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Annalise keeps WRITING and WRITING, late into the night. 
           She’s filled up almost her ENTIRE NOTEBOOK with a STORY. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Yes, it still wasn’t what others 
                        saw, but for the first time 
                        Annalise could see: A future. 

           As she writes the final words-- THE END-- Annalise SMILES. 

           INT. COZY BOOKSHOP - DAY 

           Annalise WORKS behind the CASH REGISTER in that cozy bookshop 
           in the city, the one she and Song visited during the summer. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        And though it looked like that 
                        future wasn’t with Song, knowing 
                        that someone had understood her-- 
                        that Song had understood her once-- 
                        was a seed of hope stronger than 
                        she’d ever possessed before. 

           Annalise keeps peeping over at one of her CUSTOMERS: a bright-
           eyed GIRL around Annalise’s age. From the looks of things, 
           this GIRL has her eye on Annalise as well...

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Annalise’s voice was lost, yes, but 
                        not forever. 

           The GIRL takes the plunge, approaches Annalise with a coy 
           GRIN. And Annalise, well. She SMILES at her NEW LOVE. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Somewhere deep inside her, Annalise 
                        knew that she’d find her voice 
                        again: 

                                 ANNALISE
                             (to New Love)
                        Hello.

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           SPLIT SCREEN: Annalise and Song grow up in different places, 
           with different people: 

           - Annalise goes on her very first date with the NEW LOVE we 
           met, the two of them sharing a delicate KISS. Meanwhile Song 
           works up her nerve to buy her very own LIPSTICK at a 
           department store.   
                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        In the end, they never got the 
                        answers they were looking for: Why 
                        was Song born in the body she was? 
                        Why did Annalise see things 
                        differently from anyone else? 

           - OLDER Annalise buzzes with nerves as she hands a MANUSCRIPT 
           to a PUBLISHER in an office. He looks down at it skeptically. 
           Meanwhile OLDER Song (now dressed as a WOMAN in public) sings 
           KARAOKE at a bar. She locks eyes with a DAPPER MAN in the 
           audience, who raises his DRINK to her: Cheers.  

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        But Annalise & Song had come to 
                        find that perhaps the answers to 
                        those questions didn’t matter. 
                        Perhaps the only thing that matters 
                        is finding the ones who see the way 
                        you do. 

           - OLDER Annalise and her NEW LOVE are welcomed home to 
           celebrate Mother’s birthday. Meanwhile OLDER Song and DAPPER 
           MAN dance cheek-to-cheek in Song’s apartment. This man is 
           SONG’S NEW LOVE. They KISS tenderly. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Later in life, when they had both 
                        grown into themselves fully, when 
                        they had both managed to wrangle 
                        the word freak into a badge of 
                        honor, when they had both found 
                        lasting love again with someone 
                        else--

           INT. SONG’S NEW PLACE - NIGHT

           OLDER SONG (45) GASPS awake in bed, awoken from a DREAM! It 
           takes Song a second to catch her breath... She closes her 
           eyes, attempting to recall what she just DREAMT: 

           INT. MR. SONG'S CAR - NIGHT / DREAM

           IN THE DREAM, SONG’S BACK IN HER FATHER’S CAR ON PROM NIGHT: 
           Annalise HOLDS Song tightly to her chest as SONG WEEPS... and 
           WEEPS... and weeps...  

           Finally, Song wipes the last of her tears. Song straightens 
           up in her seat. She wraps one arm around Annalise, puts her 
           other hand on the wheel, steps on the GAS--

           But the car doesn’t just DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD. It tilts up-- 
           impossibly driving upwards into the air-- up, up, up, into 
           the atmosphere and out of this world... 
           ...Until Annalise & Song are just two DOTS in outer space. 
           The whole world nowhere to be found. 

           Just them. 

           INT. SONG’S NEW PLACE - NIGHT

           OLDER Song’s still catching her breath in bed after waking 
           from this dream... PASSIVE TEARS leak down her cheeks. She 
           peeks over at her NEW LOVE, still fast asleep beside her. 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Song found that she didn’t feel 
                        sad, exactly. She couldn’t tell you 
                        what the feeling was if she tried. 

           INT. SONG’S NEW KITCHEN - DAY

           OLDER SONG DIALS a phone number she knows by heart, waits for 
           the other end to pick up. Phone RINGS... RINGS... RINGS... 

                                 STORYTELLER (V.O.)
                        Nevertheless, she knew what the 
                        dream was urging her to do... 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Now older, MOTHER (60s) answers the phone in her KITCHEN: 

                                 MOTHER
                        Hello? 

           Mother listens to the caller on the other end... her 
           expression UNREADABLE... until she SOFTENS:  

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Of course I remember.

           INT. ANNALISE’S NEW APARTMENT - DAY 

           OLDER Annalise (45) gives her NEW LOVE a SMOOCH as she enters 
           their apartment. She carries whole STACK of BOOKS, the covers 
           of which tell us they were AUTHORED by ANNALISE HERSELF. 

                                 NEW LOVE
                        Your mother called... 

           New Love hands Annalise a NOTE. When she reads it, Annalise’s 
           JAW SLACKS, heart STOPS, breath is SUCKED OUT OF HER... 

           And when Annalise finally LOOKS UP--
           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY - 1995

           --She’s standing in the middle of the CITY PARK where she and 
           Song had shared what they saw with each other so many years 
           ago. It’s 1995 now, but the park looks much the same. 

           Annalise is waiting for someone, scanning the swarms of park-
           goers anxiously for a familiar face. And then-- her eyes 
           LIGHT UP with recognition. 

           Of course, the person whom Annalise recognizes is SONG. 

           We rotate around Annalise-- spinning around and around her as 
           the scene unfolds-- Alternating between ANNALISE’S VISION and 
           NORMAL VISION every time we pass back behind her head-- 

           So that as Song approaches Annalise, we’ll come to find--

           that the way Annalise sees Song--

           and the way the rest of the world sees Song-- 

           is now finally--

           one--

           and--

           the--

           same.

           IN BOTH VISIONS: The girl that Annalise saw in their youth has grown up to 
           be the woman that Song has become in everyone’s eyes.  Song is a 45-year-old 
           trans woman. Song has a facial scar. Song is beautiful.

           Ultimately Annalise and Song stand mere inches apart. 

           Eyes connect. An unspoken bond tethering them to one another. 

           Finally, with a sharp intake of breath for courage--

           Song reaches out-- Clasps Annalise’s hands in hers--

           And smiles.

                                 SONG
                        Thank you. 
           Somewhere Over the Rainbow plays over the credits: 

                        Somewhere over the rainbow, way up 
                        high
                        There's a land that I've heard of 
                        once in a lullaby.
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, skies 
                        are blue
                        And the dreams that you dare to 
                        dream, Really do come true.
                        Someday I'll wish upon a star
                        And wake up where the clouds are 
                        far behind me.
                        Where troubles melt like lemon 
                        drops,
                        High above the chimney tops,
                        That's where you'll find me.
                        Somewhere over the rainbow, blue 
                        birds fly
                        Birds fly over the rainbow
                        Why then, oh why can't I?
                        If happy little bluebirds fly 
                        beyond the rainbow
                        Why, oh why can't I?
