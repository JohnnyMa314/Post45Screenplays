        Like last year, THE BLACK LIST
               THE BLACK LIST was compiled from the suggestions of over 90 film executives and high-level 
               THE BLACK LIST
               THE BLACK LIST
        assistants, each of whom contributed the names of up to ten of their favorite scripts that were written in or are somehow 
        uniquely associated with 2006 and will not be released in theaters during this calendar year.

                                               THE BLACK LIST.
        Unlike last year, scripts had to receive at least two mentions to be included on THE BLACK LIST
                                               THE BLACK LIST
                                               THE BLACK LIST

        All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.  THE BLACK LIST
                                                 THE BLACK LIST apologizes for all 
                                                 THE BLACK LIST
                                                 THE BLACK LIST
        misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation identification, and questionable “2006” affiliations.

                            THE BLACK LIST is not a “best of” list.  It is, at best, a “most liked” list.
        It has been said, but it bears repeating: THE BLACK LIST
                            THE BLACK LIST
                            THE BLACK LIST

        Enjoy.

               BLACK is the new white.
