           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MILES CALHOUN, a scrawny thirteen year-old boy with shaggy, 
           cow-licked hair and pre-braces teeth, sits at his desk with 
           his back turned to us. His laptop sits open, glowing blank.

           His bedroom is decorated with his many achievements. 
           Vibrantly colored art projects hang on the walls. Intricate 
           dioramas depicting great battles in history rest on shelves.

           A poster of the Wu Tang Clan hangs over him on the wall. 
           Behind him, a Playstation 2 makes violent, exploding sounds 
           of a war game having been left on. 

           Miles wears an ill-fitting suit with a clip-on tie. We hear 
           the sounds of his fingers typing rhythmically.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Dear mother and father. I want to 
                        thank you. Without you I would not 
                        be here and none of this would be 
                        possible. 

           He lifts a bottle of what can only be his parent’s Merlot, 
           and takes a long, desperate swig, leaving his lips stained 
           crimson. 

           After a moment, he spits the red wine into a plastic Clippers 
           cup nearby, disgusted by the taste. He empties the rest of 
           the wine into the cup, and refills the bottle with grape 
           juice.

                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        However, I feel compelled to write 
                        to you, to put my thoughts down on 
                        paper. I wish we could speak like 
                        adults, but clearly you are both 
                        incapable of such an act. 

           The voice of a MOTHER can be heard somewhere down the hall.

                                 MOTHER (V.O.)
                        Miles, go to bed!

           Miles grabs a stack of thick, hardcover books off his shelf 
           and heaves them at the door. Then, continues.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Consider this a means of trying to 
                        communicate with you as a last 
                        possible resort.

                        Maybe the following words will help 
                        you understand that I am a 
                        complicated person. A human being 
                        with... 
                        (thinks) 
                        ...incredible depth.

           He sips some more Welch's wine, and continues.

                        a boy trying to be heard.

           FADE IN:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles taps his fingers on the desk pensively, sighs, and 
           resumes typing.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        I understand that in the basic 
                        biological sense, you ‘made’ me. 
                        Though I also understand that in 
                        the basic biological sense, it 
                        doesn’t take a genius to do so. 

           INT. ART CLASSROOM - DAY

           TIGHT on the FINGERS of a BOY as they dip into various colors 
           of cheap acrylic paint. PINKY in midnight blue. RING FINGER 
           in sunburst yellow. A THUMB splashes in a glob of fire-engine 
           red.

           The fingers belong to a SEVEN YEAR-OLD MILES, sitting in 
           front of a large white canvas. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Besides, surely I am deserving of 
                        most of the credit.

           He turns to MRS. WHITE, his eager teacher. He gives her a 
           confident nod, and with an innocent voice:
                                 SEVEN YEAR-OLD MILES
                        A little motivation, maybe?

           Mrs. White nods obediently, and glances over her classroom of 
           SEVEN YEAR-OLDS. Some students watch with great curiosity. 
           Others pick their noses.  

           Mrs. White drops the needle on a plastic toy record player 
           and we hear these timeless lyrics:

           Puff the magic dragon, who lives by the sea... Frolics in the 
           autumn mist in a land called Hano-lee...

           Miles takes a deep breath, inhaling the cosmic diatribe. He 
           stares deep into the blank canvas with furious determination.

           And in a flash, Miles’ hands wave rapidly over the canvas. 
           His fingers SWIRL and SWOOP and SLASH until his work is 
           complete. He turns the canvas to reveal...  

           A COLORFUL MASTERPIECE

           Brilliantly abstract. Chaotically-themed. Mysteriously 
           elusive.

           Mrs. White and her students share a collective AWE of 
           amazement.

           GARY AND MEREDITH CALHOUN, Miles’ caring, supportive parents, 
           watch from the door. They beam with pride.

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           A packed house, yet eerily silent. Hundreds of parents, many 
           armed with digital cameras, blinking red-lights everywhere, 
           stare forward with anticipation, for on-stage, holding an 
           upright bass twice his size, is Miles -- and the bass is so 
           large we can only see the top of his head. Nothing but a 
           cowlick.

           With style, precision, and even a clever sense of mockery, 
           Miles plucks through the jazz classic “Blue Monk”. Somewhere, 
           someplace, Thelonious Monk is listening in awe. 

           The audience is enthralled. In the front row, the Calhoun’s 
           are impressed.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        I am only dangling on the precipice 
                        of puberty...

                                                                CUT TO:
           MILES’ REFLECTION

           As he gels his hair into a perfect crest in the mirror, and 
           almost winks.  

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        ...and am already at the top of my 
                        game.

           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           The sun beams through open blinds, illuminating wall to wall 
           bulletin boards covered in colorful, though disjointed art 
           projects.

           DRIFT OVER the rows of STUDENTS. Some hard at work. Others 
           staring off in odd directions, catatonic.

           But not Miles, writing furiously. Feverishly pressing lead. A 
           stack of pages as high as six phone books is gathered off to 
           his side.

           INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

           Students in suspenders mingle with teachers in their finest 
           corduroy. It’s the elementary literary elite. MR. SCHAFFER, 
           head of the English Department, commands attention.

                                 MR. SCHAFFER
                        It is my distinct honor to present 
                        this years’ Best New Author 
                        Award... 

           In front of bookshelves dotted with the classics, the three 
           13 year-old candidates sit in metal fold-out chairs: a smug 
           little BRUNETTE GIRL, a terrified INDIAN BOY, and Miles, 
           patiently awaiting his prize.

                                 MR. SCHAFFER (CONT’D)
                        For his powerful short story, ‘The 
                        Bully Inside’, fellow faculty and 
                        honored students, Miles J. Calhoun. 

           Respectable golf claps abound. The brunette girl bursts out 
           of her chair.

                                 BRUNETTE GIRL
                        Mongoloids!
           She stomps out. Miles looks at the crowd with a we-know-
           better smile, and approaches the podium.

                                 MILES
                        Wow, this was totally unexpected. 
                        Okay, let’s be honest... it wasn’t. 
                        Seriously, did anybody read the 
                        third act of Vaghars’ “If My Dog 
                        Could Talk?” Entirely void of 
                        realism. An unintentional farce.

           VAGHAR, the terrified Indian boy, turns bright red.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I think if his dog could talk he’d 
                        politely ask him to put the pen 
                        down.

           Around the room, uncomfortable silence. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        In conclusion, I would like to 
                        quote one of my inspirations, W.C. 
                        Fields. ‘I am free of all 
                        prejudice. I hate everybody 
                        equally.’

           He holds up his hand-bound book and smiles, dignified as 
           flash bulbs erupt. 

                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And tonight, the very night of my 
                        eagerly anticipated Bar Mitzvah...

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT

           The most highly-attended Bar Mitzvah in Jewish history. 
           FRIENDS and RELATIVES in horribly clashing outfits look on 
           with pure enlightenment as Miles chants his Torah portion -- 
           the Hebrew sung in a beautiful, somewhat-feminine staccato. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        ...I think even God was in awe. In 
                        fact, I know he was.

           Miles walks over to the Ark, and with the Rabbi’s stern, 
           dramatic nod, pulls it open -- BATHING US IN WHITE LIGHT.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles now has his jacket off, his collar hanging open 
           loosely.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Technically, and now made official 
                        in the eyes of our entire religion, 
                        I am now a man.

           The voice of a now-furious FATHER is heard somewhere down the 
           hall.

                                 FATHER (O.S.)
                        Damnit Miles, turn the goddamn 
                        lights out! I’m trying to sleep!

           He grabs another stack of hardcovers -- Che Guevara’s various 
           biographies -- pauses in mid-throw, and calms himself down 
           with a long, deep breath.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        ...and with that comes 
                        responsibility. Therefore, in this 
                        hereby document I am relinquishing 
                        you of any and all responsibility 
                        for what I have done in the past, 
                        and for what I may do in, what is 
                        certain to be, a very bright 
                        future.

           He takes another pull from the wine bottle of Welch’s grape 
           juice, sighs, and closes his laptop.

           As the wooden stake breaks the surface of a neatly manicured

           EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY

           It’s early morning in affluent Calabasas. San Fernando 
           Valley’s Laguna Beach. Miles, always in his freshly-ironed 
           suit, shoves a FOR SALE sign twice his size into the lawn 
           with all the strength he can muster.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Miles sprays and scrubs the counter tops, the oven range, and 
           the breakfast table.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           He vacuums, and as he passes framed photos of himself with 
           his parents, he turns them over or tosses them face down into 
           drawers.

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Miles makes the bed with disgust.

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           He walks through each room for final inspection. The house is 
           spotless, glowing to perfection.  

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           Miles sits at his desk, an open manila folder in front of 
           him. He sorts through a handful of documents. A MY SPACE page 
           with the photo of a YOUNG TEEN GIRL on it. She’s sixteen and 
           gorgeous. GOOGLE searches are printed off the internet, all 
           under the name LAYLA GARDNER.
           He folds the envelope closed and slides it into his desk 
           drawer. Locks it with a key. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Reflected in the mirror, Miles gels his hair into a perfect 
           crest, and as is his routine, considers winking.  

           Instead, he pulls out his red striped, clip-on tie from his 
           inner-coat pocket, clips it onto his collar and adjusts it so 
           it’s just right. Satisfied, he turns and leaves. Even shuts 
           the light out.

           Then, he turns around and flips the light back on, slides a 
           bluetooth cell phone earpiece behind his ear, and now, 
           entirely impressed by what he sees, gives a full, obnoxious 
           wink.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY

           A Lexus sedan pulls to a stop in front of the house.  A 
           lovely couple, CRAIG and SUZANNE GARDNER, get out of the car. 

           The back door opens, and out steps the most beautiful girl 
           Miles has ever seen. She wears a little cotton skirt and 
           boy’s converse shoes. This is LAYLA GARDNER.

           Miles approaches the family, his hands held together in a 
           sophisticated fashion.

                                 MILES
                        I just love that crisp morning air, 
                        don’t you? I’m sorry, and you must 
                        be the Gardners?

                                 SUZANNE
                        Well hello there, young man. Where 
                        are your parents?

                                 MILES
                        Wow. My parents. Huh. I haven’t 
                        thought about them in awhile. To 
                        tell you the truth, I... I guess I 
                        don’t really know.

                                 CRAIG

                        pregnancy and escaped the hospital 
                        just hours after she birthed me. 
                        Actually ran from the building, 
                        still in her hospital gown.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Oh. My.

                                 MILES
                        So, where are my parents? Mr. And 
                        Mrs. Gardner, you find them, you 
                        tell them to give me a call, okay?

                                 SUZANNE 
                        I am so, so sorry. 

                                 MILES
                        Listen, we live, we learn, and in 
                        the end, we accept.

           Miles nods solemnly, feigning emotion. Layla watches him, 
           intrigued. He extends his hand to Craig, professionally.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Miles J. Calhoun. I’ll be showing 
                        the house.

           Suzanne and Craig share a perplexed look.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I work for the realty company. 
                        In exchange for school credit.

           He flashes a winning smile. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Shall we?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           They enter the freshly-cleaned house. Craig is visibly put 
           off by the thirteen and a half year-old realtor.

                                 MILES
                        I understand that you’re new to the 
                        neighborhood. Let me tell you, it’s 
                        a fantastic place to raise a 
                        family. Very little crime. Not a 
                        child molester on the block. 
                        (to Layla) 
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your 
                        name?
           She looks away.

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Miles continues the tour. The Gardners walk around the master 
           bedroom. 

                                 MILES
                        Two bedrooms, two and a half baths, 
                        brand new wall to wall carpeting, 
                        hardwood floors, central heating 
                        and air...

           Layla overturns a picture frame. It’s a shot of a seven year-
           old, grinning Miles and his parents posing happily among 
           local RASTAS on a family trip to Jamaica. Miles catches her 
           in the corner of his eye, and she turns the frame back over.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           They all hold frosty glasses of Lemonade.

                                 MILES
                        Tile floors and counter tops, state-
                        of-the-art range and oven, laundry 
                        area attached... 

                                 SUZANNE
                        Miles...

                                 MILES
                        Suzanne.

                                 SUZANNE
                        You’ve done a fantastic job. I’m 
                        very impressed, young man. 

           She glares at Craig. Reluctantly, Craig pats Miles on the 
           back.

                                 CRAIG
                        Yeah. Super job, pal. Bang up. 

                                 MILES
                        You’re a complete tool, you know 
                        that?

                                 CRAIG
                        (stunned)
                        Wait, what did you just call me?
           Miles gestures to his bluetooth earpiece. He’s on a call.

                                 MILES 
                        First you waste my time. Now you 
                        tell me you can’t clear escrow? 
                        Listen closely and follow these 
                        instructions. Scroll down to the 
                        number on your cell phone that 
                        correlates with the name Miles J. 
                        Calhoun, and press delete. You’re 
                        dead to me. That clear? Dead. To. 
                        Me. 
                        (turns, whispers) 
                        Hi, grandma.

           Miles gives Layla a little inside wink. She looks away, with 
           the slightest hint of a grin.

           Suzanne and Craig step aside for a private conversation. 

                                 CRAIG
                        (to Suzanne)
                        ...because there’s no way I’m going 
                        to buy a house from a pre-pubescent 
                        broker, that’s why. And I’m sorry, 
                        but I don’t think I’m being 
                        unreasonable here!

                                 SUZANNE
                        Well I love this house. For the 
                        record.

                                 CRAIG
                        Let the record reflect.

           Miles paces, appearing stressed by the phone call.

                                 MILES
                        ...if you can’t put a couple of 
                        dollars together and make a 
                        decision like an adult, then we 
                        have nothing more to discuss, 
                        entiende?

           He presses a button on his earpiece, ending the call.

                                 CRAIG
                        Busy, huh?

                                 MILES
                        (nods)
                        It’s a buyer’s market.
                                 CRAIG
                        You must be racking up those school 
                        credits.

                                 MILES
                        Oh, I don’t do it for that, Craig.

           Miles flicks an ice-cube into his mouth, chews.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Look, take all the time you need. 
                        But she’s going to go quick, so I 
                        suggest you --

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Miles, who’s car is that out front? 

           Miles races out, leaving the Gardners in the kitchen alone.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And why is there a For Sale sign on 
                        my goddamn lawn?

           Craig and Suzanne share a confused look. Layla grins, amused.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           MEREDITH, Miles’ mother, walks the Gardners to their car. We 
           see Miles in the background, sitting on the porch, resigned.

                                 MEREDITH
                        He thinks he’s so clever. I’m gonna 
                        put his head in the washing 
                        machine.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Wait, so he’s not an orphan?

                                 CRAIG
                        Big shock, hon.

           Layla lingers from the group, and turns back to Miles.

                                 LAYLA
                        Hey, I’m Layla.

           She smiles, and walks back to her parents, not awaiting a 
           response.

                                 MILES
                        (to himself) 
                        Hello... Layla.
           Layla stops, and turns back around.

                                 LAYLA
                        Yeah, howdy. Hi there. Didn’t I 
                        just cover all that? 

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, I mean... bye.

           She slips into the back seat of the Lexus, leaving Miles 
           stung.

           Meredith walks past Miles without breaking stride, and slams 
           the screen door.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Thanks. I had a sale.

           The Gardners drive away. Out the back window, Layla looks 
           back at the house, and the strange yet intriguing boy sitting 
           on the steps.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           A loud hip-hop beat rattles shelves. Trophies clink together. 
           Prized dioramas jostle this way and that.

           Miles is playing the bass-line on an electric bass. A drum-
           machine is jerry-rigged to his laptop. Two large speakers are 
           set on either side of the desk.  

           Two fourteen year-old black kids, KEYSHON and NATE, sit 
           across from him. Keyshon’s got a shaved head and prominent 
           buck-teeth. Nate is overweight, built like a lineman with a 
           protruding belly. Oddly, an unlit joint hangs from his lips.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Hot, kid. Hot.

                                 NATE
                        Like that Timbaland shit and shit. 

                                 KEYSHON
                        Take that joint out of your mouth, 
                        and shit. 

                                 NATE
                        My brother said it’ll make us more 
                        creative. Plus, it makes TV better.
                                 MILES
                        Nate, I don’t need any drugs to 
                        create. Besides, you’re not even 
                        going to light that. 

                                 NATE
                        You think I’m scared, partner? 
                        Watch a brother spark one up.

           Nate sparks the joint, and inhales deeply. He coughs harshly, 
           and falls back to the ground, dizzy. 

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Dawg... this feels... weird. 

                                 KEYSHON
                        Creative yet?

                                 NATE
                        Nauseous. 

           Miles and Keyshon laugh hysterically.

                                 MILES
                        (shaking his head)
                        A real life public service 
                        announcement.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Miles, that beat though...

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, what about it?

                                 KEYSHON
                        Too much bounce. Hot in the club, 
                        but I’m no clown rapper. I want 
                        that laid back boom-boom-BAP shit.

                                 NATE
                        Word. 

           Nate runs his fingers through the carpet.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        Boom-boom-BAP!

                                 KEYSHON
                        Feel me?

                                 MILES
                        Feel this.
           Miles holds up his finger, pauses dramatically -- and when he 
           lowers it, a spine rattling Southern-style hip-hop beat 
           erupts from the speakers. Walls shake. The earth shifts. 

           Keyshon smiles, loving it. Nate bobs his head.

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                        Damnit, Miles! Turn that godawful 
                        noise down!

                                 KEYSHON 
                        (over the music)
                        Your moms is always trippin’, kid.

                                 MILES
                        Tripping? The woman has no culture. 
                        (re: poster) 
                        You think the Wu Tang Clan had 
                        their mothers shouting at them 
                        every time they made a beat?

                                 NATE
                        A: Wu Tang probably didn’t even 
                        know their mothers, and even if 
                        they did, they sure as hell didn’t 
                        live in a nice house in the suburbs 
                        like you do. 

                                 MILES
                        Ha. Nice house in the suburbs. My 
                        entire life is a front. 

                                 KEYSHON
                        And B: your mom, she let’s you have 
                        a recording studio in your bedroom! 
                        She supports you in everything 
                        you’ve ever wanted to do. That’s a 
                        wonderful woman out there.

                                 MILES
                        I still struggle. Every artist 
                        does. Every day of my life.

                        Maybe you do, maybe you don’t, but 
                        that mom of yours... now there’s a 
                        good woman.

                                 NATE
                        For real. A good, good woman.
                                 MILES
                        (defensively)
                        Call my mom a woman again.

           There’s a KNOCK at the door. They quickly open a window, 
           allowing the smoke to escape.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        (yelling)
                        In a meeting!

           Meredith opens the door anyway.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Sorry boys. Know any James Taylor?

           Miles buries his head in shame.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        (to Miles) 
                        Honey, I’ve got a migraine. My 
                        hormones are going AWOL. I’m hot, 
                        I’m sweaty, my entire body is on 
                        fire.

                                 MILES
                        First, James Taylor. Now my friends 
                        are forced to hear the sordid 
                        details of your hot flashes? Sit in 
                        the freezer. Figure it out. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        (appeasing)
                        Just a little quieter, okay.

           She leaves.

                                 NATE
                        Hot flashes? Wow.

                                 KEYSHON
                        That’s some serious shit. No joke.

           Miles pops a CD out of his computer and slides it over to 
           Keyshon. 

                                 MILES
                        Next time we’ll talk about 
                        distribution.

           They pound fists. 
           Miles notices the barely smoked blunt in the trash can, and 
           slides it into his desk drawer.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Meredith sits on the couch, draped head-to-toe in blue gel 
           ice packs and reading US WEEKLY. Miles sits on the other side 
           of the couch, jotting feverishly in a composition book.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Why’d you sell the house today?

                                 MILES
                        Doesn’t matter.

           Miles turns a page. So does Meredith.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You don’t like this house, is that 
                        it?

                                 MILES
                        I’m sitting here, aren’t I?

                                 MEREDITH
                        Seriously, Miles, you don’t like 
                        our home?

                                 MILES
                        It was a lousy investment. I don’t 
                        know why you and dad bought it. 
                        Nobody consulted me.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You were six.

                                 MILES
                        And even at such a young age I knew 
                        this place was a pass. Not to 
                        mention the interest rates are 
                        going up and you and Dad decided 
                        ingeniously on a three year fix. 
                        Brilliant. 

           Meredith goes back to her reading. Miles writes some more.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Dad and I read your letter. No 
                        matter how many documents you ask 
                        us to sign, you’re our son and 
                        we’re your parents, and that makes 
                        you our responsibility.
                                 MILES
                        Let’s agree to disagree.

           Meredith closes her magazine.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You know, Miles, as smart as you 
                        are, you’re still a little boy. My 
                        little boy.

                                 MILES
                        Where are you going with this?

                                 MEREDITH
                        You can’t just wake up and sell our 
                        house because the interest rates 
                        are going up. You don’t make that 
                        decision. I was embarrassed today.

           Miles puts down his composition book.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow you’re going to stay home 
                        all day, wash the dishes, do the 
                        laundry, and whatever else I can 
                        think of, and I am going to think 
                        as hard as I ever have. 

                                 MILES
                        I’ll out-source, I swear. Maybe 
                        even turn a profit.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Listen to me, Miles... As long as 
                        you live under my roof you’ll abide 
                        by my rules. 

                                 MILES
                        That’s really what you’re going 
                        with? That... cliche?

           Meredith furiously throws the magazine down.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Do you understand me?

           Miles’ looks like Che on the eve of the revolution. 

                                 MILES
                        Yeah. Yes, mother. I understand 
                        you.
           He grabs his composition book and storms out of the room, 
           fueled for battle.

           INT. MERCEDES E-CLASS - NIGHT

           GARY CALHOUN drives. He looks stressed, worried, even a bit 
           sad. We notice a few white file boxes in the back seat. 

           He flips around on the radio, unable to settle on a station. 
           Finally, he just leaves it on depressing, rainy-day jazz. 

           EXT. CALHOUN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Mercedes pulls into the driveway. Gary is immediately met 
           by Meredith, looking concerned.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You’re home early.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah.

           He pulls the white file boxes from the back seat.

                                 MEREDITH 
                         Gary, what happened?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Gary and Meredith sit at the kitchen table. The white boxes 
           are stacked along a nearby wall. The fridge is plastered with 
           happy photos of Calhoun Family vacations.

                                 GARY
                        The firm’s official position is 
                        that I’ve been laid off due to 
                        economic restructuring. 

           Gary takes a large swig from a glass of red wine.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Okay, I see. So it’s not like you 
                        were...

                                 GARY
                        ..fired? No, honey, I told you, I 
                        was laid off. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Right. Laid off. 
                                 GARY
                        As if that’s better? At least when 
                        you’re fired it’s because you 
                        messed up or made a serious 
                        mistake, and then, you’re fired. 
                        Simple as that. But when you’re 
                        laid off, they’re telling you ‘we 
                        have no use for you anymore. You’re 
                        just a body. A useless one at that. 
                        Thanks for your time, but we’ll 
                        need your office and oh please 
                        understand how hard this is for us 
                        to do. We’re really gonna miss ya, 
                        pal. It’s like losing a member of 
                        the family.’ 

           Gary finishes his wine.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Assholes.

                                 MEREDITH 
                        Like that, our lives change.

           Meredith sighs, and rests her head on her hand.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles runs hard on a treadmill at a ridiculous incline while 
           watching FOX NEWS. The digital timer reads: 48:50, 48:51, 
           48:52... 

           On the wall behind him is an 8 x 10 sheet of white paper that 
           reads, in dark black letters: As long as you live under my 
           roof you’ll abide by my rules. -- the obvious source of his 
           cardiovascular motivation. 

           As he runs, he presses a button on his earpiece.

                                 MILES
                        Evening Diego, I’m on house arrest. 
                        I know, I know, I can’t believe it 
                        either. That’s exactly what I said! 
                        Communism. 

           He shoots cold, bottled-water into his mouth without missing 
           a step.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. Your talents, well, 
                        you’ve proven your worth to me. The 
                        subject was in my house, Diego. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        In my house! And if I’m not 
                        mistaken, she practically fell in 
                        love with me on the spot!

           He drinks some more.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m not mistaken. Yes, I got 
                        ‘the look’. What do you know about 
                        girls anyway, tough guy? Listen, 
                        I’d like to retain your services. 
                        Another job. 

           The treadmill BEEPS three times and slows to a halt. Miles 
           steps off and stretches his neck from side to side.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        So, you game?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Meredith pours herself a glass of wine. She reads a legal 
           document. An open envelope sits on the table in front of her.

                                 GARY
                        Right now, we have nothing to worry 
                        about, you know, as far as our 
                        finances are concerned.

                                 MEREDITH
                        For a couple of months, at least.

                                 GARY
                        The severance package is reasonable 
                        and we have plenty in our savings. 
                        Mer, we have money. And I’ll get 
                        another job. We have to be patient.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I can start seeing patients again. 

                                 GARY
                        No, no. I don’t want you to --

                                 MEREDITH
                        I’ll set up an office here at home. 
                        The extra income won’t hurt, and 
                        this way I can keep an eye on 
                        Miles.
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Miles, soaked in sweat with a white towel draped around his 
           neck and a blender full of green protein shake in hand, stops 
           walking, intrigued by what he’s overhearing.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Keep an eye on Miles?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Gary paces, wine glass in hand.

                                 MEREDITH
                        He’s been acting strange lately. 
                        This morning he tried to sell the 
                        house.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, right.

           She looks at him, dead serious. 

                                 MEREDITH 
                        I wonder what he was asking for.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Miles proceeds cautiously, careful not to miss a word.

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry, I punished him.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Gary sits down, his wine-glass empty.

                                 GARY
                        Next time, wait for me. It would 
                        have been the day’s only joy.

           Miles’ little head appears from around the corner, entirely 
           unnoticed.

                                 MEREDITH 
                        Get your resume together, send it 
                        out to every firm in the area, and 
                        we just wait, and cross our 
                        fingers. 
                                 GARY
                        Why? Because I’m a mediocre lawyer? 
                        Who’d hire Gary Calhoun? Should we 
                        just move on to prayer?

                                 MEREDITH
                        I never said that, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Thinking it is worse. This is 
                        temporary. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Don’t get mad at me. This wasn’t my 
                        fault.

                                 GARY
                        But it was mine? Mer, I got laid 
                        off!

                                 MEREDITH
                        I told you to stay on your toes 
                        around there. It’s like a boys 
                        club, that place.

                                 GARY
                        Fuck their little boys club.

                                 MEREDITH
                        That little boys club was paying 
                        you. A lot.

                                 GARY
                        I’m only as valuable as my salary?

                                 MEREDITH
                        I never said that.

                        Thinking it is worse.

           Miles recoils. He’s never heard his parents fight before. 

           He regains his composure, and drags the white file boxes away 
           like a lion collecting his kill. Meredith and Gary are 
           oblivious. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)

                        just ‘let someone go’ after that 
                        kind of commitment. I have a

                        Gary, let’s go to bed.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. Okay.

           Meredith turns out the kitchen light as they walk out.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Gary walks towards his bedroom, head looking at the ground.

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Hey, Dad.

           Gary stops at Miles door. He opens it.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles is at his desk, his laptop in front of him.

                                 GARY
                        What, Miles?

                                 MILES
                        I heard, you know, what happened.

                                 GARY
                        Don’t worry, Miles. We’ll be --

                                 MILES
                        There’s this quote by the great 6th 
                        Century philosopher Heraclitus...

                                 GARY
                        Heraclitus? We should allow you to

                                 MILES
                        He said, ‘There is nothing 
                        permanent except change’. Think 
                        about it, is all I’m saying.

           Gary does, touched by his son’s concern.

                                 GARY
                        Go to bed, pal. It’s late.

           Miles crawls under the covers. Gary turns off Miles’ light, 
           and shuts the door.
           INT. PARENT’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Meredith, wearing her nightgown, brushes her teeth in the 
           mirror.

                                 MEREDITH
                        ...it’s just scary, you know, not 
                        knowing where the next paycheck 
                        will come from.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        We’ll be fine.

           She spits, and brushes some more.

                        Car payments, mortgage, health

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gary is in bed. Meredith climbs in.

                                 MEREDITH
                        ...property taxes. Life is so damn 
                        expensive, Gary? You know?

           She leans over and finds Gary asleep, facing his side. She 
           turns out the light and rolls over to her side, leaving them 
           back-to-back.

           DRIFT OVER to Gary, who lies there, his eyes now wide open.

           THROUGH A CRACKED DOOR - Miles has been spying the whole 
           time.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The white file boxes have all been opened. The contents -- 
           law papers, journals, written arguments -- are laid out on 
           the desk. The room is bathed in darkness, but for a desk 
           light illuminating a stack of law books that Miles is 
           intensely studying. The clock reads 4:30am.

           He looks at the framed photo of he and his parents in 
           Jamaica. Looks like good times. Better times. Miles shakes it 
           off, and goes back to the books.

                                                              FADE OUT.
           FADE IN:

           INT. GARAGE/LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Miles is carelessly throwing whites and colors in together. 
           The whole task is beneath him. He slams the lid shut. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Miles cautiously makes his way down the hall.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Under the cover of darkness, he gets to the front door and 
           turns the knob.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        What, no good-bye?

           A light is turned on. Gary, in stretched-out boxers and a 
           food-stained T-shirt, sits on the couch with a steaming mug 
           of coffee. 

                                 MILES
                        Dad! Hey, didn’t see ya there, you

                        Oh, just going over to Diego’s 
                        house for a little while.

           Miles presses speed dial on his cell phone and holds it up 
           for his dad to see. They lock eyes.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we had this talk.

           Miles walks back to his room, victorious in his own mind. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           He scrubs a plate in the sink, paying no attention. Leaving 
           the faucet on, he walks into...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Gary is on the couch watching TV. A phone is wedged between 
           his shoulder and his ear.

                                 GARY (INTO PHONE)
                        (irritated)
                        I know, Meredith. I know. I’m going 
                        to take a week to relax and get my 
                        life in order. Is that allowed? Is 
                        that acceptable to you?
           Miles peeks his head around the corner.

                                 MILES
                        The woman’s a dictator, right?

           Gary covers the mouthpiece.

           They laugh quietly, so as not to be heard on the other end of 
           the phone.

                                 MILES
                        Good one. I’ll go get the paper.

           Miles walks out the front door.

                                 GARY (INTO PHONE)
                        Have I ever not been able to 
                        provide for you? Tell me that. Have 
                        I? These things take time. Listen, 
                        no, stop shouting. Stop shouting 
                        for one fucking second!

           Gary calms down, sips his coffee, and then he realizes 
           something.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           He barges out of the house and spots Miles up the street, 
           running away. Gary rushes after him, gaining. With a burst of 
           speed, Gary dive-tackles Miles and the two roll onto the 
           front lawn of a neighbor’s house.

                                 MILES
                        You’re in terrible shape. I can

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Gary opens the door, and a sweet, little-old GRANDMA enters 
           with a basket of muffins.
                                 GARY
                        Thanks for coming, Ma. I’ve got to 
                        run to a meeting with my accountant 
                        and I’ve --

                                 GRANDMA
                        Gary, please. A chance to spend 
                        some time with my grandson? 

                                 GARY
                        He doesn’t leave the house. In 
                        fact, he doesn’t even look out the 
                        windows.

           Miles appears.

                                 MILES
                        Grandma! Grandma!

           They hug. A kid after all. Gary grabs his briefcase.

                                 GARY
                        I find out you did anything wrong 
                        and I’ll slap the eyes out of your 
                        head.

                                 MILES
                        Infantile, dad. Just... infantile.

           Gary raises a hand as if to throw a slap. Miles doesn’t even 
           flinch as he pops a fresh, blueberry muffin into his mouth.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           A teapot whistles. Miles takes it off the stove and pours 
           boiling hot water over loose tea leaves. He watches it seep, 
           and a strange smile grows on his face.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Grandma is sitting in a chair reading the New Yorker. Miles 
           presents her with a mug of freshly-brewed green tea.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Such a sweet boy. And I hear you’re 
                        doing so well in school?

                                 MILES
                        Ah grandma, it ain’t hard.
                                 GRANDMA
                        It isn’t hard.

                                 MILES
                        It isn’t hard.

           She rubs his head, lovingly.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           Miles enters his room, and in SLOW MOTION he flicks an empty 
           pill bottle into the garbage can as though it were a spent 
           bullet shell. 

           CLOSE ON the prescription:  Meredith Calhoun, Ambien.

           Miles grabs a copy of Charles Bukowski’s NOTES OF A DIRTY OLD 
           MAN, and lays on his bed with his hands behind his head, 
           incredibly proud of himself.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Grandma is in a deep, Ambien-induced sleep on the couch. Half 
           her body is slumped off the cushions. Her dress rides up in 
           an unflattering way, revealing an intricate pattern of 
           varicose veins on her upper thighs.

           Miles is at the door, dressed in his crisp suit. He takes her 
           pulse, and, satisfied with his diagnosis, flips off the 
           light, and walks out the front door, a brown bag in hand.

           EXT. CALABASAS STREETS - DAY

           Miles walks up the block holding the brown bag. He approaches 
           a BOY leaning against a street sign and eating from a melted 
           box of whoppers. He’s a pasty-white, chubby ball of a 
           teenager with thick glasses, who’s name is actually ELLIOT. 

                                 MILES
                        Afternoon, Diego. Shall we?

           Elliot shrugs and they walk up the block, enveloped in the 
           hazy sunshine of the West Valley.

                                 ELLIOT 
                        How’s detainment?
                                 MILES
                        Introspective. Sometimes, Diego, a 
                        man needs his solitude. But my 
                        parents, holy Christ...

                                 ELLIOT
                        What?

                                 MILES
                        They’re at each other’s throats. 
                        All the time.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Mine too. What are your parents 
                        fighting about?

                                 MILES
                        My dad lost his job.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Ouch. And the unemployment rate 
                        this month was like, some kind of 
                        high percentage or something. Not 
                        good, is my point. 

                                 MILES
                        Got it. Thanks. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        What if they get a divorce?

                                 MILES
                        They’re not going to. Okay?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Okay.

                                 MILES 
                        Besides, I can take care of myself 
                        even if they did.

           They walk some more, suburbia their backdrop.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Hey, Miles... 

                                 MILES
                        What?

                                 ELLIOT
                        It’s not your fault.
                                 MILES
                        What isn’t?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Your parents, you know, fighting.

                                 MILES
                        (sullen)
                        Yeah. Yeah, I know.

           Elliot slaps Miles on the shoulder. They walk on.

           INT. CALABASAS STREETS - DAY

           They approach a gated-community. Elliot gives Miles a boost 
           over the fence. Elliot throws himself over, but his pants get 
           caught on a metal rod at the top. He desperately extends his 
           hand, covered in chocolate.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Give me a hand!

                                 MILES
                        Not even if you were hanging off a 
                        cliff.

           Elliot wildly propels himself over and lands hard on a hedge. 
           He wipes the dirt from his clothes with his hands, replacing 
           the dirt with large smears of chocolate. 

                                 MILES
                        Good look, Diego.

           They make their way up the Cul-de-sac.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Can we stop using code names now? 

                                 MILES
                        You actually want to be called 
                        Elliot?

                                 ELLIOT
                        My mom says it makes me sound 
                        smart.

                                 MILES
                        She also said you were handsome.

                                 ELLIOT
                        And?
                                 MILES
                        And, we have a credibility issue 
                        here. The woman has established a 
                        terrible pattern of lying.

                                 ELLIOT
                        In your opinion.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah. In my opinion. 

           They approach a large, Mediterranean-style house. It looks 
           like the owners have just moved in. The FOR-SALE sign is 
           still wedged in the lawn.

                                 ELLIOT
                        This is it. I’m sure.

                                 MILES 
                        You trust your sources?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I carpool with them.

           Miles knocks, and waits. Nothing. He looks at Elliot with 
           doubt. Then, the door opens, and standing across the 
           threshold is Layla Gardner.

                                 LAYLA
                        What are you selling today? Junk 
                        bonds? High interest loans? Thanks 
                        anyway.

                                 MILES
                        (off-guard)
                        No. Hi. Hello. I mean, I was just, 
                        um... I came to --

           Miles hands Layla the brown bag. She pulls out a half-filled 
           bottle of Merlot, with a cork plugged in it.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Apologize.

                                 LAYLA
                        (re: wine) 
                        I think this has been opened.

                                 MILES
                        It’s my father’s finest Merlot. 
                        Very expensive. Wonderfully light, 
                        mild-bodied, yet you can really 
                        taste the grapes.
           She takes a sip.

                                 LAYLA
                        Wow. You’re right. This is amazing.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Since when do you know anything 
                        about wine?

           Miles elbows Elliot, who keels over in pain. Layla laughs, 
           her eyes sparkling.

                                 LAYLA
                        Well, apology accepted. 

           And she shuts the door, leaving Elliot and Miles standing 
           outside.

                                 MILES
                        Thanks. You’ve been a great help.

                                 ELLIOT
                        (mocking)
                        Hi. Hello. I mean, I was just, 
                        um... I came to --

                                 MILES 
                        Yeah? And how are you with women?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Me? Please. Incredible.  

           Miles looks at him skeptically.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        I know my way around one, if that’s 
                        what you’re asking. 

                                 MILES
                        Okay, that’s what I’m asking.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Than you have your answer.

                                 MILES
                        Right. I guess I do.

           Miles holds a doubtful look. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Whatever.
                                 MILES
                        Yeah, whatever.

           The door opens, and Layla stands there giggling.

                                 LAYLA
                        Are you coming in or not? 

           She turns around, and walks inside.

           Miles fixes Elliot’s hair. Tries to crest it. It falls 
           miserably around his ears.

                                 MILES 
                        Don’t embarrass me, Diego. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Please, I’m an excellent wing-man.

           Elliot smiles. His teeth blackened by chocolate.

                                 MILES
                        You’re more like an improvised 
                        explosive device.

           INT. LAYLA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Miles and Elliot follow Layla through a plush, modern home. 
           As she walks, she kicks off her boy’s converse and pulls her 
           dress over her head revealing a tiny, black bikini 
           underneath.

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           A crystal blue pool sparkles under the hot sun. A handful of 
           freshly tanned, good-looking TEENAGERS splash in the water 
           and lie back on lounge chairs.

           Layla does a perfect dive right into the deep end, the water 
           gently parting for her. She emerges right in front of Miles, 
           her dark, brown hair glistening.

                                 LAYLA
                        Come here.

                                 MILES
                        Where?

                                 LAYLA
                        (gesturing pool-side)
                        Here.
                                 MILES 
                        Sure. I mean, I was going there, 
                        you know, here, anyway.

           Elliot, feeling out of place, sits down on a lounge next to 
           BETH, a freckled-skinned girl with large, intimidating black 
           Gucci sunglasses.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Hey, I’m Diego.

           She doesn’t respond.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        Do you play Medal Of Honor on 
                        Playstation 2?

           She takes off her sunglasses.

                                 BETH
                        Ohmygod, I so do. Level five is 
                        like totally impossible! I keep 
                        getting lost in that terrible 
                        minefield.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Me too! But check this out, there’s 
                        a trick. You just press X three 
                        times, toggle the joystick and --

                                 BETH
                        I was lying, half-wit.

           Elliot shatters in every possible way. Beth slides her 
           sunglasses back on. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        That was just so, wow... 
                        unbelievably mean. 

           Miles is crouched down at the edge of the pool, near Layla. 
           His suit is getting wet.

                                 LAYLA
                        How old are you, anyway?

                                 MILES
                        According to the Torah? A man.

                                 LAYLA
                        The Torah?
                                 MILES
                        You want to argue with the man 
                        upstairs, be my guest. 

           Layla laughs. Her entire face lights up. 

           Meanwhile, over on the lounge chair, Elliot hasn’t moved, 
           baffled by the cruelness of the world.

                                 ELLIOT 
                        Seriously, why did you do that? 
                        It’s just... cruel behavior. Cruel 
                        behavior, nothing more. What is 
                        gained by that? What did you 
                        accomplish? 

           Beth turns over, annoyed. Elliot just shakes his head.

                                 LAYLA
                        (to Miles) 
                        How about you fetch that bottle of 
                        wine?

                                 MILES
                        I thought you’d never ask.

           He winks, and turns away.

                                 LAYLA 
                        Did you just wink?

                                 MILES
                        Huh?

                                 LAYLA
                        You winked.

                                 MILES
                        Wink? What? No. Sorry, no wink.

                                 LAYLA
                        Yeah, no... actually you did. Sure 
                        of it.

                                 MILES
                        Sun was in my eyes. 

           He walks away, quickly.
           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Miles walks into the kitchen, where Elliot is working his way 
           through a bag of cheddar-flavored goldfish, leaning against 
           the sub-zero, contemplating the problems of the world.

                                 ELLIOT
                        You know what, women are heartless, 
                        evil creatures.

                                 MILES
                        Better you learn that now, my good 
                        friend. Better you learn that now.

                                 ELLIOT
                        The hell you so chipper about?

                                 MILES
                        L-O-V-E, Diego. A little thing 
                        called L-O-V-E.

           Miles pats Elliot on the back, grabs the bottle of, well, 
           grape juice, and walks away with an irritating bounce in his 
           step.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I can spell, a-s-s-h-o-l-e.

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           Miles pulls open the sliding glass doors and spots Layla, now 
           in the center of the pool, now floating on a raft, and now 
           making out sloppily with a TAN GUY with a rippling six-pack.

           Miles drops the wine bottle. It explodes against the concrete 
           like a grenade.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CALABASAS STREET - AN HOUR LATER

           Miles and Elliot stand on the street corner.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Attention. That’s what that was all 
                        about. To women, it’s like oxygen.

           Miles nods solemnly. They pound fists, and walk their 
           separate ways.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Miles approaches his house. He walks around towards his 
           window. A Speech-And-Debate trophy has been wedged in the 
           sill. He slides his fingers in and pulls the window pane up 
           as quietly as possible.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           He rolls in -- onto his bed. He walks over to his mirror and 
           studies himself, wondering why a girl would ever reject such 
           a face. Confused, he walks out into...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           ...where Grandma, practically comatose, is draped across 
           Meredith and Gary on the couch, a hot towel resting on her 
           forehead. 

                                 GARY
                        (in shock)
                        This is my mother.

                                 MEREDITH
                        What were you thinking?

                                 GARY
                        This is my mother.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Are you out of your mind?

                                 GARY
                        This is my mother.

                                 MILES
                        Covered that, dad.

                                 GARY
                        And you, you drugged her! You 
                        drugged my fucking mother!

                                 MILES
                        For four to six hours. And you just 
                        said fu --

                                 MEREDITH/GARY
                        (in unison)
                        You’re grounded.
           IN SLOW-MOTION, Miles stumbles backward as though he were 
           just riddled with a thousand bullets.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Meredith and Gary are going through his things. He stands 
           aside and watches in anguish, like a prisoner having his cell 
           tossed. Meredith fishes a cell phone from his desk drawer.

                                 MEREDITH
                        What does a thirteen year-old boy 
                        need with a cell phone?

                                 MILES
                        I bought that with my own money.

                                 GARY
                        Money we gave you for school lunch.

                                 MILES
                        What I do with my finances is my 
                        business.

           She throws the cell and accompanying earpiece into a box, 
           along with a keyboard, recording equipment, and a laptop 
           computer.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You break it you buy it.

                                 MEREDITH
                        We bought it in the first place.

           He documents everything on a ledger he holds in his hand. 
           Gary rolls the treadmill out into the hallway.

                                 MILES 
                        Yeah, I don’t need that. It’s just 
                        my cardiovascular system.

           Meredith and Gary look around the room. Empty, but for a 
           desk, a chair, and a bed.

                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        So, this is what it’s come to? A 
                        hostage situation. 

           They walk out, shutting the door behind them.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You can expect an insurgency!
           He bangs his fists on the door for a long, long time. Then he 
           retreats to his desk, knowing a strategy must be formed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           GRAINY VIDEO FOOTAGE

           Miles, looking like a prisoner, sits on a mattress with no 
           sheets. It’s the middle of the night.

                                 MILES
                        (into camera)
                        I am being held against my will. 
                        Day and night have merged. To say 
                        that I am frightened is to state 
                        the obvious. I can only pray to a 
                        higher power for mercy, though in 
                        here... 
                        (with a whisper) 
                        ...I fear that one does not exist. 

           He swallows, and begins his Torah Portion. The first few 
           Hebrew words are sung in a beautiful soprano. But then 
           something happens that’s never happened to him before. 

           His voice cracks. 

           Confused, he starts again. And again, his voice cracks. PULL 
           BACK to reveal...

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           He turns off the video camera that has been set on a pile of 
           books, pops out the tape in frustration and tosses it into 
           the garbage can.

           He sits at his desk, his father’s law books everywhere. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           He sneaks down the hallway, passing...

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           And notices his mom and dad, sleeping BACK TO BACK.
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           He continues on into the...

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           And fishes his mother’s cell phone from her purse, and dials.

                                 MILES
                        (into cell, whispering) 
                        Keyshon, sorry to wake you. I know 
                        it’s late. Listen, your father’s an 
                        attorney at law, right?

           Miles listens, jotting down notes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WAITING ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Miles and Gary sit in the waiting room. Miles coughs harshly 
           and blows his nose loudly into a tissue. It’s disgusting. 
           PATIENTS recoil. He shows the contents of the tissue to Gary.

                                 MILES
                        Bird Flu.

                                 GARY
                        We’ll get the doctor to confirm 
                        that you’re faking, and then it’s 
                        straight back to your room. 

                                 MILES
                        And the award for Most Nurturing 
                        Father goes to...

           Gary smacks Miles on the back of his head.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        That make you feel good?

                                 GARY
                        You have no idea.

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Miles sits on an exam table with a thermometer sticking out 
           of his mouth.
                                 NURSE
                        Something must be going around. My 
                        daughter is home, sick as a dog.

                                 MILES
                        Oh God!
                        (gagging)
                        Bathroom? Bathroom?

           Miles leaps off the table in a panic.

                                 NURSE
                        Down the hall to the left!

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Miles rushes down the hall, pushes a LITTLE GIRL with a 
           massive arm-cast out of the way, and slips into a nearby 
           elevator.

           EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - DAY

           He walks at a quick pace down the sidewalk. After two blocks 
           he enters a tall, glass office building.

           INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

           Out of breath, he scans the directory and lands on the title: 
           ARCHIBALD, BAUMAN AND FOX, ATTORNEYS AT LAW. 

           INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Miles sits in a plush leather chair in a sky-rise office 
           suite overlooking the smog-coated San Fernando Valley. Across 
           from him, seated behind a massive oak desk in a crisp Armani 
           suit and silk bow-tie, is CORNELL ARCHIBALD III. Archibald, 
           early-fifties, dapper and refined, is a Southern black man 
           morbidly addicted to success.

                                 MILES
                        I’ve read your bio. Pretty 
                        impressive. Defended rappers 
                        charged with possession of 
                        firearms, celebrities caught with 
                        transvestites, politicians taking 
                        bribes from lobbyists with links to 
                        terrorist organizations...
                                 ARCHIBALD
                        It’s a good time to be an attorney, 
                        son.

           Archibald winks. Miles takes notice.

                                 MILES
                        Sir, I like your style.

           Archibald smiles, impressed by the kid. He walks over to his 
           bar, pours two glasses of his finest scotch, and offers one 
           to Miles. He quickly pulls it away, realizing that Miles is a 
           child -- be it a child in a suit.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        If I said that Cornell Archibald 
                        the Third does not pass judgement 
                        on potential clients, no matter who 
                        they are or what they have or 
                        haven’t done, would that be a true 
                        statement?

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        I’d be out of a job if it weren’t.

                                 MILES
                        Are there any cases you won’t take?

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        I suppose so. Depends, I guess. 
                        Why? Keyshon said you wanted to 
                        interview me for a school project. 
                        What is all this, son?

                                 MILES
                        See, sir, Keyshon was mistaken.

           Miles pulls an authentic Cohiba from his inner-coat pocket 
           and hands it to Archibald. He sits back down.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to begin a case against my 
                        parents.

           Archibald reclines in his leather chair. Sparks the Cohiba, 
           and blows out a ring of smoke, contemplating opportunity.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. BUNK - DAY

           MORRIE, a nineteen year-old hippie-ish kind of guy with thick 
           horn-rimmed glasses, and five-o-clock shadow left there for 
           style purposes lies on a noisy cot with his hands behind his 
           head.

                                 MORRIE
                        (labored breaths) 
                        And the painted ponies - oh, wow! 
                        They go up and down, cause we’re 
                        captured on an ohmygod - ohmygod -
                        carousel of time...

           A HAND with purple-polished fingernails runs through the hair 
           on Morrie’s chest. It is followed by a pony-tail and we see 
           that it belongs to Layla Gardner, on top of him in only her 
           underwear, grinding. 

                                 CAMPER (O.S.)
                        Morrie, everyone is waiting for 
                        opening circle! You okay in there? 

           They freeze. 

           EXT. OUTDOOR PAVILION - DAY

           Morrie, exceptionally glowing, strums an acoustic guitar as 
           he paces around a large circle of irritatingly HAPPY CAMPERS 
           and their PARENTS, connected at the hands.

                                 MORRIE
                        (singing)
                        We can’t return, no, we can only 
                        look, behind from where we came, 
                        and go round and round and round in 
                        the circle game.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW, Miles watches the campers sway and 
           sing. He’s horrified. 
                                 MILES
                        I need to brush up on the Geneva 
                        Convention, but is this technically 
                        torture?

                                 GARY
                        (still in shock)
                        You drugged my mother.

                                 MILES
                        And this is how you repay me? 

           Meredith stifles a laugh. Gary notices.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Miles, you’ve got to do something 
                        with the summer. Camp will keep you 
                        out of trouble. You’ll have fun 
                        here, you know, with all your 
                        friends. You’ll see. You’ll make 
                        life-long memories.

           Miles opens the back door, steps out, and slams it behind 
           him, leaving Gary and Meredith alone.

                                 GARY
                        You’re babying him. You always 
                        have.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Have I, Gary? Have I?

                                 GARY
                        There’s a time in every man’s life 
                        when he must stop behaving like a 
                        boy and start behaving like a man. 
                        Don’t stand in the way of that. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        (re: him)
                        Yeah, I’m trying not to.

           She glares out her window, seething. Then, the back door 
           opens and Miles slides back in, holding a formal-looking 
           document in hand.

                                 MILES
                        Sign this release form and I’ll be 
                        on my way.

                                 GARY
                        But you wrote this. It’s not 
                        even...
                                 MEREDITH
                        Just sign it, okay?

           Annoyed, both Gary and Meredith sign.

                                 MORRIE (O.S.)
                        (singing)
                        We can’t return, no, we can only 
                        look...

                                                                CUT TO:

           MILES SKINNY LEGS

           Draped in knee-high black dress socks that poke out of a pair 
           of checkered shorts. He wears a short-sleeve shirt and his 
           clip on, red-striped tie. He holds a briefcase in hand and 
           walks in SLOW-MOTION towards the assembled camp, like an IRS 
           agent about to issue an audit.

                                 MORRIE
                        (singing)
                        ...behind from where we came, oh 
                        yeah, and go round and round and 
                        round in the circle game.

           Miles stands next to his BUNK-MATES. Among them are Elliot, 
           Nate, Keyshon, and a few other, AWKWARD BOYS.

                                 ELLIOT 
                        Look on the bright side. At least 
                        the counselors are screaming hot.

           Miles finally notices that all his bunk-mates are staring 
           across the way at Layla -- wearing little mesh short-shorts 
           and a tight, cotton tank-top. Miles is awe-struck.

                                 NATE
                        I’d tap that ass two times.

           Miles stares at Nate, defensively.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        You know, not just once.

                                 MILES
                        Right. Why just once, you know?

                                 CAMPER #1
                        My brother stuck his tongue in her 
                        mouth last summer.
                                 MILES
                        That’s here-say.

                                 CAMPER #2
                        No, so did mine.

                                 MILES
                        Probably coercion.

                                 CAMPER #3
                        And mine.

                                 MILES
                        You serious?

           Everyone looks to the last camper in line, VAGHAR, the tiny 
           little Indian Kid.

                                 VAGHAR
                        (Indian accent)
                        And mine as well.

           Miles shakes his head in disbelief.

           EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - DAY

           Rows and rows of barrack-style, ransacked, old wooden bunks 
           in danger of being condemned. It sits on San Fernando Valley 
           acreage that has the pleasing terrain of Syria.

           Miles paces the grounds like a Vietnam War journalist with a 
           long-lensed Nikon around his neck. He SNAPS black and white 
           photos of dilapidated walls, filthy common bathrooms, and 
           insects of all kinds infesting the establishment.

           Morrie walks out of the bathroom.

                                 MORRIE
                        Hey bud, what’s up?

                                 MILES
                        Excuse me, did you even wash your 
                        hands?

                                 MORRIE
                        Huh? Yeah, man. Of course.

                                 MILES
                        Why didn’t I hear the water 
                        running?
                                 MORRIE
                        No idea. Weird.

                                 MILES
                        Bizarre.

           Miles studies him intensely.

                                 MORRIE
                        Hey, I don’t think we’ve met, bro. 
                        I’m Morrie, head counselor.

           Morrie extends his hand. Miles doesn’t take.

                                 MILES
                        What’d you dry them with?

                                 MORRIE
                        Dry what with?

                                 MILES
                        Your hands?

                                 MORRIE
                        Oh. A paper towel. Paper towels.

                                 MILES
                        Paper towels?

                                 MORRIE
                        Paper towels.

                                 MILES
                        Odd.

                                 MORRIE
                        Odd?

                                 MILES
                        I was in there five minutes ago. No 
                        paper towels.

           Morrie doesn’t respond, beaten.

                                 MORRIE 
                        Make sure to drink plenty of water.

                                 MILES
                        Oh, I will.

           They stand there for a moment, staring at each other. Then 
           Miles SNAPS a photo right in his face and runs away.
           EXT. ACTIVITIES FIELD - DAY

           Girls do their little hand-slapping cheers and dances and 
           rope-jumping crap that little girls in summer camp do. A GIRL 
           sprains her ankle. She HOWLS in pain.

           Miles snaps a series of photos of the incident.

                                 ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Last summer was like so cool I 
                        couldn’t even believe it. I’m 
                        telling you, this place is like a --

           Miles lowers the camera, revealing Elliot standing there, 
           happy as can be, a basketball in hand.

                                 MILES
                        A labor camp, Elliot. It’s a labor 
                        camp. 

           Miles snatches the basketball and launches a textbook three-
           pointer. Swish. The ball is passed back to him and he drills 
           another three. And another. And another. Even does a turn-
           around and it sinks beautifully through the net.

                                 ELLIOT 
                        Boy Miles, you’ve got quite a shot.

                                 MILES
                        It’s just physics, you lump.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Oh.

           Miles snaps black-and-white photos of loose rocks, cracks in 
           the concrete -- any and all potential safety hazards. 

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        Remember I showed you my memory 
                        book signed by all the senior 
                        counselors last year? Are you 
                        making a memory book also?

                                 MILES
                        Something like that.

                                 ELLIOT
                        If not, than why are you taking 
                        pictures?

           Nate fires a bounce-pass to Miles who catches it, dribbles it 
           between his legs, and buries another shot.
                                 MILES
                        Evidence.

           Miles walks away, leaving Elliot confused. 

           INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

           Slops of mush somewhat resembling food are flung onto plates. 
           Campers shovel it in by the spoon-load. 

           Miles refuses. He takes a sample of the mush and drops it 
           into a petri-dish, which he slides into his backpack. 

           An enthusiastic CLAP is heard. It echoes across the dining 
           hall.

                                 MORRIE
                        (as he claps, sing-songy) 
                        One. Two. Three. Clear! One. Two 
                        three. Clear!

           The entire camp joins in. They scrub and scrub and dry and 
           dry and pass their dishes down, clapping like trained seals. 
           Elliot claps and sings the loudest.  

                                 MILES
                        What. In the hell. Are you doing?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Clearing.

                                 MILES
                        (sounding it out) 
                        Clear...ing?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Clearing is something we do, as a 
                        camp.

           Miles is not convinced.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        Everybody does it.

                                 MILES
                        Said the SS Officer before he 
                        raised his pistol and decimated my 
                        ancestors.

           Elliot looks guilty, and stops clearing immediately.
                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ‘The revolution is not an apple 
                        that falls when it is ripe.

           INT. BUNK - NIGHT

           It’s the middle of the night, and Miles is the only camper 
           awake in a bunk-full of slobs. He can hardly bare the 
           symphonic sounds of snoring coming from every corner of the 
           bunk. He writes a manifesto with an ink-pen, by candlelight.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        You have to make it fall’, said the 
                        great Che Guevara.

           Elliot snores the loudest from the top bunk. He flips over in 
           his sleep, rattling the San Andreas Fault. 

                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Today I must ask you, fellow 
                        campers, help me shake the tree. 
                        Take a moment and consider, are the 
                        conditions in which we are living 
                        up to the basic standards of a 
                        civilized society?

           Elliot farts loudly. Miles kicks the top bunk with serious 
           aggression. Elliot sleeps right through it.

                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I shall take the opposing position.

           EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Miles wears all black as he moves under the cover of 
           darkness.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Our parents drop us here to labor 
                        and sleep so that they can enjoy 
                        two weeks of solitude away from us.

           He slips into a bunk.

           INT. BUNK - NIGHT

           He slides his manifesto under the beds of every camper.
                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        I can now sympathize with the 
                        interned Japanese...

           INT. ANOTHER BUNK - NIGHT

           He covertly distributes more copies of his manifesto. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        And can only hope to maintain my 
                        dignity as well as they did.

           A TINY KID tosses and turns, deep in a disturbed sleep.

                                 TINY KID
                        Mommy? That you? Is it you, Mommy?

           Miles stuffs the manifesto into the kid’s open mouth. 

                                 MILES
                        (shakes his head)
                        A lifetime of therapy. Guaranteed.

           EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Miles hides from tree to tree as he makes his way across 
           camp.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        I say it’s time we revolt. 
                        Opposition to tyranny is our only 
                        hope. Therefore, I ask each and 
                        every one of you to --

           Suddenly, a flash-light beam illuminates Miles. He freezes in 
           mid-stride, his hands up.

                                 LAYLA
                        Don’t even move.

                                 MILES
                        Sorry, pardon me?

                                 LAYLA
                        You’re busted. 

                                 MILES
                        Seriously? You’re gonna --

                                 LAYLA
                        Seriously. You’re in trouble.
                                 MILES
                        (approaching, hands kept up)
                        It’s Layla, right? 

           She nods.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Authority, Layla. That make you 
                        feel good? 

                                 LAYLA
                        Euphoric, actually.

                                 MILES
                        I bet.

           Miles lowers his hands slowly, as though she may shoot.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Can we at least talk about this?

           INT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

           Miles and Layla sit on the swings, lit only by moonlight.

                                 MILES
                        Point is, you overlook this little 
                        transgression and I’ll unionize the 
                        counseling staff and personally 
                        guarantee an immediate increase in 
                        wages.  

                                 LAYLA
                        Interesting proposal. I’ll give you 
                        that.

                                 MILES
                        And... I won’t tell anybody about 
                        you and Morrie. Head counselor.

                                 LAYLA
                        (shocked)
                        Who told you about that?

                                 MILES
                        I never burn a source.

                                 LAYLA
                        That’s over, anyway.

           She kicks her legs up and soars OUT OF FRAME.
                                 LAYLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not a slut, if that’s what 
                        you’re thinking.

           Layla swings BACK IN FRAME.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Camp psychologist said I was just 
                        ‘acting out’.

           Miles kicks his legs and now he swings OUT OF FRAME.

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Oh, is that what they’re calling it 
                        these days?

           He swings BACK IN FRAME.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        And what are you acting out 
                        against?

                                 LAYLA
                        I’m a sixteen year-old girl. What 
                        do you think? 

           Miles shrugs, having no idea.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Uh... everything.

           Miles holds his swing steady with hers.

                                 MILES
                        Can I tell you something? You might 
                        get mad.

                                 LAYLA 
                        Now I really want to know.

                                 MILES
                        I think I’m... kind of, in love 
                        with you.

           Miles kicks his legs up and swings OUT OF FRAME as quickly as 
           he can. He swings back down, digs the toes of his shoes into 
           the sand, and comes to a stop.

           He eagerly awaits a reaction. She just looks away, avoiding 
           eye contact.
                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like I’m lusting over you 
                        or anything, if that’s what you’re 
                        thinking. So get that idea out of 
                        your head, the sooner the better. I 
                        don’t even care. I barely even 
                        think about you. This is the first 
                        time, actually. Now I’m done. The 
                        subject bores me. Anyway, I only 
                        said ‘I think’.

           Miles gets off the swing, and walks out of the playground.

                                 LAYLA 
                        Tell your friends I’m not a slut.

                                 MILES
                        Young girl. Acting out. I’ll put 
                        out a press release.

           Layla leans on the swing, and gazes up at the sky. 

           EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Miles hikes back to his bunk, passing through shadows. Layla 
           catches up, lighting him up with her flashlight beam.

                                 LAYLA
                        Look, it’s nothing personal. 

                                 MILES
                        Sorry, what’s not?

                                 LAYLA
                        This whole thing.

                                 MILES
                        Oh... 
                        (points to himself and her)
                        ...this whole thing? Yeah, this 
                        whole thing’s over.

                                 LAYLA
                        Miles, I want to be friends, okay?

           He continues up the dirt path. She still trails him. He 
           pauses at the back door to his bunk.

                                 MILES
                        I didn’t even want to come here. My 
                        parents made me.
                                 LAYLA
                        Yeah, well what are you going to 
                        do.

                                 MILES
                        What am I going to do?

                                 LAYLA
                        Yeah. I mean, you’re here now so, 
                        my advice, make the best of --

                                 MILES
                        No, no. I’m going to sue them.

           Layla laughs hard. Real hard. Miles does not. She stops cold, 
           realizing he’s serious.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARENT’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Gary is brushing his teeth.

                                 GARY
                        It’s just a rough time, honey. The 
                        economy is in a downward spiral. 
                        Nobody’s hiring. Hell, I don’t even 
                        know if I want to work at another 
                        firm right now anyway, you know?

           He spits, and shuts the light off.

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gary crawls into bed. Meredith is lying on her side.

                                 GARY
                        I mean, I’m not even sure I want to 
                        be a lawyer anymore. Maybe this is 
                        an opportunity for me to explore 
                        something new. Something entirely 
                        different. Something exciting. What 
                        do you think?

           Meredith doesn’t respond.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Honey?

           Gary leans over her, and sees that her eyes are closed. He 
           shuts his light off, rolls over, and goes to sleep.
           DRIFT OVER to Meredith, who lies there, eyes now wide open. 
           They roll. 

           EXT. DINING HALL - NEXT MORNING

           There’s an awkward silence that hangs over the crowded hall. 
           Meals have been eaten and dirty plates rest in front of still-
           hungry campers. 

                                 MORRIE
                        (clapping)
                        One. Two. Three. Clear! One. Two 
                        three. Clear!

           Staff members push around carts that hold plastic bins for 
           dirty dishes, antiseptic squirt bottles, and dish towels.

           From around the room, campers watch Miles, awaiting a signal. 
           He picks up his plastic plate and bangs it on the table over 
           and over, in a rhythm. The entire camp joins in, like a 
           prison uprising.

           Miles nods to Nate, who rises to his feet, leans back and 
           sings out loud. Surprisingly, he’s got a deep, soulful voice, 
           like a teenage Isaac Hayes.

                                 NATE
                        Go down Moses. Way down in Egypt’s 
                        land, oh yeah. And you just tell 
                        that old Pharaoh to... to let my 
                        people go.

           For a second, the camp sits in silence. Campers and 
           counselors stare each other down.

           Then, Miles nods and all at once campers bang their plates on 
           the table over and over like quarter notes on a snare drum. 
           Campers sing a haunting, spiritual harmony.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        When Israel was in Egypt’s land...

                                 CAMPERS
                        Let my people go.

                                 NATE
                        Oppressed so hard they could not 
                        stand...

                                 CAMPERS
                        Let my people go.
                                 NATE
                        Go down Moses, way down to Egypt’s 
                        land and you, you tell that old 
                        Pharaoh to... 

                                 CAMPERS/NATE
                        Let my people go.

           They continue to sing and Morrie has no idea what to do. 
           Layla’s eyes find Miles reclining in his chair, glowing with 
           accomplishment. She hides a grin.

           A COUNSELOR walks up to Morrie and hands him a wrinkled copy 
           of Miles’ manifesto.

           Morrie glances around the room until he finds Miles, who 
           darts out the back door.

           EXT. DINING HALL - MORNING

           Layla catches up, cornering him.

                                 LAYLA
                        Dead man walking.

                                 MILES
                        (shrugs)
                        Depends where you come down on free 
                        speech.

           He winks and walks away, leaving a trail of confidence 
           behind. 

                                 MILES (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And therefore, in conclusion...

           INT. CAMP DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Miles is speaking to Morrie and two older CAMP DIRECTORS, a 
           hippiesh man with a goatee and Birkenstocks, and a face-
           lifted woman who’s tight skin is in a perpetual fight with 
           gravity. 
                                 MILES
                        I argue that, though John Stuart 
                        Mill’s Harm Principle clearly 
                        illustrates the danger of yelling 
                        fire in a crowded theater, tonight 
                        I was doing nothing more than 
                        airing my views and expressing my 
                        grievances, a privilege extended to 
                        us all as you most certainly know, 
                        by our beloved Bill Of Rights. I 
                        can only hope that you agree with 
                        this point of view. As Americans. 
                        During a fearful time. When our 
                        country is at war. At home. And 
                        abroad. With an enemy we do not 
                        know.

           Morrie rolls his eyes.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        The terrorists.

           The camp directors share a look of utter exhaustion. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           Miles gazes out the backseat window as the summer camp passes 
           by. A dirt path becomes a one-way road which becomes a city 
           street which becomes the busy 101 freeway. 

           In the front seat, Gary and Meredith are enraged. 

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Alcohol, drugs, sex...

           EXT. CALHOUN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Mercedes pulls into the driveway. The engine turns off.

           INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

           They sit in the car, idle.

                                 GARY
                        ...all somewhat understandable 
                        reasons for a kid to get himself 
                        kicked out of camp. But not you.
                                 MEREDITH
                        No. Not our Miles.

                                 GARY
                        No, our Miles starts a revolution.

                                 MILES
                        It was either that or arts and 
                        crafts.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Dad and I have discussed this. 
                        You’re going to get a job.

           Miles makes the sound of a rim-shot with his mouth, as though 
           Meredith just delivered the punch-line to a joke. Gary and 
           Meredith turn in their seats to glare at him.

                                 MILES
                        I know money is tight and all 
                        because dad got fired --

                                 GARY
                        Laid off.

                                 MILES 
                        But seriously? This is a joke, 
                        right? A tasteless, offensive joke?

                                 GARY
                        The feeling of earning an honest 
                        buck. How’s that sound?

                                                                CUT TO:

           A 9MM PISTOL

           Cold, black steel pointed right at US. Three loud rounds of 
           fire spit right out the nose.

           INT. NORTHRIDGE GUN CLUB - DAY

           Miles aims the pistol, squints his left eye through a pair of 
           yellow safety goggles, and squeezes off five BLASTING rounds. 

                                 MILES 
                        (to himself, possessed)
                        ‘The hour of Emancipation is 
                        advancing. This enterprise is for 
                        the young.’
           He loads another clip, fires off seven more rounds, and 
           proudly lowers the weapon.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        ‘For those who can follow it up, 
                        and bear it through to its 
                        consummation’. 

           Miles yanks off his goggles and fires one last, piercing 
           shot, gangster-style with his hand cocked sideways. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I will not let you down, Mr. Thomas 
                        Jefferson.

           Next to Miles, a large, tattooed GANGSTER shakes his head. 

                                 GANGSTER
                        I heard all that, you know.

                                 MILES
                        Oh. Okay.

                                 GANGSTER
                        Shit was gay, man. A speech to 
                        yourself.

           Miles clicks the safety on, and tucks the gun in the back of 
           his suit pants. 

                                 GANGSTER (CONT’D)
                        I mean really, really gay.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, thanks. I’ve heard your 
                        stance on the issue.

           Miles walks into the shop and slides the gun across the 
           counter to a Mexican SALESMAN with a shaved head.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Told you bro, she got a serious 
                        kick. You break a rib, little man? 

                                 MILES
                        Little man. That’s cute.

           He slides over a leather-bound folder.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Your thesis. Spell checked and 
                        everything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You’ll graduate from junior college 
                        at the top of your class, and 
                        you’ve probably got a decent shot 
                        at the Pulitzer. Thanks for the 
                        shells.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Always a pleasure, homes.

           They pound fists and Miles walks out, a backpack slung over 
           his shoulder. 

           EXT. NORTHRIDGE GUN CLUB - DAY

           Miles shoves his i-pod earplugs into his ears and cranks up a 
           gritty, thumping bass-line. “Hip-Hop”, by Dead Prez. 

           EXT. VALLEY STREETS - DAY

           He walks against traffic like he’s the only person on earth. 
           He passes liquor-stores, 7-11s, and a school holding fenced-
           in kindergartners. Eventually he comes upon a large, brick 
           synagogue. 

           INT. SYNAGOGUE OFFICE - DAY

           RUTH, a secretary far past 80, peels off her bifocals as 
           Miles enters.

                                 RUTH
                        Where have you been, young man? You 
                        were to be back from lunch at one 
                        o’clock. It’s nearly one-thirty!

                                 MILES
                        Forty years in the desert, Ruth, 
                        don’t rush me now. 

                                 RUTH
                        Rebecca is waiting for you in the 
                        sanctuary.

           He walks out the door.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        (under her breath)
                        Hitler.

           He pokes his head back in.
                                 MILES
                        You have to live with that. 

           Ruth sighs, caught.

           INT. SANCTUARY - DAY 

           The same sanctuary in which Miles was Bar Mitzvah’d. Stained 
           glass windows bathe the room in glorious, bleached colors. 

           REBECCA, a tiny and timid little twelve year-old, stands up 
           on the bimah. She chants her Torah portion and it’s just 
           horrible -- sounds like cats burning. 

           Miles sits in the front row with his arms draped over two 
           chairs, as though this were theater auditions.

                                 REBECCA
                        (chanting) 
                        Ve’havtah, et Adonai eloheicha, 
                        v’chol levavcha, v’chol 
                        navshecha...

                                 MILES
                        Stop. Stop stop stop.

                                 REBECCA
                        Uk-tov-tom le-yot alyadecha...

                                 MILES
                        Stop. Stop stop. Stop stop stop.

                                 REBECCA
                        Vchai-yu-lt’tofot beinenecha...

                                 MILES
                        Stop! 

           Miles beams his pencil at her. She has to duck to avoid a 
           serious eye injury.

                                 REBECCA
                        (frightened)
                        What? What’d I do?

                                 MILES 
                        You know how God created the world 
                        in six days and on the seventh he 
                        rested?

                                 REBECCA
                        Uh-huh. So?
                                 MILES
                        Seems like he had a little work 
                        left to do, now doesn’t it?

           She bursts into tears and runs away. Miles sighs, and then 
           spots the RABBI standing off in the corner, watching.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        (startled)
                        Jesus Christ!

           EXT. CALHOUN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The menacing Volvo pulls into the driveway.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gary is on the phone, sorting through files in front of him. 
           Meredith enters with a sullen Miles in tow.

                                 GARY
                        What happened?

                                 MEREDITH
                        He got fired. And we’ll probably 
                        have to find another congregation 
                        for High Holidays this year.

                                 GARY
                        You got fired?

                                 MILES
                        (shakes his head)
                        Laid off.

           Gary charges after Miles, who makes it to his room and slams 
           the door, fending off the attack.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           He flips down the Wu Tang Clan poster, revealing a white dry-
           erase board hanging on the wall. On it are the words: 
           Abandonment: Camp Okeebogee. Imprisonment: Grounded. Abuse:  
           Now, with a black sharpie, he writes Mental.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        (yelling, through the door)
                        No television, no radio, no 
                        internet, no telephone, no fucking 
                        breathing unless I say to! 
           Miles opens his closet and we see boxes and boxes of legal 
           briefs. He fetches his mini tape recorder, clicks it on and 
           speaks right into it.

                                 MILES
                        Can I breath now, papa? I’m turning 
                        red! I’m turning red!

           He slides the tape recorder across the carpet with an evil 
           grin, in listening range of the door.

                                 GARY (O.S.) 
                        Open this goddamn door right now. 
                        I’m going to take your tonsils out 
                        with my bare hands! 

                                 MILES
                        (to himself)
                        This is good audio.

           He crawls into bed, pulls the covers over him, and casually 
           begins a new page in his composition book, as Gary continues 
           to yell obscenities.

           EXT. CALABASAS NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           It’s painfully early, and Miles is hard at work at his new 
           job, mowing lawns. He mows and mows with determination. 

           Down the block he notices the garage door to his house open, 
           and his father’s Mercedes pulling out.

           A MOTORCYCLE COP is waiting around the corner, a speed-trap. 
           Miles rushes over in a panic.

                                 MILES
                        Excuse me, officer?

                                 COP
                        Yeah?

                                 MILES
                        You see that car over there? You 
                        know, the silver one?

                                 COP
                        I see it. 

                                 MILES
                        The man driving tried to sell me 
                        marijuana. And I’m really scared.
           Miles’ innocent face is reflected in the cop’s mirrored 
           aviator sunglasses. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        See, I know drugs are bad for me 
                        and all, and that I should stay far 
                        away from them, but this man, he 
                        made such a compelling case and now 
                        I want to try them all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The cop pulls up behind Gary’s Mercedes. His siren roars. 

           INT. MERCEDES - MORNING

           Gary spots the swirling red-light in his rear-view.

                                 GARY
                        Shit. 

           He rolls down the window.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        There a problem, officer?

           Without answering, the cop yanks open the door, pulls Gary 
           out, and cuffs him on the sidewalk in one impressive motion.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’re doing? You 
                        can’t just pull a man out of his 
                        car like this! 

           The cop reaches into the center console and finds the blunt 
           that Nate painfully sampled, and Miles ingeniously saved. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I have rights! I’ll have you know 
                        I’m a lawyer!

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Was a lawyer!

           Gary instantly looks for the body connected to that voice. 
           Miles dives down behind a Volkswagon next to Elliot, who 
           holds a digital camcorder.
                                 ELLIOT
                        Awesome footage. I’m going to put 
                        it on the internet.

                                 MILES
                        Not until after the trial.

           We DRIFT ABOVE Miles and Elliot until we are high enough to 
           ANGLE DOWN and, when we do, we see that Miles has carved the 
           words JIHAD in the lawns of the neighborhood.

           INT. DEN/MEREDITH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Meredith, on the phone, sits at her desk across from SHARON, 
           a middle-aged housewife. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        (into phone) 
                        I told you the judge would dismiss 
                        it. Did they at least let you keep 
                        the pot? That was a joke, Gary. 
                        Don’t take yourself so seriously. 
                        Excuse me? Now why would you say 
                        something like that? Look, I have a 
                        patient. Can we talk about this 
                        later?

           Meredith hangs up, perturbed.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Sharon. Where were we?

                                 SHARON
                        Oh, okay. Well, I spend all day in 
                        the house. I vacuum, I clean, and 
                        then there I am, all alone, in a 
                        clean, vacuumed house with nothing 
                        to do, and nobody to do it with.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Uh-huh. Go on.

                                 SHARON
                        Lately, I’ve even begun talking to 
                        myself. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        More common than you’d think.

                                 SHARON
                        Mostly sex stuff.
                                 MEREDITH
                        Sorry, what?

                                 SHARON
                        Like role-playing, but with myself. 
                        Sort of like a child using his 
                        imagination to create an 
                        alternative world, only this world 
                        consists of dark, twisted thoughts. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        I’m not following.

                                 SHARON 
                        Sometimes I imagine the FedEx guy 
                        knocking on my door with a special 
                        delivery. I sign for it and the 
                        next thing I know he’s got me bent 
                        over the hood of my station wagon 
                        with his hands sliding down my -- 
                        Well, I won’t go on. Unless you’ve 
                        got the time?

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Oh, see... time we’ve got.

           All eyes go to Miles, leaning against the door post.

                                 SHARON
                        Okay, great. So, then he radios in 
                        and gathers up some of his buddies, 
                        like, other FedEx guys and stuff 
                        and they come over with their -- 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Miles, get out of here! Can’t you 
                        see I’m working! 
                        (to Sharon)
                        Sharon, I really apologize. 
                        (to Miles)
                        Counting to three. One...

           Miles walks over, and takes Sharon’s hands in his.

                                 MILES 
                        Lady, I don’t have a Ph.D. And I’ll 
                        let you in on a little secret, 
                        neither does my mom. But I know 
                        this... you’re really messed up. I 
                        mean it. Total whack job. Can I 
                        give you some advice?
                                 SHARON
                        Please. Anything. I’m losing my 
                        mind!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Two.

                                 MILES
                        Vicodin and Oprah. 
                        (gesturing to Meredith)
                        It works for her.

                                 MILES/MEREDITH
                        Three!

           Meredith bursts out of her chair and slaps Miles right across 
           the face -- he dramatizes the blow as though this were a 
           Western. He throws himself over Meredith’s desk, knocking 
           over everything, and flings himself into the bookcase. Self-
           help paperbacks fall all over him. 

                                 MILES
                        Wow, that was surprisingly violent.
                        (to Sharon) 
                        Ma’am, did you see that?

           Sharon, in complete shock, nods. Miles pulls out a document 
           and an ink pen.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Great. Then if you’ll just initial 
                        here, here, here and here.

           She does, out of reflex.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Well, I’ll leave you two to your... 
                        whatever.

           Miles winks at Meredith, and walks out.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - DAY

           Miles races in, shuts and locks the door. He catches his 
           breath and smiles victoriously. He walks over to his dry-
           erase board and writes: Abuse: Mental And Physical.

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Miles walks into the den, where Gary sits in front of the 
           family computer, intensely surfing employment web-sites.
                                 MILES
                        Hey there, pop.

                                 GARY
                        (without turning around) 
                        What can I do for you, Dr.  Mengale?

                                 MILES
                        Can you check the internet? I heard 
                        the President just declared war.

                                 GARY
                        Another one? Just what we need. 

           Gary clicks on the internet logo and a shocking amount of 
           graphic pornography appears on the computer. It’s a slide-
           show of raw flesh in incredibly raw situations. 

           Miles pulls out a digital camera and SNAPS. The FLASH goes 
           off.

                                 MILES 
                        A woman having sex with a horse? 
                        That’s your thing? 
                        (shrugs) 
                        Hey, judge not lest ye be judged.

           Gary explodes out of his chair and turns to decapitate his 
           son, when -- FLASH!

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A photo of Gary with his fist extended appears on Miles’ 
           laptop. Miles grins, ear-to-ear.

           EXT. CALABASAS COUNTRY CLUB - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

           Miles is working his new job -- carrying buckets of golf 
           balls over to GOLFERS. He smiles cordially as he places balls 
           in front of swinging iron.

           He spots his father a few tees down, swinging next to a 
           distinguished black man named RUSSELL.

                                 RUSSELL
                        (teeing off)
                        How’s that lovely wife of yours, 
                        Gar?
                                 GARY
                        Ever since I got laid off, we, I 
                        don’t know, we argue, non-stop. And 
                        by non-stop, I mean I’m getting 
                        yelled at in my dreams, then I wake 
                        up and get yelled at for that.

           Gary smacks a golf ball with a 3-wood.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Women want security, pal. A woman’s 
                        husband gets fired --

                                 GARY
                        Laid off.

                                 RUSSELL
                        And what do you expect?

                                 GARY
                        Support. Instead, we battle. I 
                        don’t know what I’m going to do.

                                 RUSSELL
                        Don’t start with that.

                                 GARY
                        With what?

                                 RUSSELL
                        An exit plan. Not when it comes to 
                        marriage. 

           Gary thinks about that for a moment, and drives another ball.

                                 GARY
                        Well, I hear Nate had a great time 
                        at camp.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I had an even better time with him 
                        gone.

           Gary laughs. Russell swings. A beautiful 200-yarder.

                                 RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        And your kid? My wife tells me he 
                        got the boot for organizing some 
                        sort of rebellion? 
                                 GARY
                        I’m trying to get him enlisted in 
                        the Marines but they say he has 
                        flat feet and asthma. That, and 
                        he’s thirteen.

                                 RUSSELL
                        I say give the boy a medal for 
                        speaking his mind.

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        And I concur. 

           Russell and Gary turn to see Miles on the green next to them, 
           a club in his hand and a ball lined up on the tee.

                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        (to Gary) 
                        Here’s a tip, no charge.

           Miles slices a picture-perfect drive nearly 300 yards.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You’re rushing the follow-through.

           Gary drops his 3-wood and races after Miles. Miles, avoiding 
           a sure death, darts out onto the driving range. Golf balls 
           drop like mortars all around them.

           Gary catches Miles near the 150-yard mark and dive-tackles 
           him. The two roll around on the grass.

                                 GARY
                        Sonofa --

           Miles breaks free. Gary finds his footing, but gets pummeled 
           by a golf ball to the forehead and hits the grass hard.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m having you put to sleep! Just 
                        like Arnold! Our first dog!

           Miles stops running and turns around, horrified.

                                 MILES
                        What a cruel thing to say. That dog 
                        was my whole life! Why would you 
                        take it there?

           Miles, about to cry, beams a golf ball at Gary’s head, and 
           escapes into the dense trees lining the golf course. 
                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Please tell me you got all of that.

           Elliot, his trusted cameraman, gives a smiling thumbs-up.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Miles and Elliot stand a few feet apart.

                                 MILES
                        Okay, punch me in the face.

           WHACK! Elliot slugs him hard, close-fisted, square in the 
           face. Miles goes flailing backwards and lands on the tile 
           floor. Blood gushes from his fractured septum.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        (in agony)
                        Christ, man! Mother of GAWD! You’re 
                        supposed to hesitate. Say, ‘no 
                        Miles, I can’t do it. I don’t want 
                        to do it because you’re my closest 
                        friend’. 
                        (explosion of pain)
                        FUCK!

                                 ELLIOT
                        I feel terrible.

                                 MILES
                        Just take the picture.

           Elliot kneels down, points the camera at Miles’ disjointed 
           nose, and -- FLASH!

           INT. DEN - DAY

           Meredith is at the family computer, typing. She appears 
           frustrated. CLOSE ON an Excel sheet listing their family 
           income. In the column marked Meredith, several numbers are 
           listed. In the column marked Gary, nothing but zeros. She 
           shakes her head, disappointed. 

           Miles, his nose taped up and stuffed with gauze, stands over 
           her shoulder.

                                 MILES
                        Hey there, Ma.
                                 MEREDITH
                        (without turning around) 
                        What now? Off selling secrets to Al-
                        Qaeda?

                                 MILES
                        This is serious. Can you check the 
                        internet real quick? I heard there 
                        was another terrorist attack. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        What is the world coming to?

           Meredith clicks on the internet logo and a vile, pornographic 
           montage begins. Raw, pasty flesh contorted in awkward, 
           animalistic positions.

                                 MILES
                        C’mon, mom... voyeur?

           Meredith turns to grab him and -- FLASH! Miles lowers the 
           camera and walks down the...

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           ...where Gary had been watching from around the corner. He’s 
           laughing hard into his palms.

                                 GARY
                        That was good. I’ll give you that.

                                 MILES
                        (smiles)
                        Thanks.

           Gary just keeps on chuckling until Meredith appears, out in 
           the hallway. Then, Gary stops.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles downloads the photo of Meredith, her angry hands 
           extended, onto his laptop. He catches a glimpse of his 
           bandaged nose in the reflection in the mirror. He walks over 
           to his dry-erase board and under Abuse: Mental. Physical. 
           Very Physical.

                                 GARY (O.S.)

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The unhappy family is gathered around the kitchen table. 
           Meredith stands over the stove, stirring Spaghetti sauce. 

                                 GARY
                        I have to believe you’re not a bad 
                        kid. Just maybe a little misguided. 
                        Actually, no... the more I think 
                        about it, yeah, you’re a bad kid. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        (with disdain)
                        That’s helpful.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah? Well you patting him on the 
                        back every time he launches a 
                        Katusha rocket isn’t helping 
                        either.

                                 MILES
                        (quietly) 
                        Um... I never actually went 
                        through... 

           They glare at each other and look away, not wanting to fight 
           in front of Miles.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        ...with the launch.

                                 GARY
                        Miles, let’s pray it’s just a 
                        phase.

                                 MEREDITH
                        We can’t pray, remember? We got 
                        thrown out of temple.

                                 GARY
                        I’m trying to talk to my goddamn 
                        son and you can’t stop yourself 
                        from interrupting! Could you just 
                        please, please... go!

           She drops the wooden spoon and storms out. Gary looks at 
           Miles, but Miles looks down at the floor, uncomfortable.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s just... well, it’s a tough 
                        time, you know, for everyone.
                                 MILES
                        Yeah. 

           They sip their drinks.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

                                 GARY
                        What?

                                 MILES
                        She understands.

           Gary nods, appreciating the support. Gary goes to throw out 
           the trash, and when he does -- Miles quickly sprinkles some 
           sort of powder into the Spaghetti sauce.

           Meredith returns, and angrily plops Spaghetti down onto 
           everyone’s plate. Gary takes his seat and they eat. Miles 
           makes a big display of how tasty it is.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        (to Meredith)
                        Did I ever tell you how much I love 
                        your cooking?

                                 MEREDITH
                        No, but, well... thanks, Miles.

           Meredith smiles, touched by his unexpected kindness.

                                 MILES
                        Hey, it’s a pleasure.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MILES   

           As he violently throws up into the toilet.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           He takes a short break from heaving to literally hug the 
           porcelain. 

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        For the love of -- !
           Gary barrels in, knocks Miles out of the way, and vomits 
           violently. They gather air, both nearly passed out on the 
           floor.

                                 MILES
                        Food poisoning. Like the summer of 
                        ‘98.

                                 GARY
                        ‘98 pales in comparison. Don’t tell 
                        Mom. She’ll feel terrible.

           Meredith bursts through the door, shoves both of them out of 
           the way, and howls. 

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Miles lays out his suit, shirt, clip-on tie, and freshly 
           buffed dress shoes. 

           He pulls his laptop from under his bed, and he begins the 
           arduous process of transcribing the thousands of words he has 
           written in his two-foot tall stack of composition books.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN, he types the words THE END. Satisfied, he 
           presses print, climbs into bed, and turns off the lights. He 
           goes to sleep to the sweet sound of pages printing.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           SUPER:   

           Fool (fool) n.

           3.   One who has been tricked or made to appear ridiculous; a 
           dupe.

           FADE IN:

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Miles brushes his teeth in perfect little circles, his 
           execution flawless. 
           He swishes the water around in his mouth, stares at himself 
           in the mirror, and spits like a boxer ready to climb into the 
           ring. 

           He slips on his trousers, buttons up his freshly-ironed suit, 
           the iron still steaming in the background, and clips on his 
           tie.

           He gels his hair into a perfect crest in the mirror, and 
           considers winking. Instead, he throws a fist.  

           EXT. CALABASAS STREETS - MORNING

           It’s daybreak. The sun shines down on freshly cut lawns. 
           Sprinklers turn on in unison. Garage doors open and close as 
           NEIGHBORS hustle off to work. 

           The awakening calm is broken by a three-car caravan of 
           different model SUVs as they roar down the street like an 
           angry elephant herd. 

           INT. LAND ROVER - MORNING

           The lead SUV of the pack. Elliot sits in the passenger seat. 
           His mother, DORA, an equally large individual, sips an extra-
           large strawberry-banana smoothie while she drives. 

                                 DORA
                        Did you forget the extra fiber 
                        boost?

                                 ELLIOT
                        No.

                                 DORA
                        Than why don’t I feel it yet?

           In the backseat are three other KIDS. One’s asleep. One’s 
           listening to an i-pod. Another drools as he stares out the 
           window.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, there... now I feel it.

                                 ELLIOT
                        (disgusted)
                        Mom.

                                 DORA 
                        So, everybody excited for the first 
                        day of school?
                                 ELLIOT
                        C’mon. You know the answer to that 
                        question. School blows.

           Dora slaps him hard across his face, completely unexpected.

                                 DORA
                        Consider yourself lucky to be 
                        getting an education. It’s a 
                        privilege.

                                 ELLIOT
                        No, actually... I’m pretty sure 
                        it’s a right.

           She grips his arm hard, like an angry cop.

                                 DORA
                        Smart guy, huh?

                                 ELLIOT
                        (nods)
                        I go to school.
                         (points left) 
                        Turn here. Keyshon has to run 
                        something up to his father.

                                 DORA
                        Ah, Christ. Why didn’t you tell me 
                        earlier?

           Elliot flinches, expecting another blow.

                                 DORA
                        Oh, grow a pair, would ya?

           Dora turns the wheel. She looks in her rear-view and signals 
           to the MOMS behind her. These women could be piloting fighter 
           jets.

           EXT. CALABASAS STREETS - MORNING

           WE DRIFT quickly past the second SUV in line, a Lexus, and we 
           get a brief view through the passenger windows of bored KIDS 
           being hauled off to school like mental patients in transit. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FIVE OVERLY-MANICURED TOES

           As they slam hard on a brake pedal. 
           INT. ESCALADE - MORNING

           The toes belong to Keyshon’s mother CLAIRE, the driver of a 
           gleaming white, chromed-out Escalade.

           Behind her, Miles sits between Keyshon and Nate, as though 
           they were his bodyguards. 

           This is a motorcade. A motorcade for Miles J. Calhoun. And 
           the moms don’t even know it.

           EXT. CALABASAS STREET - DAY

           The SUV’s brake in unison and come to a stop on the side of a 
           busy street.

           INT. ESCALADE - DAY

           Claire looks at Keyshon, Nate, and Miles in the rear-view.

                                 CLAIRE 
                        Why we stopping?

           They all shrug. She fidgets with the radio, leaving it on 
           gangster rap. She taps her extra-long fingernails against the 
           steering wheel.

           EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - MORNING

           The motorcade pulls away. Nobody even noticed Miles 
           disembark, two heavy briefcases swinging at his sides.

           He climbs the steps and enters the tall, glass office 
           building.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

           He glances at his reflection in the mirrored-doors. As usual, 
           he’s incredibly pleased at what glances back.

           The doors open and Miles steps out, briskly.

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - ARCHIBALD, SCHAFER AND FOX - DAY

           Doesn’t break pace. A RECEPTIONIST shoots up from behind her 
           desk.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Calhoun, we were expecting you. 
                        How about a glass of orange juice 
                        and a granola bar? 

                                 MILES
                        Coffee. Black.

           He walks right into Archibald’s office.

           INT. ARCHIBALD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Archibald paces back and forth, enjoying a sprawling view of 
           the Encino Hills. 

           He looks up as Miles enters and slides the briefcases on the 
           beautiful oak desk.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        (into phone)
                        Governor, calling you back now, ya 
                        hear? 

           He hangs up, and shakes Miles’ hand.

                                 ARCHIBALD (CONT’D)
                        Have a seat, son.

           Miles sinks into an expensive, brown leather chair. From 
           behind, A HAND passes him a steaming cup of black coffee.

                                 ARCHIBALD (CONT’D)
                        I just want to make sure that we’re 
                        real clear with each other here, 
                        alright? 

                                 MILES
                        Of course, sir.

                                 ARCHIBALD 
                        Emancipation. You understand what 
                        this word means, don’t you?

                                 MILES
                        Let’s not waste anybody’s time 
                        here, okay?

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Freedom. It means freedom. In this 
                        case, freedom from your mother and 
                        father. Freedom from their 
                        constant, unconditional love.
                                 MILES
                        With all due respect, sir --

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Understand, you do this and you 
                        can’t go back. The law is 
                        permanent. A decision is made and 
                        lives are altered. You’re risking a 
                        whole lot here, a whole heck of a 
                        lot that may never be recovered, 
                        win or lose. 

           Archibald paces in front of his windows, commandingly.

                                 ARCHIBALD (CONT’D)
                        Once you walk out of here my 
                        paralegal picks up the phone and 
                        files a motion and this goes public 
                        and a monster is unleashed that 
                        neither you nor I can control. Son, 
                        these people, they’re your --

                                 MILES
                        Defendants, sir.

           Archibald sits on the edge of his desk, leveling with Miles.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        This will hurt them in a way you 
                        won’t understand until you have a 
                        child of your own. This really what 
                        you want to do?

                                 MILES
                        I’ll be co-counsel if allowed.

           Archibald sighs, then he chuckles to himself, amused by the 
           kid’s determination.

           He sits down behind his desk and opens the first briefcase. 
           He rifles through audio tapes, a petri dish of camp food, 
           still photos of his parents surfing porn, medical documents 
           with the words FOOD POISONING underlined. 

           He opens the second briefcase, and comes across 700 or so 
           typed pages. 

                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        My memoirs. I’ve been writing it 
                        since I was six. Non-fiction, feel 
                        free to fact-check. Filled with 
                        every sordid detail about my mother 
                        and fathers’ lives.
           Archibald closes the briefcase, impressed.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Mr. Calhoun, I have some good news. 
                        (leans in) 
                        We’re going to win.

                                 MILES
                        Because it’s right?

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Because I can.

           Miles nods, admiring the logic. 

                                 ARCHIBALD (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have one of my interns assist 
                        you in prepping your testimony.

                                 MILES
                        I don’t think that will be 
                        necessary, sir. I’m perfectly 
                        capable of -- 

           The door opens and in walks Layla Gardner, gorgeous in a 
           young, professional kind-of-way. 

                                 LAYLA
                        Miles Calhoun. Well, I’d have never 
                        guessed.

           Layla extends her hand. Miles stands in disbelief.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        This is Ms. Gardner. My new intern.

                                 LAYLA
                        (to Miles, winks)
                        School credit. But I don’t do it 
                        for that.

           He hands her the two briefcases. Her shoulders sag from the 
           weight. Her smile disappears. 

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Layla, give Mr. Calhoun a lift to 
                        school, would ya sweetheart? Oh, 
                        and make a copy of, uh, his 
                        memoirs, read the thing and give me 
                        a full report on it by the morning. 
                        (to Miles)
                        Court starts on Monday, son. Be 
                        ready.
                                 MILES
                        Always.

           Miles nods proudly, and walks out. Layla follows, lugging the 
           heavy briefcases behind her.

                                 ARCHIBALD 
                        (yelling O.S.)
                        Phyllis darling, hold my calls.

           Archibald sits in his chair, reclining back on the fine 
           Italian leather. He pulls a file out of the briefcase and 
           glances at it. The photograph of Miles and his parents 
           vacationing in Jamaica slips out. 

           He studies it, intrigued by a once happy family soon to be 
           torn asunder. He shakes his head.

           INT. VOLKSWAGON JETTA - DAY

           Layla drives. Miles sits shotgun, reading the Wall Street 
           Journal.

                                 MILES
                        What are you doing?

                                 LAYLA
                        I thought you could use my help. I 
                        didn’t believe you when you told me 
                        you were suing your parents, but 
                        then I talked to your friend Elliot 
                        who told me that you went and hired 
                        a lawyer. I found out who and 
                        applied for an internship.

                                 MILES
                        I don’t need your help. 

                                 LAYLA
                        I think you do. You got kicked out 
                        of summer camp based on a flawed 
                        argument. 

                                 MILES
                        Apparently Camp Okeebogee doesn’t 
                        believe in the basic tenants of 
                        democracy and has no regard for 
                        individual rights. I don’t know, 
                        I’m building a case.
                                 LAYLA
                        See, I believe you can win this 
                        one. With some help, of course.

                                 MILES
                        Shouldn’t you be off binging and 
                        purging, or whatever 16 year-old 
                        girls do?

                                 LAYLA
                        You’re smart, but you don’t know 
                        how to read people. It’s okay, 
                        you’re young. Eventually, you will 
                        learn that everything important 
                        exists between the lines. That’s 
                        where you look, and that’s where 
                        you make your moves.

                                 MILES
                        Tell me more, oh wise one.

                                 LAYLA
                        You can stay at my house once the 
                        subpoena is delivered. Archibald 
                        doesn’t want you staying at home. 

           Layla turns up the radio. A terrible GWEN STEFANI pop song is 
           heard. 

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, it’ll be fun!

           She turns the music up a few more decibels and sings along 
           loudly with Gwen.

                                 MILES
                        Dear diary. Today I contemplated 
                        suicide.

           Miles gazes out the window.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CALHOUN HOUSE - DAY

           Meredith watches some chirpy morning talk show. The doorbell 
           RINGS. She opens the door, revealing a MAN IN A SUIT.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Can I help you?

           He hands her an official looking document, turns on his heels 
           and leaves. Meredith opens the envelope, stunned at its’ 
           contents.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           She kicks the door shut, and leans against it in pure 
           disbelief.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Gary!

           Gary saunters into the living room, having just awoken.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been subpoenaed.

                                 GARY
                        Subpoenaed? C’mon, by who?

           He snatches the document from her hand and reads the name 
           MILES J. CALHOUN.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Our son.

                                 GARY
                        What for?

                                 MEREDITH
                        Emancipation.

                                 GARY
                        He wants freedom?

                                 MEREDITH
                        I guess so. 

                                 GARY
                        Why didn’t I think of that?

           Meredith glares, hurt.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that. Honey, I 
                        didn’t.

                                 MEREDITH
                        He’s my son. And he wants nothing 
                        to do with me. He hates me and 
                        wants me out of his life.

                                 GARY
                        I’m an equal part of the equation 
                        here.
                                 MEREDITH
                        Remember when he used to crawl into 
                        bed with us at night, when he was 
                        scared.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah.

           They enjoy the memory.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Impeccable timing, that kid. It  
                        was always when I was erect.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Gary!

                                 GARY
                        Hey, I cherish those.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Those memories?

                                 GARY
                        Those erections.

           They share an amusing moment. Then, sadness returns.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You think we may lose him, Gar?

                                 GARY
                        I think we already have.

           INT. LAYLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It’s the pastel-colored bedroom that belongs to every teenage 
           girl since the beginning of time. The walls are plastered 
           with posters and press clippings of TV stars and pop icons. 

           Layla lies on her bed, top-loaded with pillows, and reads the 
           very last page of Miles’ unbound novel. She looks off in 
           thought, digesting the narrative, deeply moved by the prose. 

           INT. TOOL SHED - NIGHT

           Miles is stashed away in a tiny little shed along with a 
           bicycle, a tire pump, and beat-up old sports equipment. He’s 
           wrapped in a sleeping bag set on top of a weight bench, his 
           head resting on the bench-press. A lantern bathes the room in 
           green-tinted light.
           The door cracks open, and Layla appears in the shadows.

                                 LAYLA 
                        I read your memoirs.

                                 MILES 
                        Here we go. Everybody’s a critic.

                                 LAYLA
                        No, no. I thought it was... 
                        inspired.

           She sits down next to him on the weight bench.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        It’s brave, you know. What you’re 
                        doing. You have... passion.

                                 MILES
                        That’s what I’ve been trying to 
                        tell you.

           TIGHT ON her dainty hand as she lays it on his leg and just 
           leaves it there, without thought. The touch of her flesh 
           separated only by a thin layer of denim. To a thirteen and a 
           half year-old boy, this is sex, pure and simple. 

                                 LAYLA
                        You’re very talented.

                                 MILES
                        The sky is blue.

           She laughs. Miles struggles not to stare down at her hand. A 
           charged moment passes, then --

                                 LAYLA 
                        (fake yawns) 
                        Okay. I’m going to bed.

                                 MILES
                        (fake yawns) 
                        Yeah, me too. Boy, am I beat.

           They sit there for another equally charged moment, nobody 
           doing anything.

                                 LAYLA
                        Well, good night then.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah. Uh-huh. Good night.
           She takes her hand off his knee and leaves. 

           Stunned, Miles rolls off the bench, still in the sleeping 
           bag, and hits the ground with a THUMP. He stares up at the 
           roof of the shed, his body still tingling from her touch. 

           INT. KITCHEN - GARDNER HOUSE - MORNING

           Miles stands over the stove, frying eggs. Layla, sleepy-eyed 
           and barefoot in a pair of oversized boxer shorts and tank 
           top, walks into the kitchen.

                                 LAYLA
                        What are you doing in the house? My 
                        mom will kill me if she finds you 
                        here!

                                 MILES
                        Relax. Suzanne left early for work. 
                        Seems like a lovely woman, by the 
                        way.  

                                 LAYLA
                        You were spying?

                                 MILES
                        Observing. Also, you should use 
                        less conditioner. 

           She throws a fork at him, knowing he’s kidding.

           Miles slides two plates of picture-perfect eggs and hash-
           browns on the table. They sit and eat together.

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK CUTS: 

           - Miles sits on Layla’s bed, practicing his answers as Layla 
           cross-examines.

           - Miles holds up the petri-dish of food from camp. He tries 
           to shove it in Layla’s face. She avoids him and laughs.

           - ON LAYLA’S TV, they watch the video footage of Miles being 
           attacked by his father on the driving range.

           - They watch the footage of Gary looking at the cop, who 
           holds a bag of grass in his hand.
           - Layla flips through still photos of Gary and Meredith 
           lunging for Miles in the den, with flashes of explicit 
           pornography on the computer screen behind them.

           - She looks at the photo of Miles’ broken nose taken from 
           five different angles. Looks like a mug shot.

           - They tack the letter that Miles wrote in the opening to a 
           cork-board.

           - They listen to the grainy audio of Miles being berated by 
           his father. It plays like the Watergate tapes.

           - Using colored markers, Layla has concocted the entire case 
           on the large dry-erase board. Imprisonment, Abandonment, 
           Abuse -- little pink arrows connect the words.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. LAYLA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           They sit there on the bed, exhausted from prepping the case. 
           Layla rests her hand on Miles’ leg, again. He doesn’t know 
           what to do, but he knows he has to do something. 

           So he leans in fast and furious, and his forehead smacks into 
           her upper lip. 

                                 LAYLA
                        What... in the hell!

           Blood trickles from her upper lip.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking sick? I’m bleeding 
                        here!

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, ooh... apply pressure. That’s 
                        gonna scar.

           She holds a piece of cotton against the wound.

                                 LAYLA 
                        This can’t happen. You’re just a 
                        little boy.

           He doesn’t respond, hating that theory. He walks out of her 
           room, holding his head low for the first time probably ever.

           IN THE MIRROR, Layla stares at her wound, and watches Miles 
           as he exits.
           INT. TOPANGA MALL - DAY

           Layla leads a protesting Miles through the mall.

                                 MILES
                        I don’t understand, what’s wrong 
                        with this suit? 

                                 LAYLA
                        Nothing, if you’re in a casket.

                                 MILES
                        Please. I debuted this at my Bar 
                        Mitzvah to rave reviews.

           INT. BANANA REPUBLIC - DAY

           Layla grabs a pin-striped, seersucker suit off a nearby rack, 
           pairs it with a tie, suspenders, and shiny shoes. She hands 
           it all to Miles, and shoves him into a fitting room.

           INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

           Miles opens the door. He fits perfectly into the stylish 
           suit. Layla is enamored.

                                 LAYLA 
                        Well, well, well... would you have 
                        a look at this.

           She circles around him as though she were appraising a piece 
           of fine art.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        It’s perfect. You look --

                                 MILES
                        Handsome. That’s assumed. But there 
                        are other adjectives. Start with 
                        dapper, divine... work from there.

           Miles walks back into the fitting room, and shuts the door. 

           He unbuttons the suit and pulls it off, when -- the door 
           swings open and Layla appears. Miles flinches and drops down 
           into the fetal position, in nothing but his jockeys and knee-
           high, striped socks.

           She shuts the fitting room door, and locks it. 
                                 LAYLA
                        Just get up.

                                 MILES
                        Don’t tell me what to do.

           Miles does as he’s told. Gets up.

                                 LAYLA 
                        Okay. Alright. So you wanna try 
                        something? 

           Miles shrugs, unknowingly. Layla plants her lips on his with 
           unbridled passion. They begin to kiss, gently.

           INT. ANOTHER FITTING ROOM - DAY

           A PIG-TAILED GIRL is trying on a summer dress. From the other 
           room, sloppy LIP-SMACKING can be heard. Her MOM throws her 
           hands over her ears.

                                 MOTHER
                        Get a room, you animals!

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        Say that again and I’ll...
                         (lip-smack)
                        ...sue you for libel.

           The mom grabs her very confused little daughter and walks out 
           of the fitting room. 

           INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

           Miles slides his hand behind her pony-tail. The room spins 
           and spins. And then it stops. The short, though powerfully 
           charged kiss comes to an end, as they pull apart.

           Miles is bright red, beside himself, having entered an 
           entirely new universe. A pretty damn good one.

                                 MILES
                        Your tongue, it was in my... 

                                 LAYLA
                        ...mouth. Yeah. Cool, right?  

                                 MILES
                        It was... moving around. And stuff. 
                        I mean, I felt it. And it felt... 
                        real good.
                                 LAYLA
                        I know how it feels. And now you do 
                        too. So, how about we cut the crap 
                        and get you emancipated?

           Miles stand up, and pulls on his suit. He looks at himself in 
           the mirror, Layla reflected behind him. Pure confidence looks 
           back. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANOTHER MIRROR REFLECTION

           Of Miles, who stands a tall four-foot something in his new 
           Seersucker suit. He cracks his neck from side to side. Fixes 
           the collar.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, he gels his hair into a perfect crest 
           and, as is tradition, almost winks -- but this time TWO HANDS 
           appear from behind. The hands mess up his perfectly sculpted 
           crest. 

                                 LAYLA (O.S.)
                        The trick is to look natural. 

           Layla appears, REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Not like you tried. 

           She walks out, leaving Miles flushed. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE ANTEROOM - DAY

           A small CROWD has gathered. Archibald and Layla hold the 
           courtroom doors open for Miles, who pauses a moment to gaze 
           across the hall, where his parents prepare enter.

           Despite pleas from Gary and their ATTORNEY, Meredith darts 
           over to Miles, beyond hurt. She’s infuriated.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Miles, you’re really going through 
                        with this?

                                 MILES
                        It’s nothing personal.
                                 MEREDITH
                        Nothing personal? I’m your mother! 

                                 MILES
                        Temporarily.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I gave birth to you!

                                 MILES
                        And my neck still aches from the 
                        delivery. What do you think, 
                        Archibald, we got a case?

           Archibald walks away, not wanting any part of this.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Don’t you remember when you were a 
                        little boy and we’d play all day 
                        together, you and me? We’d make up 
                        imaginary games and play pretend 
                        and...  

           Archibald steps in.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Pardon me, Ma’am. Court’s about to 
                        begin. 

           Meredith and Miles part -- walking in opposite directions.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I carried you inside of me for nine 
                        months.

                                 MILES
                        One more and I’d have tunnelled 
                        out.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Miles... I love you.

           Miles watches his mom walk away, sad. And it hits him. He 
           loves her too. And can’t help it.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           DRIFT OVER a table of labeled evidence: audio tapes, food 
           samples, doctor’s reports, photos of camp, etc...
           We are days into the trial and Miles is on the stand, playing 
           the part of a scared child to perfection. Archibald questions 
           his star witness.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        And right there, in the middle of 
                        the house, on the family computer 
                        no-less, this is what your mother 
                        and father were doing?

                                 MILES
                        That’s right, sir.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Must have been shocking to a young 
                        boy.

                                 MILES 
                        Sir, it was terrifying.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        How so, son?

                                 MILES
                        Just seeing these people, these 
                        real people, doing these scary 
                        things that I don’t quite 
                        understand. It looks like it must 
                        hurt so much. And seeing my own mom 
                        and dad taking such pleasure in 
                        these images...

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        ...made you feel?

                                 MILES
                        Sad.

                                 ARCHIBALD
                        Sad?

           Miles swallows dramatically.

                                 MILES
                        Sad. 

           Archibald gives the jury a moment to digest. 
           INT. COURTROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           TV monitors play the footage of Gary being arrested by the 
           cop, and Gary attacking Miles at the driving range. The 
           images freeze.

                                 ARCHIBALD 
                        Ladies and gentleman of the jury, I 
                        want to thank you for your time, 
                        and most importantly, for your 
                        understanding. As you know, my 
                        client is an above average, highly 
                        achieving young honors student. 
                        You’ve seen his report cards, and 
                        therefore have seen his inspiring 
                        marks. But folks, ever since Miles 
                        learned his ABCs, he has been 
                        writing, in vivid and may I say 
                        incredibly moving prose, a detailed 
                        account of his life with his 
                        parents, and the journey they have 
                        taken in raising him.

           Layla walks over to the jury, and passes out manuscripts.

                                 ARCHIBALD (CONT’D)
                        I ask of each and every one of you, 
                        read this tell-all for yourself 
                        before you decide whether this 
                        young man shall be set free. As you 
                        deliberate, I ask each and every 
                        one of you to read A HISTORY OF 
                        FOOLS, by my client, Miles J. 
                        Calhoun.

           Archibald holds up the book as though lightning will shoot 
           out of it. 

           TIGHT ON the cover of the novel -- a water-colored image of a 
           boy wearing fleece, footed-pajamas, trapped behind prison 
           bars.

           The title page reads: A HISTORY OF FOOLS: The Story Of My Mom 
           And Dad, by Miles J. Calhoun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE:

           - The Judge reads intensely in his bedroom at home. His WIFE 
           reads next to him, equally enthralled. 
           - JURORS read on park benches and cafeteria tables around the 
           courthouse atrium, entirely immersed in the page turner.

                                 JURY #1
                        Says here she can’t have any more 
                        kids.

                                 JURY #2
                        Yeah, and Gary took up drinking 
                        because of it.

           They shake their heads in shame.

                                                                CUT TO:

           - Two court-house JANITORS lean against their brooms, reading 
           the novel.

                                 JANITOR #1
                        The kid is prolific, let’s be 
                        honest. He’s captured that 
                        suburban, middle-class angst that 
                        has the potential to tear apart the 
                        very fabric of the family 
                        structure. 

                                 JANITOR #2
                        What I found most shocking was that 
                        he didn’t shy away from a problem 
                        that has infected our society for 
                        years.

                        Meredith Calhoun has a prescription 
                        drug problem. 

           The janitors shake their heads shamefully.

                                 JANITOR #2 (CONT’D)
                        You got any weed, by the way?

                        (shakes his head)
                        Fresh out.

           GARY 

           As he reads a passage directly to camera.
                                 GARY
                        Tonight, dad came home in a solemn 
                        mood. He says he was laid off.

           INT. CALHOUN BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gary and Meredith read in bed.

                                 GARY
                        (reading aloud) 
                        But Mom and I know it was because 
                        he was fired.

           Gary glares at Meredith.

                                 MEREDITH 
                        I never said that. I swear. 

           Gary shuts off his night-stand lamp, rolls over, and goes to 
           sleep with his back facing his wife. After a moment, Meredith 
           does the same.

           INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY

           The mood is solemn, pins and needles. Everybody takes their 
           seats. The judge begins.

                                 JUDGE 
                        In the case of Miles J. Calhoun 
                        versus Gary and Meredith Calhoun, 
                        the jury has decided to grant Miles 
                        J. Calhoun full emancipation under 
                        the title of the law. 

           Meredith cries, softly and painfully. Gary consoles her. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        We’ve lost our son.

                                 GARY
                        I know, honey. I know.

           Miles watches them, then quickly looks away, fearing the 
           slightest tinge of emotion.

                                 JUDGE
                        This entails the ability to 
                        officially obtain legal adulthood 
                        before reaching the age at which 
                        you would normally be considered an 
                        adult.

                                 JUDGE (CONT'D)
                        You now also have the right to sign 
                        legally binding contracts, own 
                        property, and keep one's own 
                        earnings. 
                        (to Miles) 
                        Son, welcome to the real world.

                        A pleasure to be here, sir.

           Miles smiles brightly, until he sees his mother and father, 
           visibly hurt. Then, his smile slowly fades.

                                                             FADE OUT.

           EXT. CALABASAS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Expensive, up-scale track homes as far as the eye can see. 
           DRIFT PAST ten-or-so of them until we land on a single one, 
           where Keyshon, wearing a cheap, black suit, yanks a FOR SALE 
           sign out of the freshly cut lawn, and breaks it over his knee 
           victoriously.

           INT. MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           The home is pristine. Mediterranean style, with high 
           ceilings, marble floors, skylights, the whole deal. However, 
           it’s sparsely furnished, a couch here, a chair there, not a 
           painting on the wall. 

                                 ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Mr. Calhoun’s office, how may I 
                        help you?

           INT. OFFICE - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Elliot, also in a ragged Bar Mitzvah suit, sits at a desk, 
           answering phones -- multiple phones that ring and ring. Faxes 
           continuously spit out of the fax machine. A copy machine runs 
           loudly, spewing documents.

                                 ELLIOT
                        (into phone)
                        I’m sorry, he is unavailable for 
                        interviews at this time. Call back 
                        in a month. 
           He grabs another ringing phone. Holds it to his other ear.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        (into phone) 
                        Mr. Calhoun’s office. That’s 
                        correct ma’am, he is currently 
                        working on his next book for Random 
                        House. An advanced copy? Nice try, 
                        sweet cheeks. Gonna have to settle 
                        for his blog.

           Another phone rings. Holds it to his other ear.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        (into phone) 
                        Mr. Calhoun’s -- I thought I made 
                        it quite clear the last time you 
                        called, lady... he is not doing any 
                        interviews at this time. What? Well 
                        you can tell Larry King to shove it 
                        up his --

           Miles walks in, a pencil behind his ear, a steaming cup of 
           coffee in his hand. Elliot changes his tone.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        (into phone) 
                        Look, Mr. Calhoun is a serious 
                        novelist, and as soon as he has the 
                        time, he’d love to join Mr. King 
                        for an in-depth conversation. Good 
                        day, ma’am. 

           Elliot hangs up. Miles pulls a fax from the fax machine. 
           TIGHT ON the document -- an expose on Miles J. Calhoun in The 
           New Yorker.

                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                        I hate this job. I hate it, I hate 
                        it, I hate it!

                                 MILES
                        That’s because you have no work 
                        ethic.

                                 ELLIOT
                        How much are you paying me again?

                                 MILES
                        Let’s see, when you add it all up 
                        and round it off to the nearest 
                        tenth? Yeah... nothing. 
                                 ELLIOT
                        I still don’t understand why I’m 
                        doing this. 

                                 MILES
                        Life lessons, Elliot. Life lessons. 
                        An honest day’s work is my gift to 
                        you.

           Miles walks out, sipping his coffee, reading The New Yorker 
           expose with his eyebrows arched upward.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You’ll thank me some day. 

           The phone rings again. And again. And again and again and 
           again.

                                 ELLIOT
                        (into phone) 
                        Mr. Calhoun’s office. Mr. Calhoun’s 
                        office. Mr. Calhoun’s...

           INT. KITCHEN - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           A sparkling kitchen, complete with a sub-zero fridge, and 
           marble counter-tops. Nate, in a white chef’s uniform, stirs 
           spaghetti sauce on the stove.

                                 MILES
                        Christ, pasta again?

                        Dawg, I told you fitty times, I 
                        don’t even know how to cook.

                                 MILES
                        True, but you know how to eat.

                                 NATE
                        Is that necessary? Look, I need 
                        some more loot. 

                                 MILES
                        For what?

                                 NATE
                        Shopping. We’re out of ice-cream, 
                        Snickers bars, Doritos, Oreo 
                        cookies, cupcakes, and Twinkies.
           Miles peels him off a few bills.

                                 MILES
                        Let me ask you something, you ever 
                        worry about your, you know, how 
                        shall I phrase this... weight?

                                 NATE
                        Please. I’m big-boned. 

                                 MILES
                        Right. Big-boned.

           A DOORBELL is heard. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Keyshon opens the door. Layla is standing there, beautiful as 
           always.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Afternoon, Ms. Gardner.

                                 LAYLA
                        Uh... afternoon, Keyshon? 

                                 KEYSHON
                        Is there something I can help you 
                        with, young lady?

                                 LAYLA
                        I need to speak with Miles, young 
                        man.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Is he expecting you?

                                 LAYLA
                        Well, no.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Huh.

           Keyshon stands there, enjoying his authority.

                                 KEYSHON (CONT’D)
                        Just a moment, if you would be so 
                        kind.

           He shuts the door on her.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Keyshon presses an intercom button.

                                 KEYSHON
                        (into intercom)
                        Miles, a Layla Gardner is here to 
                        see you.

                                 MILES (O.S.)
                        (over intercom) 
                        Send her in.

           Keyshon opens the door. Layla stands there, now annoyed.

                                 KEYSHON
                        After you.

           She walks in, followed by Keyshon, who directs her to a couch 
           sitting in the middle of a completely empty living room.

                                 KEYSHON (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Calhoun will be right with you.

                                 LAYLA
                        Mr. Calhoun? His father is here?

                                 KEYSHON
                        Well, no. We just call him... oh, 
                        here he is.

           Miles enters, coffee mug still in hand, pencil still behind 
           his ear.

                                 MILES
                        What a lovely, lovely surprise.

                                 LAYLA
                        Is there someplace we can talk?

           EXT. POOL - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Miles and Layla sit with their feet submerged in a beautiful, 
           black-bottom pool. 

                                 MILES
                        Something to drink?

                                 LAYLA
                        I don’t know. An iced-tea, I guess.
                                 MILES
                        (screams) 
                        Two iced-teas, A-SAP!

           Nate instantly appears with the drinks.

                                 LAYLA
                        Thanks, Nate.

                                 NATE
                        A pleasure, ma’am.

           Nate walks as far as another lounge chair, and collapses, 
           exhausted, though out of view of Miles and Layla.

                                 LAYLA
                        Wow, you have a full staff, huh?

                                 MILES
                        When I’m writing, I can’t be 
                        burdened by the minutia of daily 
                        life.

                                 LAYLA
                        (re: house)
                        So, all this, it’s all from the 
                        advance from Random House?

                                 MILES
                        A History Of Fools was a best 
                        seller. They are eager for the 
                        sequel, the Untitled Teenage Years 
                        of, you know, me.

                                 LAYLA
                        Congratulations, Miles. You deserve 
                        it.

           A moment passes. The sun reflects peacefully off the pool.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I have to talk to you about 
                        something. Something difficult.

                                 MILES
                        Talk away.

                                 LAYLA
                        Okay, well, look, I like you a lot. 
                        I mean, I really do. And I’ve had 
                        such a great time with you these 
                        last few days.
           Despite his lack of experience, Miles knows what’s coming.

                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        But I want to get something 
                        straight. The other day in the 
                        fitting room, I just wanted to try 
                        it, you know, and it really didn’t 
                        mean any --

                                 MILES
                        Good, because I’ve been meaning to 
                        talk to you too.

                                 LAYLA
                        Just a minute, Miles. I’m right in 
                        the middle of --

                                 MILES
                        I don’t want you to get the wrong 
                        idea here. I mean, I’m young and 
                        I’m free and everything is just so 
                        new right now! I don’t think it’s 
                        smart for me to tie myself down, do 
                        you? 

                                 LAYLA
                        (shocked) 
                        No. No, I guess not.

           Miles lays his hand on top of hers. She’s thrown off, feeling 
           rejected.

                                 MILES
                        I’m so sorry if I hurt you. It’s 
                        the last thing I ever wanted to do.

           Layla studies Miles, more fascinated by him now than ever. 
           She stands, and she leaves. 

           And then he cries. Not just a normal cry either, but a 
           primal, desperate plea for mommy.

           Unbeknownst to Miles, Nate is watching the entire time, 
           holding back a laugh.

           Unexpectedly, Layla appears once again.

                                 LAYLA
                        Forgot my sweater.

           She grabs her sweater off the back of the lounge chair, and 
           walks away. She stops, and turns back around.
                                 LAYLA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, were you crying?

                                 MILES
                        What? Crying? Me? C’mon, please.

                                 LAYLA
                        Oh, because you’re eyes are kind of 
                        red and glossy and it sort of looks 
                        like you’ve been --

                                 NATE
                        Crying. He was. I saw.

           Layla rubs Miles’ hair like he were her little brother.

                                 LAYLA
                        You’re so adorable, Miles J. 
                        Calhoun.

           She gets in her car, and drives away. 

                                 MILES
                        (to Nate)
                        Appreciate that. End it with 
                        dignity, you know?

                                 NATE
                        Right. Dignity.

           Nate walks inside. Miles drops himself into the pool like 
           dead weight. WE DROP UNDER WITH HIM, until he becomes hidden 
           by bubbles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FRONT DOOR - MILES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Miles stands at the door as his exhausted friends leave.

                                 MILES
                        Thanks for coming, guys. See you 
                        tomorrow?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Uh, Miles?
                        (to Keyshon, nudging him) 
                        You want to tell him? You said you 
                        would.

                                 KEYSHON
                        Miles, cool house and all, but...
                                 NATE/KEYSHON/ELLIOT
                        We quit.

                                 MILES
                        What? You can’t just...

                                 NATE
                        Yes, we can. And just did.

           Nate and Keyshon walk away. Elliot slaps Miles on the 
           shoulder, lovingly.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Good luck, pal.

           He shuts the door. Then, he looks around and realizes he’s 
           alone in a big, empty house -- in a big, empty world.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MILES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Miles lays in his massive bed, scribbling notes on a yellow 
           pad of paper. Suddenly, he stops. And he just lays there, 
           unable to write, unable to sleep. 

           He gets up, paces. Back and forth. Back and forth. Collapses 
           back onto his mattress, the painful feeling of loneliness 
           finally settling in.

           He fishes the photo of the Calhoun’s Jamaican vacation from 
           his night stand, and studies it.

           INT. CALHOUN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Miles walks the streets of his old neighborhood, cautious not 
           to be seen. He approaches his family home, hops over a fence, 
           and walks around to the back of the house.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Gary and Meredith are lying in lounge chairs, each holding 
           drinks with umbrellas in them. The pool is sparkling clean. 

           Miles’ little head peeks over the wooden fence, just as Gary 
           and Meredith clink their drinks together, in some kind of 
           celebration.

                                 GARY
                        This is the life. 
                                 MEREDITH
                        It sure is, baby. It sure is.

           Miles’ drops his head OUT OF FRAME. He leans against the 
           fence, dismayed.

           EXT. CALABASAS COUNTRY CLUB - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

           Gary and Meredith both tee off, wide smiles covering their 
           faces. Meredith slices the ball wide right, and she and Gary 
           giggle at her lack of skill.

           Now it’s Gary’s turn. Ducking behind a parked golf cart, 
           Miles watches, his parents oblivious to his spying presence.

           Gary smacks a perfect 300-yarder. Meredith is impressed.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Gary, my gawd! Where on earth did 
                        you learn to drive like that?

                                 GARY
                        I got a tip awhile back. Not too 
                        shabby, eh?

                                 MEREDITH
                        Not too shabby at all.

           They kiss and laugh, happy as ever. Miles sighs, hops in the 
           cart, and speeds away.

           Gary and Meredith immediately release each other.

                                 GARY
                        He was in the golf cart, wasn’t he?

           Meredith nods. They smile, up to something.

           EXT. ZUMA BEACH - MALIBU - DAY

           The sun is shining, the Pacific sparkles, and the seagulls 
           sing from high above. Gary and Meredith lie on beach towels, 
           enjoying the day. 

           Suddenly, Meredith tosses sand at Gary and races towards the 
           ocean. Gary rushes after her, picks her up, and dunks her in 
           the ocean. They laugh hysterically, and kiss lovingly.
           Miles, hiding behind an ice-box, watches the entire event -- 
           confused, shocked, and somewhat infuriated.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE - MILES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Miles, unable to work on his novel, dials a number on speaker 
           phone.

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                        (through telephone, sounding 
                        cheery)
                        Hi, you’ve reached Meredith...

                                 GARY
                        (through telephone, equally cheery) 
                        ...and Gary!

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                        (through telephone) 
                        And we’re not home right now, so 
                        please leave a message after the --

           Miles presses END. 

                                 MILES
                        Where are you, mom and dad? Where 
                        the hell are you?

           He walks out of the room, head hung low.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MILES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Miles brushes his teeth, preparing for bed, when the DOORBELL 
           RINGS. He presses the intercom.

                                 MILES
                        (into intercom, unhappy) 
                        Who is it?

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                        (through intercom) 
                        Miles, honey... it’s Mom and Dad.

                                 MILES
                        (into intercom) 
                        Hey, great! How you doing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        (screaming)
                        Go away!

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        (through intercom) 
                        C’mon, son. Open up. Just for a 
                        minute?

           Miles races down the stairwell. Now, he talks to his parents 
           through the door.

                                 MILES 
                        I can have you arrested. I have a 
                        restraining order and...

           Miles stands on his toes, and looks at his tanned, healthy-
           looking parents THROUGH THE PEEP HOLE.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        ...all I have to do is -- 

           He opens the door, staring at his parents, who hold hands 
           across the threshold.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, you look great. Did you go 
                        on vacation?

                                 GARY
                        Maui.

           Meredith elbows Gary in the ribs. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        No. We didn’t. Go anywhere. I mean.

           Meredith leans in and gives Miles a big hug. He stands there, 
           his body limp.

                                 MEREDITH
                        C’mon, honey, let us in. 

           He surrenders, and Gary and Meredith enter. They sit on the 
           couch in the large, empty living room.

                                 GARY
                        Your own regular bachelor pad, eh?

           Miles glares. Meredith prods Gary to start the conversation.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Miles, your mother and I, 
                        well we’ve missed you. It goes 
                        without saying.
                                 MILES
                        How’s the weather in Maui this time 
                        of year?

                                 GARY
                        Fabulous. From the day we got 
                        there, blue skies, sunshine, white 
                        sands beaches like you’ve never 
                        seen before, and...

           Meredith elbows Gary again.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        ...we’ve been doing a lot of 
                        thinking, son.

                                 MEREDITH
                        And it hasn’t been easy. We asked 
                        ourselves all the hard questions.

                                 GARY
                        And we’ve decided that yes, we 
                        probably have been holding you 
                        back. I mean, it goes without 
                        saying that you are not a normal 
                        child.

                                 MILES
                        That supposed to be a joke?

                                 MEREDITH
                        What he’s trying to say is that 
                        we’ve tried to nurture you and give 
                        you whatever you needed to discover 
                        and develop your talents...

                                 GARY
                        But now you feel that we’re 
                        stifling your growth, that you 
                        don’t need us...

                                 MEREDITH
                        And that we’re in your way.

           He listens attentively.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        And... we agree.

                                 MILES
                        (stunned) 
                        You what?
                                 GARY
                        We don’t want to stifle your 
                        growth. As parents, that’s the last 
                        thing we’d ever want to do. So if 
                        living away from us, from our love 
                        and guidance, helps you become the 
                        man you want to be, then we wish 
                        you the best.

                                 MILES
                        You do?

           Gary and Meredith nod, and walk towards the door.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Good-bye, Miles. 

           He shuts the door and leans against it, feeling separated 
           from his parents in a way no child ever should. 

                                 MILES
                        Good-bye, Mom and Dad.

           INT. MILES’ HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           We hear the haunting song “Let Me Fly”, by DMX.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           - Miles Calhoun, a once promising intellectual with the world 
           in his hands, has become a 13 year-old Charles Bukowski. He 
           is slumped over his laptop in his office, eyelids growing 
           heavy. 

           He sits up, inspired by an idea. He types the words: 

           Freedom, a blessing or a curse?

           Then, he passes out, hopeless.

           - Four in the morning. Pages and pages have been crumbled up 
           and thrown into the trash can. Miles types and types, prints 
           the pages, walks into the kitchen, and sets the pages aflame 
           on the oven range, finding pleasure in the blaze.

           - He eats beans. He eats Cup-O-Noodles. He stares off 
           longingly, wishing he had his mom to stir up a hot meal. 
           - Again, he tries to sleep. Struck by a perpetual loneliness, 
           he unfolds the photo of the Calhoun family in Jamaica, and 
           props it up next to his bed.

           - Now he just sits there in his sprawling master bedroom, 
           knees clenched to his chest. He can’t write. He can’t think. 
           He’s miserably alone.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. OFFICE - MILES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           His laptop screen glows. A blank page. He stares at it for a 
           moment, thinking. Finally he types:

           Freedom is a right extended to us all. However, with freedom 
           comes loneliness, reminding us that nothing is ever free.

           He stops typing.

                                 MILES
                        I can’t live like this.

           EXT. CALABASAS STREET - NIGHT

           A cab pulls to a stop in front of Miles’ house. He hands the 
           driver some cash and gets out. The cab pulls away.

           Miles stands on the lawn and inhales its scent, a child 
           standing at the foot of his childhood home.

           He thinks about knocking, and then remembers something. He 
           walks around to his bedroom window, jostles his Speech-And-
           Debate trophy from the window sill, slides it open, and drops 
           in.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           He falls down onto his warm bed, and stares up at his 
           ceiling.

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Meredith and Gary lie in bed in the darkness of night. 
           Meredith sits up, and her attention turns to the glow of 
           light coming from the hallway -- a light that peeks through 
           the bottom of Miles’ bedroom door.
           She lies back on her pillow with her hands behind her head. 
           She smiles, proudly.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I told you that would work.

                                 GARY
                        Hey, I came up with Maui.

           They share a warm smile. Then, in unison, they both roll 
           over, this time facing one another. This time, happy.

           INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

           Miles Calhoun, a scrawny thirteen year-old boy with shaggy, 
           cow-licked hair and pre-braces teeth, sits at his desk with 
           his back turned to us. His laptop sits open, glowing blank.

           He wears his trademark ill-fitting suit with a striped red, 
           clip-on tie. We hear the sounds of his fingers typing 
           rhythmically.

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        I want to thank you, Mom and Dad. 
                        Without you I would not be here and 
                        none of this would be possible. 

           He thinks, sips from a bottle of juice, then continues 
           typing.

                                 MILES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And for that, we all would have 
                        suffered.

           He turns up his laptop speakers and enjoys the sounds of 
           “Blue Monk”, the original Thelonious Monk version. WE DRIFT 
           UP, above the boy with his hands behind his head, now laying 
           comfortably on his bed. 

           He reaches over to a nearby dresser drawer and fishes out a 
           torn baby blanket. He rests it under the covers next to him, 
           closes his eyes, and falls peacefully asleep.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END.
