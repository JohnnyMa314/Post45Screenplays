           FADE IN:

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MUSIC UP. Violent music. Music for murders. 

           On TV - Air Force One lands at a Middle Eastern airport. 

           An Arab General greets the US President - the President 
           inspects troops with PRINCE MOHAMMED AL BAQTAR - the 
           President and the First Lady at a state banquet.

           The channel hops to SPORTS, TALK-SHOWS, MOVIES, PORN.

           The room is expensive corporate chic. On the king-size, two 
           MEN lie side by side. Naked.

           DUKE (late 20s), heavy-set, facial scar, and tattoos, wears a 
           square band-aid on his ankle. Rolls a joint, takes a hit.

                                 DUKE
                        Who you wanna call?

           Passes it to CALE (late 20s), lean, groomed - reading the  
           White Pages.

                                 CALE
                        Just looking.

           Cale blows perfect smoke rings up to the ceiling.

                                 DUKE
                        You freak me out with that  shit.

                                 CALE
                        Passing time.

           Duke mixes a multi-miniatures cocktail and swills it around 
           like mouthwash. Grabs the White Pages off him.

                                 DUKE
                        S A Lawrence?

                                 CALE
                        Glendale 818 449 3276 or Redwood 
                        408 557 0203?

                                 DUKE
                        I need to fuck.

           Cale takes a rubber out of a drawer and tears open the pack.

                                 CALE
                        I’m there. 
                                                                 INVADERS 2.

           The bathroom door opens. Two CUBAN GIRLS about 20 years old 
           walk in. They're naked too.

           They crawl up under the cover - their puppy fat asses 
           sticking out like coffee colored peaches.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA - OJAI - NIGHT

           A sports-car convertible powers around hairpin curves, its 
           headlights pointing the way like twin light sabers.

           On either side, the road falls away to desert and rocks and 
           the black thorny shapes of scrub plants and bushes.

           AUBRIE SUKER'S blonde hair billows out behind. This is better 
           than sex. 

           But the smile goes when she turns into Bayeux Drive.

           A DOG lies dying at the bottom of the steep road.

           She brakes and jumps out. It's a WHITE ALSATIAN. Blood stains 
           its coat and spreads over the road. 

           A WOMAN'S voice calls out from a house set back on the right. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        William? William? Come on, boy.

           Aubrie reads the disc on the dog's collar: WILLIAM.

                                 AUBRIE
                        Over here!

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 AUBRIE
                        Over here. Out on the road.

           The WOMAN comes, walking at first, then running. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh Jesus.

                                 AUBRIE
                        I didn't hit him. I swear. I turned 
                        up off Canyon and he was -

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh God, no, he's bleeding. My baby.
                                                                 INVADERS 3.

                                 AUBRIE
                        I didn't hit him. I just got here.

                                 WOMAN
                        My baby's dying. He needs help.

                                 AUBRIE
                        I live just up the way. I can -

           The woman points back toward the house  on the right.

                                 WOMAN
                        Go to my house. Please. Call the 
                        vet.

                                 AUBRIE
                        I have my cell.

                                 WOMAN
                        The number's by the phone. Under V.

           Aubrie hesitates at the gate -

                                 AUBRIE
                        He was already in the road.

           She goes up to the house. There is a black TRUCK parked on 
           the drive. Lights are on inside the house. 

           She reaches the door. It's open.

                                 AUBRIE
                        Anybody home? Hello-o.

           She can see the phone just down the hallway. She picks it up 
           and flips the book next to it open at V.

           A MAN stands in the kitchen doorway watching her. He wears a 
           black ski mask pulled halfway down his face. The facial scar 
           marks him as Duke. She's startled.

                                 DUKE
                        Put the phone down.

           The woman comes in and closes the front door behind her. This 
           is MALENA (20s). She has the Alsatian on a lead. He's 
           unharmed, and GROWLING.

           Duke puts the silencer of a pistol to Aubrie’s temple.

                                 DUKE
                        Put it down. And take off your 
                        clothes.
                                                                 INVADERS 4.

           Her eyes fix on the dog’s bared fangs. The string of saliva 
           stretching SLOW-MO to the hall carpet.

           Cale steps into the hallway from behind Duke. He wears all 
           black, and is half-masked.

                                 CALE
                        Do as he says, and you’ll live 
                        through this.

           Malena takes the dog into another room.

                                 CALE
                        You'll get invited to all the best 
                        parties to tell your harrowing 
                        tale. Just follow instructions. 
                        Take off your clothes.

           Sobbing, she strips to her underwear.

                                 CALE
                        I don't want to fuck you so put 
                        that shit out of your head. That's 
                        far enough.

           Malena returns - naked, apart from a long blonde wig. And a 
           band-aid just above her neatly trimmed pubes.

                                 CALE
                        Cut yourself shaving?

                                 MALENA
                        There are some things even I don’t 
                        show.

                                 CALE
                        I hope you’re not concealing a 
                        weapon.

                                 MALENA
                        I am a weapon.

           She takes Aubrie’s discarded clothes and slips them on. A 
           size too big, but hey, she'll be 35 too one day.

                                 CALE
                             (to Aubrie)
                        One last thing, ma'am. The shut 
                        down code?
                                                                 INVADERS 5.

           INT. 47 BAYEAUX - NIGHT

           A centerfold from a home decor magazine. Paintings from the 
           art-world's C-list. State-of-the-art HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS.

           JOHN SUKER (late 30s) is so slick he's almost a parody.

           He selects fancy crudites from the refrigerator. A monitor 
           shows CCTV views around his house. A computer tracks and 
           monitors his movements.

           EXT. 47 BAYEAUX - NIGHT

           Malena drives the sports car up to the gate, looking like 
           some Stepford clone of Aubrie. She zaps the remote, and 
           enters. Cameras capture her arrival.

           INT. 47 BAYEAUX - SAME 

           John Suker watches the gates close behind his wife's car as 
           she drives into the compound.

           When he leaves the kitchen, his wristband resets the alarm in 
           the kitchen. A zone panel shows the alarm is only off in the 
           room he moves into.

           He watches a nature documentary on a giant plasma. A pride of 
           lionesses close in on an isolated gazelle.

           Behind Suker, four BLACK-CLAD FIGURES move silently through 
           the house. They wear ski masks. Invaders.

           The alarm panel shows every zone of the house is OFF.

           A lioness leaps onto the gazelle. Duke pokes a gun into 
           Suker’s face. 

                                 DUKE
                        Don't scream, don't cry, don't 
                        breathe. Just listen.

           Cale steps into Suker’s eye-line. 

                                 CALE
                        That sensation in your ass like you 
                        no longer control your own  shit? 
                        It's normal. It will pass. 

           As he speaks, he attaches micro sensors to Suker’s key pulse 
           points.
                                                                 INVADERS 6.

                                 CALE
                        But only when our truck outside is 
                        completely full of everything 
                        inside this house. 

           He plugs the sensor wires into a palm-held device.

                                 CALE
                        When your Security Company calls, 
                        your voice will be stress 
                        monitored. You need to have an 
                        anxiety rating under three.

           He pushes Duke’s gun away from Suker’s head.

                                 CALE
                        Clear? Yes?

                                 SUKER
                        Yes.

                                 CALE
                        Good. We're communicating. The more 
                        you communicate, the longer you 
                        live.

           On TV, the lionesses tear huge ch unks of flesh from the dead 
           gazelle.

           INT. 47 BAYEAUX - LATER

           Suker practices a word. 

                                 SUKER
                        Wallaby... Wa..Wallaby.

           Cale reads his watch.

                                 SUKER
                        Wallaby ... Wallaby ... Wallaby.

                                 DUKE
                        He sounds like a pussy.

                                 CALE
                        Tell me you don't whine like that 
                        when you're dealing million dollar 
                        bonds?

                                 DUKE
                        He's going to fuck up.
                                                                 INVADERS 7.

                                 CALE
                        Mr. Suker? John? This nice white 
                        marble tile gig you got is not 
                        designed for blood. Help me keep 
                        you alive.

           Suker’s voice loses the tremble of fear, and gains a much 
           needed air of authority.

                                 SUKER
                        Wallaby ... Wallaby ... Wallaby.

           The telephone RINGS.

                                 CALE
                        Wait. After three.

           Suker picks up on Cale’s signal.

                                 SUKER
                        John Suker speaking ... It's a 
                        false alarm. Yes, my security 
                        password is wallaby. Thank you.

           On Cale’s palm-held device, the ANXIETY MONITOR gives a final 
           readout of 2.8. 

                                 CALE
                        Number nineteen is good to go.

           Suker is frog-marched through the house. He opens safes.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Aubrie bound and gagged, guarded by the Alsatian.

           EXT. BAYEAUX DRIVE - NIGHT

           A TRUCK drives through the gates to the Suker house.

           INT. 47 BAYEAUX - NIGHT

           Diamonds, jewelry, valuables are stashed in black bags. 

           Suker sobs. Two black-clad figures go past with the giant 
           plasma screen TV.

           EXT. 47 BAYEAUX - NIGHT

           Malena waits outside in the sports car. The DRIVER of the 
           TRUCK is KOVIC. 
                                                                 INVADERS 8.

           He opens the back to reveal a huge empty space with special 
           packing materials and cargo nets. The engine is running.

           The four INVADERS run from the house, laden with booty.

           Suddenly, ANOTHER TRUCK screeches across the entrance to 47 
           Bayeaux, blocking any exit.

           Red dot laser sights pinpoint their targets. 

                                 MALE VOICE
                             (over loudspeaker)
                        Put your weapons down and lay on 
                        the floor with your hands behind 
                        your heads.

           Kovic OPENS FIRE at the new Truck. The four Invaders 
           backtrack into the house.

           SILENCED bullets riddle Kovic. Malena runs to the house but 
           is SHOT DEAD.

           INT. 47 BAYEAUX 

           The Invaders burst back into the house.

           The masks come off. Cale is cool and collected. Duke is 
           boiling over. The other two men are GORAM and MAYS, a Gulf 
           War vet and an ex-Jock who never made the grade.

           The men drop duffel bags filled with stolen goods into a neat 
           row, then unload weapons from their backpacks. They have 
           fully automatic machine pistols with multi clips.

           Except for Cale. He packs zero fire-power. No gun.

           The lights go out.

                                 DUKE
                        How the fuck?

           He grabs the bound and gagged Suker. Wrenches the frightened 
           man to his feet.

           Mays and Goram check the windows.

                                 GORAM
                        They're moving in.

                                 CALE
                        Who’s moving in?
                                                                 INVADERS 9.

                                 MAYS
                        All sides.

                                 DUKE
                        He tipped them off. Is he wired?

                                 GORAM
                        I don’t see any blue lights.

                                 MAYS
                        Feds.

                                 DUKE
                        Did you check if he's wired? Did 
                        anybody look if the motherfucker's 
                        wearing a wire?

           Suker - terrified - frantically shakes his head.

                                 DUKE
                        Don't fucking move.

           Duke PISTOL-WHIPS Suker, rearranging his nose into a Picasso 
           expression.

                                 CALE
                        You're the only one wired.

                                 MAYS
                        They popped Malena in the back. 
                        She's all shot to shit.

                                 DUKE
                        Who's out there? Who? Who?

           He RIPS the tape off Suker’s mout h. The man groans.

                                 SUKER
                        Don't shoot me. Please. I didn't do 
                        anything.

                                 DUKE
                        Who the fuck is killing my people?

           He RAMS his gun into Suker’s head .

                                 CALE
                        We've got a hostage. We've got time 
                        to work this out.

                                 DUKE
                        Piece of shit.
                                                                INVADERS 10.

                                 CALE
                        No.

           Duke SHOOTS Suker.

           Silence, both of sound and movement. Cale watches the pool of 
           blood grow wider around Suker’s demolished head.

           Duke’s shoulders sag. He shrinks. His anger is gone.

                                 CALE
                        We never shot anyone before.

                                 DUKE
                        We never got shot at before.

           Goram lets loose a volley of machine-gun fire, frustration 
           more than marksmanship.

                                 DUKE
                        I done jail. I've done with it. You 
                        know I can't go down again.

           Shadows pass the windows outside. Duke throws Cale a GUN.

                                 DUKE
                        We shoot our way out.

           Cale throws the gun back.

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 DUKE
                             (to the others)
                        Are we ready?

                                 CALE
                        This is not a good plan.

           The red lines of LASER SIGHTS slice through the darkness, 
           seeking warm, breathing, targets.

                                 DUKE
                        Didn't we have the best times?

                                 CALE
                        A blast.

           Duke smiles. Then RUNS - SHOOTING, ROARING, CRASHING through 
           the floor-to-ceiling windows - glass shatters, he flies out 
           into the night.
                                                                INVADERS 11.

           BULLETS spray into the house. Cale, Goram and Mays hit the 
           deck.

           The shooting STOPS. 

                                 MALE VOICE
                             (over loudspeaker)
                        This is your final warning. Throw 
                        down your weapons. 

           Cale crawls to the window and steals a glance outside.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Put your hands behind your head and 
                        walk slowly out of the building.

           Duke lies face-down in the grass. A SWAT type guy checks his 
           vitals.

                                 SWAT
                        This one's dead.

           EXT. 47 BAYEAUX - NIGHT

           Unarmed, Cale, Goram and Mays step out, hands behind heads. 
           Arc-lights hit them. The men blink.

           SWAT figures step out of the shadows.

           POV from Cale as dark figures sur round them, guns pointed, 
           itchy fingers on light triggers.

           TWO SHOTS. Goram crumples to the ground.

           TWO MORE - and MAYS joins him in the blood and dirt.

                                 CALE
                        Wait...

           The butt of a gun SMASHES into Cale's face.

                                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 

           A peaceful, white, sanctuary.

           Cale in bed, his head bound with bandages. His shoulder 
           patched with a dressing. 

           A NURSE (20s) tends him and feeds him. There are no sounds.
                                                                INVADERS 12.

           CALE'S POV of the room:

           Fancy equipment hooked up to his arm. No window.

           The nurse is attractive and athletic. His eyes fix on her 
           every detail. She has an animal grace.

           She curls into an armchair - reading. The book is The Gold 
           Coast by Nelson De Mille.

           She has good legs. Her white court shoes are uncomfortably 
           new. There is a makeup smudge on the collar of her uniform. 

           The upside-down time on her watch is ten after three. Her 
           name-badge reads MISS L. SEWELL.

                                 CALE
                        What's the L for?

           She looks up from her book.

                                 LOUISA
                        Louisa.

                                 CALE
                        You got a cigarette?

                                 LOUISA
                        This is a hospital.

                                 CALE
                        Sure it is.

                                 LOUISA
                        I'm your nurse.

                                 CALE
                        Not in those shoes.

           She presses a RED BUTTON on the wall.

                                 LOUISA
                        How does your head feel?

                                 CALE
                        What's that?

                                 LOUISA
                        The doctors will want to do some 
                        tests now that you're awake.

                                 CALE
                        Tests?
                                                                INVADERS 13.

                                 LOUISA
                        Psyche evaluations. Memory 
                        analysis.

                                 CALE
                        You’re hot. 

                                 LOUISA
                        Is there any pain?

                                 CALE
                        You’re making my dick hard.

                                 LOUISA
                        It’s a simple question.

                                 CALE
                        And I want a simple answer.

                                 LOUISA
                        To what?

                                 CALE
                        To what flavor shit this is.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM 

           Four bare walls, a door, a table, two chairs, a mirror.

           Cale faces the mirror with a canvas bag over his head.

           INT. VIEWING ROOM - SAME 

           MADDOX (30s) watches Cale from behind the mirror. 

           He's the kind of man who seems to fill whatever space he's 
           in. He has presence. 

           People are quiet around him. Like you wouldn't shout with a 
           lion nearby.

           He lights a cigarette and exits.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM 

           Cale turns from the mirror to meet the sound of the door 
           opening. 

                                 MADDOX
                        I'm Special Agent Maddox. Your 
                        friends are dead. Goram, Mays, 
                        Kovic, Malena, and your old buddy 
                        Duke... all dead. 
                                                                INVADERS 14.

           Maddox whips the canvas bag off Cale and sits opposite.

                                 MADDOX
                        I'm sincerely not your friend. You 
                        have something I want. When I get 
                        it, you will have the rest of your 
                        life to thank God you gave it me. 

           Cale’s head bandages have gone. In their place he wears a 
           deep scar on his forehead.

                                 MADDOX
                        This is where you get to speak. 
                        Your basic Q and A. We can be done 
                        in twenty minutes. Coffee?

                                 CALE
                        I'd prefer a lawyer.

                                 MADDOX
                        You stole $129 million in art and 
                        valuables over two years. You've 
                        been smart. Sometimes very smart. I 
                        respected that. Respect this. Smart 
                        sits on my side of the table now. 
                        Colombian blend, hold the cream, 
                        one spoon of Splenda.

           A SECOND MAN brings them coffee then leaves. Maddox waits for 
           the door to close. Cale takes the offered cigarette.

                                 MADDOX
                        We smoke the same brand.

           Maddox takes out a Manila envelope, a notebook and pen.

                                 CALE
                        The guy Suker - he wasn't supposed 
                        to - it wasn't in the plan. Killing 
                        folks was never in the plan.

                                 MADDOX
                        You think I give a shit about 
                        killing folks?

           Cale tries to stare him out but concedes.

                                 MADDOX
                        I'll show you a photograph. You'll 
                        tell me what it means.

           He takes a PHOTO out of the envelope and slides it over to 
           Cale. The shot shows Malena, dead on an autopsy slab. 
                                                                INVADERS 15.

           There is a TATTOO near her crotch, where the band-aid was. 
           The tattoo is an intricate block of numbers, from 0 to 9, 
           four rows of five.

                                 CALE
                        I don't understand the question.

                                 MADDOX
                        Look closer. 20 numbers.

           He slides a second photo over. Goram on the slab, dead. And 
           again, there is the number tattoo on his back.

                                 MADDOX
                        Take your time. Different numbers.

           He slides a third photo across. Kovic. Dead. With a tattoo.

                                 CALE
                        Is it something the coroner does 
                        for kicks?

           Another photograph, Mays, dead, slab, tattoo.

                                 MADDOX
                        What does it mean?

                                 CALE
                        I don't know.

           He slides across the final photo. Duke, dead, slab, tattoo on 
           his ankle.

                                 MADDOX
                        When you tell me what it means, you 
                        can have all the things you stole.

                                 CALE
                        Everything?

                                 MADDOX
                        Except for one small item.

                                 CALE
                        What?

                                 MADDOX
                        Something worth more than $129 
                        million. Worth killing anyone who 
                        stops me getting it.

                                 CALE
                        I can't tell you.

                        Be in no confusion. If this 
                        conversation terminates now, so do 
                        you. No thirty day approval. No 
                        consultation with a lawyer. No

                                 CALE
                        I can't tell you exactly. I need 
                        more time. 48 hours.

                                 MADDOX
                        You fuck with me, you die. I can't 
                        say it any plainer.

                                 CALE
                        "Fuck with me and die." It's one 
                        word less.

           Maddox drops his cigarette in Cale’s coffee.

                                 MADDOX
                        24 hours.

           He gets up and leaves.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Louisa puts a tray of food down for Cale.

           On the plate: beef, potatoes, peas, gravy, a bread roll, 
           plastic bottle of water and a plastic cup.

           He lifts the SPORK: a cross between a knife/fork/spoon, as 
           seen in all the best penitentiary canteens.

           Cale opens the water - drains it - pushes away the tray.

                                 LOUISA
                        You haven't eaten since you woke.

                        I don't do beef.

           INT. IBP MEATPACKING FACTORY, NEBRASKA (FLASHBACK)

           The rubber work boots of a YOUNGER CALE and a SUPERVISOR walk 
           through the factory.

           JUMP CUTS as the Supervisor leads him through the different 
           processes.
                                                                INVADERS 17.

           Fatty parts and intestines line the floor. The roar of heavy 
           cutting instruments and electric knives.

                                 SUPERVISOR (O.S.)
                        Watch your step on the guts, son.

           Ankle deep in blood. The SOUND of heavy CHAINSAWS.

                                 SUPERVISOR (O.S.)
                        You wanna puke? No? Puke in your 
                        boots, you gotta puke. State 
                        Hygiene on my ass.

           The boots step out of the blood and onto a metal grid 
           walkway.

           A GUY with his back to us. He wears a white rubber overall 
           splattered with blood. He stands at the business end of a 
           cattle conveyor.

           A gate opens, a STEER walks into a narrow pen, the guy lifts 
           a heavy BOLT GUN, and shoots it in the head. Two other men 
           wrap chains around its ankles.

           The dead STEER is hoisted up onto a high level track along 
           where it dangles onwards into the bowels of the factory to 
           emerge later that day as ground beef. The whole process takes 
           eight seconds.

           The guy raises the BOLT GUN. Looks over his shoulder. It's a 
           younger Duke.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        This is the new guy.

                                 DUKE

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Cale wears white T-shirt and sweatpants. He has a SOFT 
           CRAYON. 

           A FLASH FRAME of the NUMBER TATTOO on Duke’s ankle.

           He draws the two lines of 10 numbers, l arge, on the wall.

           FLASH FRAME of the number tattoo on Malena’s crotch.

           He draws them out underneath.

           FLASH FRAMES of Goram, Mays, and Kovic.

           Now the number grid he’s drawing is complete. Ten rows of ten 
           numbers.

           Louisa works on a CROSSWORD PUZZLE. At first, she doesn't 
           take much notice. Then she  realizes -

                                 LOUISA
                        You're doing that from memory?

                                 CALE
                        I know.

                                 LOUISA
                        How?

                                 CALE
                        It's a curse. I never forget a 
                        number. Faces change. Numbers stay 
                        the same.

                        A nervous day on Wall street saw 
                        the Dow Jones close 34 points down.

           Cale, sat at the edge of the bed, stares at the number grid.

           INT. VIEWING ROOM 

           Maddox watches Cale via CCTV. Another MAN is with Maddox.

                                 MADDOX
                        He's putting on a show. He knows 
                        what the numbers mean. He's not 
                        even looking at them. He's looking 
                        past them. Thinks he's ahead of the 
                        game. The arrogance is astonishing.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 

           Cale walking around the room now - but with his EYES CLOSED.

           His feet, pigeon-stepping from one wall to another. Stubbing 
           his toes. Adjusting his steps. Counting to himself.

           Louisa notes his odd behavior.

                                 CALE
                        You got a boyfriend? Forget I 
                        asked. That was rude. Of course 
                        not. You work double shifts.

           He stubs his toe on a wall. Takes a pigeon step back.

                                 LOUISA
                        My private life is what it is. Why 
                        are you walking around with your 
                        eyes shut?

                                 CALE

                        Just sit tight till we say you can 
                        leave.

                                 CALE
                        What's to stop me leaving right 
                        now?

                                 LOUISA
                        Everything.

           He makes a sudden move for the door.

           She bars his way.

           He moves to push her aside, but she deflects his arm, 
           unbalances him, and PITCHES HIM on his ass with some martial 
           arts moves.

           He wipes a speck of blood off his nose. 

           A beat, then...

                                 CALE
                        Ninja nurse. Cool.

           She helps him to his feet. They stand toe to toe. Their eyes 
           connect. She breaks the brief spell and turns back to her 
           seat. Though nothing happened, something did.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Cale sleeps.

           A new MINDER sits across the room. Male, massive, mean 
           looking. Cale greets the new face without really stirring.

                        brain bounced around. Inside his 
                        skull. He don't remember nothing. 
                        Not his name. Or what had happened. 
                        I feed him. He forgets what he's 
                        chewing. Spits it out. Puts it in 
                        his pocket. For later. 'case he 
                        remembers. Only he never does.

                        Good night, James.

           James checks his watch.

           8 hours go by.

           BOLTS slide in the door. Louisa replaces James. Cale opens an 
           eye ever so slightly.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Louisa concentrates on her crossword. Cale isn't in the room. 
           She glances over to the door-less entrance to the bathroom.

                                 CALE (O.S.)
                        How much does a nurse make? 15? 25?

                        more. Maybe 35.

           Cale does pull-ups in the doorway between the bedroom and the 
           bathroom.

           A slight crack appears between the wall and the ceiling above 
           the doorway where he exercises.

                                 CALE
                        Maybe money is no object. Maybe 
                        you're Maddox's bitch. Is he

           Looks to the CCTV camera in the corner of the room.

                        Does he like to watch you with 
                        other men?

           POV FROM THE CCTV CAMERA as Cale reaches up to inspect it.

                        This isn't good. Who installed 
                        this?

           He stands under the camera. It whirs to point downwards but 
           can't angle to see him.

                                 CALE

                        security. And no monthly fee.

           When she turns to him with the hint of a smile, he mouths the 
           word HELP.

           Her smile disappears. She glances at the RED BUTTON on the 
           wall. Then reconsiders. She hands him her crossword and pen.

                                 LOUISA
                        Help me.

           He steps back to the bed, and sits down. But he's not 
           relaxing. No. Every fiber of his body is keened for signals.

           A nod from Cale. He continues with the crossword.

                        And how to get out of this room?

           He shakes his head.

                        No. Two is what's a lady like you 
                        doing baby-sitting me? Shouldn't 
                        you be working in PR, or producing

                        I've already figured it out. It

                        Your every move is being watched. 
                        The door and casing are metal. The 
                        lock bolts the sides and 4 corners.

           He hands her the crossword back, and stands by the door.

                                 LOUISA

                        weakness.

           He puts the metal PEN into the LOCK, jams it in, and snaps it 
           off. The LOCK is now BLOCKED.

                        Cancun.

           He jumps over the bed and into the bathroom.

           Louisa tries to dislodge the broken pen from the lock.

                                 LOUISA

           The SOUND of something being wrenched off the wall in the 
           bathroom. Cale steps out with a TOWEL RAIL in his hand.

                                 LOUISA
                        Don't make me have to hurt you.

           He twirls the thick steel rod around like a NINJA with 
           NUNCHAKUS.

           Louisa adopts a defensive stance but doesn't close to combat 
           him. The BED is between them.

                                 CALE

           The SOUND of banging on the DOOR. The handle being tried and 
           tried again.

                                 LOUISA

           He ducks back into the bathroom.

           INT. CRAWLSPACE 

           Infra-red CCTV footage of Cale breaking through the ceiling 
           of the "HOSPITAL BATHROOM" and into a low, roof space lined 
           with heating ducts, pipes, wiring, and beams.

                        Good. False ceiling. The only 
                        possible exit route. 

           The CCTV footage now winds through at FAST FORWARD. Cale 
           dropping into a maintenance corridor. 

                                 MADDOX (O.S.)
                        Well executed. But stupid. Now I 
                        know to keep two eyes open for you.

           There's an EXIT door. Cale bursts out into...

           An INDUSTRIAL UNIT - like a huge aircraft HANGAR. The HANGAR 
           has a block-built building in the center - his HOSPITAL.
                                                                INVADERS 26.

           ARC-LIGHTS flood on Cale. He's dazzled - blinded.

           EXT. ROAD - VAN - NIGHT

           A dark VAN with blacked out windows exits an INDUSTRIAL AREA 
           and heads toward a local AIRFIELD.

           In the distance, beyond a chain-link fence, there are small 
           planes and private jets.

           INT. VAN (MOVING) 

           Maddox rides in back with Cale and James.

                        This is a $900 suit and blood is 
                        not an easy stain to remove.

           They stare at each other. Again, it's Cale who backs down.

                                 CALE
                        I don't have my passport.

           EXT. HANGAR - SAME 

           Louisa follows the van through BINOCULARS.

           All around, a TEAM OF MEN dismantle the interior - the area 
           Cale was held, the prefab offices, the comms networks.

           INSERT SHOT: of the van pulling up next to an EXECUTIVE JET. 
           James, Cale and Maddox board the plane.

           Louisa goes into...

           INT. OFFICE 

           She closes the door, checks no-one is watching.

           She takes a piece of paper out of her pocket and unfolds it.
                                                                INVADERS 27.

           It's the CROSSWORD puzzle she was working on with Cale.

           Cale has filled in one of the long clues. Only, he hasn't 
           inserted a word. He's written a number. A PHONE number.

           She deliberates a moment, then DIALS.

           EXT. MODULAR HOME - SOUTH CAROLINA - NIGHT

           A white ENGLISH BULL TERRIER sleeps chained on the porch. The 
           SOUND of a phone RINGING inside.

           INT. MODULAR HOME 

           DIP TAYLOR (50s), sits in his La-Z-Boy sipping beer and 
           watching sports on cable. Despite the gray hair and lined 
           face, he retains a solid physique. Powerful arms.

           Twenty years ago he could have put you down with one punch. 
           Now, he'd need two. Maybe.

           He doesn't turn from the screen - just reaches over to the 
           table by his chair and grabs the phone.

                                 DIP

                        Dip Taylor.

           The phone CONTINUES TO RING. He looks at it - odd.

           Then realizes...

           It’s SECOND PHONE on the table.

           Dip picks it up. A beat then...

                                 DIP

           Stone silence from Dip.

                        I'm calling from a Al's Pizza in 
                        Columbus. A diner left his wallet 
                        on the table. I found this number

           INT. MODULAR HOME - SAME 

           Dip lifts himself out of the La-Z-boy and into a WHEELCHAIR. 
           He rides it to his bedroom and -

           Fills a duffel bag with clothes and money from a SAFE, then 
           grabs a heavily laden BUILDER'S TOOL BAG from a closet.

           EXT. MODULAR HOME - NIGHT 

           Dip loads it all into his pickup, takes a can of gas off the 
           bed, empties it inside the house, lights a cigarette, takes 
           one drag, then tosses it onto the gas-soaked carpet. 

           WHOOSH - fire in the hole.

           Dip unchains the dog. They get in the pickup - Dip sliding 
           across from wheelchair to driver’s seat, then folding the 
           chair and stowing it behind. The car is specially adapted to 
           help him.

           He guns the engine as the flames take a grip on his home. 

           He tunes the radio to a rock station and drives away without 
           a solitary glance back.

           A WOMAN - she's drunk and asleep on a sofa. Curtains are 
           closed. A shaft of sunlight hits a table lined with empty

                        for Mickey's and crinkle-cut cock.

           Jeb fucking the woman. Paying her. George Washington smiles 
           up from a dollar bill. Leaving her to sleep off her booze 
           while he opens new toys with the Kid.

                        the boy. But all on the QT.

           Jeb drives into a near empty park ing lot. Woman gets out of a 
           SEDAN to meet him. Wants to see his ID. Jeb and Kid reunited. 
           Jeb introduced to Misters SMITH a nd WESSON.

           Malena, Goram, Mays, Kovic, Cale, Duke, and Dip gather around 
           a table, eating the contents of the snack cupboard.

                                 GORAM
                        How come Cale gets the cipher?

                        sequence.

           Then fills the rest of the squares in with any old letter. 
           Long Beach disappears into the alphabet soup.

                                 DIP
                        He puts it together, cracks the 
                        code. 

           The letters become numbers. The numbers swap places in the

           There’s a PERIMETER MONITOR sat on the table. The screen

           They pull on SKI MASKS and take WEAPONS out of concealed 
           bags. They march past the BOUND and GAGGED figures of a

           EXT. MONTREAL, CITY - DAY

           A black SEDAN pulls out into traffic. Behind it is a SEMI-

           The street sign points to PORT DE MONTREAL.

           The Black Sedan crosses the bridge.

           Maddox completes the SECURITY docket.

           Raised high above the port on stilts, the office is the 
           epitome of poor working conditions. Steamed up windows, smoke 
           filled rooms.

           Two secretaries, two shipping clerks, SUB-STOCKMASTER 
           GUILLAUME - a gangly man in half-mast trousers. And ARNAUD - 
           the STOCK-MASTER for the Contrecouer section.

           Arnaud is from a long line of short burly French-Canadians. 
           He only takes a Gitanes out to swig from a coffee cup.

           Maddox and Cale enter. Cale approaches the desk and speaks to 
           Guillaume.

                        I need to collect a container.

                        No.

           Guillaume looks over to Arnaud, helpless. Arnaud sighs, folds 
           his newspaper, and weighs up the new idiots.

                                 ARNAUD
                        You got a Reference Number? An RF?

                        He's only fluent in shit and pain.

                                 ARNAUD
                        Like he's going to cut your dick 
                        off and fuck your ass with it.

                                 CALE
                        Good. I need to make a call for the 
                        RF. A call he can't listen in on.

           Arnaud opens the door in the counter. Cale moves through the 
           desks to a glass walled office at the back. Closes the door 
           behind him. Picks up the phone, winks at Maddox, then turns 
           his back on him.

           INT. RENTED OFFICE - DAY

                                                                INVADERS 37.

                                 CALE
                        I need the first RF.

                                 DIP
                        Zip that pecker, son. I need 
                        answers.

                                 CALE
                        I've only got questions.

                                 DIP
                        You've seen the sequence?

                                 CALE
                        On bodies. With bullet-holes. It 
                        took me to Montreal. Alone. The 
                        team is dead. FBI, I’m guessing. 

                                 DIP
                        You're with the sons-of-bitches 
                        now, right?

                                 CALE
                        Right.

           Dip takes the LITTLE GREEN BOOK out of his shirt pocket, and 
           flips to a page.

                                 DIP
                        What do they want?

                                 CALE
                        One item. Won't say what. Won't say 
                        who we took it from.

                                 DIP
                        And if they get what it is they 
                        want?

                                 CALE
                        The rest is ours to split.

                                 DIP
                        And if I hang up?

                                 CALE
                        Make sure they play Happy Trails by 
                        Van Halen at my funeral.

                                 DIP
                        You start down this road, you don't 
                        know where it's going to end.
                                                                INVADERS 38.

                                 CALE
                        I've started. And there's only two 
                        places I'm heading. Dead, or rich.

                                 DIP
                        Maybe I'll just come and get that 
                        box myself.

                                 CALE
                        You know you can't leave US soil. 

                                 DIP
                        It was a good plan.

                                 CALE
                        We ain't done yet.

                                 DIP
                        GSU 489/071/403923. Harbour taxes  
                        paid. Look on the inside left door.

                                 CALE
                        Got it. One more thing.

                                 DIP
                        Yeah?

                                 CALE
                        Water my plants.

           In the LITTLE GREEN BOOK - Dip's finger flicks through pages 
           of code. He rests on a spread - one page entitled DELETE, the 
           other SAVE.

           There are six names listed under DELETE: Duke, Mays, Goram, 
           Malena, Kovic and Cale. Each name has a phrase next to it 
           such as "I need a box of Winston" or "I need a box of 
           Marlboro."

           Three names are listed under SAVE. Mom, Dad, Adrienne. Again, 
           each has a phrase next to it, such as "Feed the dog," "Cut 
           the lawn" or next to Adrienne - "Water the plants."

           EXT. CONTRECOUER CONTAINERS - DAY

           A crane lifts a CONTAINER onto the trailer bed of the Semi-
           Truck.

           INT. SEDAN (MOVING) - DAY

           Cale watches Montreal go by out his window. Maddox is on the 
           phone. He uses a headset.
                                                                INVADERS 39.

                                 MADDOX
                             (into headset mike)
                        Do you speak French? Get on the 
                        next flight.

           He ends the call.

                                 CALE
                        Louisa?

           Maddox doesn't answer, just fixes him with a stare.

                                 MADDOX
                        You pull one more stunt - I pull 
                        the trigger on your sister.

           EXT. YELLOW-PAINTED HOUSE - DAY

           A modest rancher with its neat front yard and an old Pinto on 
           the drive. A child's bike leans against the porch.

           A line of cars adorns each  curb.

           Dip doesn't slow his pickup as he drives by.

           HIS POV: as he passes a PARKED CAR where TWO SUITS sit 
           waiting, watching.

           Dip drives on, turns at the top of the road, then motors back 
           down. He pulls into the space in front of the PARKED CAR, 
           blocking it in.

           The DRIVER leans out of his window, pissed.

                                 DRIVER
                        Hey, buddy, you're blocking the 
                        car.

           Dip holds up one finger to indicate he'll be one minute. He 
           unloads his wheelchair, swings in, grabs the tool bag.

           Wheels up to the side of the car.

                                 DIP
                        Did you not see the disabled access 
                        only painted on the road? Or are 
                        you just a pair of fag cocksuckers?

                                 DRIVER
                        This isn’t zoned disabled.

                                 DIP
                        Let me get you something -
                                                                INVADERS 40.

           But Dip reached into his tool bag, and already has a 
           SUPPRESSED MACHINE-PISTOL in hand. 

           Point blank, he SHOOTS the men so full of holes they could be 
           Swiss cheese. If it was red.

           He leans in, frisks the nearest corpse for ID.

           Finds an FBI BADGE. He pockets it, stows the tool bag, and 
           wheels over to the yellow painted house.

           A twenty-something woman answers the doorbell. She's pretty, 
           but unmade up. This is ADRIENNE.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Dip?

                                 DIP
                        Cale sent me. Get little Freddie. 
                        We're leaving. Now.

           HER POV: on the GUN held casually on his lap. He's looking 
           down the road. The blood spattering his face and forearm.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (calling into the house)
                        Freddie, come here, baby.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE, MONTREAL - LATER

           The Semi-Truck is backed into the empty warehouse. James 
           closes the shutters.

           INT. WAREHOUSE, MONTREAL 

           Maddox puts on overalls and slides a ramp up to the back of 
           the container.

           Cale sits on an oil drum, waiting.

           Pigeons flutter in the rafters. Rain drips through the roof. 
           A car on blocks. An office up steps. Faded centerfolds dot 
           the walls.

           The security tags on the container doors are clean and 
           untampered with. There’s a heavy padlock on each door.

           Maddox crowbars them off, snips the security tags, and swings 
           the doors open to reveal...

           An ENVELOPE taped to the back of the left-hand door. 
           Addressed to Cale. Maddox opens it. 
                                                                INVADERS 41.

           Inside - a 10 x 10 number grid.

           Maddox slips it into his pocket.

           INT. WAREHOUSE, MONTREAL - LATER

           The four men have unpacked half of the container. 

           The warehouse floor is covered with high end electrical 
           equipment, gym gear, couture dresses, carpets, antiques, 
           paintings, and sealed packing crates.

           Cale brings the last box out.

           Maddox has a box cutter knife. Slices boxes open.

           CDs are scattered across the floo r.

           Chinese vases smashed.

           Small paintings skimmed against the warehouse wall.

           Sculptures trashed in puddles.

           Items being tossed aside - jewelry, photo albums, cameras.

           Cale watches the destruction of his stolen goods.

                                 MADDOX
                        It's not here. Why would that be?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MADDOX
                        You're trying to fuck with me 
                        again. I shit you not, you would 
                        rather stick your dick in a bacon 
                        slicer than me.

                                 CALE
                        I just steal the goods. Dip packs 
                        and ships them.

                                 MADDOX
                        What's this?

           He holds up the piece of paper with the number grid.

                                 CALE
                        Top of my head - another container.
                                                                INVADERS 42.

                                 MADDOX
                        How many containers?

                                 CALE
                        Ask Dip.

           Maddox gets a call on his cellphone.

                                 MADDOX
                        Yeah?
                             (listens; then into phone)
                        Both of them?

           He ends the call. His hand tightens around the box cutter.

                                 MADDOX
                        Your Fairy Godmother just sprinkled 
                        Pixie Dust over two of my men.
                             (to James and Driver)
                        Hold him.

           The two burly men lift Cale off his feet. 

           Maddox goes behind and takes one of Cale’s feet like a cowboy 
           would hold a horse's hoof.

           He slices off the laces, tears off the shoe, and peels down 
           the sock.

                                 MADDOX
                        You've led me on a merry dance. Be 
                        under no illusion - your disco days 
                        are over.

           He uses the box cutter knife TO SLICE a large X into the sole 
           of Cale’s foot, from toes to heel.

           Cale bites on the agony.

           James and the Driver drop him. He crumples onto the wet floor 
           and reaches down to his slashed foot. The concrete becomes 
           slick with his blood.

                                 MADDOX
                        Take him to the motel. I haven't 
                        finished.

           EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           Low key, low rent.
                                                                INVADERS 43.

           INT. MOTEL BEDROOM 

           A BANDAGED foot. The bandage is blood-soaked. A woman's hand 
           unwinds it.

           Cale lies on his back in the bathroom with one leg raised 
           straight up. Louisa stands over him, inspecting the foot.

           The bandage is off. The deep gouged X looks ragged and 
           rancid. Dry blood, bruising, fresh blood.

                                 LOUISA
                        This will hurt.

           She pours hydrogen peroxide over the wound. It FIZZES as it 
           touches raw flesh, and froths as it kills infection.

                                 CALE
                        Jesus...

           She sprays iodine on, staining it brown.

           Louisa kneels by the bath with bottles of ointments and 
           dressings.

                                 CALE
                        Your boss has a problem with anger.

                                 LOUISA
                        This will need stitching.

           She goes into the bedroom.

                                 LOUISA (O.S.)
                        Two of his men died.

                                 CALE
                        Hey, it’s a start.

                                 LOUISA (O.S.)
                        He wasn't expecting a second 
                        container.

           She returns with catgut and needle. 

                                 LOUISA
                        I’m not good at this.

                                 CALE
                        I know. Your bedside manner sucks.

                                 LOUISA
                        You’ll have a scar.
                                                                INVADERS 44.

                                 CALE
                        I could’ve been a contender.

           She closes the wound with stitche s. He winces.

                                 LOUISA
                        Sorry.

                                 CALE
                        What's he looking for?

                                 LOUISA
                        That's not your concern.

                                 CALE
                        He smashed up half my take. It's in 
                        my financial interest to help.

           She pads the injury with cotton wool and straps it with a 
           support bandage.

                                 LOUISA
                        Don't put any weight on it for 12 
                        hours. You'll live.

                                 CALE
                        I'm not counting on it.

           She helps him up onto his good foot. He has to lean on her 
           for support. Maybe too much. But she isn't pulling away.

                                 LOUISA
                        Do you remember everything you've 
                        stolen?

                                 CALE
                        Not unless it was a bunch of 
                        numbers.

                                 LOUISA
                        It's a box. Black metal. 

                                 CALE
                        Nope.

                                 LOUISA
                        About the size of a laptop. 

                                 CALE
                        What's inside?

                                 LOUISA
                        I don't know.
                                                                INVADERS 45.

                                 CALE
                        Sure. Oh, you dropped an earring.

           She blushes. Touches her bare ear.

           INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cale rests on the bed with a heavily bandaged foot.

           Maddox and Louisa sit to one side, watching him.

           Cale looks at the paper with the number sequence.

                                 CALE
                        I know where this is. Thailand. A 
                        village called Fuck You. It's fake 
                        code.

           Maddox hands over the real sheet of paper, with the real 
           sequence. 

                                 CALE
                        Your blind date is a trip to 
                        France.

                                 MADDOX
                        France is a big country.

                                 CALE
                        If I get there alive, I'll narrow 
                        it down.

           Maddox and Louisa get up to leave.

                                 LOUISA
                        Walk before morning, the stitches 
                        will split. Run, you'll bleed to 
                        death.

                                 MADDOX
                        There's no crawlspace. There’s a 
                        man outside your door and window.

           There’s a TELEPHONE by his bed. Maddox and Louisa are by the 
           door.

                                 CALE
                        You forgot something.

           He snatches up the phone, rips out the cable, and throws it 
           into the wall across the room. It SMASHES into fifty pieces.
                                                                INVADERS 46.

                                 CALE
                        Pick up your bug on your way out.

           On the debris of wires and electronics from the smashed phone 
           on the floor -

           Maddox fixes him with a stare that would freeze steam, then 
           locks the door behind him.

           INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - LATER

           Cale hops over and retrieves the TELEPHONE PIECES.

           INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - LATER

           Cale sits with the covers draped over his head like a teenage 
           tent. He has the bedside lamp under there for light, and all 
           the components from the phone spread out.

           He picks out a BUG.

           Then reconstructs a telephone device from the broken parts.

           He plugs it into the wall socket. And touches the number 
           zones on the mother board with a PAPER CLIP.

           INT. RENTED OFFICE - DAY

           A dark box room. One table, one fancy looking digital phone 
           on the table. Two rings then a message plays...

                                 PHONE (V.O.)
                        One to record. Two to forward.

           The SOUND of one BEEP.

           EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           A 737 heads toward the dawn.

           INT. CUSTOMS, FRANCE - DAY

           Maddox approaches the immigration desk with 4 passports.

           Behind him, James and Louisa flank Cale.

           A nod from the OFFICIAL waves them through.

           Maddox carries a HEAVY BLACK BAG. It has DIPLOMAT stencilled 
           on it in several languages. And a FLAG with a CRESCENT MOON.
                                                                INVADERS 47.

           EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

           An MPV powers down the autoroute from Charles De Gaulle.

           A RIG pulling an empty flat-bed trailer swings in behind 
           them. The DRIVER flashes his headlights. 

           EXT. HARBOR, LE HAVRE, FRANCE - DAY

           The MPV leads the Rig along the docks.

           INT. MPV (MOVING) 

           Maddox, Louisa, James driving, and Cale. Maddox on his cell 
           phone.

                                 MADDOX
                             (into phone)
                        Sequence two spells out Le Havre. 

           He hangs up. Hands the phone to Cale.

                                 MADDOX
                        Get the container RF. 

                                 CALE
                        Good to see you working on your 
                        sense of humor.

           Cale takes the phone.

                                 CALE
                        Pull over. You can listen, but you 
                        can't look.

           EXT. AUTOROUTE - DAY

           The MPV pulls over. Cale gets out. Maddox follows close 
           behind.

           Cale scrolls through the cell phone settings.

           All names in the SIM are retained by just their initials. AT, 
           AV, BB, BL, BM, CF, DK, DP etc. He finds LS and brings up the 
           number on screen.

                                 MADDOX
                        What are you doing?

                                 CALE
                        I forgot the international code.
                                                                INVADERS 48.

                                 MADDOX
                        Zero zero one.

           Cale calls.

                                 CALE
                        I'll need to delete this number 
                        afterwards. You understand that?

                                 MADDOX
                        You understand I'll be able to 
                        trace it in an hour anyway.

                                 CALE
                        You understand he won't be at this 
                        number then.

           EXT. COMMERCIAL OFFICE, LE HAVRE DOCKS - DAY

           Cale, Maddox and James wait by the MPV.

           THREE ALGERIAN-LOOKING MEN wait by the Rig.

           Louisa comes out of the office with a sheet of paper.

                                 LOUISA
                        A crane operator will meet us over 
                        there. 

           EXT. LE HAVRE CONTAINERS - LATER

           The Container is guided onto the Rig’s flat-bed.

           The MPV and Rig crawl through a city of containers, like a 
           Manhattan of metal.

           INT. MPV (MOVING) - DAY

           MADDOX'S POV down an aisle. A BLUE CAR keeps pace with them.

           Maddox has the Diplomatic Bag at his feet. He reaches in and 
           takes out three semi-automatic pistols, handing one  to James 
           and Louisa.

           Louisa reading her sheet of paper - a map of the depot.

                                 LOUISA
                        Next right.

           James makes the turn. The Rig follows.
                                                                INVADERS 49.

                                 CALE
                        What have I got that you want? The 
                        launch codes to our nukes? Secret 
                        formula for Coke?

                                 MADDOX
                        You're sweating.

           James just catches a GLIMPSE OF ORANGE as he passes  a side 
           aisle. Then...

           WHAM!

           A fork-lift truck SLAMS into the MPV at speed. The FORKS 
           puncture the door, one piercing James' gut just above his 
           belt, the other smashing into the engine block.

           James spews BLOOD as he empties his GUN at the driver of the 
           fork-lift - killing him.

           Maddox spills out of the MPV. Louisa drags Cale clear.

           The Algerians in the Rig jump down. Each is armed.

           Above everyone, a CRANE swings a CONTAINER. Suddenly...

           Silence.

           James is in several shades of deepest pain. Maddox puts an 
           end to the giant's suffering with a HEAD SHOT.

           The Algerians scan the depot but nothing moves, save the 
           crane and the seagulls.

           Then, three ENGINES. Revving fast. Speeding closer. SQUEALING 
           tires. Echoes pinging off high metal walls.

           Louisa jams her gun into the back of Cale's neck.

                                 MADDOX
                        He moves? Kill him.

           Louisa prods Cale into the Rig. The Algerians spread out.

           MADDOX'S POV as the blur of a RED CAR streaks past.

           An Algerian steps out into the aisle - a car approaching 
           fast, but from where? The SOUND comes from everywhere.

           SCREECH. A WHITE CAR spins out - searching for grip, finding 
           it, and delivering 350hp toward the Algerian. 

           SLAMS into him.
                                                                INVADERS 50.

           TWO HANDGUNS blaze as Maddox empties his clips into the 
           occupants. He reloads on the run.

           A blazing gun battle now between the red, white and blue cars 
           and Maddox’s team. Bullets fly, sparks fly, car parts fly, 
           debris flies, CRASH, BANG, WHAM, BLAM thank you, ma’am.

           Louisa prods Cale into the driving seat of the Rig. 

                                 LOUISA
                        Drive.

           Cale fires it up and CRUNCHES into GEAR.

           The Rig lurches forward. A BLUE CAR burns past.

           Algerians 2 & 3 are hunkered down, taking pot shots at the 
           fleeting glimpses of BLUE and RED speeding by.

           Maddox sees the Rig pull away. He calls to the Algerians to 
           follow him after it.

           There’s another CONTAINER swinging from the CRANE ARM as they 
           pass beneath. The cables are released.

           It crashes down. At the last millisecond - Cale swerves hard.

           Maddox and Algerian #2 grab onto the back.

           Cale floors the gas. A long clear straight. The RED and BLUE 
           cars dead ahead. They hit reverse. 

           Chased down the aisle, they hand-brake turn into safe alcoves 
           as the Rig THUNDERS PAST. Then surge into pursuit.

           The Rig scrapes along metal container walls, SPARKS, drums 
           and packing crates crushed.

           Maddox hangs on with one hand and shoots. Bullets pepper the 
           windshield of the BLUE car. The OCCUPANTS return fire.

           Algerian #2 is HIT. He falls on the hood of the RED CAR, and 
           SMASHES through the windshield.

           Maddox skirts around the SIDE of the Rig’s container. Cale 
           edges toward a wall to try and scrape him off.

           A mountain of containers dead ahead. Maddox is almost at the 
           Rig door. Louisa leans out of the window to help.

           Cale reaches across and grabs her gun hand. A volley of 
           bullets SHOOT UP the interior. 
                                                                INVADERS 51.

           Cale abandons the wheel and grapples for the gun. The Rig 
           lurches out of control, almost wiping Maddox off the side. 

           The gun falls onto the floorboard. 

           The Rig hurtles straight for a wall of CONTAINERS. 100 meters 
           and closing.

           Louisa looks from the wall of containers, down to the gun, 
           and back up to Cale. 75 meters.

           Cale smiles. 50 meters. She pushes him aside and steers to 
           safety. He gets the GUN.

                                 CALE
                        Pull over.

           She stops at the EXIT while the barrier is lifted. Maddox, 
           outnumbered, is bundled into the BLUE CAR. 

           A FRENCH GUY with a gun climbs up  into the Rig and pushes 
           Louisa across toward Cale.

                                 LOUISA
                        You don't know what you're getting 
                        into.

                                 CALE
                        Let's find out.

           EXT. HARBOR, LE HAVRE, FRANCE - DAY

           Algerian #3 enters a CALL-BOX by the docks.

                                 ALGERIAN #3
                             (in Arabic; subtitled)
                        The American has the container. 
                        Send a recovery team.

           EXT. CHATEAU - DAY

           The Rig and BLUE CAR pull into the courtyard of a fine old 
           Chateau. Solid oak gates are closed behind them.

           THE FRENCHMAN (50s) waits on the Chateau steps. He wears a 
           dressing gown over pyjamas. His long hair tied back, an 
           imposing man. 

           He has an army of toy dogs YAPPING around his slippers. Where 
           he goes, they go, like a living carpet.
                                                                INVADERS 52.

           Cale leads Louisa down from the Rig at gunpoint. Maddox is 
           hauled out of the blue car. They have their hands secured 
           with plastic wrist cuffs.

           Cale pops the combination locks on the container. Levers the 
           door and retrieves the ENVELOPE pinned to the back of it. 
           Inside - a new number sequence.

           The Frenchman signals his men to unload the container.

           Louisa and Maddox are pushed down onto their knees on the 
           gravel courtyard.

           Cale slips the number sequence into his pocket.

           Louisa watches. Her blank face is impossible to read. 

           The Frenchman ushers Cale inside.

           INT. CHATEAU, PARLOUR - DAY

           Controlled decay. Tiled floors, 17th C furniture. Part home, 
           part antique store.

           The Frenchman lounges on an overstuffed sofa.

           A dour MAID pours coffee. The Frenchman feeds himself and his 
           dogs with pieces of dunked croissant as he speaks.

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        Dip and I go back. La Legion. We 
                        take all the container as payment, 
                        and give you $50,000.

                                 CALE
                        Is that what's agreed?

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        It's what will be.

           The GIRLFRIEND of The Frenchman walks through, also in her 
           dressing gown. They don't speak or look at each other as she 
           passes - merely touch with outstretched fingers.

                                 CALE
                        You lost some men back there.

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        For their mothers, they have been 
                        dead a long time. For the others, 
                        the cut is bigger.
                                                                INVADERS 53.

           INT. CHATEAU, LIBRARY 

           Cale in a room lined with leather-bound books. There are 
           photographs from The Frenchman'S Foreign Legion days. On one, 
           Cale can make out the young Dip.

           He has a view of the courtyard through the window. 

           Maddox and Louisa are still on their knees, heads bowed. One 
           guy stands guard over them.

           EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Louisa and Maddox still kneel in the courtyard with their 
           heads bowed. It's RAINING. They're soaked. Their guard stands 
           behind them, gun in one hand, umbrella in the other.

           INT. CHATEAU, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale sets up a pair of NAUTILUS SPEAKERS, linked to the 
           world's greatest MUSIC SYSTEM.

                                 CALE
                        The rich - they eat better, breathe 
                        better, fuck better women, and this 
                        is the nut. 

           The Frenchman and his Girlfriend recline on a chaise lounge. 
           Behind, the remains of a fine meal on a dining table.

                                 CALE
                        You play this CD on my home stereo, 
                        you hear the music. On theirs, you 
                        hear the musician.

           The CD slides in. The music PLAYS. Like you're on stage. 
           Glasses dance on the table. Cale takes his outside.

           EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

           Cale crouches in front of Maddox and Louisa, lights two 
           cigarettes, and puts one in Maddox's mouth.

                                 CALE
                        We smoke the same brand.

           The music booms out of the CHATEAU.

                                 CALE
                        If it's any consolation, your black 
                        box isn't in this container either.

           Maddox glances at Louisa.
                                                                INVADERS 54.

                                 CALE
                        This kneeling down gig doesn't stop 
                        ‘til morning. That's when Le Fumer 
                        arrives. He runs a smokehouse. 
                        Slices thin strips of meat and fish 
                        and cooks them over juniper coals. 
                        He has special knives. When the 
                        time comes, it's OK to scream. 
                        Better still, talk. Even better 
                        still, talk now. What's in the box?

           Maddox blanks him. Louisa mouths the word HELP.

           EXT. CHATEAU - MORNING

           Maddox and Louisa are still kneeling, though shaking with 
           cold and exhaustion. The rain has stopped.

           The Rig has gone. A table has been set up before them.

           LE FUMER is a small, precise man. He wears a white apron over 
           a three piece suit.

           The Frenchman sips coffee and smokes. Cale eats a cream 
           cheese bagel with slices of smoked salmon.

           Le Fumer lays out his array of knives. You don't even want to 
           be in the same time zone as these things.

                                 CALE
                        What's in the box?

           Le Fumer sets a tray of smouldering coals in front of Maddox. 
           Over it, he stands a rack, like a clothes horse.

                                 CALE
                        OK. Take up his sleeve.

           The GUARD moves to cut Maddox's jacket sleeve off. But...

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        No. He won't talk. He'd enjoy it. 
                        Do her.

                                 CALE
                        She doesn't know anything.

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        She knows pain.

           The Guard moves behind Louisa. He cuts off her SLEEVE at the 
           shoulder, and rips it off her now bare arm.
                                                                INVADERS 55.

                                 CALE
                               (to Maddox)
                        You’re a sick bastard if you let 
                        him do this.

           Le Fumer selects an implement like a vegetable peeler. The 
           cold steel rests against her trembling flesh.

           The Girlfriend of The Frenchman walks up behind Louisa. The 
           Guard steps forward to hold Louisa still.

           A SCREAM rises and scatters the birds from trees all around.

           A sliver of FLESH is draped over the smoking coals.

           The Guard has his hand over Louisa's mouth.

           Maddox has his eyes closed.

                                 CALE
                        You can close your eyes, but you 
                        can't close your ears. Pain always 
                        finds a way in. 

           Maddox opens his eyes and stares at Cale. Defiant.

                                 CALE
                        What can be worth all this hurt? A 
                        bomb? A virus? A cure for cancer?

           The Frenchman signals to Le Fumer.

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        Encore.

           Louisa's eyes go wider. She struggles, but is too weak to 
           resist. Maddox looks at the flesh being smoked on the rack. 

                                 MADDOX
                        It's not a bomb.

           All eyes, all ears are on Maddox. 

                                 MADDOX
                        But if it gets out, it'll blow the 
                        world apart.

                                 CALE
                        What's in the box?

           Maddox struggles to his feet.
                                                                INVADERS 56.

                                 MADDOX
                        I want coffee. I want a cigarette. 
                        I want a chair. And I want this 
                        shit out of my face.

           He KICKS OVER the smoking apparat us away. GUARDS cock 
           weapons. Louisa is face down and being wrapped in a coat.

                                 MADDOX
                        Shoot. You're all dead anyway.

                                 CALE
                        What's in it?

                                 MADDOX
                        A video.

                                 CALE
                        I don't see the world blowing 
                        apart.

                                 MADDOX
                        You haven't watched it.

           Maddox is marched up the steps.

           Cale pockets a KNIFE from Le Fumer’s box.

           INT. CHATEAU, DINING ROOM - DAY

                        The world does not love America. 
                        Other countries fall into three

           A guy in combat jacket, wild hair, skin that hasn't seen soap 
           in days, nervous. Really nervous. This is BRIAN (20s).

           He feeds a card into the BOX, connects his call and takes it 
           out. The CARD is a fake AMEX with high tech frills.

           MARKHAM JONES (50s) reclines in his leather and chrome home 
           cinema. His shirt is unbuttoned and his eyes are wired.

           Hardcore porn plays on the cinema screen. And two BLONDES 
           entertain each other on the floor.

           Jones has a hands-free phone because his hands are busy.

                        We installed IT for the hotel

                        I put my own dot cams in the top 
                        suites. Plastronic. Electro-mag 
                        sensitive. If they sweeps for bugs,

                        I make those.

           A MAN walks over to the bed. The footage is grainy. He wears 
           a tux. He takes off his jacket and loosens his tie. He unzips 
           his pants and sits on the bed.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        It gets better.

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        It's a fake.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        I shit you not.

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        It's a fake.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        I got 2,000 pixel lines says it's 
                        the leader of the Free World.

           A WOMAN enters the bedroom. The PRESIDENT calls her over. She 
           kneels before him.

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        She's smoking his cigar. Look at 
                        his face. Go, dog, go.

           She lies on the bed and he's between her legs.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        He gets my vote for this move 
                        alone.

           The President fucks her. She has her legs wrapped around him. 
           His hands on his waist, like he's posing for a catalogue.

                                 JONES (O.S.)
                        Total tush desecration.

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        He's going for the reverse double 
                        gut crunch, and the crowd goes 
                        wild.

           ANGLE on BRIAN and MARKHAM JONES watching, transfixed.

                                 JONES
                        Who knows?

                                 BRIAN
                        Nobody. You. Me.

                                 JONES
                        This is a triple platinum earner. 

                                 BRIAN
                        I see me cruising the Gulf in a

                        choking on my wiener.

                        headlining right now? The biggest 
                        move to peace the Middle East has

                        be good.

                                 JONES (CONT'D)
                        The President promising to be good. 
                        But we've got the President being 
                        very, very bad.

                                 BRIAN
                        I guess it fucks the schedule.

                                 JONES
                        This is America saying fuck you.

                        It don’t look like the First Lady.

                        It's the wife of Prince Mohammed Al

                                 BRIAN
                        How do you know it's her?

                                 JONES

                        I read other stuff.

           He holds up a copy of TIME magazine. Its cover - The 
           PRESIDENT shaking hands with PRINCE MOHAMMED AL BAQTAR. 
           Behind the Prince is his wife, the woman in the video.

           INT. CHATEAU, DINING ROOM - DAY (NOW)

           Cale listens intently to Maddox.

                                 MADDOX
                        Your call.

                                 CALE
                        I'll get your box.

                                 MADDOX
                        Good.
                                                                INVADERS 62.

                                 CALE
                        But I go alone. We'll meet in Miami 
                        in seven days. The Raleigh Hotel.

                                 MADDOX
                        No.

                                 CALE
                        OK, you choose the hotel.

                                 MADDOX
                        You don't go alone. You take one of 
                        us.

                                 CALE
                        This is no time to worry about your 
                        frequent flyer miles.

                                 MADDOX
                        It's for your safety.

                                 CALE
                        I can arrange my own protection.

                                 MADDOX
                        Mine won't cost you your next 
                        container.

           He walks around the table to be next to Maddox.

                                 CALE
                        Give me your hand.

           As Maddox offers his right hand to shake, two GUARDS pounce 
           and hold him down. Cale takes the extended right HAND. He has 
           the KNIFE he took off Le Fumer.

           He SLICES a deep X across the pal m.

                                 CALE
                        Think of me next time you jerk off.

           The Frenchman watches from the doorway. As Cale passes...

                                 THE FRENCHMAN
                        Do we kill him?

                                 CALE
                        I don't know if he's full of shit 
                        or just 95% full of shit. The FBI 
                        gets those who get theirs. Your 
                        call. I'm on the next plane out of 
                        here. You should be too.
                                                                INVADERS 63.

           A nod from The Frenchman.

           INT. CHATEAU, BEDROOM - LATER

           Cale has clothes laid out on a bed, and a small case.

           The Girlfriend comes in with Louisa. They are the same size.

           The Girlfriend lays an armful of clothes over a chair and 
           closes the door behind her on the way out.

                                 LOUISA
                        How do you want to do this?

                                 CALE
                        Carefully.

           He steps toward her. She unbuttons her blouse .

           He lifts his hands to her hair but waits before he touches 
           it. Waits for her to signal it’s OK. She nods.

           His hands sink deep into her tresses. Searching fingers 
           roaming over her scalp, down her neck, behind her ears.

           She slips off the blouse and unhooks her bra. She covers her 
           breasts with her hands. He traces the line cut by her bra 
           under each breast with his thumb.

           He lingers a moment too long, her nostrils flare oh so 
           slightly. He pulls away. Nods.

           She hooks the bra back, and steps out of her shoes. He checks 
           inside, checks the low heel. She unzips her skirt and lets it 
           fall while he's still crouching by her feet.

           His eyes wander higher. She has a tattoo about six inches 
           below her navel. It's HINDU script.

                                 LOUISA
                        It says heaven above, heaven below.

                                 CALE
                        Thanks.

                                 LOUISA
                        I should be thanking you.

           EXT. CHATEAU, COURTYARD (FLASHBACK)

           Maddox and Louisa kneeling. Le Fumer stands behind her with 
           his peeling knife.
                                                                INVADERS 64.

           The Guard blocks Maddox's view of Louisa.

           He puts his hand over her mouth. Their eyes connect. The 
           Girlfriend appears by Le Fumer. She SCREAMS.

           Le Fumer takes a slice of fresh PIGLET skin from inside his 
           jacket, and lays it on the SMOKING RACK before Maddox.

           INT. CHATEAU, BEDROOM (NOW)

           Cale packs. She brings her things and layers them in the case 
           with his clothes.

                                 CALE
                        When I get the box, remind Maddox I 
                        kept him alive. I don't want my 
                        retirement fantasy in Fiji  fucked 
                        by a bullet.

                                 LOUISA
                        You've got it all figured out.

                                 CALE
                        This is not my usual game.

                                 LOUISA
                        It shows. You don't know the 
                        pieces. You don't know the rules.

                                 CALE
                        I'm just rolling the dice.

                                 LOUISA
                        Double six you get another turn.

                                 CALE
                        What did I throw?

           She spins the case and snaps the clasps shut.

           INT. HI-TECH OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE UP on a COMPUTER SCREEN.

           A 100 number sequence. 10 rows of 10 numbers. Each number 
           turns into a letter. Rattling through the alphabet. 
           Occasionally, random words appear.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        It's alphanumeric. Letters for 
                        numbers. Like the U-Boat codes. 
                        Let's say 1 = A. 2 = B and so on.
                                                                INVADERS 65.

           Every number 1 turns into a letter A etc. A graphic passes 
           over to find words, like word-search puzzle-book.

                        Never reads Montreal. Up down, 
                        backwards, diagonal, whatever. So 
                        there's a rogue in there.

           The letters turns back to numbers.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        A number personal to the breaker. 
                        Lucky number. Birthday. Cale was 
                        born 26th of October. 2 and 6 makes 
                        8. There are 8 eights in the 
                        square. 8 letters in Montreal.

           All 8s light up.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Make eight a C for Cale. Continue 
                        the Caesar cipher. The next letters 
                        above, below, around spell...

           All the numbers become letters again, following an 
           alphanumeric path where 8 = C, and so 9 = D, 0 = E and on 
           back to 1 = F etc.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Jack shit. It's eight letters but 
                        not the ones we need. October is 
                        the tenth month. Skip ten letters 
                        after each C and...

           The tenth letter after each C spells MONTREAL. All other 
           letters disappear. MONTREAL redraws in the center of screen.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Show me the next sequence, I'll 
                        show you where he's heading. 

           WIDER, we see the hi-tech office environment. Muted lighting. 
           The CIA logo on the wall.

           A STEWARDESS mixes two Vodka Mules and hands them to Cale and 
           Louisa.

           They watch the same seat-back movie, wearing headphones.

           Cale takes his off and looks out of the window at a CRESCENT 
           MOON hanging above the clouds.

           She smiles. Sips her drink. Twirls the ice around with the

           It's a tight squeeze. Louisa locks the door and the light 
           flickers on.

           Their faces are inches from each other.

           She kisses him. Their mouths lock as they feast on pure 
           passion.

           Her hands tug at his zipper. He MOANS. Her other hand 
           silences him.

           She hitches her skirt higher, pushes him onto the commode, 
           and lowers herself slowly onto him.

           Louisa slides back into her seat next to Cale.

           She kisses him. Runs her hand along his thigh. He smiles 
           behind the mask.

           She slides her hand into his pocket. He grabs her wrist. 
           Lifts his mask. Peels her fingers apart. Her hand is empty.

           Cale and Louisa walk.

           Cale is suddenly surrounded by BIG SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY, 
           and herded under protest into an ANNEX.

           GUNS are thrust in his face. He is brought to his knees by a 
           nightstick to the gut, and dragged away.

           Louisa shakes hands with the OFFICER-IN-CHARGE and is 
           afforded an altogether different welcome.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - LATER

           Cale looks out through the tiny barred window toward Table

           Cale lies awake on a bare mattress. Approaching FOOTSTEPS. 

           The door is unlocked. A lean, tanned man enters - it's Agent

           He carries a HARD BRIEFCASE and a folding metal chair. Sits 
           by the bed.

           Edmonds takes two packages out of the CASE and stands them on

           EXT. STAIRWELL OF A RUNDOWN OFFICE BLOCK 

           A MARKSMAN slides a listening device under a DOOR. He 
           hears...

                        They're listening.

                        They gonna kill you. All you got is 
                        the time from now ‘til they get 
                        what they want. RF is EFX/56/7887T.

           The MARKSMAN nods to the rest of the team, who now silently 
           hunker around the door.

           EXT. STAIRWELL OF A RUNDOWN OFFICE BLOCK 

           A MARKSMAN counts down - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

           BLAM. The DOOR is BLASTED OPEN.

           INSERT SHOT OF: DIP, jolted, surprised by the sudden noise...

           Two Marksmen in the DOORWAY lit up by the muzzle flash from 
           their weapons as they redecorate the room with lead.

           INT. HOLDING CELL 

           The line goes dead at Cale's end...

           INT. SMALL DARK ROOM 

           A Marksman sweeps a flashlight around the now silent room.

           We see that it is small and EMPTY.

           Apart from a bullet-ridden table, and a relay phone device 
           that has now been shot to component parts and less.
                                                                INVADERS 74.

           Dip takes off his headset. Reaches down to his feet and 
           strokes his dog.

           EXT. APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

           A barely visible slit in the hillside - a letter-sized 
           viewing hole - to the expanse of wilderness.

           The ultimate bolt-hole.

           EXT. FINE HOTEL, CAPE TOWN - DAY

           The busy harbor - a sixth floor balcony.

           INT. FINE HOTEL, SUITE 

           Expensive trappings, natural shades with African flourishes. 
           Cale paces. Louisa works on a laptop.

           He passes a WOMAN carrying beach bag. Smiles at her. She 
           takes a silenced MAUSER from beach bag and FIRES one slug 
           through his skull from behind.

           INSERT SHOT of THREE MAN CIA TEAM in HOTEL KITCHEN. They look 
           worried. They check weapons and communications systems. An 
           argument among the CHEFS distracts them.

                        The airports are covered.

           From across the kitchen, a knife flies and skewers a CIA MAN 
           in the back. He turns and lets fly a volley of silenced 
           MACHINE PISTOL. PANS and FOOD and the PASTRY CHEF are ripped 
           apart. AFRICAN ASSASSINS wielding MACHETES swarm in. The CIA 
           MEN are hacked to pieces.

                                 LOUISA (V.O.)
                        And if we need more firepower, 
                        we've got the Nimitz class carrier 
                        rounding the Cape. 

           ON LOUISA'S LAPTOP - a warning flashes - code yellow. After a 
           couple of seconds, it returns to green. Louisa dials base.

                        Eagle's nest to base, come in.

           She goes to the SUITE'S double doors. Opens them. Outside, 
           two GUARDS.

                                 LOUISA
                             (to guards)
                        I can't raise Charlie. See if you

           As she closes the doors, one guard takes out his radio. At 
           the end of the hotel corridor, the elevator doors open.

           INT. FINE HOTEL, CORRIDOR

           A TALL ARAYAN-LOOKING MAN in a suit, with a long flat flight 
           case steps out of the elevator.

           A fat black MAID pushes her HOUSEKEEPING cart along. She 
           stops at a door. KNOCKS. Enters with her pass key, and pulls 
           the cart inside.

           Arayan Man walks past the Maid and stops at his room. He 
           takes a long look down the corridor.

           At the far end, the two Guards outside a room.

           Arayan Man slips into his room.

           INT. SUITE - LATER

           Cale watches a wildlife program. It shows a SEAL being chased 
           by a GREAT WHITE SHARK.

           Louisa checks her watch.

                                 LOUISA
                        What will you do when this is over?

                                 LOUISA
                        I'm here to protect you.

           INT. SUITE 

           Louisa turns to the door at the SOUND of a CRACK. She sees 
           the bullet hole at head height and the trickle of red below 
           it.

           POP. POP. Two more holes appear.

           She pulls her gun and backs Cale into a  corner from where she 
           can cover the door and the balcony.

           INT. CORRIDOR

           Arayan Man comes out of his room, minus the flight case. The 
           Maid raises the silenced Mauser and POPS a bullet between his 
           eyes from 25 yards.

           INT. SUITE 

           Louisa closes the balcony doors and draws all the curtains.

                                 CALE
                        There's only one way out of this.

                                 LOUISA
                        I'm listening.

           She's packing away her laptop into a neat and chic backpack 
           carry-case.

                                 CALE
                        I open the door and walk out.

                                 LOUISA
                        What?

                                 CALE
                        Maddox wants the RF so he needs me 
                        alive. No one's going to shoot me. 
                        Not yet.

                                 LOUISA
                        And me?

                                 CALE
                        You run.

                                 LOUISA
                        It's not a good plan. We can hold 
                        out till Agent Edmonds gets back.
                                                                INVADERS 78.

                                 CALE
                        What if he isn't coming back?

           Louisa considers it.

                                 LOUISA
                        I'm not letting you go. I need you.

                                 CALE
                        You?

                                 LOUISA
                        We.

           Cale steps up to the door. Louisa blocks him.

                                 CALE
                        You had ten men around this hotel. 
                        And bullets are coming through our 
                        door. It's not looking good.

                                 LOUISA
                        I'll be right behind you.

                                 CALE
                             (calling outside)
                        I'm coming out. Alone.

           No answer.

                                 CALE
                        I'm unarmed.

           He reaches for the door handle.

                                 LOUISA
                        What if they already know the RF? 
                        What if they got to Dip? What if 
                        they're here to kill you?

                                 CALE
                        You thought of that just now, or 
                        have you been saving it up till the 
                        time was right?

           He pulls the door ajar. He can see out into the CORRIDOR. He 
           can see the BODIES of the dead GUARDS just outside.

                                 CALE
                        I'm stepping out.

           As he does...
                                                                INVADERS 79.

           ...there's a gun at his head. The  Maid standing by the door 
           gestures for him to move all the way out.

                                 CALE
                        Shoot me, or take the gun from my 
                        head.

           Louisa has a bead on the door. BLAM. The bullet slams through 
           the wood and connects with the MAID'S HAND, blowing away the 
           gun she's holding and half her fingers.

                                 LOUISA
                        Go!

           Cale hobbles down the CORRIDOR for the ELEVATORS.

           The Maid tries to pull the GUN from the shoulder holster of a 
           dead GUARD. But Louisa is upon her. BLAM. Dead MAID.

           Louisa catches up to Cale. The AFRICAN BUSINESSMAN appears at 
           the end of the corridor, reaching for a concealed weapon.

           Behind him, the elevator doors OPEN.

           Louisa SHOOTS through the lock of a guest room door and 
           pushes her way inside. Cale is rooted to the spot looking 
           down toward the elevator.

           Toward the WHITE-SUITED FIGURE stepping out. Stepping out and 
           smiling right back at Cale. A big smile for a big man.

           INSIDE the room, Louisa SHOUTS for Cale to RUN.

           The AFRICAN BUSINESSMAN draws a cumbersome weapon. FIRES it 
           at Cale. 

           But instead of spitting bullets, he shoots DARTS ON WIRES.

           As the DARTS find Cale, so too does 50,000 volts. The 
           ELECTRIC BLAST sends him sprawling onto his back.

           Louisa has gone.

           The AFRICAN stands over Cale. And now the BIG MAN in the 
           white suit, too. As the big man crouches down, his suit pants 
           ride up to reveal a number sequence tattoo on his ankle.

           Cale, losing consciousness...

                                 CALE
                        Duke?

                                 DUKE
                        Welcome to the fun-house.

           INT. DUSTY CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           A man drives.

           DUKE in the passenger seat. Has a GUN trained on Cale - 
           unconscious behind him.

           Duke slowly SQUEEZES the trigger. 

           WATER squirts out and hits Cale in the face. It's a WATER 
           PISTOL. He squirts him again. Cale's hands are tied with 
           plastic cuffs on his lap. The cold water wakes him.

                                 CALE
                        You're dead.

                                 DUKE
                        I am arisen.

                                 CALE
                        You sold me out.

                        I cut you in.

                        We’re all dead because of you.

                                 DUKE
                        I had a choice: die poor, or save 
                        my friend and make us both rich. 
                        Didn't have to think long about it.

                        I got $25 million with my name on 
                        it. I'm sorry all the way to 
                        Hawaii.

                                 CALE
                        Where's Louisa?

                        You got the same coming. 25. If you 
                        play ball.

                        Where is she?

                        There you go. Complicating a no-
                        brainer. Bitch or scratch? We'll 
                        find her. But don't hold no 
                        candles. She won't be so pretty 
                        when we're through.

           Cale lashes out with his feet. Kicks DUKE, catches him 
           unaware. DUKE blocks the next blows.

           He grabs Cale by the shoulders and holds him steady. Cale 
           BUTTS HIM in the mouth.

           Duke spits out blood, then puts an end to Cale's fight with a 
           GUT PUNCH that would floor an elephant.

                                 DUKE
                        The world turns. Your CIA friends 
                        are all DOA.

           INSERT SHOT of AGENT EDMONDS and two other AGENTS standing on 
           a PALLET as a FORK-LIFT raises them up to the third tier of 
           containers.

                                 DUKE
                        Maddox says CIA stands for 
                        Complacent Insular Assholes. 
                        Whatever that means.

           INSERT SHOT of EDMONDS opening the container doors. Empty 
           inside, except for Maddox. He steps from the shadows and lays 
           waste to the AGENTS. Bullet casings and bodies rain down.

                                 DUKE
                        We stripped the container. The 
                        black box wasn't there. So it's 
                        down to the wire. The last 
                        container. It's good to see you.

                                 CALE
                        What have you done?

           INSERT SHOT of number sequence being cracked into the name of 
           a PORT. The name is revealed as HONG KONG.

                                 DUKE
                        The right thing. We have the number 
                        sequence. You have access to the 
                        RF. The team is back.

                                 DUKE
                        I'll ask the same thing Maddox 
                        asked me when I signed. Do you 
                        trust our leaders?

                                 CALE
                        Are you for real? Shot dead in 
                        Ojai. Comes back as Michael fucking 
                        Moore.

                                 DUKE
                        Do you trust them?

                                 CALE
                        I don't trust anyone.

                                 DUKE
                        This is the start of the New 
                        America. We backed the Jews. We got 
                        war and bagels. We back the Arabs, 
                        we get oil and peace. 

           Duke squirts water in his mouth from the GUN.

                                 DUKE
                        It's so simple it bites your ass 
                        and says wake up, you dumb fuck. 
                        Think about it.

                                 CALE
                        I can't. It hurts.

           EXT. CAPE TOWN, ROOFTOP - DUSK

           Louisa battles against a raging wind and the roar of engines. 
           She shouts into her cell phone and huddles into an alcove 
           between heating ducts.

                                 LOUISA
                             (into phone)
                        Requesting back-up. Tracking Eagle

                        much? Everything you've got.

           Ending the call, she crouches low and runs out across the 
           rooftop to the waiting HELICOPTER.

           EXT. PIER - NIGHT

           Duke drags Cale out of the car and marches him down the pier. 
           At the end is a LUXURY MOTOR YACHT. The Arab-looking crew 
           have white uniforms and MACHINE PISTOLS.
                                                                INVADERS 83.

                                 CALE
                        This will not have a happy ending 
                        for you. Everyone else involved is 
                        dead or waiting to be dead.

                                 DUKE
                        Everyone else was on the losing 
                        side.

           Three burly CREWMEN come down and bring Cale aboard.

           There are enough COMMS DEVICES, SAT DISHES, and COMMUNICATION 
           MASTS on the yacht to broadcast the SUPER BOWL.

                                 CALE
                        The hell is this, a TV station?

                        You see what this baby is packing, 
                        your dick ain't going down for a 
                        week.

           The crewmen cast off. The yacht pulls away.

           EXT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT (MOVING) - NIGHT

           TWO CREWMEN frisk and strip Cale.

                                 DUKE
                        The full glove, man. Rules is 
                        rules.

           They inspect every last inch of his body manually.

                                 DUKE
                        OK, girls, he's clean. Fun's over .

           But the crewmen produce electronic SCANNING DEVICES. They 
           scan his whole body. Even his bandaged foot.

           They make him lift his foot up and SCAN the sole. A BEEP.

                                 DUKE
                        What is that?

                                 CALE
                        It's where your boyfriend gave me a 
                        box-cutter kiss.

           The crewmen cut away the bandage to reveal the stitched 
           wound. They run the SCANNER over it. A stronger BEEP.
                                                                INVADERS 84.

                                 DUKE
                        Something’s wrong with your foot, 
                        dude.

           Duke takes out a knife and probes into the WOUND.

                                 CALE
                        The fuck are you doing?

                                 DUKE
                        Keep still.

           Cale creases over in agony. The point emerges with -

                                 DUKE
                        A tracking device, in an earring, 
                        in a foot. That’s one resourceful 
                        bitch. 

           He flicks the earring overboard.

                                 DUKE
                        Swim, Nemo, swim.

           INT. HELICOPTER (MOVING) - NIGHT

           An LCD computer SCREEN. The outline of the coast. A RED DOT 
           marks Cale's position just out to sea.

           The RED DOT fades.

           Louisa studies the screen, grimly.

                                 LOUISA
                        No.

           INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Duke opens a door into the opulent SALOON. 

           Maddox is at the round table, smoking a cigar. Duke leads in 
           a fully dressed Cale, with newly bandaged foot.

           A glimpse of another MAN in the shadows. Watching.

                                 CALE
                             (to Maddox)

                        We haven't been introduced. Cale 
                        Fallon.

           The MAN steps forward. A distinguished Arab gentleman and 
           extends his hand.

                        Mohammed Al Baqtar. Welcome aboard

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           The yacht cuts out to sea at its highest rate of knots.

           INT. SALOON - NIGHT

           Prince Mohammed lights a cigar. Maddox sits forward like a 
           lion on a leash. Duke snacks on pretzels.

                        We cannot change the world. But we 
                        can change the world order. Who is

                        want you to share in it. And its 
                        value will be counted in billions.

                        So I play ball, I get a cut of X

                                 PRINCE MOHAMMED

                        You've got thirty eight minutes. 
                        Take him to the bridge.

           Duke leads Cale outside. When they have gone, Prince Mohammed 
           signals to Maddox.

           CIGARETTE.

           Cale whips the GUN from DUKE'S pants and has it cocked and 
           pointed at Maddox at pretty much the precise moment that 
           Maddox has his own GUN cocked and pointed at Cale. 

           The armed CREWMEN lock and load their MACHINE PISTOLS.

                                 DUKE
                        Christ.

                                 MADDOX
                        Put the gun down.

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, right.

                                 DUKE
                        We both know you won't use it.

                                 CALE
                        Try me.

           Duke slips out a SECOND GUN from a leg holster. He puts the 
           muzzle is against Cale's cheek.
                                                                INVADERS 95.

                                 DUKE
                        Quit fucking around.

                                 MADDOX
                        Like I said, smart sits on my side.

           Cale lets the GUN swing loose in his grip. Duke leans over 
           and takes it. He gestures to the burn on his cheek.

                                 DUKE
                        Lucky it wasn't my good side, bro.

           BLAM!

           A BULLET rips through DUKE'S HEAD.

           LOUISA crouches atop CONTAINERS and now takes aim at Maddox. 
           But he's fast. Fires up as she fires down. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           Bullets slam into the deck, one punches through the chest of 
           a CREWMAN, others ping off metal forcing Maddox to run for 
           cover.

           Cale throws open the container doors, DIVES INSIDE just as 
           Maddox takes a parting shot at him. BULLETS wang off the 
           door. 

           Cale steals a glance at Duke --

                                 CALE
                        Now you’re dead. 

           Louisa covers him from her turkey-shoot position, pinning 
           Maddox and his Crewmen on deck.

           INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT 

           Prince Mohammed reclines in his stateroom with BLONDES, but 
           his interest wanders to the GUNFIRE.

           He pulls on his dressing gown and opens the door to a 
           concerned Crewman.

                                 CREWMAN
                        Someone's shooting at us on the 
                        Excelsior, sir.

                                 PRINCE MOHAMMED
                        Then go and shoot back.
                                                                INVADERS 96.

           INT. CONTAINER 

           A sliver of light from the coming DAWN reveals the container 
           is neatly stacked along two walls with a narrow aisle down 
           the middle for access.

           Cale checks all down one side - feeling rather than seeing - 
           judging shape and texture. Nothing fits the bill. He tosses 
           items aside with disregard for value.

           The GUN-BATTLE continues outside. He keeps one eye on the 
           door, just slightly ajar.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK 

           Louisa takes out the last of the Crewmen. Maddox is hunkered 
           behind a bulwark, reloading. Louisa drops down to the DECK.

           Maddox spots she has gone from her perch.

           INT. CONTAINER 

           Cale still rifling through the contents. Suddenly, the DOOR 
           is flung OPEN. A silhouette with a GUN.

                                 LOUISA
                        Move it.

           He pushes a painting aside. There, behind it, is the black 
           enamel METAL BOX.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK 

           Maddox rolls and looses off another volley at Louisa at the 
           container door. She ducks around the corner.

           More CREWMEN from the yacht climb aboard.

           INT. CONTAINER 

           As bullets PING OFF the container, Cale grabs the METAL BOX.

                                 CALE
                        Cover me!

           In a loping crouch, he's out on deck. A BULLET hits the BOX 
           and frags into his arm. 

           He keeps a hold on his prize with his one good hand, and 
           disappears around the container - following Louisa's lead as 
           she lays covering fire. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
                                                                INVADERS 97.

                                 LOUISA
                        Down here.

           She pushes him into a GAP between containers. A natural 
           alcove where they hide - close - confined - pressed tight 
           together again - a KISS - urgent. 

                                 CALE
                        You pick your moments.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK - DAWN

           Crewmen searching the top of the CONTAINER STACK - under 
           tarpaulins, behind odd units, flashlights making spook shapes 
           out of nothing as the swell rocks the ship.

           EXT. ALCOVE BETWEEN CONTAINERS 

           Louisa makes a call on her cell phone. 

                                 CALE
                        If you're ordering pizza, hold the 
                        pepperoni.

                                 LOUISA
                             (looking Cale over)
                        You need a hospital.

                                 CALE
                        I got a nurse. How’d you get here?

           Her call connects.

                                 LOUISA
                        Helicopter. 
                             (into phone)
                        Code 347 is aborted.
                             (listens; then)
                        Damn.

           She ends the call and changes a setting on her phone.

                                 CALE
                        That didn't sound like Domino's.

                                 LOUISA
                        It was a US warship about fifty 
                        miles South East. I've set a phone 
                        beacon. We have two in-bounds.

                                 CALE
                        Inbounds...?
                                                                INVADERS 98.

                                 LOUISA
                        Harpoon missiles. Homing in on this 
                        signal in T minus five minutes.

                                 CALE
                        And you did that because..?

                                 LOUISA
                        I couldn't risk Maddox taking the 
                        box.

                                 CALE
                        So you're going to blow us all out 
                        of the water?

                                 LOUISA
                        Uh-huh.

                                 CALE
                        And that seems like a good plan?

                                 LOUISA
                        If we're somewhere else when the 
                        missiles arrive.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           2 HARPOON MISSILES skim the surface - hell bent for their 
           distant target.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, CONTAINERS - NIGHT

           Louisa lodges the CELL PHONE/HOMING DEVICE between two 
           containers.

                                 CALE
                        I've got a better idea.

           Suddenly, lights shaft down onto them. Voices from above.

                                 LOUISA
                        Too late.

           She puts a BULLET in the first head that looks down, then 
           makes her move down the GAP and out toward the deck.

                                 LOUISA
                        The bridge. Come on. 

           Cale hangs back between the containers.

                                 LOUISA
                        What are you doing?
                                                                INVADERS 99.

           Cale finds the energy to follow her, clasping hold of the 
           METAL BOX with one hand.

           They move along the dark side of the containers to the stern.

           A hand reaches over and SPRAYS A RANDOM VOLLEY of machine-gun 
           fire. BULLETS dance around them, urging them along.

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME 

           The twin missiles speed mercilessly to their target.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK - NIGHT

           As Louisa nears the end of the container stack, a sudden 
           movement to her right freezes her to the spot.

           A HAND snakes out from a bulwark - holding a GLOCK. Maddox's 
           hand.

                                 MADDOX
                        Far enough. The gun.

           She drops it. Cale leans against the side of the ship, 
           exhausted.

                                 CALE
                        Touch her, the box goes over the 
                        side.

                                 MADDOX
                        You'll be dead before you lift your 
                        arm.

           Crewmen aim down at Cale from the top of the stack to back up 
           Maddox's claim.

                                 MADDOX
                        Lay it on the deck.

                                 CALE
                        Let her go first.

                                 MADDOX
                        Go where? We're in the middle of 
                        the fuckin’ ocean.

           Cale suddenly throws the METAL BOX at Maddox. 

           It hits him square in the head, pitching him sidewa ys. 
                                                               INVADERS 100.

           Louisa scoops up her GUN and makes for the bridge. Bullets 
           HIT the metal stairs as she takes them three at a time. 
           Crewmen chase after her. 

           Maddox rolls on top of Cale . Rams the GLOCK into his face.

                                 MADDOX
                        Part of me is sad to end this. You 
                        have been one onerous bastard. I 
                        respect that. You heard of Captain 
                        Fetterman?

                                 CALE
                        Don't tell me a story. Just shoot 
                        if that's what gets your dick hard.

           BLAM! BLAM!

           Two shots. One near. One far. 

           The first bullet PUNCHES through Maddox’s shoulder and sends 
           him rolling off Cale. 

           The next, a split second later, blows half Cale’s ear off as 
           it erupts from Maddox’s gun.

           His Glock is locked back on an empty ch amber.

           From the DARKNESS, two more SHOTS. One takes out a Crewman, 
           the second DANCES by Maddox.

           Wounded, Maddox grabs the METAL BOX and takes cover. 

           One last look at Cale. Maddox makes a FINGER GUN and mock 
           shoots him before staggering off up the ship. 

           The remaining Crewmen follow him off the Excelsior.

           Cale lies back. His world a POV of the stars above, the sky 
           turning from black to a mid blue with the sunrise over the 
           other side of the ship.

           And the INFERNAL RINGING in his good ear.

           Louisa crouches over him. 

           She shouts at him but he can’t hear a thing.

           Trying to lift him, but he’s an exhausted dead weight.

           EXT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT - NIGHT

           Maddox steps on board.
                                                               INVADERS 101.

                                 MADDOX
                        Cast off.

           INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT, BRIDGE (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Prince Mohammed looks up from the COMMUNICATIONS CENTER as 
           Maddox strides in.

                                 PRINCE MOHAMMED
                        You have it?

           Maddox lifts the lid on the BLACK BOX. Inside, a GOLD CD/ DVD.

                                 DJEMBA
                        Satellite link ready.

           Prince Mohammed takes the CD/DVD out of the foam inside the 
           black box and lays it gently into the tray of a player.

                                 PRINCE MOHAMMED
                        Gentlemen, I give you the end of 
                        Western Civilization as we know it.

           The tray sucks into the player.

           On-screen graphics display a READING message.

           Then change to an image of the PRESIDENT walking into his 
           HOTEL ROOM. Crystal clear.

                                 DJEMBA
                        You can watch it through as I 
                        upload the system for broadcast.

           A crewman administers first-aid to Maddox. He and the Prince 
           exchange nods of a job well done.

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK - SAME 

           The Yacht speeds away from the container ship.

           Louisa is more urgent now, trying to drag Cale to the side. 
           He’s laughing.

                                 LOUISA
                        Get your ass moving.

                                 CALE
                        Duke. Phone. Back pocket.

                                 LOUISA
                        What?
                                                               INVADERS 102.

                                 CALE
                        Go.

                                 LOUISA
                        There's no time.

           Cale’s shaking his head. 

                                 CALE
                        Go!

           She looks at him as if he's crazy enough now to get them both 
           blown to pieces.

                                 CALE
                        Trust me.

           She runs around the containers to Duke’s body. Rolls him 
           over. Slips the phone out of his back pocket.

           EXT. OCEAN 

           The MISSILES homing in on the Excelsior.

           The container ship grows from toy size to life size as the 
           missiles streak toward it.

           Then bank ever so gently. And alter trajectory oh so 
           slightly. And -- WHOOSH -- past the prow of the Excelsior.

           EXT. WYNDHAM EXCELSIOR, DECK 

           Cale punches a number into Duke’s phone.

                                 LOUISA
                             (looking at the screen)
                        That’s my cell number.

           INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT, BRIDGE (MOVING) - DAWN

           Djemba furiously taps at his console keyboard.

                                 DJEMBA
                        There's something wrong with the 
                        upload routing. It's not gone to a 
                        known server. We can't broadcast 
                        till I find it.

           A twitch from Maddox's facial muscles. He turns slowly from 
           the TV monitors at the MUFFLED SOUND of a CELL PHONE ringing. 
                                                               INVADERS 103.

           INT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           Dip working at his computer. He clicks a file labelled IF.

           The PRESIDENT/ARAB WIFE video comes on his screen. He hits 
           RECORD.

                                 DIP
                        The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh 
                        away. The Lord giveth back. With 
                        interest.

           INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT, BRIDGE (MOVING)

           Maddox follows the sound of the RINGING to its source - the 
           METAL BOX.

           Lifts out the thick FOAM INNER.

           Beneath it is Louisa's cellphone - STILL RINGING. 

           On the screen - a solitary X. 

           A brief puzzled look, then -- 

                                 MADDOX
                        I hate that prick. 

           EXT. EXCELSIOR, DECK - DAWN

           The missiles veer away from the container ship.

           Cale kisses Louisa again.

                                 CALE
                        Boom.

           Behind them, a MASSIVE EXPLOSION. 

           FIREBALL rising into the red dawn sky as the LUXURY YACHT is 
           hit. They watch the fireball grow in the sunrise.

                                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Cale and Louisa sit side by side.

           His head is strapped with a dressing over his ear.

           The stewardess serves them cocktails.
                                                               INVADERS 104.

           Cheers.

                        Too much money. Not enough theft.

                                 LOUISA
                        Stop that. Luck can’t last forever.

                        What can?

           She kisses him. Loving.

           She follows his eyes to the restroom.

                                                                      FADE OUT.
