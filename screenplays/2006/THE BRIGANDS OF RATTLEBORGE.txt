           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - NIGHT

           The moon is a milky eye hidden behind a cataract of filthy
           clouds.  Two men ride their horses to the edge of an
           escarpment.  The horses are lean and their coats are pocked
           and abraded.

           The first man is a chubby and squat fifty year-old fellow
           named RODNEY.  He wears a yellowed kerchief around his
           neck and weathered blue clothing.  His porcine head is
           topped by a wide blue hat with a drooping brim.  He looks
           ahead, past his horse's neck, and into the dell below.

                                 RODNEY
                        There's a lot of 'em.

           The man astride the horse beside Rodney is a tall good-
           looking gentleman of thirty-seven named BILLY LEE.  He has
           a thick blond mustache, chiseled features and eyes that
           look like bright greenish-blue stars; he wears a gray suit
           and a gray hat.  He exhales; his breath mists in the air
           about his head, illumined by the fires below.

           Billy Lee surveys the encampment that fills the dell.  His
           greenish-blue eyes glean teepees, horses, animal skins,
           piles of wood, piles of bone and Native Americans setting
           about their evening duties or simply sitting before the
           roaring fires in an effort to stay warm.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        What'cha thinking, Billy Lee?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Far too many thoughts for your
                        raisin of a brain.  Yet currently
                        and most immediately, I think we've
                        been spotted.

           Billy Lee points to the nearest teepee, outside of which
           three Native Americans stand, their faces turned up to the
           escarpment upon which the horsemen are perched.  The trio
           CHATTERS excitedly, calling out to others.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        The time is upon us.

           Billy SNAPS the reins to his horse, a subtle and efficient
           flicker.  The horse obediently takes to the steep decline
           beyond the lip of the plateau, and picks its footing down.

           Rodney watches Billy Lee go.  Rodney's eyes flicker to the
           Native Americans below, who are now preparing for Billy
           Lee's arrival.  Rodney's eyes go back to Billy Lee, several
           yards down the path.
                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        Indians can smell fear.

           Billy Lee does not look back as he speaks, but continues
           steadily downward, facing the people below.

                                 RODNEY
                        I ain't yellow...I'm just cautious.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        A lot of cautious men have been
                        scalped in these parts.  Move.

                                 RODNEY
                        Don't suppose I got a choice, now
                        do I, Billy Lee?
                              (muttering)
                        Son of a toothless, clapped-out
                        cripple whore goat...

           Rodney nudges his horse forward with a quick SNAP and a
           firm dig of his rusty spurs.

           EXT. NATIVE AMERICAN VILLAGE - SAME

           The horsemen ride into the dell and are met by twelve NATIVE
           AMERICANS.  They approach the white riders.  Three of them
           have bows and four of them have spears.  They wear patchwork
           cloaks of animal hides and have painted their faces with
           green dots and swirling red lines.

           Billy Lee raises his hands.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I am a friend.  I want to speak to
                        the chief.
                              (beat; addressing
                               the foremost member
                               of the tribe)
                        I want to speak with the chief.

           The Native Americans look at him; they do not understand
           him.

                                 RODNEY
                        Show 'em the scarf.

           Billy Lee gives Rodney a baleful glance.

           The Native Americans close in around the mounted duo.  A
           young Native American Male points his spear head at Billy
           Lee and then at Rodney and then to the ground.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (to Rodney)
                        Dismount.  Slowly.

           Billy Lee climbs off of his horse, slowly and gracefully.
           Rodney twists and spills himself out of the saddle, stirring
           up some dust with his awkward footing, though he manages
           to stay upright.  He is nervous.

           The reins to the two horses are snatched up by two Native
           Americans Females.  The horses dance back, complaining
           with nervous WHINNIES and a few low NEIGHS.

           Billy's eyes do not leave the penetrating gaze of the Native
           American standing immediately in front of him.

           The horses settle and are then led away from Billy Lee and
           Rodney into the village.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        I would like to speak with the
                        chief.

           Billy Lee reaches into his jacket pocket slowly and
           deliberately, as if he is about to perform a magic trick
           for children.  The Native Americans watch him, their eyes
           mere pinpricks of light visible within their fire-limned
           forms.

           From his jacket pocket, Billy Lee withdraws a beige scarf,
           colored with red swirls and green dots.

                                 NATIVE AMERICANS
                        Amagana!

           Billy Lee nods and offers the scarf up to the foremost
           member in the group.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (pointing to his
                               own eyes)
                        I have seen...
                              (pointing to the
                               scarf)
                        ...Amagana.

           A Native American male wearing pants of animal hide and a
           headdress approaches the group.  His complexion is lighter
           than the complexion of the others in the tribe.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        You wish to speak with the chief?

           Billy Lee looks at the half-caste and nods.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        We do.  We have seen the men who
                        took his daughter.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        White men?

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (nodding)
                        White men.
           The Half-caste shakes his head and then looks at Billy
           Lee.

           He glances over at Rodney and then turns his sorrowful
           gaze to the ground.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        The news you bring will make the
                        chief most unhappy...and will make
                        my already difficult life much
                        moreso.  Hatred of the white man
                        burns bright in this tribe, and
                        their tolerance of me and the other
                        half-caste is...not unlimited.
                              (beat; shaking his
                               head)
                        Come.  Share your black words with
                        the chief.

           The Half-caste speaks to the vanguard of Native Americans;
           they relax their weapons and disperse.

           The Half-caste leads Billy Lee and Rodney into the heart
           of the settlement.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        You are well spoken- much moreso
                        than my foul-mouthed companion-
                        and you are fit and strong.  You
                        could find work almost anywhere,
                        in any of the developing cities. 
                        Why do you stay here if you are
                        not wanted?

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        I am not wanted yet what I want is
                        another matter.  I desire to follow
                        my mother's way, not my father's.

           Half-caste looks to the surrounding hills as he walks.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                              (continuing)
                        There is no shortage of white men
                        in this land.

           They walk in silence for a double dozen paces.  Members of
           the tribe look up from their fires at the Half-caste and
           the white men he escorts.  Nothing is said to the pale
           trio, but when they pass, muttering and whispering
           invariably follows in their wake.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Does this tribe truly practice
                        cannibalism?

           Rodney, frightened by this inquiry, looks at Billy Lee to
           see if he making a jest.  He is not.
                                 HALF-CASTE
                        Why should the bodies of our mothers
                        and fathers nourish the land, but
                        not the rightful people of the
                        land?  Why should the worms feast
                        on sacred native flesh while we go
                        hungry?
                              (looking at Billy
                               Lee)
                        Is it more civilized to eat the
                        flesh of dung-eating animals and
                        filthy beasts of burden, as white
                        men do?  Is it wiser to ingest
                        such tainted and stupid meat?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        You make a fair point, though I
                        cannot say that I plan on changing
                        my diet just yet.

           Rodney attempts to disguise his disgust.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        I do not expect you to comprehend,
                        but that is our way.  It is part
                        of the mystical rites of the
                        Canhougache.  Our rivals in these
                        parts observe this practice as
                        well.  It may seem savage to you,
                        but the Canhougache and the Maccanoi
                        endure.

           Rodney's eyes go to the top of the nearest teepee, upon
           which rest three human skulls and a dozen petrified hands,
           the fingers of which are curved like bird talons.

           Rodney sucks in his pot belly in a feeble attempt to look
           lean.

           INT. THE CHIEF'S HUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Swirls of smoke hang within the hut like imprisoned clouds.

           Shelves made from crudely worked wood line the walls of
           the dwelling.  A rug depicting a ritual feast covers the
           entire floor.  An iron pot sits in the center of the room,
           glowing coals pulsating dimly within it.

           The CHIEF is a handsome Native American male of no more
           than forty-five years.  His oiled black hair is tied and
           elaborately braided behind his head.  He wears a skirt of
           leather and a fur vest.  He is painting a picture of an
           old woman.

           Half-caste leads Billy Lee and Rodney inside the hut. 
           Both men remove their hats immediately upon entering. 
           Rodney is sweating profusely from the fear that grips him.

           Half-caste addresses the Chief in the tribe's unique
           language.
           The Chief responds to Half-Caste.

           Half-Caste says a few more words.

           The Chief nods, glances at the two white men standing at
           the doorway.  He motions for them to sit.  They do.

           The Chief continues painting.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        The Chief wishes to know if Amagana
                        has been raped.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I cannot speak for certain on that
                        matter, but her clothing had not
                        been sullied or sundered.

           Half-caste translates to the Chief.   The Chief, not looking
           up from his painting, replies with a few short words.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        Can you win her her freedom?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        The fellows who took her are
                        dangerous men.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        All white men are.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I will not argue that point, though
                        truthfully any man who is hungry,
                        unlucky or in love can be dangerous. 
                        But these men...they are killers
                        of a particularly nasty sort. 
                        There is only one way to deal with
                        a posse like that.

           Half-caste nods and translates Billy Lee's remarks to the
           Chief.  The Chief looks up from the painting into Billy
           Lee's eyes.  The Chief addresses Billy Lee in a hostile
           tone.  He does not look away as Half-caste translates.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        The Chief says, do not be deceived
                        by his youth.  His father died at
                        a very young age and he has ruled
                        the Canhougache since before he
                        had even seen his twelfth winter. 
                        He is young but he is very wise.

           The Chief, still staring at Billy Lee, says a few more
           words.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                              (continuing)
                        What do you want in exchange for
                        killing these men and rescuing
                        Amagana?
           Rodney's eyes flicker to Billy Lee.

           Billy Lee's shoulders relax almost imperceptibly.

           Rodney scratches his bulbous second chin.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I have heard that the raindance of
                        this tribe can summon forth a storm
                        of tremendous power.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        We have such capabilities.  In
                        your language, the storm would be
                        known as The Crone's Cataract.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        If you summon forth this storm on
                        a day of my determining, and send
                        it in the direction of my choosing,
                        I will free Amagana and kill her
                        captors.

           Half-caste translates the exchange to the Chief.

           Billy Lee fingers his moustache and Rodney tries to even
           out the drooping rim of his blue hat.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        We will call The Crone's Cataract,
                        after Amagana has been saved.

           Billy Lee looks at the Chief and shakes his head.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        No.  There is a fair chance that
                        Amagana's captors will kill me or
                        my partner here...or at least injure
                        us.  You summon the storm first if
                        you want us to risk our lives
                        killing men we would otherwise
                        have no reason to tangle with.

           Half-caste translates Billy Lee's remarks.  The Chief does
           not look pleased.  He turns away from Billy Lee and
           continues painting, giving the elderly woman a lone
           protruding tooth.

           He says a few terse words.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        For what purpose is this storm
                        summoned?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        The town of Rattleborge has become
                        quite successful...too successful
                        in the eyes of many.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILLY LEE (CONT'D)
                        If a terrible storm struck that
                        prosperous locale one week before
                        their crops had been harvested,
                        Rattleborge would be plunged into
                        crisis and many neighboring towns
                        would gain a significant financial
                        advantage.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        As would you.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        As would I.

           Half-caste translates to the Chief.  A few guttural noises
           are his response.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        The business of white men is of no
                        concern to him.  He agrees to summon
                        the storm on the first day of July.

           The Chief says one last thing.

           Rage momentarily registers on Half-caste's face.  He
           suppresses his anger and speaks in a cool even tone.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                              (continuing)
                        I must accompany you to see that
                        what you claim is true and that
                        you hold to your word.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        We have a long ride.  Amagana's
                        captors were headed northwest,
                        into the mountains.  You are welcome
                        to come if you wish.

                                 RODNEY
                        But we don't got enough-

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        I will supply myself.

           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - DAWN

           Billy Lee, Rodney and Half-caste ride across the plains,
           towards the rising sun.  Billy Lee's black steed shuffles
           slowly as does Rodney's gray palfrey; Half-caste's white
           mare steps lightly with her bareback rider atop her.

           Rodney's eyelids droop as sleep wraps her arms around him.

           He begins to tilt forward in the saddle.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Rodney!
                                 RODNEY
                        I'm asleep...errr awake.  I'm awake.

           Half-caste rides tacitly, ignoring the white men; his face
           a sullen mask.

           Billy Lee trots his horse up directly behind Half-caste's.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        do not wish to call you half-caste
                        for the next five weeks.  What is
                        your proper name?

           With the fluidity of a water serpent, Billy Lee withdraws
           a revolver from the holster hidden beneath his suit jacket.

                                 HALF-CASTE
                        My Canhougache name is-

           BLAM.

           Half-caste's face explodes forward in a flurry of blood,
           bone and brain bits, as if he were screaming in crimson.

           Billy Lee holsters his pistol with another serpentine
           gesture.

           Half-caste slumps forward onto his white horse, his blood
           painting gory swatches across the steed's white hide.

           Grimacing at the macabre sight, Rodney looks over at Billy
           Lee.

                                 RODNEY
                        I was kind of curious what his
                        name was though.  Weren't you?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        No.  What that cannibal calls
                        himself or thinks is of less
                        consequence than a nigger's shit.

           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - NOON

           Billy Lee and Rodney ride in silence.  Rodney holds the
           lasso fastened around the white mare's neck; the third
           horse goes agreeably.  The brains and blood of the dead
           Native American have agglutinated beneath the hot sun: his
           broken face adheres to the mare's back upon which he still
           sits, slumped forward.

           The horses walk between the cacti that erratically sprout
           from the sere topography.

           Rodney points in the distance.

                                 RODNEY
                        I see Jordan.
                              (squinting)
                        It looks like he's still raping
                        that Amagana gal.
           Billy Lee says nothing.

           The horses walk forward, between the prickly limbs of the
           brown- and green-speckled cacti.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        D'you suppose he's been rapin' her
                        continually since we left him?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I believe you mean continuously.

                                 RODNEY
                        That's what I said.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        No.  You said continually, which
                        would mean repeatedly, or in
                        repeated succession but with breaks
                        in between.  Yet what I believe
                        you wanted to know was if he had
                        been raping that savage without
                        stopping since noon yesterday-
                        whether Jordan has been having his
                        way with her continuously for twenty-
                        four hours.

                                 RODNEY
                              (nodding)
                        Yeah, Billy Lee.  That's what I
                        wanted to know.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I doubt that that is physically
                        possible.

                                 RODNEY
                              (disappointed)
                        Yer probably right.

           The horses continue forward.

           Rodney squints and shades his eyes.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Why'd he tie her up to a cactus?

           Billy Lee lowers his hat's brim in an effort to see through
           the refracted light.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        She probably stopped screaming at
                        some point.  I am sure that being
                        bound face-first to a cactus makes
                        her far more demonstrative.
                                 RODNEY
                        Jordan likes it when they scream
                        and curse his name while he's having
                        at 'em.

           Billy Lee nods.

           The sound of distant SCREAMING become faintly audible.

           The horses continue forward.

           The distant sound of horrible SCREAMS waft across the cruel
           open air.

                                                                FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - NOON

           A freshly painted wooden sign swings from bright steel
           chainlinks.  Written upon the sign:  "You are now entering
           Rattleborge, Population 1647.  'Western Land with Southern
           Hospitality'"

           Behind the sign sits the town: new wood shaped into new

           buildings, intersected by roads for carriages.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - SAME

           MEN and WOMEN of variegated economic stature (as evidenced
           by their dress) walk up the central avenue, surveying the
           numerous cheerful storefronts- creameries, barbershops,
           funeral homes, chandleries, cobblers, saloons- and
           conversing.

           WALTER, a short man of thirty-seven with his blond hair
           neatly combed (parted in the middle) and wearing a freshly
           brushed striped suit, walks towards Sindy's Saloon.  He
           holds a box in his hands.  His tie has apparently been
           tied too tightly.

           He clears his throat and swallows dryly.

           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - SAME

           Walter walks into the unlit establishment, sunlight
           following him through the swinging doors.  The ceiling is
           high, and from it hang three electric candelabra, currently
           dark.  The swinging of the entrance doors causes light to
           flash on and off throughout the saloon.

           Twenty tables, several mismatched rugs, an upright piano
           and a long mahogany bar furnish the saloon.

           Walter looks around for a moment.

           From the shadows, comes a deep womanly voice.
                                 HUSKY FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        We're closed.

                                 WALTER
                        It is I.

                                 HUSKY FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Come back later.

                                 WALTER
                        It is Walter.

           Stepping from the shadows behind the bar, a bottle in either
           hand is SINDY, a buxom woman of forty-four with a beauty
           mark just above her full lips.  Her curly black hair is
           streaked with silver and tied up in a knot behind her head,
           away from her square, handsome face.

                                 SINDY
                        I know who it is.  Nobody else in
                        this entire town says, 'It is I.'

                                 WALTER
                        Well actually, it is grammatically
                        incorrect to say, 'It is me' 
                        because-

                                 SINDY
                        Go to England or London or New
                        York if you want to talk about
                        words all day.  What do you want?

           Walter opens his mouth to respond.

                                 SINDY
                              (continuing)
                        I hope whatever's in that box ain't
                        for me.

           Walter looks at the box in his hands as if it has magically
           appeared there.

                                 WALTER
                        Ummmm.

           Walter starts to get nervous.

           Sindy places the two whisky bottles on the bar and walks
           towards Walter.

                                 SINDY
                        Listen Walter...you are a nice
                        fella, and it's nice that you want
                        to give me things...but-

                                 WALTER
                        Don't you want them?  Don't you
                        use the dictionary I gave you? 
                        Don't you like me at least a little
                        bit?
           Sindy reaches Walter.  She is five inches taller than he
           is.

           Walter looks up at her.

           Sindy looks down at him.

                                 SINDY
                        We are not compatible.

                                 WALTER
                        Do you want to be a widow forever?

                                 SINDY
                        The first time you came in here,
                        you told me that my name was spelled
                        incorrectly.

                                 WALTER
                        But it's not too late to change
                        that!

           Sindy look irritated.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        That is why I purchased those books
                        for you...to help you learn-

                                 SINDY
                        Get out of here you irritating
                        little man.

           Walter's eyes narrow.  He throws the package onto the floor.

                                 WALTER
                        Spell your name however you like. 
                        You shan't see me anymore!

           Walter turns away from Sindy and leaves the saloon without
           looking back.

           Sindy looks at the the box on the floor, which had opened
           upon impact and spilled its contents.

           Partially obscured by lavender tissue paper, lies a doll
           in a silver dress.  The doll has black curly hair and a
           beauty mark above its full lips.  It stares up from the
           floor.

           Sindy picks the doll up and examines it.

           It is beautifully crafted and strikingly resembles Sindy.

           The eyes stare back at her, seemingly sentient.  The fingers
           are beautifully articulated curves and each nail is painted
           the exact same shade of violet as Sindy's present nail
           polish.

           Unexpected LAUGHTER bubbles up within her chest; she tosses
           the doll into the spittoon at the end of the bar.
           It CLANGS loudly within.

           Sindy retreats into the shadows.

           INT. ERMINE'S BARBERSHOP - DAY

           Four reclining barber chairs, each with bronze trim securing
           the upholstery, line the far wall of the shop.  A giant
           mirror and two wash basins line another wall, opposite a
           rack with several periodicals.

           ERMINE, a seventy year-old barber who looks and moves like
           a praying mantis, lathers up a heavyset CUSTOMER stretched
           out before him.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        That lather smells so good, I almost
                        want to eat it.

           Ermine smiles, dips the brush into the lather bowl, swirls
           it around, extricates a puff of foam and coats the
           customer's face.

                                 CUSTOMER
                              (continuing)
                        It smells like cakes- birthday
                        cakes.

           Ermine nods his head.  He rests the lather brush in the
           bowl and pulls out a straight razor.

                                 CUSTOMER
                              (continuing)
                        D'you hear about Binfrey's daughter?

           Ermine vigorously pulls his straight razor across the
           sharpening strap hanging beside the lather basin.  He shakes
           his head.

                                 ERMINE
                        Nope.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        An aunt o' hers- a fancy woman in
                        the east- passed on and left her a
                        lot of money and a phornagrap.

           Ermine approaches the man, the razor glinting in the
           streaming sunlight.

                                 ERMINE
                        A phonograph did you say?  Hmmm.
                        How much money do you suppose?

                                 CUSTOMER
                        A sizable sum.  Quite substantial.

           Ermine gently pulls stubble and suds away from the
           customer's face, exposing smooth pink swaths of skin.
                                 CUSTOMER
                              (continuing)
                        Smells like a birthday party.

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - AFTERNOON

           A forty-two year-old MAN with a gun on either hip walks
           towards the swinging town sign.  The man's clothing is
           black and covered with dust, as is his thick suitcase; he
           wears his black and gray hair long and untied; his short
           beard is closely shaved.

           His brown eyes are dark almost to the point of looking
           like burnished coals.  He has more than half a dozen deep,
           circular scars on his cheeks, ugly red craters burrowed
           into his sun-bronzed skin around his hawkish nose.  His
           hat is a wide brim with a dangling leather chin strap. 
           His name is ABRAHAM.

           Abraham walks directly to the swinging sign and runs his
           finger along the bevelled word, Rattleborge.

           He looks up at the town.

           Abraham walks forward.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham walks amongst the people of Rattleborge,
           conspicuously dark and dirty amidst their fresh, bright
           colors and faces.  His heavy boots sound noisily on the
           sidewalk planks beneath him.

           INT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham enters the lobby of the hotel- the motion of the
           door stirs a tiny bell to life.  RING. RING. RING.

           Abraham looks up at the two electric ceiling fans spinning
           above him.  He looks around the room, furnished with two
           green sofas, a periodical rack and a check-in counter,
           behind which sits MABELLE, a chubby young blond-haired
           woman of nineteen.  She looks up from the leatherbound
           novel that she clutches like an infant in her plump hands.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I would like to rent a room.

           Mabelle regards his dirty apparel and thick accent with
           suspicion.  She then sees the guns on his hips.

                                 MABELLE
                        Strangers aren't allowed to carry
                        guns in Rattleborge.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I'm sorry.  I was not aware of
                        this policy.  Where do I go to
                        turn in my pistols?

           The door opens, followed by the bell's insistent RINGING.
           A fifty-six year old man enters the room.  He is wearing
           brown slacks and a brown vest over a blue shirt.  He is
           tall, stocky and strong and has bright blue eyes lodged
           within his sun-wrinkled face.  What remains of his receded
           sandy hair is combed straight back.  His name is PICKMAN;
           he wears a sheriff's badge on his vest.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I'll take those pistols.

           Abraham reaches for his pistols.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I said, I'll take 'em.  Hold your
                        hands out and away from your sides.

           Abraham complies and slowly extends his arms out, away
           from his guns.

           Pickman approaches Abraham.

           Pickman reaches over and withdraws the pistols from
           Abraham's holsters.

           Pickman looks at Abraham's thick black suitcase.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        You got any guns in there?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I do not.

                                 PICKMAN
                        If you lie to me, I'll throw you
                        in jail and fine you every cent
                        you've got.  I'll only ask you one
                        more time- you got any guns in
                        there?

           Pickman taps the suitcase with the tip of his toe.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I do not.

           Pickman nods and grins, though the smile does not reach
           his deepset eyes.  He shoves Pickman's two pistols beneath
           his own belt, next to the two silver-plated revolvers he
           regularly carries.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        You might need a bigger belt,
                        Sheriff.

           Pickman admits a brief, but genuine CHUCKLE.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You can have these back whenever
                        you leave, Mister...
                                 ABRAHAM
                        Weiss.  Abraham Weiss.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Enjoy your stay in Rattleborge,
                        Mr. Weiss.

           The Sheriff turns and leaves.

           Abraham turns back to face Mabelle at the counter.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I would like to rent a room. 
                        Preferably one with no windows.

           Mabelle looks quizzically at Abraham.

                                 MABELLE
                        All of our rooms have windows, Mr. 
                        Weiss...hough there's one on the
                        third floor with only one window
                        on the south wall and it never
                        gets direct sunlight.  There's a
                        curtain you can draw if you choose
                        too.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (nodding)
                        Thank you.  That room will suffice.

           Mabelle smiles, though it is clear that she finds Abraham
           a bit unnerving.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - TWILIGHT

           The street is painted with golden twilight sun.  The long
           shadows of the strolling residents and rolling carriages
           streak across the dusty road.

           Sheriff Pickman, now wearing a brown hat to match his vest
           and pants, walks along the street, his sharp eyes surveying
           the people he protects.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sheriff!

           Pickman turns in the direction of the caller.

           A young couple seated in a horse drawn carriage rolls up
           the avenue.  GRANT waves amicably at Pickman and the woman
           beside him, DONNA, smiles pleasantly.  They are both dressed
           in immaculate clothing and have the bright teeth and shoes
           to match.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Good evening Mr. And Mrs. Grant
                        Tylor the Second.  Off to the church
                        dance I'm guessin'?
                                 GRANT
                              (effervescing)
                        We are indeed.  Reverend Hodgeson's
                        got a swell colored fella who can
                        sing and play piano better than
                        anyone I ever heard, white or
                        otherwise.  He makes you just want
                        to dance until you pass out from
                        so much sweating and screaming and
                        spinning and stomping.

           Pickman smirks at Grant's enthusiasm.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Well, don't trample Donna's sweet
                        feet with that fancy footwork of
                        yours.
                              (looking at Donna)
                        Count your toes when the evening's
                        through.  That's an order from the
                        Sheriff.

                                 DONNA
                        I will.

                                 PICKMAN
                        If you have any less than ten,
                        send for me or Deputy Cooperson.

                                 DONNA
                        I will.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Good night now.

                                 GRANT
                        Good night Sheriff.  May the Lord
                        watch over you as you watch over
                        us.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Let's hope he does that.

           Pickman grins, tilts his hat to the young couple and walks
           along the central street of his town.

           Pickman looks to his left.  The lights go on inside of
           Sindy's Saloon.  The buxom proprietor is talking to her
           employees; she does not look pleased.

           Pickman walks a few more paces, taking in the late day
           activities.  Five storefronts down, the praying mantis-
           like barber Ermine is closing his barbershop.

           The Sheriff stops for a moment.  He withdraws a cigarette
           from his vest and puts it into his mouth.  He strikes a
           match on the heel of his boot and lights his cigarette. 
           He shakes the match and drops the extinguished tinder into
           the pocket of his light blue shirt.
           Cigarette tip aglow, Pickman turns around and looks at the
           far end of the avenue, from which he came.  In the distance
           he sees Hotel Ruddington.  He stares at the hotel for a
           long, slow cigarette drag.

           As he exhales, his eyes turn to the two extra pistols lodged
           in his belt- Abraham Weiss' pistols.

           Pickman looks up from the stranger's guns and surveys the
           nearby storefronts.

           He sees: a creamery, another saloon, a funeral home, a pet
           shop, and a jewelry store.

           An elderly man with a tomato-red complexion and wiry,
           oversized hands stands outside of the jewelry store, locking
           the front door.  Pickman extinguishes his cigarette on the
           heel of his boot, drops it in his shirt pocket beside the
           used match, and jogs over to the establishment, named
           McDonelly's Fine Jewels and Things.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing; calling
                               ahead)
                        Mister McDonelly.  Just a moment.

           Pickman jogs up to the decking in front of the store.

           HUBERT MCDONELLY looks up in alarm, but relaxes when he
           recognizes Pickman.

                                 HUBERT
                        I'm glad it's you Sheriff.  As a
                        jeweler, I've not had too many
                        good experiences that began with
                        someone running at me and hollering.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (winded)
                        apologize...Mr. McDonelly-

                                 HUBERT
                        Hubert, please.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I apologize Hubert.  I just wanted
                        to get your opinion on something
                        before you left for home.

           Hubert's shoulders slump; he looks disappointed.

                                 HUBERT
                        Today was a slow day...I was hoping
                        you wanted to buy something for
                        the little lady.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Things are a bit tight right now,
                        but whenever the Mayor pays out
                        that bonus he owes me, I promise
                        I'll come here right away.
           Hubert shrugs, accepting but not pleased with this
           compromise.

           He licks a brass key and then inserts it into the top lock
           and undoes the latch.  He then licks an iron key and inserts
           it into the keyhole above the doorknob and twists it.

                                 HUBERT
                        They don't slide in correctly unless
                        you lubricate them.

           With a huge, knob-knuckled hand, he gestures for the Sheriff
           to enter McDonelly's Fine Jewels and Things.

           INT. MCDONELLY'S FINE JEWELS AND THINGS - SAME

           A glass counter filled with jewelry and less valuable
           knickknacks lines three of the four walls of the
           establishment, leaving only a narrow space behind it for
           Hubert to maneuver.  Another locked door leads to the
           inventory room.

           Some golden twilight sneaks past the windows, though the
           space is predominantly dark.

                                 HUBERT
                        As a rule, I don't turn the electric
                        lights on after closing time.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I'd not ask it of you.

           Hubert nods in affirmation.

                                 HUBERT
                        How can I be of service to
                        Rattleborge's finest?

                                 PICKMAN
                        stranger come into town today- a
                        queer looking fellow- swarthy,
                        covered with scars and dressed up
                        all in black.  His accent definitely
                        marked him for European, but shoot
                        me in the foot if I can tell which
                        country he comes from, though not
                        England- I heard plenty of
                        Englishmen in my time.

                                 HUBERT
                        I don't like Englishmen.  Not one
                        bit.  They walk around thinking
                        they're so smart and proper.  When
                        my father died with the fever, his
                        doctor was English.
                        That fancy accent didn't help my
                        father none.  Whenever I hear a
                        man speak that way- in that
                        effeminate, nigh unintelligible
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUBERT (CONT'D)
                        style-  I always thing of that
                        damn English doctor saying,
                              (in an English accent)
                        "There is nothing I can do for
                        him."

                                 PICKMAN
                        I'm not fond of the English myself. 
                        But, as I said, the stranger isn't
                        English or French, cause I heard
                        some Frenchmen in my time too.

                                 HUBERT
                        A French woman-- now that's a thing
                        to hear.  That damn accent is so
                        adorable it tickles your eardrums
                        like pink feathers.

                                 (Hubert smiles upon
                        reflection)
                        So where is this fella from, you
                        s'pose?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Perhaps Sweden or Germany, or some
                        other way off place.  I was hoping
                        you could help figure out a little
                        bit about him.  As with any stranger
                        who walks into town, I confiscated
                        his pistols.

                                 HUBERT
                              (nodding approbation)
                        That's showin' him who carries the
                        stick in these parts.  You want me
                        to examine his guns?

           Pickman nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I do.

           The Sheriff withdraws one of the pistols from his belt and
           lays it upon a portion of the counter illuminated by the
           orange twilight.

           Hubert walks behind the counter and from a hidden shelf
           picks up a lorgnette.

           Pickman looks at the gilded, long-handled opera glasses
           with mild amusement.

                                 HUBERT
                        My jeweler's eyepiece broke.  I
                        ordered a new one from the east,
                        but in the meantime I'm using the
                        wife's opera glasses.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You're a resourceful fellow.
           Hubert raises the lorgnette to his eyes and looks at the
           pistol resting upon the counter.  He squints.

           Hubert takes a couple of steps away from the pistol, still
           looking through the lorgnette.

                                 HUBERT
                        Problem is, you can't stand too
                        close to what you're looking at.

           Hubert takes a third step away from the pistol, still
           peering through the lorgnette.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Steisselbach.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Pardon me?

                                 HUBERT
                        Steisselbach.  Engraved beneath
                        the barrel it says Steisselbach.
                              (looking at Pickman)
                        Was that the fella's name?

                                 PICKMAN
                        That's not the name he proffered. 
                        He called himself Abraham Weiss.

           Hubert's eyes return to the lorgnette, oddly magnified by
           the bulbous glass at the far end.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        You think he lied to me about his
                        name or do you suppose that
                        Steisselbach is the make of the
                        pistol?

                                 HUBERT
                        I think it's the make of the
                        pistol...or possibly the name of
                        the town the pistol was made in.

           Hubert rests the lorgnette upon the glass counter.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Mind if I handle the weapon,
                        Sheriff?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Go ahead, but be careful- it's
                        loaded.

           Hubert walks over to the gun and lifts it.  He SNAPS the
           front suspension lever down and the barrel swivels out
           into a loading position in one quick, automated motion.
                                 HUBERT
                        Fancy.

           Hubert plucks a bullet from a chamber and places the gun
           down upon the counter.

           Hubert raises the bullet to his eye, squinting.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Hmmm.

           Hubert rests the bullet in the patch of sunlight and again
           lifts the lorgnette to his face.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Hmmmmmm.

           Hubert take one mincing step backward, staring at the bullet
           through the lorgnette.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Well!

           Pickman patiently awaits Hubert's explanation.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        Sheriff, would you mind placing a
                        few more rounds from that gun beside
                        the one I'm lookin' at?

           Pickman upends Weiss' pistol; the bullets fall into his
           cupped left hand.

           Pickman stands the bullets up beside the first like little
           toy soldiers.

           Hubert swivels his head and lorgnette almost imperceptibly.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        An illustration has been etched
                        into the head of each bullet.  The
                        etching is of a young woman's face. 
                        A pretty, dark-haired gal with a
                        long nose.

           Pickman picks up one of the rounds and raises it into the
           streaming sunlight.  He squints as he stares at it, in an
           effort to discern the image.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I can barely see it, but I see it.

           Hubert, nodding, rests the lorgnette down and looks at
           Pickman.
                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        You ever come across bullets like
                        these before?

                                 HUBERT
                        Never.  To carve such detailed
                        work by hand...is far beyond the
                        capabilities of any jeweler I've
                        ever met.

           Hubert taps his knob-knuckled fingers on his forehead as
           he ponders the bullets.

                                 HUBERT
                              (continuing)
                        They say that the most skilled
                        Chinese can paint a pretty vista
                        on a single grain of rice.  Any
                        chance that this fella's a Chinaman?

           Pickman walks over to Weiss' pistol and one by one returns
           the cartridges to their chambers.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Nah.  He's no Oriental.

           Pickman shuts the cylinder with a CLICK.

                                 HUBERT
                        You gonna lock him up?

           Pickman shoves the pistol back into his belt; he tucks his
           blue shirt further in and shakes his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                        For having pretty bullets?  No law
                        against that.

           Hubert seems a little disappointed that no arrest will be
           made.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Thanks for your time and your
                        knowledge Hubert.  You been a big
                        help.

                                 HUBERT
                        Thanks for keeping our town safe
                        Sheriff.  Remember McDonelly's
                        Fine Jewels and Things after the
                        Mayor pays out that bonus he owes
                        you.  And you deserve it too- I've
                        never heard of any town this size
                        without a single killing in its
                        books.

           Pickman nods, grins, turns and departs.
           EXT. PICKMAN'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Just beyond the perimeter of downtown Rattleborge lie the
           houses of its citizens, each set upon half or full acre
           lots of green grass demarcated by white, brown or yellow
           picket fences.

           Half a mile into this grouping of domiciles sits Sheriff
           Pickman's house, a dark brown two story edifice with bright
           yellow fences and trim.

           Pickman walks up the stone walkway towards the wooden porch
           that fronts his house.  He carries a brown paper bag, the
           contents of which are seemingly substantial.  He no longer
           carries Weiss' pistols.

           From the yard next door come the shrill GIGGLES of two
           boys running after each other in a heated game of tag.

           Pickman walks up the steps, onto his porch.

           Pickman walks over to the cast-iron bootscrape beside the
           door and drags the soles of his brown leather boots across
           its ridge, one after the other.

           INT. GREETING ROOM - SAME

           The Sheriff walks into the greeting area.  He rests the
           bag on a nearby table, hangs his hat and his jacket on the
           wrought iron coat rack and stretches his arms.

           He picks up the brown bag and walks down the hall.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Beside the wood-burning stove is a long butcher block
           counter, at which stands VALERIE, a petite blond woman of
           forty-three years.  Her delicate pretty features belie her
           age- she could pass for ten or fifteen years younger than
           she is- but a few hard lines crack the edges of her eyes
           and the sides of her nose, indicating that she is not in
           her twenties.

           Valerie is busy rolling out the dough for a pie crust and
           does not notice Pickman enter the room.

           He watches her roll out the dough and dust it ceremonially
           with flour as if she were a holy priest.  She presses the
           heel of her hand into the dough and works it out from the
           center in circular motions.  She picks up a tarnished fork
           and pricks the dough in a rapid, systematic way.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You baking that for me, Val?

           Valerie looks up from the pie.

                                 VALERIE
                        No.
           Pickman is surprised by his wife's brusque response.  He
           sets down the brown paper bag and walks over to her.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Somethin' the matter?

                                 VALERIE
                        Alicia Binfrey's aunt died.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That's sad...though I wasn't aware
                        that you had any dealings with
                        Alicia Binfrey's aunt.

                                 VALERIE
                        I don't.  I didn't.

           Pickman waits for his wife to explain.

           Valerie shakes the flour from her hands and SIGHS.

                                 VALERIE
                              (continuing)
                        Janice suggested that we all bake
                        pies and take them over to Alicia
                        Binfrey's to show our sorrow at
                        her loss.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Seems like a considerate thing to
                        do.

                                 VALERIE
                        It's not.  Janice doesn't like
                        Alicia at all, not one bit...she
                        just wants to ingratiate herself
                        to Alicia, now that Alicia's wealthy
                        and has a phonograph.

           Pickman shakes his head, disapprovingly.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Well that seems a bit low.

                                 VALERIE
                              (nodding)
                        It is.  But if I didn't make
                        anything, Janice and the ladies
                        would spend the entire afternoon
                        at Alicia's making derisive remarks
                        about me.  So I made this- to thwart
                        her.

           Valerie nods affirming her plan.  She points to the pie
           crust and the nearby bowl containing a macerated cherry,
           ripe rhubarb and sour brandy filling.
                                 VALERIE
                              (continuing)
                        I'll deliver it tomorrow morning-
                        just before the other ladies show
                        up- and express my condolences to
                        Alicia.  I'll leave when Janice
                        and the ladies arrive, so that
                        they know they've been beaten.  If
                        I have to play their stupid game,
                        I might as well put some matches
                        in their garters.

           Pickman's face is split wide by a gigantic grin.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You're adorable.  Even when you're
                        devious you're cuter than a kitten
                        made out of polka-dotted cotton
                        candy.

           Pickman licks his thumb and wipes a smudge of flour from
           his wife's chin.

                                 VALERIE
                        If I were taller, you would take
                        me more seriously.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Six days a week I walk around with
                        guns on my hips, looking into the
                        malicious eyes of miscreants,
                        locking up churlish drunks and
                        breaking up disputes, civil and
                        otherwise.  When I come home, the
                        last thing I want to be is serious. 
                        I want to feel the lightness of
                        youth Val, not the weight of the
                        grave.

           Pickman runs his hand over his bare scalp to the point
           from which his retreating hair has not yet surrendered.

                                 VALERIE
                        Roger...

                                 PICKMAN
                        You keep me feeling young Val, and
                        dammit if you don't look exactly
                        the same as when I first met you.

           Valerie just stares at her husband, smiling, flushed, her
           eyes sparkling.

                                 VALERIE
                        What a flatterer you are, Sheriff.

           She leans over and kisses Pickman on the mouth.  He wraps
           his strong arms around her and kisses her back,
           passionately.
           EXT. CATTLEBRUSH CASINO - NIGHT

           Men in suits or tuxedos and ladies in formal gowns walk up
           to the casino's facade, which has an electric sign comprised
           of small illumined light bulbs reading, 'Cattlebrush.'

           INT. CATTLEBRUSH CASINO - NIGHT

           The casino is near its capacity, with over one hundred
           patrons inside, gambling, talking, drinking and laughing.

           Ten card tables line one wall and five roulette wheels
           another.  Waitresses selling cigars and carrying drinks
           weave throughout the seated patrons.

           In the back corner is a staircase leading up to an oaken
           door; beveled into the solitary door are two words, 'Men's
           Club.'

           Three elderly men in worn, denuded tuxedoes walk into the
           casino's main entrance.  Each man clutches the gilded head
           of a long slender cane in his right hand.  They are all
           tall and slender and posses an impressive amount of white
           hair, especially when considering that the youngest is at
           least eighty years old.  They are the GOULEY BROTHERS.

           A few patrons point to or eyeball the Gouley Brothers.

           The Gouley Brothers slowly walk across the casino's polished
           floor, the crowd parting before them.

           They surround a blackjack table and take three seats, beside
           the two PLAYERS already seated.  Each of the Gouley Brothers
           rests his cane across his lap.

           The DEALER, a twenty-five year-old man with a patch over
           his left eye, SIGHS.  The other two PLAYERS at the blackjack
           table stand up and leave.

           The table now belongs to the Gouleys.

           Each Gouley tosses two chips to the center of the green
           felt-covered table, as does the Dealer.

                                 GREG GOULEY
                              (to the dealer)
                        Deal.

           The dealer slaps cards face down in front of each Gouley
           and then returns with the face up card: seven of hearts,
           ace of clubs, and a five of spades.

           The Gouleys peek at their hidden cards.

           The dealer lays a nine of clubs upon his own face-down
           card.

                                 GREG GOULEY
                              (continuing)
                        Hit.
                                 GARRET GOULEY
                        Stick.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        Hit.

           The dealer makes his second pass: jack of clubs, and a six
           of hearts.

                                 GREG GOULEY
                        I'm busted.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        Hold.

                                 GARRET GOULEY
                              (to Godfrey)
                        I say we double the pot.

           Garret throws in four chips.  Godfrey nods and throws in
           four chips.

           The Dealer shakes his head.

                                 DEALER
                        The house folds.

           Garret shows his hand: a nine and an ace.

           Godfrey shows his hand: a ten, a five and a six.

           Godfrey grabs the sixteen chips.  He gives five to Garret,
           five to Greg and keeps the other six.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        Let's raise the ante.

           The Dealer looks sourly at the old men.

           Across the way at the bar, sits the diminutive, blonde-
           haired doll-maker Walter, nursing a large beer stein.  He
           still wears the snug suit that he wore to Sindy's Saloon
           earlier that day.  He watches the Gouley Brothers play
           cards through the mirror hanging behind the shelves of
           liquor.

           The BARTENDER, a young man with freckles, sandy hair and a
           red bow-tie, walks over to Walter.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You want another?

                                 WALTER
                        Thank you, but I've not yet quaffed
                        this one in its entirety.

           The Bartender blinks quizzically at Walter's diction and
           then turns to walk away to another customer.  Walter calls
           after him.
                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        Excuse me sir.

           The Bartender turns back around.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        I wish to put a query to you.  Why
                        is it that nobody chooses to play
                        cards with those octogenarians? 
                        They seem like respectable
                        gentlemen.

                                 BARTENDER
                        The Gouley Brothers?  Any blackjack
                        table they sit at loses money,
                        plain and simple.  One of the
                        Gouleys- I'm not sure which- plays
                        it risky and usually busts.  He
                        always goes for twenty-one even if
                        he's got a strong hand like eighteen
                        or nineteen.  Another one plays it
                        in the middle, hoping for twenty-
                        one, but sticking with anything
                        higher than sixteen.  And the last
                        Gouley, he plays it very safe, in
                        case the other two bust.  In the
                        end, they don't care which one
                        wins at all, as long as the house
                        loses.  And once they sit, they
                        stay seated until closing time-
                        I've never once seen any of 'em
                        get a drink or go to the toilet.

           Walter turns around on the bar stool- from which his short
           legs dangle like a child's in a high chair- and looks at
           the Gouley Brothers.  Greg Gouley is dividing his newly
           acquired chips between himself and his two brothers.

           Walter turns back to the Bartender.

                                 WALTER
                        That table can seat as many as
                        nine players.  They could be beaten
                        if other people stayed on and played
                        against them.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Well they got an additional strategy
                        workin' for 'em-- they smell like
                        skunk puke.

           The door to the casino swings wide and in steps a man
           wearing brown pants, a blue shirt, a leather tie and a
           brown vest with a badge.  He is twenty-eight, fit, handsome
           and has his sandy hair cut so short it looks like velvet. 
           He is DEPUTY COOPERSON.

           Two WAITRESSES carrying cigar boxes on silver trays make a
           beeline for Deputy Cooperson.
           Cooperson's hazel eyes flicker to both of the women
           scuttling towards him, and the cigar boxes nestled below
           their voluminous cleavage.

           Walter enviously watches the pair of shapely women move
           towards the deputy.

                                 WALTER
                        I'd wager handsomely that Deputy
                        Cooperson could bed any woman of
                        his choosing in Rattleborge- married
                        or otherwise.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I'd not take that wager- he could,
                        only he won't: he's a pious man.

           Truly devout.  And smart too.  He studied to be a lawyer
           back in Massachusetts.  Went to some fancy college and
           everything.

                                 WALTER
                        How did he wind up in Rattleborge?

           The Bartender shrugs.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Perhaps being Catholic ain't the
                        way to go.

           The first Waitress kisses Cooperson on the cheek, slowly
           with a little, almost inaudible, SIGH.

           The second Waitress kisses Cooperson on the opposite side
           of his face, even more slowly.  She MOANS quietly when she
           withdraws her plush lips from his clean-shaven cheek, where
           she has painted her lips in carmine.

                                 BARTENDER
                              (continuing)
                        Or perhaps being Catholic is the
                        way to go.

           INT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - TEN O'CLOCK PM

           Mabelle sits at the hotel counter clutching her book,
           reading by the light of an oil lamp set upon the counter. 
           Her concentration upon the book she grips is quite
           tremendous the book is entitled, 'The Weird Black Mask
           from the Golden Ziggurat of Nango-to.'

           She hears a GROAN coming from upstairs.

           Mabelle inserts her placeholder, shuts the book and looks
           worriedly at the stairwell.

           After a moment's indecision, she hops off of the stool and
           walks toward the stairs.

           She looks up towards darkened landing of the second floor.
           She listens for a moment, but hears nothing.

           Mabelle apprehensively puts her foot on the first stair;
           it CREAKS loudly beneath her.

           Something SLAMS loudly upstairs.  Mabelle jumps at the
           abrupt sound.

           The chubby receptionist walks back to the counter and lifts
           the oil lantern by its curved suspension handle.  Swallowing
           her fear, she turns back to the stairwell and walks towards
           it.

           She looks up at the darkened landing of the second floor,
           raising her lantern aloft, ahead of her.

           The luminance of the lantern spills onto the landing,
           revealing...nothing.

           Mabelle ascends the stairwell, each step CREAKING beneath
           her.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

           Mabelle, gripping the banister, climbs to the second level.

           She walks across the empty landing to the foot of the next
           stairwell.

           Mabelle raises the lantern.

           Abraham, wearing a long black robe, is standing on the
           landing, staring down at her.

           Mabelle SCREAMS.

           Abraham takes a step down the staircase, towards Mabelle. 
           He is shaking his head back and forth.  His scarred face
           is pale and covered with a sheen of sweat; a lone trickle
           of blood drips from his right cheek.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        What is the matter?

           Mabelle takes one step back, away from Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        I mean you no harm sweet child.

                                 MABELLE
                        I-I heard a n-noise.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I apologize if I disturbed you...I
                        will be more considerate in the
                        future.  Good evening.

           Abraham turns away from Mabelle.
           As he walks up the stairs, Mabelle resolves to take charge
           of the situation.

                                 MABELLE
                        What're you doing up there, in th-
                        that room?

           Abraham does not turn around, but continues up the stairs
           and, enshrouded in his black robe, disappears into the
           darkness.

                                 MABELLE
                              (continuing)
                        Excuse me, Mr. Weiss?

           The sound of his door being SHUT and then LOCKED is his
           tacit response.

           INT. PICKMAN'S BEDROOM - ELEVEN O'CLOCK

           Pickman and Valerie lie in bed together; they are both
           nude.

           A thin sheet covers each them from the waist down.

           Valerie lies on her stomach and Pickman on his side, running
           his weathered fingertips up and down the smooth crevasse
           in the center of his wife's back.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Are you gonna make me take another
                        bath?

                                 VALERIE
                        No.  But perhaps you should wash
                        out your mustache.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Nah, I like it when it smells that
                        way.

           Valerie looks into her husband's eyes.

                                 VALERIE
                        That's sweet.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Not really.  More like calf's liver
                        mixed with catch of the day.

           Valerie playfully pokes Pickman in the side.  He CHORTLES.

                                 VALERIE
                        Well I guess it's a good thing
                        that your mother made you eat so
                        much liver when you were little.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Bein' from Texas ain't all bad.

           Pickman kisses his wife on the neck.
                                 VALERIE
                        Any news from the Mayor on when
                        he's paying out that bonus?

           Pickman SIGHS.

                                 PICKMAN
                        He's got other priorities right
                        now, the harvest-

                                 VALERIE
                        Don't make excuses for him, Roger. 
                        He promised you an additional
                        stipend if you kept this town safe
                        and you have.  Not one killing
                        since you've been Sheriff- not
                        one.  Besides, we could really use
                        the money.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I know, I know.  I'll talk to him
                        tomorrow.  You happy?

                                 VALERIE
                        I will be in a moment, Sheriff.

           Valerie smiles as she slides her hand beneath the sheet,
           between her husband's legs.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Woman, you've got one hell of a
                        naughty left hand.

           Pickman grabs her left shoulder and rolls her onto her
           back; he then climbs on top of her, bringing his face
           immediately before hers.  She wraps her legs around him,
           her feet poking up through the sheet tangled about their
           waists.

           They look into each other's eyes and find a slow rhythm
           together.

           They do not say another word.

           INT. MEN'S CLUB WITHIN THE CATTLEBRUSH CASINO - MIDNIGHT

           The Men's Club is filled with thick cigar smoke and the
           five beefy bull-like MEN who exhale it.  They sit in plushly
           upholstered chairs surrounded by ashtrays, leather-bound
           books and small dark drinks.

           Deputy Cooperson opens the door and walks into the room;
           one of the waitresses, JESS WALKER, showcasing her luminous
           smile and voluminous cleavage, is hooked to his left elbow. 
           He shuts the door behind him.

           HOGAN, a beefy sixty-two year old man in a shinning blue
           suit with gray pinstripes, looks up through his spectacles
           at the Deputy and his companion.
                                 HOGAN
                              (to Cooperson)
                        Didn't seem to me to be that
                        complicated of a concept.  Rather
                        simple in fact, I'd say, especially
                        for a scholar.

           DUGAN, his portlier mirror image, nods in agreement.

                                 DUGAN
                        Especially when considering that
                        superior background he's got.

           Hogan inhales deeply through his fat cigar.  He exhales.

                                 HOGAN
                        Men's club.

           Cooperson smiles, revealing two perfect rows of teeth.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (with a slight Boston
                               accent)
                        I do not plan on staying Mayor
                        Hogan- I promised to escort Miss
                        Walker home this evening.  But
                        before I do so, I wanted to stop
                        in and make a recommendation, if I
                        may.

           Mayor Hogan looks at Dugan and the other three men's club
           Bulls.

                                 HOGAN
                              (to the club members)
                        Shall I indulge the Deputy?

                                 DUGAN
                        Indulge the deputy.

           Hogan waves theatrically with his cigar.

                                 HOGAN
                        The Mayor awaits his Deputy's fine
                        and thoughtful council.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Now I know that you have a lot of
                        things on your table at all times...

                                 HOGAN
                              (to the Bulls)
                        Is that...is he...is he remarking
                        upon my...my girth?  I thought I
                        was slim and waifish.

           The men's club Bulls LAUGH, as does Hogan himself.
                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Continue Deputy.  I was just havin'
                        some fun at my own expense.

                                 COOPERSON
                        I know you are a busy man, but I
                        wanted to suggest that- if you
                        could find the time- you pay Sheriff
                        Pickman that bonus you have promised
                        him.

                                 HOGAN
                        I was gettin' around to it, I was
                        gettin' around to it...and I'll
                        swear that to any lord not listenin'
                        right now.

           The Bulls LAUGH.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Why you so concerned with Pickman's
                        pay?

                                 COOPERSON
                        Pickman is a mighty and rightfully
                        proud man and I think he feels
                        embarrassed to ask you about his
                        due...yet he and Mrs. Pickman are
                        still in debt to the bank and living
                        tight.  They took out a lot of
                        loans when their little girl became
                        ill...and...and afterwards.

           Hogan's jovial demeanor abates; he shakes his head sadly.

                                 HOGAN
                        Say not another word Cooperson,
                        not another word on the matter. 
                        I've been thoughtless.  An
                        inconsiderate ass.  Best Sheriff
                        in the West deserves his bonus and
                        probably a raise too.  It's only
                        because Pickman does such a fine
                        job that I don't think about him
                        nor any o' you Deputies too often--
                        and that's an entirely truthful
                        fact.  I'll see the treasurer about
                        it first thing tomorrow.

           Cooperson nods appreciatively.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Thank you Mayor.  Have a good night
                        fellas.

           Cooperson turns around, still escorting Jess Walker by the
           arm.
                                 HOGAN
                        Aren't you a devout man, Deputy?

           Cooperson turns his head and nods.

                                 COOPERSON
                        I am.

           Hogan raises his cigar in the air and points the smoldering
           end in the direction of Jess Walker's posterior.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        I am escorting Miss Walker home,
                        nothing more.

           Jess frowns slightly at the Deputy's words.

           Cooperson and Jess leave, shutting the door behind
           themselves.

           Dugan sips some brandy and looks at the Mayor.

                                 DUGAN
                        You believe the Deputy?  You think
                        he's just gonna walk that pretty
                        gal home and not invite himself
                        in?

                                 HOGAN
                        I do believe him, I do.  Deputy
                        Cooperson's head is so full of
                        book knowledge and Jesus that
                        there's no room left for the good
                        stuff.
                              (beat)
                        He's the smartest imbecile I ever
                        met.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cooperson walks along the avenue, escorting Jess Walker,
           who now wears a longcoat over her skimpy waitress attire.

           Jess stares at Cooperson, while he stares at the stars.

                                 JESS
                        Thank you for walking me back,
                        Deputy.

                                 COOPERSON
                        My pleasure.  I enjoy any
                        opportunity to serve the people of
                        Rattleborge and admire the majestic
                        creations of the Lord.

           Jess is disappointed by his answer; Cooperson is oblivious
           to her reaction.
                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Have you ever seen the aurora
                        borealis, Miss Walker- the northern
                        lights?

                                 JESS
                        What're those?

                                 COOPERSON
                        It's a diaphanous sheet of light
                        that floats at the top world. 
                        Some scientists think that it's a
                        reflection of the sun from the
                        other side of the world, but that's
                        too simple and moreover it doesn't
                        explain why it's there.

                                 JESS
                        Why do you think it's there, Deputy?

                                 COOPERSON
                        I think it's God's way of saying,
                        'I am here and I will protect you.'

           Directly in front of Ermine's Barbershop, Jess stops walking
           and turns to face Cooperson.  She looks at him, closes her
           eyes and tilts her head back, waiting to be kissed.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        You are a pretty woman Jess Walker-
                        painfully pretty- but I am afraid
                        that we had best keep walking.

           Jess opens her eyes, which sparkle with tears.  Cooperson
           takes her arm again and they continue to walk up the avenue.

           Up ahead, Cooperson see two MEN engaging in a heated
           argument.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing; calling
                               ahead)
                        Simmer down there, gentlemen!

           The two MEN continue arguing.  Cooperson looks at Jess.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Just a moment Miss Walker.

           Cooperson jogs over to the arguing Men.

           One of them hold a broken bottle, the other a knife.

           With his right hand, Cooperson withdraws one of his two
           pistols.  He points it at the ground.

           BLAM.
           The two Men look over at him.

           Cooperson draws his second pistol.  In an instant, he trains

           a barrel at each man's left kneecap.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Drop your weapons unless you like
                        the idea of limping for the rest
                        of your days.  I swear to Christ
                        almighty that I will not ask you
                        second time.

           The Men stare at him, the fury of their argument rapidly
           abating.

           The first man drops his knife; the second man tosses the
           neck of the broken bottle towards the barbershop.

           Cooperson lowers his pistols, but keeps them drawn.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        What was the squabble about?  A
                        girl?  Someone cheated at cards? 
                        Someone insulted someone's boots
                        or hat?  Trust me fellas, whatever
                        it is, it's not worth getting
                        knifed, gouged, shot in the leg or
                        locked up over.  Pick up your hats.

           The Men walk over to their respective hats and put them on
           again.  They both stare at the ground.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Charlie you walk north, Haskell
                        you walk south.  If either of you
                        turn around- even for a moment-
                        I'll throw you in jail for a whole
                        week for disturbing the peace.  If
                        there is some legal matter that
                        needs judicial resolution, take it
                        to the courts in the morning. 
                        Start walking.

           Each Man nods, turns away and walks off.

           Cooperson walks back to Jess Walker, his eye vacillating
           between the retreating men.  He holsters his two pistols.

           Jess stares at Cooperson, impressed.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Sorry about that Miss Walker.

           Cooperson takes Jess' arm and continues up the street.
                                 JESS
                        Why don't you like me Deputy?  Is
                        it because I'm a widow or I'm not
                        educated enough to know about the
                        northern lights?  Is it because I
                        have a daughter waitin' for me at
                        home or that I make a livin' wearing
                        immodest clothing?

                                 COOPERSON
                        It is no reflection on you
                        whatsoever, but I am the Lord's
                        man.

                                 JESS
                        Why'd you even come to Rattleborge,
                        if you don't want a wife or a family
                        or nothin'?  Why didn't you become
                        a lawyer like you went to school
                        for?

                                 COOPERSON
                        The devil's hand tangled up the
                        laws out east- made a quagmire of
                        simple right and wrong- and I could
                        no longer do His bidding in such a
                        convoluted and specious system. 
                        Out here, I can do His work and
                        help His people.

                                 JESS
                        But you walk me home all of the
                        time, me!  You pick me, when all
                        of the girls like you- and Annie
                        and Stacy are much prettier besides-
                        but you pick me and everytime I
                        think, 'This is the time, this is
                        the time he's gonna come inside.' 
                        But you don't, you don't ever come
                        in.

           Cooperson looks at the upset woman and shakes his head,
           somewhat remorsefully.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Nor will I.  I never intended to
                        mislead you...I thought by now you
                        would understand what kind of a
                        fellow I am.

           Jess is about to respond, but shakes her head and looks
           away from him.

           EXT. JESS WALKER'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           The house is a small A-frame house, with a tiny attic
           serving as its second floor.  The blue moonlight reaches
           through the surrounding trees, dappling the plain, unpainted
           wood.

           Cooperson and Jess walk up to the front door.
                                 JESS
                        Thank you for walking me home,
                        Deputy.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Goodnight ma'am.

           Jess nods and enters her house, sullen and dejected.

           Cooperson stays outside as Jess shuts the door from within.

           Cooperson turns away from the house and begins to walk
           towards the road.

           He grits his teeth and begins to perspire.  He turns around
           and looks again at Jess's house.

           The Deputy is deeply conflicted.

           After another moment's deliberation, Cooperson walks towards
           the front door, but just before he reaches it, he walks
           into the trees nearby and hides.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing;
                               muttering)
                        Oh Christ.

           Cooperson walks deeper into the copse of trees abutting
           the house.  His forehead glistens with sweat.  He turns
           back and looks again at Jess' house.

           Cooperson looks into a bedroom window at the rear of the
           home.

           BETTY, a girl of five years, lies asleep in her bed.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Christ.

           Cooperson looks at Betty's long eyelashes...and her pudgy
           little lips...and her long golden hair...and her curled
           little fingers.  His eyes fill with tears.

           Betty turns over in her small, polka-dotted bed; her

           nightgown droops from her left shoulder.

           Cooperson stares at her with a wanton look in his eyes. 
           His composure is utterly rigid.  He swallows as his eyes
           roam across her face and arms and pristine white neck...

           Cooperson punches the trunk of the tree he hides behind. 
           He punches it again.  And again.

           The Deputy looks at his knuckles which are now abraded and
           bleeding.  He turns away from the window and flees the
           copse, beneath the watchful blue orb of the moon.
           EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - SAME

           Walter, the diminutive dollmaker, walks up the dusty
           suburban road towards his home- a yellow one-storey house
           set upon a half-acre of land.

           He nears the wooden gate that surrounds his property. 
           Atop the gate are the carved heads of his four wooden
           sentries: a bear snarling, a dog growling, an alligator
           baring its teeth and a lion roaring.

           Grabbing the lion's head, Walter swings the gate open and
           enters his property.  He shuts the gate behind him and
           walks on the path of broken stone towards his front door.

           He does not see the man who watches him from the shadows
           of the trees nearby.

           That man is Abraham Weiss.

           INT. CHURCH SOCIAL HALL - HALF PAST MIDNIGHT

           The high hall is filled with exhausted dancers and fatigued
           onlookers.  Only seven couples are currently able to keep
           up with the indefatigable pianist, an African American man
           nicknamed MANGO.  The shirt he wears beneath his brown
           suit is the very color of his favorite fruit.  His up-tempo
           music reverberates throughout the vast enclosure.

           Amongst those still dancing are Grant and Donna Tylor the
           Second, both of whom are red-faced and practically
           delirious.

           Mango hammers out a quick twelve bar shuffle for the
           churchgoers.  Occasionally, while pushing the tempo, he
           throws in a clashing block chord.  The dancers do not
           notice, but some of the older people seated along the walls
           throw a suspicious eye his way.

                                 GRANT
                              (panting)
                        Don't hold back, Mango!
                              (gasp)
                        Don't...don't spare us...us white
                        folk nothin'!

           Mango switches meter, momentarily disorienting the revelers.

           For a brief moment, all of the dancers are lost, helplessly
           swimming in between the beats of music.

           An old man falls to the floor, with an awkward THUMP.

           At the head of the next measure, the dancers find the
           skipping beat and move accordingly.

           Mango opens his mouth wide.

                                 MANGO
                              (singing)
                        The swamp is breeeeeeeeathing...
           He runs a diminished scale down the upright piano.

                                 MANGO
                              (continuing; singing)
                        The bats, they are
                        whiiiiiiiiirling...

           He runs another diminished scale, down the keyboard and
           then up it again.

                                 MANGO
                              (continuing; singing)
                        And the white folk, the white folk
                        talk to the woman in the woods...

           Grant whirls Donna around, spellbound by the music.

           Hubert McDonelly, the red-faced jeweller, and his wife
           ELIZA, watch Mango, their lips wrinkled with disdain.

                                 MANGO
                              (continuing; singing)
                        Sally, Sally, Sally, Sally, give
                        us back the little ones.  Sally,
                        Sally, Saaaaaaaaaaallly.  Where
                        are the little ones?

           He pounds a chord.

                                 MANGO
                              (continuing; singing)
                        'In the swamp,' she says, 'In the
                        swamp, the little ones're flying,
                        flyyyyyyyinnnnng.'

           Donna and Grant whirl in ecstasy.

           EXT. ALICIA BINFREY'S MANSION - SAME

           Set upon a five acre lot at the edge of town sits Alicia
           Binfrey's mansion, a three story behemoth of a house,
           painted an off-white color, trimmed with maroon.

           Valerie, in a light blue dress, walks towards the imposing
           edifice, holding a wicker basket in her right hand and a
           small white parasol in her left.  She walks along a path
           of colored pebbles.

           As she nears the mansion, she sees two African American
           WOMEN tending a flower garden at the edge of the property. 
           They talk animatedly to each other as they clip brambles
           and twist vines.

           The older of the duo sees Valerie and nudges her companion.

           Their conversation abruptly ceases.

                                 VALERIE
                        Good morning ladies.

           The duo watches Valerie approach.
                                 OLDER GARDENER
                        Good mornin' Mrs. Pickman.

                                 YOUNGER GARDENER
                        Good mornin' Mrs. Pickman.

                                 VALERIE
                        The garden seems to be comin' along
                        beautifully.

                                 OLDER GARDENER
                        Thank you very much Mrs. Pickman.

                                 YOUNGER GARDENER
                        Thank you very much Mrs. Pickman.

           Valerie nods as she passes the two women, headed up the
           hill towards the mansion.  A moment before she is out of
           earshot, the two Gardeners resume their lively conversation.

           Valerie reaches the front door.  She collapses the parasol
           and sets her wicker basket upon the stone porch.  She looks
           at the mother of pearl button beside the varnished mahogany
           double doors.  She presses the button: DING DING DING DONG.

           Valerie smiles at the novelty of the electric doorbell.

           CLICKING FOOTSTEPS reverberate within.  The door opens.  A
           BUTLER, a silver-haired man of seventy, swings the door
           open.

                                 BUTLER
                              (English accent)
                        Good morning Mrs. Pickman.

           Valerie looks puzzled.

                                 BUTLER
                              (continuing)
                        Are you here to visit the bereaved
                        Mistress of the house?

                                 VALERIE
                        Why're you talkin' like an
                        Englishman?

                                 BUTLER
                        The Mistress of the house has
                        requested it of me.

           From within the mansion, reverberates the sound of a woman's

           RAUCOUS LAUGHTER.

                                 BUTLER
                              (continuing)
                        Are you here to visit the bereaved
                        Mistress of the house?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Show her inside, Ralph!
                                 BUTLER
                              (pointing to the
                               wicker basket)
                        May I please assist you with your
                        burden?

                                 VALERIE
                        It's just a pie- I can manage it. 
                        But feel free to hang this
                        someplace.

           She hands the Butler her collapsed parasol.

                                 BUTLER
                        Please enter the house of mourning.

           More RAUCOUS LAUGHTER reverberates within.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Valerie, carrying her wicker basket, walks into the thickly
           carpeted room, three walls of which are hung with paintings
           and tapestries.  The fourth wall is entirely glass and
           looks out onto the hedge maze at the rear of the house.

           Alicia Binfrey, wearing a lavender kimono, sits on a plush
           divan reading the newspaper.  She is stunningly beautiful,
           in a ravishing way that makes other women feel diminished
           when nearby.

           Alicia looks up from the paper, her green eyes shining
           beneath her black eyelashes.

                                 ALICIA
                        Good morning Mrs. Pickman.  What
                        brings you here this sparkling and
                        crisp day?

           Valerie does not know exactly how to respond.

                                 VALERIE
                        I heard of your aunt's passing and
                        I wanted to offer you my husband's
                        and my own condolences.

                                 ALICIA
                        Well thank you for that most
                        heartfelt sentiment.

           Valerie cannot tell whether of not Alicia is being
           facetious.

                                 VALERIE
                        I baked you a pie.

           Alicia smirks.

                                 ALICIA
                        Thank you.
                                 VALERIE
                        Were you close with your aunt?

                                 ALICIA
                        No.  I met her once when I was
                        twelve.  She took me to the county
                        fair and I threw up on her.  I
                        never saw her again.

           Alicia smirks.  Valerie smirks.

                                 ALICIA
                              (continuing)
                        Where are you from Mrs. Pickman? 
                        Texas?

                                 VALERIE
                        No, my husband is from there, but
                        I was born and raised in Colorado.

                                 ALICIA
                        Did they have an opera house in
                        Colorado?

                                 VALERIE
                        They did and I went to it every
                        chance I could.

           Alicia nods, cogitating, pondering...

                                 ALICIA
                        I need to escape the premises before
                        Janice and her preening, sententious
                        friends come to call on me, but if
                        you'd like to hear my phonograph
                        perhaps we can schedule a later
                        time for you to do so.

           Valerie nods enthusiastically.

                                 VALERIE
                        I would like to see it- and hear
                        it- very much.

                                 ALICIA
                        I thought you might.  Are you
                        engaged later this evening, Mrs. 
                        Pickman?

                                 VALERIE
                        I am not- my husband is on duty. 
                        And call me Valerie.

                                 ALICIA
                        Come back tonight at around seven
                        o'clock and we'll listen to some
                        handsome Italian tenors while
                        drinking some fine Italian wine.

                                 VALERIE
                        That would be wonderful Alicia.
                                 ALICIA
                        Please...call me Miss Binfrey.

           She is not joking.

           EXT. OSCAR'S LUNCHEONETTE - TEN O'CLOCK AM

           Rubbing his belly, Sheriff Pickman exits Oscar's
           Luncheonette, followed by Deputy Cooperson and DEPUTY
           BARTLEY, a stocky strong-jawed thirty-year old man with a
           big black mustache and thick black eyebrows.

           Pickman looks at the bandages on Cooperson's knuckles.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Anything happen last night I should
                        know 'bout?

                                 COOPERSON
                        Nothing worth describing in detail--
                        three civil squabbles and some
                        general churlishness, nothing
                        terribly relevant.

           Pickman nods; he and Cooperson look north on the central
           avenue.  Bartley turns south and sees, amidst the morning
           traffic of pedestrians and carriages, Mayor Hogan and his
           obsequious men's club pal Dugan driving towards them.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I ate too much.  I could lie down
                        right here in the road an take a
                        nap.

                                 BARTLEY
                        I'd advise against that boss. 
                        Turn around.

           Pickman and Cooperson turn south and see the Mayor's
           horseless carriage puttering towards them.

           All three lawmen remove their hats.

           The car PUTTERS and COUGHS as it pulls up the dusty avenue.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Mayor.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Mayor.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Mayor.

                                 HOGAN
                        Sheriff.  Deputies.

           Dugan nod to the men, but does not address them and is not
           himself addressed.
           Hogan looks at the painted glass storefront of Oscar's
           Luncheonette behind the three lawmen.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Well, I'd say that that there
                        establishment is one helluva safe
                        place to get a chicken-fried steak,
                        yes indeed, yes indeed.
                              (to Dugan)
                        Might even be kinda hard to read
                        the menu in there, what with all
                        them blinding badges shining
                        everywhichway.  A veritable
                        constellation of legal icons.

           Dugan nods in affirmation.

                                 DUGAN
                        A very safe place, for certain.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What can I do for you Mayor Hogan?

                                 HOGAN
                        Not a damn thing other than what
                        you been doing since Sheriff
                        Reddington retired.

           Hogan reaches into his suit pocket and withdraws a wax-
           sealed envelope.  He hands the parcel to Pickman.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        That's the bonus I been remiss on
                        payin' you.  And you're not allowed
                        to thank me for it, since it's
                        your due.

           Pickman tacitly nods his thanks.

           Hogan leans over and releases the clutch of his flatulent
           vehicle.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        You might also be pleased to know
                        that you no longer owe any more
                        money to the Bank of Rattleborge.

           Pickman, mouth agape, looks up at the Mayor.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Mayor Hogan, you didn't have to go
                        and-

                                 HOGAN
                        Was nothin'.  Bank owed me some
                        favors and now they owe one less.
           Hogan clears his throat in a spectacular manner involving
           his cheeks and chins and eyes and all ten of his fingers.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Well, we gotta scram fellas, before
                        our wives catch us out scootin'
                        'round.  They ain't too fond of us
                        enjoyin' ourselves in any manner
                        whatsoever.  My wife sees me smilin'
                        in my sleep, she wakes me up right
                        quick.

           In a PUTTING, SPUTTERING tumult, Hogan and Dugan drive
           off.

           Pickman slides the envelope in his vest.

                                 BARTLEY
                        You should see if he shorted you.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Nah, he didn't...besides I want
                        Val to open it.

           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - SAME

           Walter, the diminutive dollmaker, walks into Sindy's unlit
           establishment.  The swinging doors admit and then block
           the streaming sunlight, in slow alternation.

                                 SINDY (O.S.)
                        We're closed.

                                 WALTER
                        It is I.

                                 SINDY (O.S.)
                        Look in the spittoon.

           Walter is confused by the recommendation made by the shadow-
           obscured proprietor.

                                 WALTER
                        Pardon me?

                                 SINDY (O.S.)
                        The spittoon.  Go look inside it.

           Walter looks at the spittoon at the far edge of the bar;
           it sits atop the sawdust-strewn floor like a squat little
           man.

           Walter approaches the spittoon warily.  He looks inside.

           Covered with the ichor of spitting tobacco and other viscous
           detritus, is the doll he made of and for Sindy.
                                 SINDY (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                        I thought you should know before
                        you went ahead and made another.

           Walter looks into the shadows, a baleful look in his eyes.

                                 WALTER
                        I spent two weeks crafting that
                        miniature which now lay despoiled,
                        besotted, sullied by the
                        expectorations of rogues.

           Sindy steps out of the shadows and looks at the little
           man.

                                 SINDY
                        Do you think that usin' them big
                        words somehow makes you a bigger
                        man?  Do you?

           Walter opens his mouth to reply, but no words come to him.

                                 SINDY
                              (continuing)
                        I didn't want to be cruel, but I
                        don't know how to get you to stop
                        pesterin' me.  You been after me
                        since the week after my husband
                        was buried and lookin' back, I'm
                        surprised you even waited the week. 
                        Why just yesterday you said 'You
                        shan't see me anymore,' but look
                        now- here you are, very visible.

           Walter's gaze grows cold and penetrating.

                                 WALTER
                        Do whatever you please with your
                        remaining three years.

                                 SINDY
                        Three years?

                                 WALTER
                        I can tell by the lines in your
                        face, the circumference of your
                        ankles, the limpness of your hair
                        and the elasticity of your dermis
                        that your beauty will begin to
                        deteriorate, rapidly, three years
                        from now.

                                 SINDY
                        Is that so?

                                 WALTER
                        What did you mother look like when
                        she was three years older than you
                        are now?
           Sindy's eyes narrow with undisguised hatred.

                                 SINDY
                        Get out.

           Walter nonchalantly turns around and exits the Saloon.

           Sindy turns and looks at herself in the mirror behind the
           bar.  She touches the skin beneath her eyes.

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

           A gray mass of storm clouds coalesce over the town.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman walks a handcuffed PRISONER towards the town jail.

           AT THE VERY TOP OF THE AVENUE- MORE THAN FIFTY YARDS AWAY-

           Pickman sees his wife jogging across the avenue.

           Valerie has a brown bag between her arms and is clearly
           hurrying in an effort to beat the storm.

           Pickman opens his mouth to call to her, but looking at the
           Prisoner he currently has in custody, decides not to get
           her attention.

                                 PRISONER
                        You always eyein' me Sheriff.  Me
                        and my little brother.  You're
                        biased against us, you are.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I don't engage in debates with
                        prisoners.  Shut up.

           Pickman watches Valerie disappear onto the dirt road just
           beyond McDonelly's Fine Jewel's and Things.

           EXT. TOWN JAIL - TWILIGHT

           Pickman walks out of the jailhouse.  He looks at the sky.

           The gray clouds are turning black.

           Mango, wearing a brown suit, a brown derby and a mango-
           colored shirt, walks up to the Sheriff.

                                 MANGO
                        That's a mighty mean lookin' storm
                        hangin' up there Sheriff.

           Pickman nods.

                                 MANGO
                              (continuing)
                        Kinda looks like a giant eye, don't
                        it?
           Pickman nods.

           EXT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - MOMENTS LATER

           Deputy Cooperson and Deputy Bartley stand outside of the
           hotel.  Cooperson is reading from his carrying Bible;
           Bartley is picking at his wide teeth with a toothpick while
           looking at the amassed storm clouds above.

           Pickman saunters up to them.  They nod their salutations.

           Pickman strikes a match on his boot heel.

           A lone raindrop SPLATS on the lit match, extinguishing it
           with a HISS.

           EXT. MCDONELLY'S FINE JEWELS AND THINGS - MOMENTS LATER

           Hubert steps out of his store.  He shuts the door behind
           him.

           With his oversized, knob-knuckled fingers, Hubert withdraws
           a brass key, licks it, and inserts it into the top lock. 
           He twists it.  CLICK.

           Two raindrops land upon Hubert's bald, red head.  SPLAT,
           SPLAT.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Gouley Brothers walk abreast each other up the street.

           They hold their canes in their right hands.  Each man is
           struck by a falling raindrop.  SPLAT.  SPLAT.  SPLAT.

           EXT. ERMINE'S BARBERSHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           The barbershop has been locked up.  The praying-mantis
           like barber stares up at the dark congregation in the sky. 
           He holds a cake covered in whipped cream between his hands.

           Four raindrops SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT into the foamy
           frosting which coats the confection, leaving little craters
           in the sea of frozen white waves.

           EXT. GRANT AND DONNA TYLOR'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Grant and Donna Tylor the Second stand out in the front
           yard of their cute tall narrow house, looking up at the
           sky.

           Grant SNAPS open an umbrella, and shields his wife from
           five falling raindrops: SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

           EXT. THE MAYOR'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mayor Hogan and Dugan ride the PUTTERING, WHEEZING vehicle
           up the dirt driveway that leads to the front entrance of
           the Mayor's wide, proud three-storey home.  Rain falls
           towards Hogan's forehead, spectacles and lit cigar as well
           as Dugan's cigar and open timepiece.
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT-HISS, SPLAT-HISS, SPLAT.

           EXT. ALICIA BINFREY'S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Valerie Pickman, carrying the brown paper bag she had
           earlier, jogs up the colored-pebble path, past the flower
           garden, towards the front of the Binfrey Mansion.  Behind
           her, rain strikes the pebbles: SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alicia Binfrey looks out of the enormous window covering
           the rear wall of the sitting room, facing the hedge mazes.

           Rain strikes against the window:  SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

           EXT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Sindy stands at the front of her establishment, wrinkling
           her nose.  Rain strikes the overhang she stands beneath:
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT.  She shakes her head, turns around and hangs a sign
           on the door: 'CLOSED.'

           EXT. OSCAR'S LUNCHEONETTE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter walks out of the eatery, looking at the sky.  He
           puts on his wide brim hat, mutters a curse and steps out
           into the rain.  SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

           EXT. CATTLEBRUSH CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess Walker, clad only in her skimpy waitress attire, runs
           towards the front door of the casino.  The rain comes down
           upon her.  SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

           Two Bulls from the Men's Club- both tucked safely beneath
           the overhang- watch the damp woman's bouncing beeline with
           undisguised pleasure.

           INT. ROOM THREE R AT HOTEL RUDDINGTON - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is cloaked in darkness, excepting only the light
           that sneaks in through the crack beneath the door.  A dark
           form moves within the room, walking back and forth.  The
           sound of rain striking the roof can be heard within:  SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT,
           SPLAT, SPLAT, SPLAT.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispering)
                        Wachet auf, Adelaide, wachet!

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - NIGHT

           Night has fallen over Rattleborge and with it a deluge of
           HISSING rain.
           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - NINE O'CLOCK

           The THUNDEROUS downpour of rain makes it appear as if the
           road is a pot of boiling water.  The deluge is so powerful
           that it is impossible to see more than thirty feet in any
           direction while standing within it.  The rain ROARS like
           fire, attacking everything exposed in the city of
           Rattleborge.

           Materializing in the blur of rain, are three black
           triangles, pointed at the top and broad at the bottom. 
           The black triangles move in tandem up the central avenue. 
           They look like bats, except that from the bottom of the
           triangles extend legs, establishing them as plantigrade
           beings.

           The wet boots upon these legs churn the muddy road, but
           the footsteps cannot be heard within the roaring
           conflagration of the downpour.  The black triangles move
           up the avenue, dark phantoms adrift in the unnatural storm. 
           They stop momentarily and then veer to the left.

           The black triangles continue forward; they pass through
           the yellow light spilled from a half-shut window.  The
           triangles are three MEN in black ponchos.

           A hand emerges from the beneath the central poncho.  The
           hand holds a compass.  The hand then disappears beneath
           the poncho and a moment later reappears, pointing northeast.

           The three poncho-covered Men move eastward towards the
           suburban area of town, though they cannot see where they
           are going, nor can they be seen.  The central man speaks,
           his voice only audible to the two men immediately beside
           him.

                                 CENTRAL MAN
                        Let me see your timepieces,
                        gentlemen.

           From beneath the two flanking ponchos, come hands clutching
           pocket watches.  The central Man withdraws his own and
           surveys all three in a quick moment.

                                 CENTRAL MAN
                              (continuing)
                        Good.  We meet at midnight by the
                        town sign and then return to our
                        horses.

           The hands retract beneath their respective ponchos.

                                 MAN ON THE RIGHT
                        Got it.

                                 MAN ON THE LEFT
                        I understand.

           From the edges of the three ponchos emerge the gleaming
           barrels of pistols and shotguns.  The men disperse in three
           different directions.
           In five steps they look like no more than blurry black
           triangles.

           In twelve steps they have all but vanished into the rain-
           occluded night.

           In twenty steps, they are wholly absorbed by the ROARING
           waters of The Crone's Cataract.

           INT. HUBERT MCDONELLY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The storm ROARS loudly outside: there is no thunder or
           lightning, just a brutal and relentless downpour.  Hubert,
           the red-faced jeweler, sits across from his wife, Eliza, a
           plump and pale woman in a many-layered nightgown.  A candle
           rests in the center of the table that they sit at,
           illumining the finely knit tablecloth, two wedges of cheese
           and the nutty pumpernickel loaf they have been picking at
           for several hours.

                                 ELIZA
                        What!?!

                                 HUBERT
                        I said, 'It's pointless trying to
                        hold conversation when the storm
                        is this bad.'

           Eliza shakes her head.

                                 ELIZA
                        can't hear you over the storm- I
                        can't hear anything but the storm!

           Hubert stands up and lifts his chair- a nicely worked and
           very heavy maple walnut fullback- from the ground.

                                 ELIZA
                              (continuing)
                        Don't strain yourself, dear.

           Hubert carries his chair around the table and sets it next
           to his wife.  She smiles at him.  He sits down in the chair.

           Eliza pats him on the shoulder.

                                 ELIZA
                              (continuing)
                        Always were a strong one, full of
                        energy and romantic notions.

           Hubert nods, pleased with himself.  Eliza cuts a sizable
           piece from the wedge of sharp cheddar and then cuts off
           the end of the pumpernickel loaf.  She rests the cheese
           neatly upon the bread and hands it to Hubert.  He takes
           the bread and cheese and bites into it.

           A hand emerges from the shadows and SLAPS the food from
           Hubert.  Eliza is then SLAPPED.  She SCREAMS.  She is
           SLAPPED again and stops her screaming.  Hubert, mouth agape
           looks up.
           Rodney, the hood of his poncho drawn back from his porcine
           face, stands at the end of the table.  He wears the drooping-
           rim blue hat and the yellow kerchief tied around his neck
           that he wore out on the plains a few weeks earlier.  He
           draws a pistol and presses the barrel to Hubert's forehead.

           Eliza is about to scream again, but Rodney shakes his head.

                                 RODNEY
                        Screamin' ain't gonna do nothin'.

           Nobody can hear you through that storm, not even your next
           door neighbor.

                                 HUBERT
                        What do you want from us?

                                 RODNEY
                        A businessman.  I like that.

           Makes things go smoother, that kinda attitude.  Here's the
           situation.  Mrs. McDonelly goes and gets all the cash and
           jewels and valuables you got stashed in this house.  While
           she's gone, you tell me everything she's gonna find, down
           to the last dollar and fancy bauble.  If she comes back
           without some of the stuff you mention, or if she comes
           back with more than what you told me about, someone is
           gonna get shot for bein' deceitful.

           Eliza's eyes are frozen in fear, as is the rest of her.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing; to
                               Eliza)
                        Get to it.  You got two minutes
                        before I start beatin' up on him. 
                        Get me everthing of value and put
                        it in a pillowcase.

           Eliza stands up, takes one step and doubles over.  She is
           shaking.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        I'll put that cheese knife in your
                        husband's eye if you don't git
                        right now.

           Eliza stands and stumbles from the room; her face is bright
           red from being struck.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        So how much cash should I be
                        expectin' the old lady to return
                        with?

           Hubert is shaking horribly.  His mouth opens and shuts
           like a fish tossed on dry land; his giant knobby hands
           tremble.
                                 HUBERT
                        We...we have t-two thousand seven
                        hundred dollars in cash-- we don't
                        t-trust the bank.

           Rodney nods, pleased with the amount.

                                 RODNEY
                        And what might be my new inventory
                        of sparkly things and whatnots?

                                 HUBERT
                        I'm not exactly sure...I think we
                        have a dozen pearl necklaces, some
                        silver timepieces- and one gold
                        one- and two wedding bands.  And
                        also a mother of pearl brooch inlaid
                        with sapphire and platinum ingot.

                                 RODNEY
                        Sounds like you treat the old lady
                        right.  Good for you old man.

           Eliza returns, clasping a nearly filled pillowcase.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Bring it here.

           Eliza apprehensively walks towards Rodney.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Open it so's I can take a gander
                        inside.

           Eliza opens the pillowcase; Rodney glances inside.  He
           sees: the glimmer of jewelry and three tall stacks of bills.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Put the sack on the table.

           Eliza rests the loot-filled pillowcase on the table.

           BANG.  The back of Hubert McDonelly's head erupts in a
           welter of gore.  Rodney points his gun at Eliza who is now
           SHRIEKING.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. HUBERT MCDONELLY'S HOUSE - SAME

           The side window flickers with the FLASH of the second
           gunshot, though the report is completely muffled by the
           THUNDEROUS deluge of the downpour.

           INT. ERMINE'S STUDY - SAME

           Ermine, the praying-mantis like barber, sits in a plush
           chair reading a book by the light of a hanging oil lamp.
           He wears a long nightgown and a night cap on his head. 
           The storm ROARS outside, yet he reads with a very intense
           focus.

                                 ERMINE
                              (while reading)
                        Son of a gun.

           He turns the page with a quick, insect-like gesture and
           then reaches for a glass of warmed milk.  He sips a little
           and then replaces the glass on the stand, without ever
           taking his eyes from the book.

                                 ERMINE
                              (continuing; reading)
                        You don't say?

           Ermine turns the page.  He continues reading.

                                 ERMINE
                              (continuing; reading)
                        That's it now, you can do it little
                        fella!

           Ermine smiles as his eyes rapidly scan the pages before
           him.

           A hand reaches from the darkness and grabs the book.  Ermine
           looks up.

           Standing in front of him, poncho hood drawn back, is the
           handsome, blonde-haired, greenish-blue-eyed and finely
           mustached Billy Lee; his gun is pointed at Ermine's face.

           Billy Lee tosses the book to the floor where it lands with
           a THUMP.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Take me to the safe.

           Ermine shakes his head.

                                 ERMINE
                        don't have-

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I will hurt you if you start weaving
                        fabrications, Ermine Ducat.  I'd
                        rather avoid such unpleasantness,
                        as I'm sure would you.

           Ermine nods his head.  He stands up, lifts the hanging oil
           lantern from its suspension hook and walks towards the
           doorway that leads into the bedroom. 

           Billy Lee's greenish-blue eyes follow the agile old man,
           as does the barrel of his pistol.
           INT. ERMINE'S BEDROOM - SAME

           The circle of light from the lamp spills onto the long
           slender bed which sits isolated in the center of the unlit
           room.  Upon the wall above the bed's headboard hangs a
           painted picture of a radiant woman standing beside Ermine,
           thirty years younger than he currently is.

           Ermine rests the lantern upon his night stand and walks
           over to the painting.  With an I insect-like motion, he
           reaches over and pulls the painting down.

           Billy Lee looks at the blank gray iron of the small safe
           nestled in the wall.

                                 ERMINE
                        Please don't look at the
                        combination, I don't want to have
                        to buy another one after you leave--
                        they're quite expensive you know.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        I cannot see the numbers from here.

           Ermine nods, satisfied.  In some odd, ritualistic safe-
           opening preparation, Ermine moistens his lips with his
           carmine tongue three times.  He twists the combination
           lock to the right, whistling a high pitch, and then to the
           left, whistling a low pitch, and then wildly to the right
           again, whistling a high pitch.

           Ermine twists the handle- CLUNK; he pulls the door open. 
           He darts his hands inside.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        Withdraw your hands slowly if you
                        want to live to see the end of
                        this storm.

           Ermine pulls out five stacks of bills and a gold timepiece.

                                 ERMINE
                        Never did trust the bank.

           Ermine walks towards Billy Lee, proffering the money.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Set that down on the bed.

           Ermine drops the money and whirls around, a straight razor
           in his hand.  Billy Lee pivots the point of his pistol.

           BANG.

           Ermine falls to his knees.  His right hand has been blown
           clean off of his arm.

           Billy Lee picks up the stacks of money with his left hand.
           Ermine stares glassy-eyed at the white bone, yellow tissue
           and pink flesh at the terminus of his right arm.  A moment
           later, blood drenches the wound and flows onto the floor.

           Billy Lee points the gun at Ermine's face.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. ERMINE'S HOUSE - SAME

           Barely visible- and totally inaudible- in the ROARING
           downpour of rain, is the flash of a gunshot in the bedroom
           window of the house.

           INT. GOULEY MANSION GREETING ROOM - SAME

           The grand enclosure is lit by a lone candle.  The room
           features a hanging fan (not on), two electric lights (not
           on) and three dead stuffed animals: a boar, a tiger and a
           bear.

           The Gouley Brothers, dressed in their denuded tuxedos,
           stand in the room, staring at the floor-to-ceiling window
           beside the front door.  The rain ROARS outside.

                                 GREG GOULEY
                        I think we should go.

                                 GARRET GOULEY
                        It's too wet out there.  We'd
                        probably catch the shivers.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        We can't play cards here?

                                 GREG GOULEY
                        Against whom, each other?  What
                        would that accomplish?  I think we
                        should go.

                                 GARRET GOULEY
                        As you said, as you said.  But you
                        are a risk-taker...and you almost
                        always go bust trying to get
                        blackjack.

                                 GREG GOULEY
                        I like the excitement.

                                 GARRET GOULEY
                        It's dangerous going out there in
                        this weather.  I think we should
                        play it safe.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        Me too.  I'm holding, I'm sticking
                        right here.

           The front door swings open.

           The sound of the ROARING storm fills the room.
                                 GREG GOULEY
                        It's a sign.  It's a sign that we
                        should go.

           A poncho-covered Man enters the greeting room.  He kicks
           the door shut behind himself.  SLAM.  He keeps the hood of
           his poncho drawn over his face.

           The barrel of a shotgun pokes out of an opening at the
           center of the poncho.  An instant later, a long-barreled
           revolver emerges just above it.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        Godfrey Gouley.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                              (nervous)
                        Yes?

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        Go upstairs, open your safe and
                        bring the contents to me.  You
                        have two minutes.

                                 GODFREY GOULEY
                        You want the poker chips too?

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        No.

           As quickly as his eighty-two year old limbs will allow,
           Godfrey Gouley walks towards and then up the grand stairway,
           gripping the balustrade.  The remaining two Gouleys stare
           at the Intruder.

                                 GARRET GOULEY
                        Please don't harm my brothers. 
                        I'm the oldest one if-

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        No talking.

           Greg and Garret Gouley look at the intruder.  His face is
           indiscernible within the wet shadows of his poncho hood. 
           The brothers shift nervously; their breathing is quick and
           shallow.

           The poncho-cloaked Intruder does not move.  He stands stone
           still, the barrels of his weapons trained on the Gouleys.

           Greg's eyes fill with tears.  He begins to shake.  Garret
           takes his brother's hand and squeezes it reassuringly. 
           Tears slowly track down Greg's face.

           The Intruder remains still, standing in the puddle of
           rainwater which drips from his black and shining poncho.

           Godfrey, holding a box in his arms, descends the stairway.
                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Set the box beside me.

           Godfrey, breathing hard, clambers over to the Intruder. 
           He sets the box beside the puddle pooled around the
           Intruder's feet.

           The shadow-obscured head swivels slightly within the poncho.

           Garret squeezes Greg's hand.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. GOULEY MANSION - SAME

           The long window beside the front door FLASHES three times
           in rapid succession.

           Nothing is heard but the ROAR of the rain.

           INT. GRANT AND DONNA TYLOR'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Rodney has the couple at gunpoint.  Donna, standing beside
           the bed, holds a sheet up against her nude body; Grant
           slowly pulls up a pair of long underwear, his thoughts
           elsewhere.

                                 RODNEY
                              (to Grant)
                        You thinkin' about bein' a hero?

           Grant does not reply.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Yup.  Heroes are quiet...and when
                        they're quiet it means they're
                        thinkin'.  But I don't want you
                        thinkin', I want you doin'.  Doin'
                        what I say.

           Rodney advances towards Donna and presses the tip of his
           pistol to her right breast.

           Grant's face is bright red with suppressed rage, but he
           does nothing.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing; to
                               Grant)
                        Git me them stones real quick. 
                        And if those heroic thoughts start
                        pesterin' you again, think about
                        my partners waitin' outside in the
                        rain, cold and wet and looking for
                        warmth.  They'll do things to your
                        wife that I'm not comfortable even
                        talkin' about in front o' her. 

           Grant walks over to the credenza.  He opens a drawer.
           Rodney presses the tip of his pistol deeper into Donna's
           bosom; she YELPS.

           Grant withdraws a velvet pouch.

                                 RODNEY
                              (continuing)
                        Pour 'em out beneath the 'lectric
                        lamp so I can gaze upon their
                        sparklin' spendor.

           Grant unfastens the leather strap holding the pouch shut
           and upends the contents into the pool of light on the
           credenza's polished surface.  Diamonds roll out, sparkling
           and brilliant.

           Rodney's wide eyes reflect the diamonds like little bursts
           of white fireworks.

           EXT. GRANT AND DONNA TYLOR'S HOUSE - SAME

           A light FLASHES in the bedroom, followed by a second FLASH,
           both reports are totally inaudible amidst the POUNDING
           downpour.

           EXT. TALL WHITE HOUSE - LATER

           A window FLASHES with the silent flash of a gun.

           EXT. WIDE YELLOW HOUSE WITH A BARN - LATER

           A window FLASHES.

           It FLASHES a second time.

           It FLASHES a third and fourth time in rapid succession.

           INT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - ELEVEN O'CLOCK

           Sheriff Pickman, Deputy Cooperson and Deputy Bartley sit
           in the lobby of the hotel.  The sound of the ROARING rain
           fills the room.  Pickman reads a newspaper and Cooperson
           reads from his pocket bible.  Bartley, bored, picks at his
           fingernails.

           Mabelle sits at the counter, reading her tightly clutched
           book.

           Finishing a troublesome cuticle, Bartley looks up at the
           front window.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Can't even see the other side of
                        the street.

           Pickman glances up briefly from his paper and then looks
           down again.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Nope.
                                 BARTLEY
                        Where do you suppose that Abraham
                        Weiss fellow is?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Don't know.  Maybe he's at Sindy's,
                        if she's open.  Maybe

           Nestor's Lounge.  Maybe Cattlebrush's.

           Bartley NODS.

                                 BARTLEY
                        You don't think maybe he got back
                        to his room somehow?  Climbed in
                        through the window, sneakily?

                                 PICKMAN
                        I don't think that that's at all
                        likely.  But if you want to go
                        check his room again, go ahead. 
                        Or if you want to finish your shift,
                        you can go home.

           Bartley looks to the window and the THUNDERING rain beyond.

           He does not want to venture out into the fierce storm.

           Bartley stands up and stretches his thick, muscular limbs.

           He walks over to Mabelle.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Hey Mabelle.

                                 MABELLE
                              (not looking up
                               from her book)
                        Hello Deputy.

                                 BARTLEY
                        That a good book you got there?

                                 MABELLE
                        You wouldn't like it.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Would you mind reading it aloud
                        while I'm stuck here?

                                 MABELLE
                        You don't know how to read?

           Pickman looks up from his newspaper, a grin on his face.

                                 BARTLEY
                        I can read, I just prefer bein'
                        read to is all.  Like my momma
                        used to do when I was little.
                                 MABELLE
                        What's this say, then?

           Mabelle holds up the book right in front of Bartley's face.

                                 BARTLEY
                        The Weird Black Mask from the Golden
                        Ziggurat of Nango-to.

           Pickman CLAPS twice, loudly.  Mabelle nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I wouldn't mind bein' read to
                        myself, that is if Cooperson don't
                        object.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (humorlessly)
                        I can ignore her.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Would you start from the beginin'
                        please?

           Mabelle puts a marker in the page she is currently on and
           then flips back to the beginning of the book.

                                 MABELLE
                        I've never done this- exceptin'
                        for my niece- so I hope I do
                        alright.

                                 BARTLEY
                        I'm sure you'll do fine Mabelle. 
                        You got such a pretty voice and
                        all.

           Mabelle blushes.  Bartley sits on a stool beside the counter
           and rests the square chin of his square head upon the
           knuckles of his thick, interlaced fingers.  Pickman walks
           over and sits upon the stool beside Bartley.

                                 MABELLE
                        Well, let me start.
                              (reading)
                        'In the deepest reaches of the
                        unknown Orient, far beyond the
                        jutting peaks of The Wing-ho
                        Mountains and Shan's Jungle of
                        Warrior Destiny, lies the Golden
                        Ziggurat of Nango-to.  The opulent
                        splendor of the edifice corruscates-

           Bartley raises his hand.  Mabelle looks up from the book.

                                 MABELLE
                              (continuing)
                        It means sparkles.

           Bartley puts his hand down.
                                 MABELLE
                              (continuing; reading)
                        The opulent splendor of the edifice
                        corruscates beneath the sun's rays,
                        but the golden light of heaven is
                        never admitted within the Ziggurat
                        itself.  Deep in the heart of the
                        many-tiered structure, Oriental
                        mystics practice the dark arcane
                        arts of the sect of the Weird Black
                        Mask.  Any western man captured in
                        Nango to is brought to the Ziggurat
                        and emerges from it changed into
                        something other than he was,
                        something perhaps that should not
                        be...'

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION RECREATION ROOM - SAME

           The room has three tall glass windows, their views entirely
           obscured by the ROARING rain.  The walls are hung with
           tapestries and the floor is covered with three bear rugs
           and two oriental-patterned rigs.

           Alicia Binfrey and Valerie Pickman sit in divans facing
           each other.  A phonograph sits in between the two women;
           the cylinder in the machine's center rotates and a heavy
           needle brings forth music from the deep grooves.  The sound
           of a man SINGING an opera aria- accompanied by the POPS
           and CRACKLES of the cylinder- fills the room.

           Valerie stares at the phonograph as if it were an animal
           or a small child- a thing of endless fascination.  Alicia
           bemusedly watches her.

           Valerie sips from her glass of white wine.  Alicia leans
           forward on her divan and opens the small doors in the
           housing of the phonograph, located directly beneath the
           rotating cylinder.  As the doors open, the SINGING and
           POPPING and CRACKLING get louder.

                                 VALERIE
                        What a clever device Miss Binfrey.

           Alicia opens the doors a little more and the SINGING
           increases its volume a little more.

                                 ALICIA
                        Italy is such a wonderful country.
                        The music, the food, the wine...it
                        is too bad that the men- though
                        handsome- are utterly lacking in a
                        sense of propriety.

                                 VALERIE
                        I've heard that they paw at anything
                        which gives milk and walks upright,
                        Miss Binfrey.

           Alicia is a bit irked by the comment.
                                 ALICIA
                        Well I certainly received a lot of
                        attention...though the same cannot
                        be said for the more common ladies.

           Valerie suppresses a smile.

                                 VALERIE
                        Yes Miss Binfrey.

           Alicia is not quite sure if she is being mocked.

                                 VALERIE
                              (continuing)
                        What is this aria about Miss
                        Binfrey?

                                 ALICIA
                        The character's name is Giuseppo
                        and he has fallen in love with a
                        woman who is married to a wealthy
                        older man, but the wealthy older
                        is dying, and so a priest is called
                        in to hear his last words.  But it
                        turns out that the priest is the
                        wealthy older man's long lost
                        brother and that the wealthy older
                        man's wife is the priest's
                        illegitimate half-gypsy child,
                        raised by a French baker.  The
                        aria is sung by Giuseppo to the
                        French baker.

                                 VALERIE
                        So the old man married his own
                        half-gypsy niece?

           Alicia, sipping her wine, nods.

                                 VALERIE
                              (continuing)
                        The stories in these things are so-

           BLAM.

           The phonograph flies off of the table and CRASHES to the
           floor.

           The startled women look over at the doorway.

           The Poncho-cloaked Intruder stands in the room, his smoking
           pistol pointed towards them.

           Valerie bites her lower lip and clenches her fists; Alicia
           pales with fear.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        Both of you stand up.

           Valerie stands up.  Alicia stands up.
           The two women stare at the Intruder; his face is hidden in
           the shadows of his dripping wet, shining black poncho. 
           The rain ROARS outside.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Alicia Binfrey walk over and stand
                        next to your guest.

           Alicia walks over to stand beside Valerie.  The Intruder
           walks towards the women, gun held forward.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Disrobe.

           Valerie looks at the man in horror; Alicia shakes her head
           'no'.  The Intruder CRACKS Alicia in the face with the
           butt of his pistol.  She CRIES and falls backwards, onto
           the divan.

           The Intruder, keeping his gun on Valerie, grabs Alicia by
           the neck and stands her upright.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Disrobe.

           Valerie begins to unbutton the front of her dress.  Alicia,
           her cheek swollen and red, nods acquiescently.  She begins
           to unravel the complicated strap that winds around her
           dress.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing; to
                               Alicia)
                        Turn around.

           Alicia, pale and tremulous, eyes filled with tears, turns
           around.

           A knife emerges from the poncho, firmly gripped in the
           Intruder's left hand.  The Intruder SLASHES the straps on
           the back of Alicia dress.  The dress sags forward.  Blood
           begins pool on Alicia's bare back.

                                 ALICIA
                        You cut me!

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                        Turn around.

           Alicia turns around to face the Intruder.

           Valerie's blue dress falls to the floor, revealing her
           beige slip beneath.  She clenches her fists and grits her
           teeth in an effort to suppress her fear.  Alicia's silk
           dress puddles like water around her slippered feet.  She
           wears only a black brassiere and underpants.
           The Intruder points his pistol into Valerie's face.  He
           rests the tip of his knife in between Alicia's breasts.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Everything.

           Valerie's shoulders tremble visibly and her breathing
           becomes rapid and erratic.  She raises her slip over her
           head, revealing her white brassiere and underpants.  Alicia
           unfastens her brassiere and drops it on the divan.  Valerie
           unfastens her brassiere and lets it fall away.  Alicia
           puts her finger to the lip of her underpants, but then
           turns and runs.

           The Intruder takes his pistol from Valerie's face and points
           it at Alicia.  BLAM.

           A bullet opens up Alicia's right thigh, sending her to the
           ground.  She cries out in agony.  Valerie starts to quietly
           cry.

           The Intruder walks over to the prostrated mistress of the
           house.  She grips her bleeding right thigh, hysterically
           SOBBING.  The Intruder raises the heel his boot over her
           left shin and brings it down upon the bone with a sickening
           CRACK.

           Alicia SHRIEKS.  He stomps down a second time.  CRACK.

           Alicia's SHRIEKING sounds inhuman.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        Stay put.

           The Intruder turns to face Valerie; she is nude.  She covers
           her breasts and pubic region with her arms and hands.

                                 PONCHO-CLOAKED INTRUDER
                              (continuing)
                        My name is Jordan.

           Jordan pulls back the hood from his head to reveal his
           face.

           Valerie involuntarily takes a step back and falls onto the
           divan behind her.

           Jordan's bald head and neck are covered with numerous
           scratch marks mostly old scars, though there are a few
           scabs and a few fresh wounds.  His left eye is milky and
           gray.  His nose is partially collapsed.  His lips are
           swollen with giant purplish-red cankers.

                                 VALERIE
                        Please...please don't...

           Valerie, seated on the divan, shuts her eyes.
                                 JORDAN
                        Look at me or I start cutting off
                        your fingers.

           Valerie looks up at his scratched, canker-swollen face.

           Jordan's knife hand disappears beneath his shining, dripping
           poncho.  He keeps his gun trained on Valerie.  Behind him,

           Alicia MOANS and SOBS hysterically, sprawled on the floor--
           one leg bleeding the other broken into an obtuse angle.

           Jordan stands in front of Valerie, his gun pointed at her.

           He leans down and kisses her mouth with his own purplish,
           pustulated lips.  Valerie shakes in rage and disgust, but
           tries to remain as still as possible.

           Jordan leans back and lifts his poncho, exposing his
           phallus.

                                 JORDAN
                              (continuing)
                        It is a bit corroded, but it still
                        functions well enough.

           Valerie vomits.

           Jordan climbs on top of Valerie.  She struggles beneath
           him and starts to SHRIEK.

                                 JORDAN
                        (continuing; nodding

                                 APPROVAL)
                        Scream.  Squirm and scream.

           Valerie stops screaming and stops struggling; she turns
           her head away and ties to detach herself from the coming
           horror...

           Alicia's MOANS begins anew.

           Valerie silently and repeatedly mouths the word 'no' as
           Jordan forces himself between her legs.

                                 VALERIE
                              (whispering)
                        Oh god, Roger.  Oh god.

                                                                FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. WALTER'S WORK ROOM - SAME

           Walter, the diminutive dollmaker, sits at a table in the
           center of his work room.  Pieces of raw wood, spools of
           multi-colored yarn, various tiny ceramic eyeballs and at
           least a hundred carving implements lie on the massive work
           table.
           Walter's HUMMING is barely audible amidst the ROAR of the
           storm outside; he has a slender paint brush in his hand
           and is painting the elaborate headdress of a Native American
           War Chief doll.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        That is a fine looking Indian, and
                        I know of what I speak.

           Walter looks to the open doorway; a poncho-covered Man
           stands just beyond it, in the hall.

                                 WALTER
                        Is it...?

           Billy Lee steps from the shadows.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        It is I.

           Walter smiles.  He rests the doll upon the table and
           scampers over to Billy Lee.  Billy Lee discards his poncho,
           hanging it on the doorknob to the workroom and hunches
           over, his arms extended to greet Walter.

           The two men hug.

           Billy Lee stands back and looks down at Walter; Walter
           looks up at Billy Lee, wearing his fine- albeit soaked-
           gray suit.

                                 WALTER
                        You picked some very inclement
                        weather to travel in.

           Billy Lee nods.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Adverse weather is fitting for
                        people with an adverse dispositions,
                        is it not?

           Billy Lee looks at the dolls that line the shelves of the
           walls.  He sees one of a tall, blonde-haired man wearing a
           gray suit and carrying a gun in either hand.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        Is that a miniature replica of me?

           Billy Lee walks over to the shelf and looks at the doll.

                                 WALTER
                        It is exactly that.  I also did
                        one of mom and one of dad, but
                        they were purchased by a traveling
                        salesmen.

           Billy Lee turns back to face Walter.
                                 BILLY LEE
                        Did that lady come around on you
                        yet- the one with the Saloon?

                                 WALTER
                        Sindy?  Not just yet.  She is
                        intimidated by my intelligence.

           Walter wants to change the subject.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        Why do you venture this way,
                        presently?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        We did it, Wally Lee.

           Walter's eyes widen; he smiles.

                                 WALTER
                        Tonight?  In the storm?  What a
                        wonderful opportunity, what a
                        brilliant conceit!  Was I correct? 
                        Did you find safes or precious
                        stones in the houses I informed
                        you of?

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Every single one brother, every
                        single one.

           Walter's smile grows luminous.

           A moment later, a look of concern flashes upon his face.

                                 WALTER
                        You did not have to...to injure
                        anyone did you, during your
                        burgling?

           Billy Lee looks at his brother's worried face.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Aside from some gentle coercions,
                        no.  The people in this town are
                        cowed by the mere sight of a gun.

           Walter nods his head, not entirely convinced by Billy Lee's
           words, yet wanting to believe them just the same.

                                 WALTER
                        Good.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Presently though, I need to ride
                        out-- my rendezvous time draws
                        nigh.  I cannot risk being nearby
                        when one of the robbed gentlemen
                        frees himself from his bonds.
           Walter is disappointed.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        May I abscond with that miniature
                        replica of me?

           Walter brightens at the thought and scrambles over to pull
           it off of the shelf and hand it to him.

           Billy Lee gently places the doll in his suit pocket and
           hunches over to hug his brother.

                                 BILLY LEE
                              (continuing)
                        I will write to you soon Wally
                        Lee.

           Tears sparkle in Walter's eyes and Billy Lee grows a bit
           melancholic.

           The two men hug.

           Billy Lee leaves, snagging his poncho on the way out.

           EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Billy Lee, wearing his poncho, steps from Walter's yellow,
           one-storey house into the ROARING deluge.  He looks around
           him: the opaque rain falls in thick sheets, occluding his
           surroundings.  From a pocket beneath his poncho he withdraws
           his compass.  He looks at it in the dim light emanating
           from

           Walter's house.

           A BLACK SHAPE emerges from the rain and descends upon him.

           Two pale white hands grab Billy Lee's throat.

           Abraham Weiss and Billy Lee tumble to the ground, SPLASHING
           in the water, SPLATTERING mud pell-mell.  Abraham sits
           atop his adversary, his strong fingers digging into the
           ropy sinews of Billy Lee's neck.

           Billy Lee punches his assailant in the stomach.  Abraham
           does not react; his face is a mask of calm hatred.  He
           squeezes Billy Lee's neck, tighter.  Billy Lee begins to
           choke, his face goes red.  Billy Lee reaches for his pistol
           and withdraws it.

           Before Billy Lee can point the gun, Abraham purposefully
           collapses forward on top of the weapon and his pinned foe.

           The gun is sandwiched flatly between the two men's chests.

           Their faces are only inches apart.

           Abraham has not let go of his opponent's neck; he continues
           to dig his fingers in.  Billy Lee's face darkens further;
           falling rainwater pools in his open mouth.
           He COUGHS and GURGLES and struggles futilely.  Billy Lee
           attempts to pull the sideways-wedged gun out from between
           their chests, but the revolver is too tangled in their wet
           clothing to extract.

           Billy Lee starts to loose consciousness.  He squeezes the
           trigger of the gun that lay flush between the two men.

           BLAM.  BLAM.  BLAM.

           Abraham jumps off of his pinned opponent.

           Billy Lee CRIES out in agony.

           Billy Lee's poncho is torn open, his chest burned and scored
           by the gun's discharge.  Blood begins to pool in the
           diagonal trenches across his skin.

           Abraham's black jacket and vest are shredded; his chest
           beneath is torn open and bleeding profusely.  One of the
           shots punctured his left forearm.  Abraham sees something
           on the ground nearby and snatches it up.

           Billy Lee, COUGHING and GASPING, weakly raises his pistol.

           Abraham turns to flee into the obscurity of the storm.

           By the time Billy Lee is able to raise the pistol, Abraham
           has been absorbed the by the night and the rain.

           GRUNTING in pain and still GASPING for air, Billy Lee stands
           up, the storm pressing heavily upon him.  Gun in hand, he
           flees into the anonymity the storm proffers.

           EXT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - SIX THIRTY IN THE MORNING

           The rain has stopped.  Sunlight shines upon the facade of
           the hotel.

           INT. HOTEL RUDDINGTON - SAME

           Sheriff Pickman lies asleep on one of the sofas, Deputy
           Cooperson on another.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Where's the Sheriff, where's the
                        Sheriff!?!

           Sheriff Pickman and Deputy Cooperson continue to sleep.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Fire that thing into the air-
                        that'll fetch him!

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Stand back.

           KABOOM!  Pickman and Cooperson are immediately awake.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        One more time.
           KABOOM!

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sheriff Pickman!

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sheriff Pickman!

           Pickman and Cooperson are on their feet; the men draw their
           revolvers as they run to the front door of the hotel.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman and Cooperson careen up the avenue, towards an
           elderly COUPLE.  The man holds a smoking double-barrelled
           shotgun.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Put that down, immediately!

           The Old Man complies, resting the shotgun on the wet ground.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Somebody murdered the McDonellys.

           Pickman's eyes widen as he races towards the Elderly Couple.

           Cooperson's eyes flicker in all directions.  Somebody
           SCREAMS in the distance.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sheriff!  Sheriff!

           Pickman looks at Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Get the other deputies.

           Cooperson NODS and SPLASHES away, up the avenue.

           In the distance a young girl SPLASHES down the avenue,
           passing Cooperson, headed towards Pickman.  She is SOBBING.

                                 GIRL
                        Sheriff, Sheriff, Sheriff!
                              (gasp)
                        The Tylors are dead, somebody killed
                        the Tylors!

           Pickman's stomach sinks.  In the distance someone begins
           to WAIL.

           Pickman jogs up the avenue, towards the running Girl.  She
           falls into the water and mud of the ruined avenue with a
           SPLAT.

           Pickman hurries to her and lifts her up, his eyes furtively
           scanning the street.

           The Girl convulses in his arms.
                                 GIRL
                              (continuing)
                        And the barber...
                              (gasp)
                        ...the barber got killed too...
                              (gasp)
                        ...shot his hand off and his...his
                        face.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Ermine?

           The Girl nods.

           Pickman stands up.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        You're Annie Dunforth's little
                        girl?

           The Girl nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Where's you momma at?

                                 GIRL
                        She never come home last night.

           Pickman's stares at the Girl in horror.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        The Sheriff's at the Ruddington!

           Pickman turns around to the Elderly Couple and addresses
           them.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Watch over little Miss Dunforth
                        until things settle down.

           Pickman runs up the avenue.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Val...oh god please...Val...

           Pickman falls into the mud with a SPLAT, dropping his
           pistol.

           He gets back to his feet, picks up the gun, shoves it into
           his holster and runs as hard as he ever has in his entire
           life, SPLASHING water in all directions and soaking himself
           within seconds.

           In the distance somebody SHRIEKS.

           Pickman's feet SPLAT and SPLASH on the soaked avenue.  He
           does not slow his pace even though he can barely breathe.
           EXT. PICKMAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman runs towards his house.  Somewhere nearby a person
           MOANS.

           Pickman runs up to the front porch, beneath the dripping
           overhang.  A sheet of paper is fastened to the door.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Oh god.

           Pickman bounds up the stairs and reads the note:

           'Roger, I am going over to Alicia Binfrey's for the evening. 
           She is a bit of a snob, but I really want to see and listen
           to her phonograph.  I should be back by ten o'clock.  If
           you're lucky, I might be a little drunk.

                                 LOVE YOU, VAL'
                        He opens the door and sticks his
                        head in.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Valerie?  You home kitten?

           There is no response.  Pickman pulls the note from the
           door, shoves it in his jacket pocket and races down the
           porch.  He looks terrified.

           He races up the suburban road, GASPING for breath and
           COUGHING, but not slowing at all.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Somebody killed Dugan!  The mayor's
                        assistant is dead!

           Pickman runs, numb to the horrors around him, only one
           thing...one desperate hope...in his mind.

           A Hysterical Boy comes running at the Sheriff.

                                 HYSTERICAL BOY
                        Sheriff!

           Pickman races right past the child.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (muttering)
                        Please be alright kitten...

           Pickman runs and runs and runs, his boots SPLASHING water
           and SPLATTERING mud; he COUGHS and WHEEZES but does not
           relent.

           EXT. ALICIA BINFREY'S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman runs towards the colored-pebble driveway, past the
           flooded and ruined flower garden.  He looks at the front
           entrance to the mansion.  The door is ajar.
                                 PICKMAN
                        No.

           Pickman's boots CRUNCH upon the colored pebbles of the
           front path; his gasping beeline brings him closer to the
           entrance.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        No.

           He ascends the stairs and enters the house.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION GREETING AREA - SAME

           Pickman enters the marble-floored, mirror-adorned enclosure.

           Ralph the butler lies dead, sprawled upon the floor, a
           black hole where his left eye once was.

           Drawing his gun, Pickman continues further into the house.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION SITTING ROOM - SAME

           Pickman quietly passes through the room; his sharp blue
           eyes, nestled deep within his leathery skin, scan the space. 
           He sees nothing of interest.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION RECREATION ROOM - SAME

           Pickman enters the room.  The first thing he sees is Alicia

           Binfrey's body.  The skin has been removed from her face--

           her wide white eyes up stare up at him horribly from her
           exposed skull.

           Pickman starts to shake.  He looks further into the room. 
           He sees the knocked over phonograph, and behind it the two
           divans.  Valerie is curled up upon the further divan, nude
           and unmoving.  Her eyes are wide open as is her mouth. 
           Her head is twisted almost entirely backwards on her
           shoulders.

           The blood drains from Pickman's face.  Tears roll down his
           cheeks.  He looks away from his wife, unable to endure the
           sight.  He looks at the phonograph lying on the floor.

           EXT. ALICIA BINFREY'S MANSION - SAME

           BLAM.  BLAM.  BLAM.

           BLAM.  BLAM.

           BLAM.

           INT. THE BINFREY MANSION RECREATION ROOM - SAME

           Pickman stares at the pieces of the phonograph he just
           blew apart.  Smoke rises from the barrel of his gun.
           He places his gun back in his holster, his hand shaking
           terribly.

           Pickman looks over at his wife and his stomach sinks, as
           if seeing the tragedy for the very first time.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Kitten...

           He walks over to Valerie, tears stream from his eyes down
           his mud-splattered cheeks.  He sits beside her.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Val.

           Pickman rests his hand on her shoulder.  Upon touching
           her, he begins to shiver uncontrollably.  He exhales a
           horrible shuddering breath as he brushes the hair from her
           eyes.  He shuts her eyelids with his coarse fingers.  He
           closes her agonized mouth.  He becomes nauseated but refuses
           to look away.

           He gently turns her head forward.

           Pickman shuts his eyes and presses his forehead into the
           splash of blond hair that runs down her back.  He hugs her
           as tightly as he can.

           EXT. ALICIA BINFREY'S MANSION - LATER

           Pickman emerges from the mansion, carrying his wife's body.

           He has clothed her in her blue dress.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        The shots came from the Binfrey
                        Mansion.

           Pickman walks down the colored pebble path, cradling Valerie
           against his chest.

           Deputy Bartley and DEPUTY JACKSON, and older able-bodied
           man with silver hair and an angular face, run towards the
           mansion.  They have their guns drawn.

                                 JACKSON
                              (to Bartley)
                        It's the Sheriff.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Shots were reported-

           Bartley sees who the Sheriff is carrying; he is horrified.

           Deputy Jackson crosses himself.  The Deputies run up the
           hill towards Pickman.

           The Sheriff continues to descend the colored-pebble path,
           and the Deputies fall in beisde him, silent for a long,
           horrible moment.
           Bartley rubs the tears from his square face with his thick
           fingers.

                                 BARTLEY
                              (continuing)
                        Is there anything we can do?

                                 JACKSON
                        Should I call a minister?

           Pickman looks at Bartley and then at Jackson.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Call an assembly at town hall.

           One o'clock.  At least one person from every single
           household must attend or the entire family risks bein'
           jailed.

           Bartley nods, wiping tears from his eyes.  Jackson nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Nobody leaves this town.  Lock up
                        anyone tryin' to get out.  Find
                        Abraham Weiss and lock him up. 
                        Send a telegram to Starfield about
                        what happened here.  Send another
                        to Foxville asking for their top
                        detectives.  Get volunteers for a
                        digging committee for those who...

           Pickman's voice trails off.  He inhales deeply and
           continues.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Get a digging committee for those
                        who ain't got somebody left to
                        bury 'em.

                                 BARTLEY
                        Is there anything we can do for
                        you?

           Pickman shakes his head as he walks down the pebble path. 
           He does not look at the deputies when he responds.

                                 PICKMAN
                        No.  I'll be at that meeting. 
                        I'll be there as soon as I've buried-

           Pickman's voice CRACKS.

           He clears his throat and continues.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I'll be there as soon as I've buried
                        my wife beside my little girl.
           EXT. RATTLEBORGE GRAVEYARD - NINE THIRTY

           The young town's graveyard is small: less than one hundred
           people are buried within its confines.  Pickman, shovel in
           hand, looks at a small tombstone upon which is written:

           'Emily Lisa Pickman, Our Beloved Daughter.'

           Next to the grave, lies Valerie's body, nestled in a plainly
           made coffin.  Pickman plunges his shovel into the moist
           earth and starts digging.

           INT. TOWN HALL - ONE O'CLOCK

           The enormous enclosure is filled to capacity with at least
           six hundred distraught and agitated Rattleborge residents.

           A podium with the name 'Rattleborge' written upon it stands
           in the middle of the dais at the front of the hall. 
           Sunlight pours through the six windows at the top of the
           tall eastern wall.

           Little clusters of people ARGUING, TALKING, WEEPING or
           WHISPERING are scattered throughout the assemblage.  Fearful
           and teary eyes turn towards the central door as it CREAKS
           open.

           Mayor Hogan, his face red from crying stands at the podium.

                                 HOGAN
                        Before I speak and do what little
                        I can to console you, let's take
                        us a moment and bow our heads in
                        prayer.

           The townspeople of Rattleborge shut their eyes and bow
           their heads.  Mayor Hogan looks down and at his pocket
           watch.

           Engraved in its silver are the words:

           'HOGAN,

           To the beefiest bull in the Men's Club: Happy Sixtieth
           Birthday you old rascal.

           YOUR PAL, DUGAN'

           Hogan's eyes brim with tears.  He pockets the timepiece
           and looks up at the crowd again.

           Hogan wipes the tears and clears his throat.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Prior to coming here, I done spoke
                        to Minister Darren.  He'll hold
                        three contiguos services tonight
                        with the aid of Parson Howards- to
                        accomodate those in need of
                        spiritual support.
           Sheriff Pickman walks through the doors; he has washed
           himself and put on a clean brown suit, a clean blue shirt
           and a pair of newly shined boots.  He has cleaned his guns
           as well.

           Silence flows like spilled ink over the assemblage.

           Deputy Cooperson, Deputy Bartley and Deputy Jackson enter
           the hall a moment later.  Jackson shuts the door behind
           them.

           The four lawmen walk towards the platform, their heavy
           footsteps CRACK loudly against the polished wood floor;
           the reports echo like fading heartbeats in the enclosure's
           high rafters.

           Mayor Hogan steps away from the podium.  He nods solemnly
           to Pickman and pats his tenderly on his shoulder.

           The wet, red and fearful eyes of the numerous attendees
           watch the Sheriff stand behind the podium.  The Deputies
           stand beside the Sheriff.

           Pickman looks forward, at the amassed townspeople before
           him.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Sixty-three were murdered in
                        Rattleborge last night.

           Some WHISPERING and TALKING swells within the crowd.

           Pickman waits for it to subside.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I do not make idle threats, as
                        most of you already know.

           Anger colors Pickman's face.  He grips the sides of the
           podium, waiting for his rage to subside.  Pickman exhales
           a hot breath through his nose and then coolly inhales
           through his mouth.  He breathes out again- slowly- and
           clears his throat.

           Cooperson, Bartley, Jackson, the Mayor and the crowd watch
           Pickman struggle with his anger and grief for a long,
           uncomfortable moment.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Somebody here knows something 'bout
                        what happened.  All of our
                        wealthiest citizens were robbed
                        and murdered by the foul men who
                        came and went with the storm. 
                        Somebody who knows this town- and
                        knows it thoroughly- aided
                        these...these jackals.
           Pickman surveys the crowd, as do Cooperson, Bartley and
           Jackson.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        If you know something or were
                        somehow involved- accidentally or
                        willingly- come to me before sundown
                        tonight and come clean, and I'll
                        deal with you squarely as a man
                        bound by the law.

           Again rage consumes Pickman; he waits for the internal
           tempest to pass before continuing.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        If I find out that you withheld
                        information from me, I swear on
                        the graves of my wife and my little
                        girl, I will hand over my badge
                        and I will cut out your tongue and
                        nail it to the town sign.

           The assembly is frozen by the Sheriff's words: for an
           instant nobody moves, nobody blinks.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing; nodding)
                        I will be on my front porch waitin'
                        for you.

           Pickman turns from the podium, walks off of the platform
           and leaves the hall.

           Mayor Hogan exchanges worried glances with Deputy Cooperson.

           Cooperson whispers into Bartley's ear and then runs after
           the Sheriff.

           Buried deep within the crowd, Walter pales and begins to
           tremble.  Cold sweat pours down the diminutive dollmaker's
           face.

           EXT. TOWN JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman walks towards the jail, flanked by Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                        How many volunteers we got for the
                        diggin'?

                                 COOPERSON
                        Far more than we need.

           Pickman nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Let's see if our suspect is
                        conscious.
           INT. TOWN JAIL, RECEIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman and Cooperson walk into the stone-walled builing.

           The guard, a stocky woman of fifty named GERTRUDE, sits
           behind the front desk, beside the door leading to the cells.

                                 PICKMAN
                        He wake up yet?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I think so-- I heard some moanin'
                        and some kinda talkin' in another
                        language: babblin' and whatnot. 
                        And that colored fella is hungry.

           Pickman pulls a key from his vest, inserts it into the
           lock and twists it.

           INT. TOWN JAIL, HOLDING CELLS - MOMENTS LATER

           Ten jail cells fill the space, each with a small wooden
           stool, a cot and a metal bucket.  In one cell sits Mango,
           the piano player.  He stands up as Pickman and Cooperson
           enter.

           In another cell lies an Elderly Man, asleep.  In another
           cell lies a Native American with his arm over his eyes.

           In the furthest cell- distant from the others- is Abraham
           Weiss. His chest and left forearm have been bandaged.  He
           sits on the small wooden stool, staring at the floor.

           Pickman and Cooperson walk towards Abraham.

                                 MANGO
                        Why am I in here, Sheriff?  I didn't
                        have nothin' to do with them
                        killings'.  You just lock up colored
                        folk with no-

           Pickman turns to face Mango.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Like the other men in here- two of
                        whom are white- you're a stranger
                        in town at the time of the killings. 
                        Until I know more, bein' a stranger
                        makes you a suspect.  So if you'll-

                                 ABRAHAM
                        These men are innocent, as am I.

           Pickman, irked at being interrupted, turns his head to
           Abraham.  The Sheriff's eyes smolder; he walks in front of
           Abraham Weiss' cell.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What do you know?
                                 ABRAHAM
                        There were three of them, correct?

           Pickman and Cooperson exchange glances but say nothing.

           Abraham stands up from his chair and walks towards the
           bars.

           Even though he is a bit unstable on his feet, his eyes
           never leave Pickman's.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        I know the name of their leader. 
                        I know how they knew which houses
                        to rob.  And I will divulge nothing
                        unless you allow me to hunt them
                        down and kill them with you.

           Pickman surges against the bars and grabs Abraham by the
           throat.  The Sheriff pulls the prisoner close to his face,
           so that their noses are practically touching.  Pickman's
           eyes are like cold blue gems; his voice is strong and
           measured when he speaks.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Don't interrupt me and do not dare
                        put terms to me.  You are my
                        prisoner and right now you're the
                        primary suspect in the worst crime
                        perpetrated in the history of this
                        state.  You'll tell me what you
                        know and you'll stipulate no
                        conditions.

           Abraham stares back, incurious, aloof.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        While I was unconscious, did the
                        doctor who sewed and bandaged me
                        describe or perhaps show you the
                        many ways in which I have been
                        mutilated?

                                 PICKMAN
                        He did.  He showed me.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Those are self-inflicted wounds
                        Sheriff.  I did those things to
                        myself with the surgical instruments
                        I once healed people with.

           Abraham shakes his head.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        No, Sheriff.  There is nothing you
                        can do that will intimidate me.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABRAHAM (CONT'D)
                        There is no pain you can inflict
                        upon me worse than the pain I
                        inflict upon myself daily, as
                        punishment.

           Pickman loosens his grasp upon Abraham's collar.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        Release me Sheriff.  Together we
                        will find and kill these foul men.

           Pickman's face reddens in frustration.  He turns away from
           Abraham, unsure of how to proceed.

           Cooperson looks at Abraham.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Withholding evidence in a multiple
                        homicide investigation is tantamount
                        to being an accessory, Mister Weiss. 
                        You can be hanged for not complying
                        in a case such as this.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        If you wish to hang me, do so after
                        I've aided you and exacted justice.

           Pickman turns back to the bars and looks between them at
           Abraham.  The Sheriff speaks slowly and with empathy.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Did they kill your wife?  Is that
                        whose face is etched in those
                        bullets?

           Abraham walks back to his stool.  He tilts his head down
           and stares at the floor, his eyes are dead and distant.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        When I am in a dark room- punishing
                        myself with my blades her spectre
                        appears before me.  During her
                        visits, we talk to each other and
                        remember happier times in the
                        fatherland...or when we first came
                        to this country.  But always, just
                        before she departs, she says, 'Why
                        do the men who raped and killed me
                        still live?'

           Pickman bites his lower lip in an effort to suppress his
           own emotions.  Cooperson looks at Abraham, unnerved by his
           revelation.  Mango returns to his cot, worriedly looking
           towards Abraham.

           Abraham sits like a statue upon the small chair.

           Cooperson puts his hand on Pickman's shoulder.
                                 COOPERSON
                        We should go, Sheriff.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (to Cooperson)
                        Wait.
                              (to Abraham)
                        You'd let these brigands kill again-
                        murder other innocents- if you
                        couldn't kill 'em yourself?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I would.  It is for my wife, you
                        understand...I must kill them for
                        her.

           Pickman, his eyes distant, nods.  Cooperson and Pickman
           leave.

           INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter, pale and terrified, looks out of the front window
           of his living room, towards the street.  Sheriff Pickman
           and Deputy Cooperson walk past.  Walter holds his breath.

           EXT. PICKMAN'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Pickman sits in a rocking chair on his porch, staring at
           the sunset.  In his laps lies the note that Valerie left
           for him.

           Cooperson walks towards the house.  He takes off his hat
           as he climbs the steps to the porch.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Deputy.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Sheriff.

           Pickman folds the note and puts it in his vest pocket.  He
           points to the rocking chair beside him.  Cooperson nods
           and sits in it.  The two men stare off at the setting sun.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Did anybody come to you with any
                        new information?

                                 PICKMAN
                        No.  Lots of people come by and
                        give me condolensces, but nobody
                        said anythin' of any import.  You?

                                 COOPERSON
                        Phyllis Cranston says that she
                        might have heard some men talking
                        in the storm and Sindy Waterford
                        says that she might have seen some
                        men walking around in the rain.
                                 PICKMAN
                        That's it?

           Cooperson nods.

                                 COOPERSON
                        How are you holding up?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Not so good.  Just thinkin' about
                        finding the fellows who did
                        this...and about her.  Just those
                        two things, back and forth, back
                        and forth.

           Pickman nods, affirming his own statement.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I've got a question for you.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Yes?

                                 PICKMAN
                        You're a man of God.

                                 COOPERSON
                        I am.

                                 PICKMAN
                        When I was on the hill this morning,
                        diggin' my wife's grave, I saw a
                        rainbow.

           Pickman turns from the sunset and looks at Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I'm buryin' my wife next to my
                        five year old girl...and in the
                        sky is the prettiest rainbow I've
                        ever seen.  For the briefest moment-
                        forgettin' that Val was dead- I
                        wanted to show it to her.  And
                        then it hits me for the twentieth
                        time that mornin' that she's gone. 
                        And still there's that rainbow
                        hangin' up there smiling at
                        me...mocking me as I'm diggin' a
                        hole to bury my whole life in.

           Pickman rubs his hands together and shakes his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        All I could think was that there's
                        no order, no logic to anything--
                        no reason to what happens here on
                        earth.  Can you or your bible make
                        some sense of this massacre?
                                 COOPERSON
                        Violence is one of the stained
                        hammers that comes with freewill,
                        and it can be wielded by both the
                        wicked and the righteous.  Men are
                        not controlled by the creator,
                        merely made in His image.

                                 PICKMAN
                        If there is a higher power, a
                        watchful eye up there, what the
                        hell was he doin' last night while
                        this town was bein'
                        slaughtered...and my wife was bein'
                        violated?  Why didn't he give us a
                        sign or let us know what was
                        happenin'?

           Pickman's face colors with anger.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Where was your Lord then, Cooperson?

           Cooperson does not respond; he stares sympathetically at
           Pickman, shaking his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Sorry...I don't mean to attack
                        you, I know that you come out here
                        to check up on me and I appreciate
                        that.

                                 COOPERSON
                        I do not want to preach to you
                        Roger, I am here as your friend--
                        to listen and help you in any way
                        that I can.

           Pickman nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I do appreciate that.

           Pickman SLAPS Cooperson's knee and looks back at the sunset.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Ever since my girl died, I had a
                        hard time believin'.  You remember
                        Emily don't you?  Prettiest little
                        girl there ever was.

           Cooperson's face pales.  His hands start to tremble.  He
           nods.

                                 COOPERSON
                        She was a beautiful little angel.
                                 PICKMAN
                        When she passed on, Val and I
                        stopped goin' to church.  You see,
                        our prayers weren't answered. 
                        But, after some rough years, we
                        eventually found our way back to
                        happiness...and we didn't need the
                        roads of religion to lead us there. 
                        And at some point I started to
                        wonder: were people happier before
                        there were churches?  In that time,
                        I think if a man had a problem he
                        fixed it himself, he didn't ask
                        for some invisible power to fix it
                        for him or forgive him for his
                        transgressions.  He figured out
                        what needed doin' and then went
                        and did it.

           Pickman leans forward in his chair and looks at Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I've made my decision Deputy.  I
                        can't give those brigands any more
                        of a head start than I already
                        have.  Can you watch the town while
                        I'm gone?

           Cooperson's eyes widen.  He nods.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Thank you.

           Pickman give Cooperson his badge.

           INT. TOWN JAIL, HOLDING CELLS - NIGHT

           Carrying a two-buckle saddlebag, Pickman enters the holding
           cell area.  A lone light bulb glares in the center of the
           space, throwing opaque shadows in all directions.  Mango,
           the Elderly Man and the Native American male are all eating
           their suppers from metal plates.  In his corner cell,
           Abraham sits on his stool staring at the floor.  His food
           is untouched.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Abraham Weiss.

           Abraham tilts his head up.  Pickman pulls a pair of
           handcuffs from his brown suit jacket.

           EXT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           The lights are on within the saloon.  Walter walks up the
           steps towards the establishment, holding a gift-wrapped
           oblong box.  His eyes are distant and glazed like a starved
           dog's.

           The box he carries is heavy.
           EXT. TOWN JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Two horses are tethered to the tieing pole just outside of
           the jail.  The sound of a congregation SINGING GOSPEL wafts
           on the chilly night air.  Pickman and Abraham exit the
           jail; Abraham is handcuffed.

           Pickman unties the reins of the two brown steeds.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Here.

           He hands the reins of the smaller horse to Abraham.  Abraham
           takes the reins.

           The two men walk the horses down the avenue, out of the
           light spilling from the windows of the jail.

           EXT. MCDONELLY'S FINE JEWELS AND THINGS - MOMENTS LATER

           Illumined solely by the sliver of moon hanging in the sky,
           the two men lead their mounts before the closed jewelry
           store.  Pickman looks at the sign and- remembering the
           proprietor- shakes his head.  He walks over to Abraham and
           unlocks his handcuffs.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You will let me torture the one
                        who savaged my wife in the manner
                        of my choosing?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Yes...but I get the other two. 
                        And you answer my questions as to
                        how you know so much and wound up
                        here.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Agreed.  To find these men we need
                        the dollmaker.  He has not departed
                        Rattleborge, I hope.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Walter Lee Higginsford?

           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter, carrying the oblong box, walks inside the Saloon.

           Two MEN sit at the bar: their faces are long with sorrow.

           Empty glasses sit before them.  Sindy stands behind the
           bar, drying recently washed whisky glasses with a tattered
           rag.

           She does not see Walter.

           The diminutive dollmaker makes his was to the bar.  His
           hands, tremulous and white-knuckled, grip the big box.

           He looks inside the spittoon: it is empty.
           Walter places the oblong box upon the bar and clambers up
           upon the bar stool, down which his feet dangle like a
           child's.

           Sindy turns around and sees him.

                                 SINDY
                        I'm glad to see that you're alright
                        Walter.

           The dollmaker nervously nods.  Sindy walks over and looks
           at him.

                                 SINDY
                              (continuing)
                        Whiskey with fruit syrup and three
                        cherries?

           Walter, sweating profusely, nods.

                                 SINDY
                              (continuing)
                        Take off your jacket if you're
                        hot.

           Walter nods again, but does not remove his jacket.  Sindy
           turns away from him.

           Walter nervously TAPS his fingers on the oblong box as
           Sindy mixes his drink.  Sindy tuns back around.

           She places the small amber drink beside the box.

                                 SINDY
                              (continuing)
                        No charge.

           Sindy turns around and walks away.  Walter eyes the cherries
           floating in the drink.  His fingers nervously TAP the lid
           of the box, in a continuous tattoo.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - SAME

           Pickman and Abraham ride their horses down the avenue at a
           quick gallop.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You go to his house, I'll check
                        Sindy's.  Don't cross me Abraham,

           OR-

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I will hold to our agreement,
                        Sheriff.

           Abraham yanks his reins hard, wincing as he strains his
           bullet-pierced left arm.  He rides towards the suburbs.

           Pickman SNAPS his reins.  The Sheriff speeds his mount
           forward, down the avenue.
           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - SAME

           Walter unties the blue polka-dotted ribbon fastened around
           the oblong box and lets it fall to the bar.  He picks up
           his small dark drink and swirls it gently.  The cherries
           orbit the circumference of the glass like little red
           planets.

           Walter drinks the entire glass and SLAMS it down, startling
           Sindy and the other two patrons.  He chews the cherries
           twice and swallows.

                                 WALTER
                        I would like another.

           Walter runs his fingertips around the edge of the box's
           lid.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman's horse gallops down the avenue.

           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Sindy places another drink before Walter.

                                 SINDY
                        Don't drink too much, alright?

           Walter, irked by the comment, takes the drink in his hand
           and downs it in one violent motion.

           EXT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman rides up before the Saloon.  He hastily climbs off
           of his horse.  A woman SCREAMS inside the bar.

           Pickman draws his revolvers as he runs up the stairs.

           INT. SINDY'S SALOON - SAME

           Walter stands on his stool, pointing a double-barreled
           shotgun down at Sindy's chest.  The saloon doors swing
           wide.

           The Sheriff storms in.

           Walter turns his head to the Sheriff.

                                 WALTER
                        Drop your guns.

           Pickman gauges Walter; he immediately assesses that the
           little man is volatile.  He drops his silver-plated guns;
           they CLATTER onto the sawdust-covered floor.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
           TAKE A SEAT SHERIFF, UNLESS YOU-

           Sindy grabs the barrel of the shotgun, points it away from
           her and yanks.

           KABOOM.  The wall of bottles SHATTERS; their contents pour
           out as if a dam to a river of whiskey has just collapsed.

           Walter falls from his stool and tumbles face first onto
           bar with a CRACK.  Sindy wrenches the shotgun away from
           his grasping fingers.

           Walter reaches beneath his blue suit jacket.

           Pickman leans over and grabs one of his dropped pistols
           from the floor.

           Walter withdraws a tiny two-shot handgun from his suit
           jacket and raises it.

           Pickman levels his pistol at Walter.  Sindy drops behind
           the bar.  Walter plunges the tiny handgun into his own
           open mouth; he shuts his eyes.

           BANG.

           Walter CRIES out and grabs his shoulder, at the point where
           Pickman's bullet just pierced him.

           Walter's pistol CLATTERS to the bar and then CLATTERS upon
           the ground.  The two Patrons at the bar run out of the
           establishment.  Pickman rushes Walter.

           The dollmaker clasps his bleeding shoulder.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        You shot me!

           Pickman grabs Walter by the collar and yanks him from the
           bar, hurling him to the floor.  The little man SLAMS upon
           the ground.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Get up.

           Walter scrambles to his feet, his left hand clutching his
           bleeding right shoulder.  Pickman shoves the barrel of his
           pistol into the nape of Walter's neck.

           With his free hand, the Sheriff picks up his second pistol
           and holsters it.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Walk.

           Walter walks forward, Pickman walking directly behind him
           like a giant shadow.
           EXT. SINDY'S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham sits atop his horse, standing beside Pickman's.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (to Abraham)
                        He was about to kill the
                        proprietor...or himself...or maybe
                        me.  Didn't have much luck.

           Abraham looks at the little man.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How serious is his wound?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Not very.  Bullet got clean through--
                        only nicked his shoulder bone. 
                        Patch it up later when we're clear
                        from town.

           Abraham nods.  Walter looks up at the black clad, strangely
           accented stranger.  With and ungentle motion, Pickman
           handcuffs Walter.

                                 WALTER
                        Owwww.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (to Pickman)
                        I need to retrieve my instruments
                        from the Ruddington.

           Pickman nods as he kneels next to Walter.  The Sheriff
           handcuffs his prisoner's ankles together.

                                 WALTER
                        Wait a-

           Pickman pushes Walter's chest; the little man stumbles
           backwards, but the slack on the handcuffs fettering him
           makes it impossible for him to maintain his balance.  He
           SPLATS on his back in the mud of the ruined road.

           With the toe of his left boot, Pickman rolls Walter onto
           his stomach.  Pickman ties a rope tightly around Walter's
           ankles.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        Wait a minute Sheriff!

           Pickman wraps the rope around the cross strap at the back
           of his horse's saddle and secures it thoroughly.

           Abraham reaches into his black jacket and extracts a small
           dark shape.  He tosses the item to Pickman.

           The Sheriff catches the tossed item and looks at it.  In
           his hands he holds the doll of Billy Lee.
                                 ABRAHAM
                        That is what Walter's brother looks
                        like.  He is the leader of the
                        band that came here.

           Pickman looks balefully at Walter.

                                 WALTER
                        Sheriff, you can't do this...I
                        didn't know he was gonna hurt anyone--
                        he said he wouldn't hurt anyone!

           The Sheriff climbs into his saddle and SNAPS his reins. 
           The horse GALLOPS forward.  The loose rope wrapped around
           Walter's feet grows taught.

           Walter, lying facedown in the muddy, rocky avenue is yanked
           forward, GURGLING and YELLING.

           Abraham SNAPS his reins and follows.

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           Pickman pulls back on the reins, halting his horse.  Abraham
           pulls up beside him.

           They look at the dragged dollmaker, lethargically squirming
           in the grass behind Pickman's horse.  Walter's face is a
           mask of mud and blood.  He has lost two teeth, the tip of
           his nose and a portion of his left ear.  He GROANS in dull
           agony.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You gonna take us to your brother?

           Walter spits something solid into the dry grass.

                                 WALTER
                        I'm not sure...where...I'm not
                        sure where he's gone to.  Please
                        Sheriff...please b-believe me...he
                        didn't tell me where...

           Walter starts to SOB again.

                                 PICKMAN
                        But you know places he might turn
                        up.  A gal he fancies?  A whorehouse
                        he frequents?  A place where he
                        can unload the jewels he took from
                        Rattleborge?

           Walter continues SOBBING.

                                 WALTER
                        I know where his...his wife and k-
                        kids are.

           Pickman, surprised by the dollmaker's words, looks over
           towards Abraham.  The black-clothed doctor looks at the
           hanging sliver of moon up above.
                                 PICKMAN
                        Where do his wife and kids live?

                                 WALTER
                        Quarterstone.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Quarterstone.

           Pickman climbs out of his saddle and walks beside Walter.

           The dollmaker shudders and shakes.  He looks at Pickman
           and then away again, as if the sight physically hurts his
           eyes.

           Pickman kneels beside the dollmaker and unravels the rope
           around his feet.

                                 WALTER
                        You won't...you won't tell Billy
                        Lee I helped you, will you?

                                 PICKMAN
                        When I find him, there ain't gonna
                        be much in the way of conversation.

           EXT. HILLY REGION - MOMENTS BEFORE DAWN

           Pickman and Abraham ride their horses eastwards.  The
           horizon is a luminous royal blue, heralding the sun's
           imminent arrival.  Across the back of Pickman's horse lies
           Walter, face down; his feet drape the horse's left flank
           and his arms and head drape the horse's right.

           Walter MOANS.

           Pickman watches a distant bird sketch elaborate circles
           against the sky.

           Walter RETCHES, but his stomach is completely empty and
           has nothing left to yield.

                                 WALTER
                        I'm dying, Sheriff...I'm dying...

           Pickman and Abraham say nothing.  The horses canter forward.

           EXT. HILLY REGION - DAWN

           Upon their horses, the three press on.  Walter GRUNTS and
           MOANS with the horse's every movement.

                                 PICKMAN
                        We can't have him moanin' when
                        we're threadin' through the passes
                        in this area.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I will tend to his injuries.

           Pickman pulls on his reins, as does Abraham.
           Abraham climbs down from his horse.  He walks to the packs
           fastened to his steed's posterior and unfastens his thick
           black suitcase.  He unbuckles the straps that hold it shut.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        How far is Quarterstone?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Two and a half days' ride through
                        Canhougache country and at least
                        five if we take the safe passage
                        around.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        We are opting for the shorter route?

                                 PICKMAN
                        We are.

           Abraham nods and cracks open his bag.  He withdraws a vial
           with powder and yellowish crystals that he then places in
           the pocket of his black jacket.

           Walter MOANS and fruitlessly RETCHES again.

           Abraham withdraws a vial containing a sepia-toned fluid
           and then a slender leather pack, ten inches long.  He
           UNSNAPS the leather pack and from it, withdraws a glass
           syringe reinforced with steel wiring.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        What're you givin' him?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Morphine.

           Abraham dissolves a few of the crystals inside the solution-
           filled vial.

           Walter MOANS.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That stuff'll quieten him?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        It will quieten him.

           Abraham places the vials back inside his black suitcase.

           Upturned syringe in his left hand, Abraham walks over to
           Walter.  He twists the dollmaker's arm around to get at an
           artery.  Walter GROANS.

           Abraham slides the long needle expertly into the soft
           underside of Walter's arm.  He presses the plunger.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Looks like you're givin' him quite
                        a dose.
                                 ABRAHAM
                        Addicts have no secrets.

           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - NOON

           Atop their two horses, the three men ride eastward.  Walter
           in unconscious.  His face and his shoulder have been sewn
           up and bandaged.

                                 PICKMAN
                        How'd you know?  How did you know
                        they'd be headed to Rattleborge?

           Abraham, his wide black hat tilted very low over his face,
           glances at Pickman.  Two black gems sparkle from within
           his shadow-obscured face.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        When I returned to my wagon and
                        found my wife dead and ravaged,
                        there was a letter smoking in the
                        campfire, not yet completely
                        consumed.  On it was the name Walter
                        Lee Higginsford and his address in
                        Rattleborge.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That's it?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Yes.

           The horses canter forward.

                                 PICKMAN
                        How'd you know when they'd turn
                        up?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I did not know when...or even if
                        they ever would.  It just happened
                        that they arrived shortly after
                        me.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That seems to be the way of this
                        world-- no reason for anythin'.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You have no religious faith?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Not anymore.  You?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        I practiced Judaism once, but not
                        since I saw how the faithful were
                        rewarded.  What the 'Chosen Ones'
                        like my wife and I were chosen
                        for.
           Pickman eyes a few carrion birds whirling in the distance,
           quickly going nowhere.  Abraham watches the creatures wind
           their invisible weft in the sky.

           The two men ride silently for a moment, watching the birds.

           The sound of horse hooves gently breaking dry grass whispers
           in the riders' ears.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        In the small hours of the night,
                        my blades and my blood and my pain
                        summon my wife back to me.  That
                        is my faith-- private and
                        purposeful.

           Pickman looks at the shadow-stained and scarred face of
           Abraham, and then looks away, wary.  The two horses, with
           their three breathing burdens, canter eastward.  The
           conversation has ended.

           EXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - TWILIGHT

           The horses gently pick their way across the sere, orange-
           hued terrain.  Loose stones roll down the small hills,
           away from the steeds' hooves, like fleeing children. 
           Pickman scans the horizon ahead, but sees nothing.  Abraham
           looks west, seeing nothing but more rock.

           Pickman looks south.  In the very distance a small black
           speck glides across the rocky topography.  Pickman shakes
           his head, dismayed.

           Pickman turns in his saddle and opens up one of the
           saddlebags.  He extracts two black pistols from the bag:
           the Steisselbachs.  He pulls back on his reins and motions
           for Abraham to canter up beside him.

           The doctor pulls up alongside the Pickman, where he receives
           his two Steisselbach pistols.

           Abraham examines the guns.  He SNAPS the front suspension
           lever down; the barrel swivels out into a loading position
           in one quick, automated motion.  Abraham withdraws a bullet
           and looks at the etching he carved into it.

                                 PICKMAN
                        She was a pretty woman.

           Abraham nods.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        She is.

           He places the bullet back into the barrel and flips the
           suspension lever up; the barrel locks back into place with
           a CLICK.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Don't fire that thing unless I do.
           The Indians round here can be dealt with peaceably, though
           not always.

           Abraham slides the pistols inside the empty holsters still
           at his waist.

           EXT. CAVE MOUTH IN THE ROCKY REGION - NIGHT

           Pickman rests a few twigs on the tiny fire he has made
           within the nestled and shielded cave.  Beside him lay
           Walter, handcuffed, fettered and unconscious.  Abraham,
           holding his black suitcase, stands at the cave mouth.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispering)
                        I will return later tonight.

           Pickman looks at the Doctor and shakes his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispering)
                        This ain't the kind of place in
                        which to hack at yourself and mumble
                        in the dark.  Canhougache infest
                        these parts.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispering)
                        The summoning ritual occurs only
                        in pure darkness-- it will not
                        draw the attention of the
                        Canhougache.

           Pickman sees that he is not going to dissuade Abraham.  He
           tosses a couple more tiny twigs into the fire.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispering)
                        Be careful and be quiet.

           Abraham nods and departs, absorbed by the night.

           Pickman leans back against the wall of the cave.

                                 WALTER
                              (loudly)
                        The doctor is insane.

           Pickman lunges at the dollmaker and presses the thick palm
           of his left hand to Walter's mouth.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered)
                        Unless you want to be Canhougache
                        chow, keep quiet.

           Walter's morphine-glazed eyes drift to Pickman.  The
           dollmaker focuses his jumbled thoughts.
                                 WALTER
                              (whispered)
                        The doctor...he is deceiving you,
                        Sheriff.  He used to run with my
                        brother's band, years back...but
                        Billy Lee thought he was too
                        volatile...too unpredictable to
                        involve in his extralegal endeavors. 
                        He is a treacherous-

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered)
                        I may not know all them fancy words
                        you know Higginsford, but I can
                        smell bullshit the second a bull
                        starts to squat.  Lie to me again
                        and I'll drag you all day tomorrow.

           Walter wrinkles his bandaged nose and looks balefully at
           Pickman.  The dollmaker shuts his eyes and lays his head
           upon the convex rock given to him for a pillow.

           EXT. ROCKY VALLEY - LATE DAY

           From a nearby defile, Pickman and Abraham ride their steeds
           into the open valley.  The two brown horses are lathered
           and exhausted.

                                 PICKMAN
                        We gotta rest 'em.

           Pickman surveys the valley.  Deeper in lies a small stream
           surrounded by a few ugly bushes and trees.  Pickman points
           to the water.  Abraham sees it and nods.

           Both men climb off of their horses.  They take the reins
           and lead their mounts to the water.  Walter, flopped over
           the rear of Pickman's horse, MOANS weakly.

           The horses dip their long necks and put their mouths into
           the cool water.

           Pickman takes off his hat and dunks his face into the water.

           He pulls his face out, wiping away the day's grime.  He
           cups his hands, plunges them into the water, and lifts up
           a handful to drink.

           Walter MOANS.

           Abraham dips a small steel cup into the water and drinks
           from it.  Pickman glances at the far rims of the valley
           they are in.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        We're too visible here.  Once the
                        horses've had enough, we gotta
                        find another spot.
           Abraham, holding his wire-reinforced glass syringe, walks
           up to Walter.  He twists Walter's left arm around.  Four
           purplish-red weals stand out from previous injections.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Don't kill him.

           Abraham slides the needle in and presses the plunger. 
           Walter

           SIGHS.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (to Walter)
                        What is the name of Billy Lee's
                        wife?

                                 WALTER
                        Becky.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Where does she live?

                                 WALTER
                        Quarterstone.

           Abraham replaces the syringe in the narrow leather pack
           and SNAPS it shuts.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How old is Becky?

                                 WALTER
                        Twenty-seven.

           Abraham walks to the stream and dips his steel cup into
           the water.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        What are the names of Becky's
                        children?

                                 WALTER
                        Regina, Thomas and Clarence.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How old is Thomas?

                                 WALTER
                        Eight.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        How many are in Billy Lee's band?

                                 WALTER
                        Three.  Billy Lee and the two he
                        freed from prison: a fat man and a
                        diseased rapist.
                                 ABRAHAM
                        Open your mouth.

           Walter does.  Abraham pours the water into the sticky
           carmine hole that is the dollmaker's upturned, open mouth. 
           Walter SPUTTERS and GURGLES and then swallows the liquid
           down.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (to Abraham)
                        That's what he said this mornin'
                        and last night, right?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Other than the wife's age- which
                        last night he said was twenty-six-
                        he says the same exact thing each
                        time I question him.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What he says is true then?

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Very likely.  It would take a person
                        of incredible focus and resolve to
                        lie while contending with such
                        varying amounts of pain and
                        narcotic.  We should find Becky
                        and her children Regina, Thomas
                        and Clarence in Quarterstone.

           Pickman scoops up more water and swallows it down.  He
           exhales and then looks over at Abraham.

                                 PICKMAN
                        We ain't gonna be killin' no women
                        or kids, in case you're thinkin'
                        along those lines, doctor.

           Abraham walks back to his horse and puts his syringe case
           away.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        We will not kill them.

           Pickman looks into the shadows beneath Abraham's hat, but
           sees nothing.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Or hurt them either.

           Abraham climbs upon his horse, but does not respond.

           EXT. NARROW DEFILE - END OF SUNSET

           Atop the two steeds, the three men wind deeper into the
           jagged terrain.  The last rays of the sun do not enter the
           defile they are in.  The trio rides beneath the lit plateau,
           completely within heavy shadow.
           EXT. NICHE - NIGHT

           The horses are tethered outside a niche in a wide low pass;
           the steeds' heads hang low to the ground.

           Walter, handcuffed and fettered, lies passed out, face
           first in the six-foot deep crack the men have chosen to
           camp in.

           There is no fire or illumination of any kind within the
           niche.  Pickman and Abraham stare up at the stars and the
           wisp of moon hanging in the black vault above them.

           Pickman reaches into his vest and from its inner pocket
           withdraws a sealed envelope.  He turns the parcel over
           with his coarse hands, the dim moonlight making it glow
           royal blue.  Written upon the envelope are the words: 
           'Sheriff Roger Pickman's Bonus'

           He turns the envelope over in his hands and looks at the
           wax seal: 'Mayor Hogan of Rattleborge'.

           Pickman places the envelope back inside his vest.

           EXT. STEEP, ROCKY SLOPE - DAWN

           Pickman and Abraham lead their horses by the reins down
           the treacherous terrain.  The horses pick carefully as
           they descend, carrying the packs and Walter.  Loosened
           pebbles and stones roll ahead of declining assemblage,
           CLICKING and CRACKING as they spill down.

           Pickman silently mutters curses with each loud noise the
           rolling stones cause.

           They are two-thirds of the way down the hill when they see
           a NATIVE AMERICAN appear at the bottom.

           Pickman turns and looks up the slope.  A NATIVE AMERICAN
           stands at the top of the rise, looking directly at him.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered to Abraham)
                        There's one at the top too.  Let's
                        continue down and act friendly.

           Abraham nods.

           Pickman and the doctor continue to lead their horses down
           the slope.

           TEN MORE NATIVE AMERICAN MEN and WOMEN emerge from the
           brush beside the bottom of the slope.  Most of them carry
           spears, though few have bows.

           Pickman shakes his head and curses silently.
                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing;
                               whispered)
                        The marks look like Maccanoi--
                        they're rivals with the Canhougache.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispered)
                        Should we not take advantage of
                        the superior range of our weapons?

           Pickman looks at the top of the range.  SIX MACCANOI stand
           atop it.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered)
                        No.  We're pinned on an open and
                        unstable surface.  Let's hope we
                        can treat with them.

           The Maccanoi start to CHATTER in excited voices.  The
           foremost Maccanoi points behind Abraham.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispered)
                        They want my horse.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered)
                        No.  They want Walter.  They think
                        he is dead.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (whispered)
                        They wish to eat him?

                                 PICKMAN
                              (whispered)
                        Yeah.

           Pickman and Abraham are now only twenty feet uphill from
           the eleven Maccanoi Warriors.

           The LEADER, a shirtless Maccanoi with black stripes painted

           across his chest and green stripes across his face, points
           at Walter.  The Leader then points to his own belly and
           the belly of a Woman standing beside him.

           Pickman shakes his head, 'no'.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        He is still alive.

           Pickman walks over and nudges Walter.  Walter MOANS.

           The Maccanoi Leader's eye widen.  He turns around and
           addresses his brethren.  The Maccanoi Leader turns back to
           Pickman.
                                 MACCANOI LEADER
                        Hungry.

           Abraham waves his hands.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (to the Maccanoi
                               Leader)
                        Look.

           All of the Maccanoi look at Abraham.  He walks over to
           Walter.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        Look.

           Abraham points to Walter's left leg and then to Walter's
           right leg.  Abraham walks over to the Maccanoi Leader and
           points to his stomach and then to the stomachs of other
           Maccanoi.

           The Maccanoi Leader nods and smiles.

                                 MACCANOI LEADER
                        Yes.

           Pickman's face goes pale.  Sweat glistens on his forehead.

           He turns and watches Abraham unbuckle his black suitcase.

           The doctor withdraws a bone saw.

           Pickman looks away.

           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - LATE DAY

           Clear of the rocky terrain, Pickman and Abraham speed their
           horses along.

           Walter is tied to the back of Pickman's horse.  He has no
           legs.  His remaining stumps are sewn, bandaged and bound
           tightly.

           Walter's morphine-glazed eyes stare at the sun.  He does
           not blink.

           EXT. OPEN PLAINS - NIGHT

           Pickman and Abraham sit around the campfire.  Abraham eats
           a crust of bread smeared with lard.  Pickman just stares
           into the fire, the blaze reflecting from a vast distance
           in his blue eyes.  Walter, still handcuffed, stares up at
           the moon.

                                 WALTER
                              (delirious)
                        I just...I just wanted to scare
                        her...I only intended...to make
                        her see...
           Pickman glances back at Walter and then turns to the fire
           again.

                                 WALTER
                              (continuing)
                        Sindy...I loved that
                        woman...truly...I wasn't going to
                        shoot her, you know...I just wanted
                        to scare her...I only intended...

           Abraham chews his bread, his black eyes flickering to Walter
           and then to Pickman.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Do you wish for me to quieten him?

           Pickman's face flushes angrily.  He looks at Abraham.

                                 PICKMAN
                        We've already done enough to him. 
                        Let him ramble.  There ain't no
                        Indians out here.

                                 WALTER
                        Billy Lee is going to shoot you...he
                        will shoot you fine, fine gentlemen
                        dead.  And then I will go back to
                        Rattleborge and marry Sindy.

           Pickman stares into the fire, filled with self-loathing
           and doubt.  He looks down at his folded hands.  He watches
           the firelight play like sunlit waves upon his golden wedding
           band.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (shaking his head)
                        Oh kitten...

           Abraham extricates some small bones from a dried fish with
           a scalpel.  He flings the bones into the fire and then
           offers one of the filets to Pickman.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Thank you, but I can't eat right
                        now.

           EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DAWN

           The horses carry their burdens and passengers towards the
           rising sun.  Pickman and Abraham wear the brims of their
           hats low, hiding their eyes from the screaming morning
           light.

           Walter stares blankly at the clouds above.

                                 WALTER
                        My toes are cold.
           EXT. GRASSY HILLS - LATE MORNING

           Pickman and Abraham eye the huddled civilization looming
           on the horizon beyond the hills they ride in.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That's Quarterstone.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Perhaps we should enter the town
                        at night?

           Pickman shakes his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Anyone rides into Quarterstone at
                        night must go before the Sheriff
                        Dreighton or one of his men.  During
                        the day, things're more relaxed.

           Abraham glances at and points to Walter on the back of
           Pickman's horse.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Yeah...we'd better gag and conceal
                        him before we get any closer.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF QUARTERSTONE - AFTERNOON

           Pickman and Abraham ride their horses towards the town.

           Walter has been covered by a poncho, excepting his face
           which has been covered completely over with a small bale
           of hay.

           It is impossible to tell that a person lies fastened to
           the back of Pickman's horse.

           The riders come upon the town sign.  It reads:
           'Quarterstone, Population 2842.'

           EXT.  QUARTERSTONE CENTRAL AVENUE - LATE DAY

           The storefronts on the central avenue are far more weathered
           than those in Rattleborge.  The colors on the barber's
           pole are faded, the signs for 'Hanson's Creamery' and
           'Chandler Shoppe' are sun-warped, and new wood intermingles
           with old in many decaying facades.  The people walk with
           tight faces and purposeful gaits.

           Pickman and Abraham ride their horses, directly behind a
           loudly CHUGGING and tremulous open car.

           EXT. DENNIS AND DORIS' SALOON - MOMENTS LATER

           Abraham stands beside the two rail-tethered horses, watching
           the passersby.

           An aristocratic YOUNG WOMAN walks by the horses and SNIFFS.
           She looks at the bundle of cloth and hay that hides Walter
           and then shakes her head derisively while flaring her
           nostrils.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Wash those horses.

           Abraham's eyes do not move beneath the heavy shadow of his
           black hat.  She looks away and walks on, nose upturned.

           INT. DENNIS AND DORIS' SALOON - SAME

           The saloon is a wide wood-paneled space with a piano, a
           bar on either wall, four electric candelabra and thirty
           tables, half of which are occupied despite the early hour. 
           DENNIS, a tall bald man of fifty stands behind the bar,
           threading pimentos into recently pitted olives.  Beside
           him stands DORIS, a short amicable looking woman, slicing
           a lemon into nearly transparent circles with a sharp paring
           knife.

           Pickman walks over to the bar.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Good day to you folks.

           Dennis successfully completes his coital endeavor and,
           resting the filled olive in a small wooden bowl with its
           peers, looks up at Pickman.

                                 DENNIS
                              (a light Irish brogue)
                        And a good day to you to.  New to
                        town are you?

                                 PICKMAN
                        I am, and unfortunately I am here
                        deliverin' some bad tidings.

           There has been a death in the Higginsford family.

           Doris looks up from her lemon.

                                 DORIS
                        We don't know the Higginsfords too
                        well.  They're a bit...uppity.

           Billy Lee Higginsford only came in here once and he left
           almost immediately complainin' 'bout how we shouldn't be
           servin' red wine with ice.

                                 DENNIS
                              (nodding)
                        Uppity fella, he is.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Do you know where he and his family
                        live?
                                 DENNIS
                        No, but you can talk to Deputy
                        Ricksby, he'll likely know.
                              (pointing over
                               Pickman's shoulder)
                        Sittin' right there, he is.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Thank you.

           Pickman does not want to arouse suspicion by avoiding the
           Deputy, so he smiles and turns around.

           He approaches DEPUTY RICKSBY, a pudgy man with very curly
           hair and small reddish eyes.  The deputy is carving into
           the rough wooden table with a long, slender 'pig-sticker'
           knife.

           Pickman weaves through the table towards the inebriated
           deputy.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Deputy Ricksby.

                                 RICKSBY
                        Just Ricksby.  I'm off duty.

           The Deputy does not look up from the table into which he
           has carved 'Jessica is a w' with a pocket knife.  He is
           currently making the lowercase 'w' into a bolder capital
           'W'. 

           Ricksby looks up from his carving into Pickman's bright
           blue eyes.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing)
                        It's gonna say 'Jessica is a WHORE'
                        when I'm finished.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Kinda figured that.

                                 RICKSBY
                        She walked out on me, with some
                        twig of a fella with straight hair.

           Ricksby looks back down at the table.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing)
                        What do you want?

                                 PICKMAN
                        I have the unfortunate
                        responsibility of bearin' some
                        mighty bad news to the Higginsford
                        family.  Do you know where they
                        live?
           Ricksby starts carving the letter 'H' into the table.

                                 RICKSBY
                        They live up on Silver Hill, a
                        ways in on Valerie Drive.

           Pickman blanches at the utterance of his wife's name.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (tipping his hat)
                        Thank you for your help.

           Pickman turns away from the besotted deputy and walks
           towards the saloon's front doors.

           EXT. SILVER HILL - TWILIGHT

           The grass in the suburban area is pale and reflects the
           twilight sun in an opalescent manner.  The houses, each
           set upon a four acre lot, are pine green or light brown. 
           Several of the wide two-storey houses have open-roofed
           cars parked in their curvilinear driveways.  Pickman and
           Abraham ride up the slender road that cuts across the eerily
           luminous grass.

           Pickman looks at the mailbox on the left.  The name hanging
           from the horizontal post is Halleford.  Abraham looks at
           the mailbox on the right.  The name hanging from the
           horizontal post is Jacobs.

           The dusty horses and dusty men continue up Valerie Drive.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (quietly)
                        Do you think the trio will still
                        be together?

                                 PICKMAN
                              (quietly)
                        Don't know.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (quietly)
                        If they have disbanded, we must
                        not kill Billy Lee until we learn
                        the whereabouts of his accomplices--
                        the rapist and the fat one.

           Pickman nods in agreement.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing; quietly)
                        It will be simple to extract any
                        information we need from him with
                        my drugs and tools.

           Pickman shudders at the slight hint of pleasure he hears
           in Abraham's voice, but says nothing.

           Pickman looks at the mailbox on the left.  The name hanging
           from the horizontal post is Edmond.
           Abraham looks at the mailbox on the right.  The name hanging
           from the horizontal post is O'Hare.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I meant what I said about his wife
                        and kids.  I will not abide violence
                        being done to them.

           Abraham does not respond.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I mean it.

           Abraham looks over at Pickman.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        If there is a point at which you
                        can no longer stomach what must be
                        done, you are free to return to
                        Rattleborge.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I ain't gonna debate this with
                        you.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You are correct-- there is no point
                        in debate.  If you need to stop me
                        from doing something, stop me. 
                        Otherwise, save your threats for a
                        truant child or the town drunk.

                                 PICKMAN
                        No threats, Abraham.  You hurt
                        them, I'll hurt you worse.

           Pickman's blue eyes smolder within his creased, sun-
           weathered face.  Abraham stares back at him for a long,
           breathless moment.

           Both men look away, towards the mailboxes of the upcoming
           houses.  Pickman looks at the mailbox on the left.  The
           name hanging from the horizontal post is Yardman.  Abraham
           looks at the mailbox on the right.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        This is the house.

           Pickman looks to the right.

           The name hanging from the horizontal post is Higginsford.

           Pickman looks at the house: it is a two-storey building
           painted pine green and is surrounded by a cream-colored
           picket fence.

           Pickman looks at Abraham.

           Abraham climbs off of his horse.  Pickman climbs off of
           his horse.
           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           The two men lead their horses, past the open picket fence,
           up the driveway.  The horses' hooves impact the pebbles in
           a tattoo of CRUNCHES.  From deep within the house comes a
           child's voice.

                                 BOY (O.S.)
                        Mother.  Mother.  Two men are coming
                        up the drive.  They have big horses
                        and guns!

           Pickman looks at Abraham, but the doctor does not return
           his gaze.

           The front doors, shaped in the French style, open inwards.

           BECKY HIGGINSFORD stands in the doorway, her rose-colored
           gown luminous in the setting sun.  She is a tall woman in
           her late twenties with a pleasant smile, a narrow nose, a
           high forehead, curly auburn hair and kind eyes.

           Pickman and Abraham remove their hats.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Good evenin'.  Are you Becky
                        Higginsford?

                                 BECKY
                              (heavy French accent)
                        I am.

           A look of concern wrinkles her high forehead.  THOMAS, a
           boy with curly blond hair, pokes his head in between the
           doorframe and Becky's skirt.

                                 BECKY
                              (continuing)
                        Has something happened to my Billy
                        Lee?

                                 PICKMAN
                        He's not in then?

                                 BECKY
                        No.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I'm afraid that I have some bad
                        news to relate...I'd prefer to
                        speak to him on the matter.

           Becky looks down at her inquisitive child.

                                 BECKY
                        Thomas, go to your room and take
                        your brother and sister.

           Thomas nods and retreats behind his mother's skirt, which
           hides the boy as if it were a closing curtain.
           Pickman and Abraham walk up to the patio.

                                 BECKY
                              (continuing)
                        What is this bad news you bring?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Perhaps I should wait until Mister
                        Higginsford arrives.

                                 BECKY
                        Please tell me.

                                 PICKMAN
                        It's about Mister Higginsford's
                        brother, Walter Lee.

           Becky eyes open wide with concern; in an instant they brim
           with tears.  Pickman walks onto the porch; Abraham takes
           the reins for both horses.

                                 BECKY
                        Is he...unwell?

           Becky wipes the nascent tears from her eyes.

                                 PICKMAN
                        He has passed on, I'm afraid.

           Becky shakes her head, shocked and speechless.  She steps
           forward and hugs Pickman, pressing her flushed face into
           his dusty brown jacket.

           Pickman raises his hand to pat her shoulder, but then
           decides against the consolatory gesture.

           Abraham looks at the facade of the house, counting the
           windows and memorizing specifics.

           Becky withdraws from Pickman.

                                 BECKY
                        Billy Lee will be heartbroken...he
                        has always been close with his
                        brother-- they are fraternal twins.

           Becky wipes her eyes clear and looks up at Pickman.

                                 BECKY
                              (continuing)
                        Who are you men?

                                 PICKMAN
                        I am Theodore, a friend of Walter's.

           Becky's eyes flicker to Abraham.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        The man with me is a banker.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PICKMAN (CONT'D)
                        Unfortunately, Walter Lee
                        Higginsford died owing a sizable
                        sum to the bank.

           Becky looks distastefully at Abraham.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Might you know when William Lee
                        Higginsford will return?

           Becky shakes her head.

                                 BECKY
                        He was supposed to have returned
                        yesterday, but sometimes his
                        business has complications and
                        keeps him away longer.  You are
                        welcome to stay here and await his
                        arrival-- dinner is almost ready.

           She eyes Abraham.

                                 BECKY
                              (continuing)
                        Should I...

           Pickman shakes his head 'no'.

                                 PICKMAN
                        He has other business to attend to-
                        including cleaning up those horses-
                        and already has a room reserved at
                        Hotel Mayweather.

           Abraham nods, affirming Pickman's words.

           Becky looks relieved.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (hiding his accent)
                        I will return tomorrow afternoon
                        to see if Master Higginsford has
                        returned.

           Abraham leads the horses back up the pebble driveway.

           Pickman climbs the porch stairs and enters the house.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Pickman, washed and wearing borrowed clothing, sits at the
           dinner table with Becky, Thomas, CLARENCE (a blond-haired
           boy of six) and REGINA (a miniature of her mother, aged
           nine).

           Pickman, Becky and the childrens' eyes are shut; their
           foreheads pressed to their folded hands.
                                 BECKY
                        And please welcome Wally Lee into
                        your arms in heaven, Holy Father.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Amen.

                                 CHILDREN
                              (in unison)
                        Amen.

           EXT. COPSE BESIDE THE HIGGINSFORD PROPERTY - SAME

           Abraham has tied the horses to a thick birch tree inside
           the dense copse.  Walter has been fastened to a separate
           tree, a cord wrapped around his neck and torso.  The legless
           man is gagged and blindfolded.  Walter's urine has stained
           the bark of the tree trunk between his legs.

           Abraham currently watches the Higginsford house with a
           small, handheld telescope.

           He sets the telescope down for a moment and kneels to the
           ground.  He pokes his finger into the dirt, eliciting a
           small SQUEAK from some subterranean animal.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - LATER

           Pickman, wearing a gray bed robe over his undergarments,
           sits upright at the edge of a wide, soft spring mattress. 
           The room has a bookshelf, a small electric table lamp and
           its own private bathroom.

           There is a KNOCK on the closed door.

           Pickman slides his right hand beneath his pillow.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Yes?

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        May I speak with you for a moment?

           Pickman relaxes, but keeps his hand beneath the pillow.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Come right in Mrs. Higginsford.

           The door opens slowly, quietly.

           Becky, wearing a silken camisole draped with a diaphanous
           robe, enters the room.  She shuts the door gently behind
           her.

                                 BECKY
                        Becky, please.  Is there anything
                        else you need?

           Pickman eyes the woman warily.
                                 PICKMAN
                        I'm fine, thank you.

           Becky's face is flush.  She looks at the ring upon Pickman's
           left hand.

                                 BECKY
                        How long have you been married?

                                 PICKMAN
                        Fifteen years come this August.

           Becky nods her head.

           There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        How long have you and William Lee
                        been together?

                                 BECKY
                        Ten years.  But he is away so
                        often...ever since he started having
                        his problem, not long after Clarence
                        was born...

           Becky looks down at her feet, which are bare: her toenails
           are painted red.

           Pickman does not wish to hear any more.

                                 PICKMAN
                        That's too bad.  Maybe he should
                        see a doctor.

           Becky, not looking up from the ground, shrugs.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        I'm pretty beat Mrs. Higginsford--
                        I'd better turn in.

                                 BECKY
                              (nodding)
                        Oui.  Good night.

           She briefly glances at the pillow, beneath which Pickman's
           right hand is thrust, and turns away.  She opens the door,
           passes through and shuts it behind her, stealthy as a
           thieving cat.

           Pickman slides his right hand out from beneath his pillow,
           walks over to the door and locks it.

           EXT. SILVER HILL - DAWN

           The pale grass shines like white fire with the bright clear
           light of the climbing sun.
           Billy Lee, Rodney and Jordan ride up Valerie Drive, each
           man is atop a weary, dusty horse.  Their saddlebags are
           indecently bloated.

           Billy Lee wears his gray suit and gray hat; his chest is
           bandaged from his confrontation with Abraham.  Rodney wears
           his drooping-rim blue hat and his yellow kerchief around
           his neck.  Jordan still wears his black poncho, the hood
           drawn close to his face.

                                 RODNEY
                              (to Billy Lee)
                        Lookin' forward to some screwin'
                        with the little woman?

           Billy Lee looks distastefully at Rodney.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        Perhaps you should not speak every
                        thought that comes to your mind...or
                        perhaps you should simply refrain
                        from speaking altogether.

                                 RODNEY
                        I'm going to the whorehouse as
                        soon as I'm cleaned up.
                              (to Jordan)
                        Wanna come with me?

           Jordan's scarred, shadowy visage turns to Rodney for a
           moment.

                                 JORDAN
                        Whores do not interest me.

                                 RODNEY
                        I love 'em, with that perfume they
                        spray on their neck and under their
                        arms-- smellin' like some far off
                        exotic land.  And that soft, red,
                        silky, shiny stuff they wear-- if
                        you dress a dog up in one of them
                        gowns, I'd wager he'd get hisself
                        humped to death...and not just by
                        dogs.

           Rodney LAUGHS.

           Billy Lee and Jordan ignore him.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           The three riders canter their steeds up to the pebble
           driveway of the Higginsford house.

                                 BILLY LEE
                        You gentleman wait here.

                                 JORDAN
                        I shall.
                                 RODNEY
                        Don't take too long.

           Billy Lee climbs off of his horse.  He looks at his house
           for a moment.  He stretches his arms up over his head and
           YAWNS.

           Billy Lee leads his heavy horse up the pebble driveway,
           its hooves CRUNCH upon the white, brown, and beige pebbles,
           some of which burst into fine powder.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Pickman, a napkin tucked into his borrowed gray linen shirt,
           dips a corner of his toast into a steaming cup of coffee.

           Opposite him sits Becky.  From outside comes a faint
           CRUNCHING sound.

           Becky turns to glance at the window.

           EXT. COPSE BESIDE THE HIGGINSFORD PROPERTY - SAME

           Abraham finishes injecting morphine into Walter's left
           stump.

           He places the steel-wired glass syringe back inside the
           slender leather case.

           Abraham picks up the telescope from where it rests, nestled
           in between two branches.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           Rodney and Jordan sit atop their horses.

                                 RODNEY
                              (whispered)
                        He's got a problem with his pecker,
                        you know.  I heard him one night
                        he was talkin' in his sleep
                        apologizing to his wife for not
                        bein' able to do the job.

           Jordan ignores Rodney.

           Further up the drive, Billy Lee walks his horse towards
           the front porch.  His eyes look to the upstairs windows. 
           In the uppermost window, his son Thomas waves excitedly.

           INT. THE BOYS' ROOM - SAME

           The room is wallpapered with a pattern of snakes and
           lizards.

           Thomas runs over from the window and shakes Clarence awake.

                                 THOMAS
                        Father's home!  Father's home!
           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Becky walks over to the window.

                                 BECKY
                        My husband is here.

           Pickman lunges out of his chair and races out of the room,
           knocking a vase over as he beelines.

           EXT. COPSE BESIDE THE HIGGINSFORD PROPERTY - SAME

           Abraham tosses the telescope to the ground.  He runs towards
           the edge of the copse.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           Billy Lee walks his horse up to the house.  He looks away
           from the upstairs room.  The pebbles CRUNCH beneath his
           boots and the horse's hooves.

           Billy Lee's greenish-blue eyes swivel to the window on the
           first storey.  His wife stands in the window, calling after
           someone within the house.

           INT. STAIRS - SAME

           Thomas and Clarence careen down the stairs, towards front
           door, a tumble of limbs and excited CHEERS.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - SAME

           Pickman runs into the room; he flings the pillows from the
           bed.

           His guns are gone.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Becky slides the window open.

                                 BECKY
                        Billy Lee!

           EXT. COPSE BESIDE THE HIGGINSFORD PROPERTY - SAME

           Abraham emerges from the copse.  He draws his pistols.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

                                 RODNEY
                        Ever done an Oriental one?

           Jordan, ignoring Rodney, stares at the Higginsford house.

                                 JORDAN
                        Something is wrong.

           The twin barrels of a shotgun emerge from beneath Jordan's
           poncho.
           INT. FRONT HALL - SAME

           The boys run to the front door.  Thomas grabs the whorl-
           shaped handle to the left door and twists it.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           The doors swings open.

           Thomas and Clarence run out of the house towards their
           father.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Father!

                                 THOMAS
                        Father!

           Pickman, barehanded, comes running out behind them.

           Billy Lee looks up from his children to the weathered fifty-
           six year old man running behind them, carrying a pool stick
           in his right hand.  With a serpentine gesture Billy Lee
           withdraws the pistol on his right hip.

           At the same time Abraham, emerging from the copse, trains
           his Steisselbach pistol on Billy Lee.

           BANG.

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Becky SCREAMS.

           EXT. HIGGINSFORD HOUSE - SAME

           Billy Lee's right hand dangles tenuously from his wrist,
           exposing the white bone, yellow tissue and pink ligament
           within.  Blood fills the wound.

           Thomas and Clarence SHRIEK.

           Pickman passes the terrified children and CRACKS Billy Lee
           across the left cheek with the fat end of the pool stick.

           Billy Lee's left eye pools with purplish red fluid.  Pickman
           swings the pool stick around for another blow, but Billy
           Lee lunges forward at him; they SLAM together and fall to
           the ground.

                                 JORDAN
                              (to Rodney)
                        We've been ambushed.

           Jordan SNAPS the reins of his horse and turns the animal
           away from the Higginsford property.

                                 RODNEY
                              (to Jordan)
                        We gotta help him!
           Jordan digs his spurs into the sides of his horse; the
           horse NEIGHS loudly and whirls for a moment.

           Abraham, thirty feet away at the front of the house, points
           his Steisselbach at the head of Jordan's horse.

           BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  BANG.

           The horse's head comes apart in thick gory gobs.  The horse
           collapses forward and then on its side, with Jordan still
           mounted.

           Rodney turns his own horse away, SNAPS his reins and digs
           his spurs in.

           Becky runs out of the house, SCREAMING, SCREAMING,
           SCREAMING.

           She is holding one of Pickman's pistols in her two upraised
           hands.

           Pickman shoves Billy Lee down and then rams his elbow into
           Billy Lee's jaw.  CRACK.  He rams his elbow into Billy
           Lee's jaw a second time: Billy Lee's jaw buckles inward
           with a horrible CRUNCH.

           Billy Lee withdraws his remaining gun with his left hand.

           Pickman clamps his hand onto Billy Lee's revolver, clutching
           the hammer forward so that it cannot retract to fire.

           Pickman stares into Billy Lee's eyes.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You killed my-

           Billy Lee twists the gun abruptly and squeezes the trigger.

           BANG.  Pickman GRUNTS as he takes a shot in the stomach.

           Rodney rides his horse away from the fray.  Abraham points
           his Steisselbach at Rodney's neck.  BANG.  Rodney's throat
           stretches and bursts, spitting a crimson streak into the
           blue morning sky.

           Abraham runs towards Jordan; the rapist's left leg and
           poncho are pinned beneath his dead horse.  While running,
           Abraham holsters his emptied pistol and withdraws his other.

           Jordan crawls out from beneath the dead horse.  Abraham
           points his Steisselbach at Jordan's left knee.  BANG. 
           Jordan HISSES and drops face first onto the road.

           Pickman squeezes his bullet-pierced stomach as he kicks
           Billy Lee's hand, sending the gun off into the grass. 
           Pickman kicks Billy Lee in the head.  THUD.  He kicks him
           again.

           THUD.  Billy Lee's eyes close as he loses consciousness.
           Pickman kicks him again.  CRACK.  The left side of Billy
           Lee's head caves in and blood squirts from his right ear.

           Holding Pickman's pistol with her two trembling hands,
           Becky SCREAMS and squeezes the trigger.

           BANG.

           Pickman CRIES OUT as he is blown forward by the impact of
           the bullet in his back.  He lands face first in the grass. 
           He twists his head.

           Becky is standing over him, YELLING at him in French.  She
           points the gun at him, her face a mask of fury covered
           with a sheen of tears.

           Pickman turns away from her.  He COUGHS and blood comes to
           his lips.  He presses his face into the opalescent grass
           in final resignation.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing;
                               muttering)
                        Val...

           A shadow falls over Pickman, turning the opalescent grass
           black.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Mrs. Higginsford.  Put down that
                        gun or I will shoot you dead where
                        you stand, right in front of your
                        children.

           Becky YELLS at the children in French; they run inside,
           SOBBING continuously.

           Pickman lifts his head up from the grass, trailing threads
           of pink saliva and blood; he looks up at Abraham.

           Abraham has his Steisselbach aimed at Becky.

           Pickman shakes his head in horror; he struggles to his
           knees.

                                 PICKMAN
                        No, no...Abraham, no...no...

           Abraham levels his gun at Becky's head.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (to Becky)
                        Drop the gun or I will kill you.

                                 BECKY
                        You murderers, you murderers!  How
                        dare-

           BANG.  Becky falls back, her forehead caved in by the bullet
           that impacted in its center.
           From inside the house, the children SHRIEK.

           Pickman's face goes scarlet with rage.  He struggles to
           his feet and lunges for Abraham.

           Abraham steps out of the way of Pickman's clumsy, pained
           attack.

           Pickman's THUDS back down, onto the glowing grass; his
           scarlet face deepens to an almost violet hue.

                                 ABRAHAM
                        Should I have let her shoot you
                        again?  Or possibly me?

           Pickman COUGHS his answer, a crimson splatter upon the
           opalescent grass.

                                 PICKMAN
                        You bastard...you evil, evil-

                                 ABRAHAM
                        You should know by now that there
                        is no good nor evil-- only animals
                        with desires.

           Abraham, holsters his pistol, turns away from Pickman and
           walks towards the road.

                                 ABRAHAM
                              (continuing)
                        The most satisfied animals are the
                        ones who do not deny the things
                        that they crave.

           Pickman struggles to his knees again, but collapses forward,
           GRUNTING deeply as the pain wrenches him.

           He watches Abraham stand over Jordan who tries to crawl,
           regardless of his blown-out kneecap and broken leg.

           Abraham raises his left hand in the air.  The sun catches
           upon a piece of metal he holds aloft. He runs the metal
           along Jordan's poncho.

           The black poncho drops to the road, revealing a pale,
           scarified and bruised man, covered with rashes and sores.

           Pickman watches Abraham withdraw a gleaming metal hook.

           Abraham pierces Jordan's quivering belly with the hook. 
           Once through the skin- in then out- Abraham yanks the hook,
           pulling up the flesh it has snagged.

           By the hook embedded in Jordan's pale, sore-speckled belly,
           Abraham drags his captive towards the copse.

           Pickman exhales, his breath sounds like a TIDAL WAVE
           crashing upon the shore.

           Abraham drags Jordan inside the dark copse.
           Pickman rises to his hands and knees, wobbling like a sick,
           bleeding dog.  He shuffles forward towards Billy Lee's
           pistol.  He COUGHS, spattering pink saliva and tiny crimson
           globules on the white blades of grass.

           Pickman grabs the pistol in his right hand and continues
           to crawl towards the copse.  A low MOAN comes from within
           the cluster of trees.

           Pickman crawls onward.

           INT. COPSE BESIDE THE HIGGINSFORD PROPERTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman enters the copse.  His eyelids flutter as he
           struggles to remain conscious; beads of sweat slide like
           glass slugs down his face.

           A SHRIEK comes from further within the copse, momentarily
           reawakening him.  Pickman COUGHS violently; blood sprays
           from his nostrils.  He crawls further into the copse, the
           chiaroscuro absorbing him like a veil of insects.

           Pickman looks up.  A thicket of bushes lies directly before
           him.  Upon the other side of the brush he sees a dark figure
           moving before a pale one.  Pickman reaches out with his
           left hand and pushes aside the thorny thicket.

           Jordan's nude body hangs upside down in the middle of a
           small clearing, his feet tied together, suspended by a
           rope, his hands bound behind his back.  An emptied syringe
           is lodged in his scrotum.  The two stomach punctures from
           Abraham's hook have been plugged with rocks.  Jordan's
           canker-covered tongue hangs out of his mouth upon a white
           tendril of flesh, like a half-eaten sausage.  A metal tube
           juts from between his ribs, air WHISTLING in and out with
           his shallow breathing.

           Pickman gags and looks away.  Jordan MOANS and writhes in
           horrible agony.

           Pickman draws the hammer back on his pistol and tremulously
           trains it upon Jordan's agony-distended face.  Abraham
           lunges from the shadows and kicks the gun from Pickman's
           hand.

           Pickman reaches for the gun.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (mumbling)
                        You...you goddam...jew bastard...

           Abraham quickly snatches the pistol from the ground and
           flings it into the darkness.  He then kicks Pickman in the
           back of his skull.

           Pickman starts to pass out.

           Abraham reaches beneath his black jacket and removes a
           silver mask.  The features of the mask are molded to
           resemble Abraham's dead wife.
           Pickman's eyes erratically roll back in his head as darkness
           takes him.

           Abraham reaches into a pouch beneath his jacket and
           withdraws a pygmy mole by its little gray tail; the
           bucktoothed creature SQUEAKS.

                                 PICKMAN
                              (continuing)
                        Goddam you...

           Abraham lifts the pygmy mole to the WHISTLING metal tube
           that juts from Jordan's torso.  The bucktoothed marsupial
           disappears into the metal tube, headed towards Jordan's
           left lung.

           All is quiet in the copse for one horrible moment.  Jordan
           then begins to spastically jerk upon the rope which suspends
           him upside down.  He SHRIEKS; the sound he makes is utterly
           alien to humanity-- a sound like steel cutting through
           steel.

           Abraham watches Jordan's suffering from behind the metal
           mask of his dead wife's face.

           Pickman passes out.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE IN:

           INT. QUARTERSTONE JAIL - NIGHT

           Pickman, bandaged, pale and gaunt, lies in the jail cell,
           upon a tattered and stained mattress.  The lone window in
           the cell is small and has rusted bars.

           Pickman GROANS as he swims towards consciousness.  He lifts
           his aching head and grimaces as pain shoots through his
           thickly-bandaged torso.

           Plump, curly-haired Deputy Ricksby sits at the front desk,
           carving into the wood with his oversized pig-sticker knife.

           He looks up at Pickman with baleful eyes, obliquely
           illumined by the kerosene lamp on his scored and denuded
           desk.

                                 RICKSBY
                        You're awake.

           Ricksby stands up and stretches; he flings the pig-sticker
           into the surface of his desk where it PINGS and wiggles
           like the tail of a happy dog.  He walks to the door and
           pokes his head out.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing)
                        Todd.  Get the Sheriff.  He's awake.
                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yes sir.

           Pickman, his lips chapped and his as mouth dry as a sun-
           bleached canyon, rubs the detritus of a long sleep from
           his eyes and lips.  He sits forward slowly, wincing as
           pain spreads like spilled ink throughout his body.  He
           SNIFFS and grimaces at what he smells.

           Ricksby turn around and faces Pickman.

                                 RICKSBY
                        That was pretty deceptive, what
                        you done.  Askin' me about the
                        Higginsfords and all.  That was
                        pretty low.

           Ricksby plucks his knife from the table, the long blade
           PINGING as it vibrates in the air.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Got any water?

                                 RICKSBY
                        I got a bladder full o' the stuff
                        if you want some.

           The door at the front of the room opens.  Filling the
           doorway stands SHERIFF DREIGHTON, a broad, huge mountain
           of a man with thick white hair and a bushy white mustache. 
           His eyes look like two small black peppercorns; his left
           hand is shy two fingers.  A stuffed bear's claw hangs on a
           leather twine around his neck.

           Sheriff Dreighton briefly glances at Pickman and then racks
           his rifle on the wall.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing; to
                               Dreighton)
                        He's awake.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        I can see that.

           Dreighton walks towards Pickman, each step a cruel CREAKING
           punishment to the worn floorboards beneath him.

           Pickman stares at Dreighton.  Dreighton spits into Pickman's
           cell, the expectoration landing with a SPLAT.

                                 DREIGHTON
                              (continuing)
                        A mother and a father are dead--
                        murdered right in front of their
                        own kids.  Another two were found
                        dead in the woods-- their bodies
                        mutilated worse than any Canhougache
                        could manage.  How dare you a lawman
                        bring such reckless violence to
                        Quarterstone?
                                 PICKMAN
                        Had your wife been raped and killed,
                        you woulda done the same.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        You're wrong Pickman.  I'd not
                        conspire with some evil torturer
                        and allow an innocent woman to be
                        killed before her children no matter
                        what her husband done.  I got kids--
                        ain't nothin' more precious than
                        their little souls.  You've a
                        daughter, don't you?

                                 PICKMAN
                        She died.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        And so will you for the foul things
                        you done here.

           Dreighton spits again into Pickman's cell.  SPLAT.  He
           turns away and walks towards the door, the floorboards
           protesting the massive man's weight with plaintive CREAKS. 
           He reclaims his repeater rifle from the rack.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Are the children alright?

           Dreighton pauses but does not turn back to face Pickman. 
           His peppercorn-like eyes almost disappear entirely within
           his wrathful face.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        The children ain't alright.  The
                        girl has got the shocks and may
                        not recover.  She don't eat anythin'
                        unless its poured down her throat.

           Pickman looks at the ground, shaking his head remorsefully.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Let me out of here, so I can get
                        the fella that killed Mrs. 
                        Higginsford and bring him to
                        justice.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        You've confused justice and revenge--
                        that's why you're gonna hang.

           Pickman withdraws the envelope that contains his bonus--
           it is worn and stained brown, but still intact.

                                 PICKMAN
                        If I could...I'd like to give my
                        money to whoever is raising those
                        kids.

           Dreighton stares at the floor.  For a long silent moment,
           he is as still as the mountain he resembles.
                                 DREIGHTON
                        I better leave this place right
                        now or I am liable to beat you to
                        death for that remark.

           Dreighton walks through the door, SLAMMING it behind him.

           Ricksby walks over to the cell and runs his pig-sticker
           across the bars: CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.

                                 RICKSBY
                        Now that you're awake they gonna
                        try you and string you up quick as
                        a gnat's fart.  Your deputies can't
                        save you neither.

           Pickman looks up at Ricksby at the mention of the deputies.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing)
                        They tried takin' custody of you
                        while you was unconscious, but
                        Sheriff Dreighton sent them
                        scuttlin' back to that fancy town
                        o' yours.

           Ricksby grins at the memory.

                                 RICKSBY
                              (continuing)
                        Big words and lawyer talk ain't
                        gonna oil your neck out of the
                        noose, no sir.  You gonna choke
                        until you're purple and dead.

           Ricksby nods in affirmation of himself, turns away and
           walks back to his desk.

           INT. QUARTERSTONE JAIL - MIDNIGHT

           Pickman lies in his bed, staring up at the ceiling.  He
           hears a whispered VOICE from outside.

           Something CLANGS against the bars and CLATTERS to the floor
           of the cell.  Pickman sits up, each and every injury
           screaming for him to remain prostrate.

           Deputy Ricksby, asleep at his desk, stirs.

                                 RICKSBY
                        What's that racket about?

           Pickman looks on the floor; he sees a pistol.

           The front door to the prison opens.  Deputy Cooperson and
           Deputy Bartley storm in, guns raised.

           Ricksby scrambles for the gun rack, but Cooperson
           intervenes, proffering the two barrels of his blue-enameled,
           ivory-handled pistols.
                                 COOPERSON
                        We are taking Sheriff Pickman.

           Ricksby shakes his head in defiance.

                                 RICKSBY
                        You ain't gonna shoot me.

           Cooperson WHACKS him across the mouth with the butt of his
           pistol.  Bartley rushes behind Ricksby and pulls a gag
           over his mouth; he then SNAPS handcuffs over Ricksby's
           wrists.

           Cooperson looks at Pickman.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Let's get you back home to
                        Rattleborge.

           EXT. QUARTERSTONE CENTRAL AVENUE - ONE IN THE MORNING

           Pickman, supported by Cooperson and Bartley, struggles to
           remain upright.

           The storefronts are dark and the slender greenish-blue
           moon yields very little light.  The trio shuffles forward.

           Pickman is in tremendous pain, but suppresses all of the
           whines and groans that would escape a weaker man.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (whispered)
                        We hobbled some horses just beyond
                        the town perimeter.

           CLICK-CLACK.

           Pickman, Cooperson and Bartley turn around.

           Sheriff Dreighton stands behind them, flanked by Deputy
           Ricksby and DEPUTY TODD, a young hawk-nosed man.  All three
           men hold repeater rifles.

                                 DREIGHTON
                        I don't want to leave Rattleborge
                        without no lawmen.  Leave Pickman
                        and I'll forget you two boys pulled
                        this dumb stunt.

           A jackal scampers across the street.  Cooperson flinches.

           Bartley flinches.  Deputy Todd flinches.  Deputy Ricksby
           flinches.  Pickman and Sheriff Dreighton do not flinch.

           The mountainous lawman stares at Cooperson with his small
           black peppercorn eyes.

                                 DREIGHTON
                              (continuing)
                        Set him down and walk away.
                                 PICKMAN
                              (to Cooperson)
                        Do it, Matthew.  Nobody else needs
                        to die.

                                 COOPERSON
                        No, Roger.
                              (to Dreighton)
                        I will not let you lynch Pickman. 
                        He is a hero in Rattleborge and
                        that town is in desperate need of
                        some hope right about now.  If you
                        kill him, you'll take that glimmer
                        away...

                                 DREIGHTON
                        I ain't arguin' with you college
                        boy.  Put him down-- he'll have a
                        trial for what he done.

                                 COOPERSON
                        An eye for an eye was all he was
                        after.  I stand by the Lord's words.

           BLAM.  Cooperson's right shoulder opens up in a burst of
           crimson.  With his left hand he draws his pistol and fires
           back at Dreighton.  BANG.  Dreighton's right arm whips
           back; his rifle flies into the air like a frightened bird.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        Stop this before-

           Ricksby aims and fires.  BLAM.  Bartley takes a bullet in
           his neck and falls backward, air whistling through his
           rent windpipe.  Cooperson's eyes widen as he watches Bartley
           collapse.

           Pickman raises his gun.  BANG.  Ricksby takes a bullet in
           the stomach; he curls forward like a kitten around a ball
           of string.

           Cooperson and Todd aim at each other and fire
           simultaneously.

           BANG.  BLAM.  Todd's face caves in at his mouth, his jaw
           and teeth and gums crumbling inwards like stained glass.

           Cooperson catches a second bullet in the chest.

           Dreighton, disregarding his bleeding right arm, snags
           Ricksby's rifle with his left, three-fingered hand.  He
           points it at Cooperson.

           BANG.  BANG.  BANG.  Dreighton stumbles backward as
           Pickman's shots pound into his massive torso.  Dreighton's
           small dark eyes glint with the greenish-blue light of the
           moon for a brief moment; he falls backward, SLAMMING onto
           the dusty road.
           Cooperson and Pickman look around; town residents hesitantly
           walk into the street.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who got shot?

           Cooperson and Pickman hobble towards an alleyway as the
           avenue fills with curious, confused PEOPLE.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - SAME

           Cooperson and Pickman stumble into the alleyway.  They
           totter beside a giant wooden garbage box filled with the
           rotting offal of a butcher's shop-- the flesh is speckled
           with buzzing flies.  From the avenue nearby come SHOUTS
           and YELLS.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        The Sheriff's been kilt!  The
                        Deputies is wounded.

           Pickman sits beside Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                        How did we get on this side of the
                        law?

           Cooperson reaches beneath his jacket and pulls out his
           bible; he COUGHS, spattering the book with blood.  He starts
           to wheeze.

                                 COOPERSON
                        My left lung is collapsing.

           Cooperson leans back against the hamper filled with rotting
           meat.  Pickman shakes his head.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What can I do?

                                 COOPERSON
                        Hear my final confession...
                              (gasp)
                        ...and take it to a priest for me.

           Pickman nods, his eyes blurred with tears.

                                 COOPERSON
                              (continuing)
                        When I was in Boston I did
                        something...something terrible to
                        a little girl named Mary LaPreggia.

           Pickman sad eyes harden.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What did you do?

           Cooperson starts to cry.  His shoulders shake as tears run
           down his face.
                                 COOPERSON
                        I'm so so sorry...I couldn't help
                        myself...that's why...that's why I
                        got away and moved out here.  I
                        needed to see the northern lights.

           Pickman looks coldly upon Cooperson.

                                 PICKMAN
                        What did you do to her?

           Cooperson COUGHS up blood; he shakes his head weakly back
           and forth denying his words...his past...

                                 COOPERSON
                        I took her.  I took her and I used
                        her.

           Pickman's hands squeezes the handle of his revolver; he
           trembles as rage surges through him.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Twice when I went with Val to
                        Colorado, I let you look after my
                        little girl.  I left her in your
                        care.

           Cooperson violently shakes his head back and forth.

                                 COOPERSON
                        No Roger, I never transgressed
                        again...not since Boston.  I've
                        given my life over to the Lord as
                        penance, to try and make things
                        right.

           Pickman grits his teeth; the sinews in his forearms tighten;
           his fingers squeeze his pistol handle; his eyes turn into
           small black coals.

                                 PICKMAN
                        But you looked at her...with those
                        eyes.  And you had those thoughts.

           And with Jess Walker's girl too.

           Cooperson nods his head.

                                 COOPERSON
                        I did.

                                 PICKMAN
                        Goddam you Matthew.  Goddam you
                        for telling me this.

           EXT. QUARTERSTONE CENTRAL AVENUE - SAME

           People are huddled around the bodies of Sheriff Dreighton
           and Deputy Todd.  Deputy Ricksby, still alive, is being
           carried away by a group of four men.
           BANG.  BANG.  BANG.

           People in the street scatter in all directions.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - SAME

           Pickman stands up.  Three bulletholes smoke in the wooden
           box of rotting meat, just beside Cooperson's head.

           Cooperson, shivering and sweating, looks up at Pickman.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Please take my confession to a
                        priest...I've tried my whole life
                        to-

                                 PICKMAN
                        Nope.  I ain't gonna repeat what
                        you said, nor am I gonna kill you.
                        I'm gonna leave you in your Lord's
                        hands...if He'll still touch you.

           Pickman staggers out of the alleyway.

                                 COOPERSON
                        Are you going to after Abraham?

           Pickman looks back at Cooperson, bleeding, shivering,
           pitiful against the hamper of rotten meat.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I'm done up with revenge, Cooperson.

           Pickman staggers out of the alley.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE IN:

           EXT. TWENTY PACES OUT OF TOWN - AFTERNOON

           The sign for Rattleborge has been repainted.

           "You are now entering Rattleborge: Location of the Rainy
           Night Massacre.  Population: 1581"

           Pickman rides his horse up to the sign; he and his mount
           are completely covered in sand and dust.  Pickman looks as
           if he has been scorched and aged by his long ride in the
           open sun.

           EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pickman rides his horse up the street.  He looks at the
           familiar storefronts, many of which are still dark.

           He rides past Hotel Ruddington, Ermine's Barbershop,
           Cattlebrush's and McDonelly's Fine Jewels and Things.

           A few people wave at him, but he just stares back at them,
           as if he has no idea what their gestures mean.
           EXT. RATTLEBORGE GRAVEYARD - TWILIGHT

           Pickman stands before two simple gravestones, upon which
           are chiselled the names Emily Lisa Pickman and Valerie
           Meredith Pickman.

           Mayor Hogan, wearing a fine blue suit with white pinstripes,
           climbs out of his flatulent car and walks up the hill
           towards Pickman.

                                 HOGAN
                        I'm supposin' you know that there's
                        a bounty on your head over what
                        happened back in Quarterstone.

           Pickman nods.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        Most people here think you're a
                        hero for killin' those men.

                                 PICKMAN
                        And you?

                                 HOGAN
                        I think you left this town when we
                        needed you and then behaved like a
                        black jackal.  You abandoned your
                        people to slake your own bloodlust,
                        you did.  That ain't the future
                        for frontier lawmen, nor for
                        frontier towns.

           Pickman looks at Hogan.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        You bein' back in town will make
                        many folks happy, but it will bring
                        more violence, be certain of that. 
                        Things'll never be peaceable between
                        Rattleborge and Quarterstone again,
                        no they won't be.

           Hogan shakes his head morosely.

                                 HOGAN
                              (continuing)
                        I'd rather you left.

                                 PICKMAN
                        I want to live near my wife and
                        daughter and here's where they're
                        buried.  I'm not diggin' them up.

           Hogan, seeing the futility in continued discussion, turns
           away from Pickman and walks towards the setting sun, the
           angled rays limning his plump body.
           Hogan turns and looks at the sad, dusty man standing before
           his buried family.

                                 HOGAN
                        Sheriff Dreighton had four
                        brothers...and he wasn't even the
                        biggest of 'em.

                                 PICKMAN
                        If they want to kill me, I'll be
                        sittin' on my porch.

                                 HOGAN
                        You a gunfighter now?

                                 PICKMAN
                        No, I don't intend to do any more
                        killin'.  I won't fight back as
                        long as you bury me here when it's
                        all over.

           Hogan nods.

                                 HOGAN
                        I can do that for you.

           Pickman nods his thanks.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE IN:

           EXT. PICKMAN'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Pickman, now with a thick beard and whiter hair, sits on
           his porch rocking back and forth in his chair.  It is
           raining.

           A dog begins to BARK in the distance.  The rain collects
           in gray puddles on the newly paved street.  Four ENORMOUS
           MEN walk up the road, towards Pickman's house.  Each man
           holds a repeater rifle.

           Pickman shuts his eyes and leans back in his rocking chair.

           The rain continues to fall.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
