           EXT.LACROSSE FIELD, DAY

           Searing blue sky from POV of someone laying on their back 
           looking up. The sun is as bright as the overhead lights in 
           an airport lavatory. Person on their back uses palm of 
           their upstretched hand, adjusting it precisely, to block 
           out the sun.

           A lunch time lacrosse match is being played on the playing 
           field of an elite girls school. At the fringes, girls cheer 
           the players on. 

           MR.SLATTERY, thirty, good looking within the context of an 
           all girl’s school, patrols the perimeter of the field, 
           pausing to make small talk from time to time, introducing 
           himself to students. At the very far corner, tucked beneath 
           a tree, he notices a sleeping student - Nina, owner of the 
           sun blocking hand, sixteen years old, almost beautiful, but 
           not quite - using a book as a pillow. He taps her. She 
           opens her eyes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Excuse me, but are you okay?

           She pulls aside her headphones. 

                                 NINA
                        Fine.

           He tips his head to see the book.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You fell asleep on top of Balzac.

                                 NINA
                        I find him tiresome.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You often use great novelists of 
                        the 18th century as pillows?

                                 NINA
                        Only the French. Fuck’em.

           He takes a step back, thrown.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What are you listening to?

                                 NINA
                        Bowie.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No kidding? Why?
                                 NINA
                        Because he expresses my 21st 
                        century malaise and ‘life after 
                        irony’ ennui.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Bowie does?

                                 NINA
                        Perfectly. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Bowie was the first concert I 
                        ever went to.

                                 NINA
                        Honestly?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Me and my brother drove to New 
                        York, saw him play at the Garden.

                                 NINA
                        My brother and I.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Pardon?

                                 NINA
                        It’s ‘My brother and I’. You 
                        wouldn’t say ‘Me drove to New 
                        York’ so ‘Me and my brother’ 
                        would be grammatically incorrect. 
                        But you know that, you’re a 
                        teacher...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes...

                                 NINA
                        I mean, I’m sorry, I don’t mean 
                        to be a bitch. Just, my father 
                        would have a fit.

           She sits upright and lights a cigarette. He looks 
           flustered.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t think you’re supposed to 
                        do that.

                                 NINA
                        Small fry. We’ve got junkies 
                        here. Half the twelfth grade are 
                        dying of anorexia . This is the 
                        aristocracy you’re dealing with.

                        I wouldn’t bother with the 
                        cigarettes. Anyway, go on with 
                        what you were saying about Bowie. 
                        You saw him at the Garden...that 
                        would be Madison Square Garden, 
                        not someone’s back yard?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Put it out.

                                 NINA
                        Because seeing Bowie in someone’s 
                        backyard would be hard to beat.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Put it out.

           She looks at the cat hair on his crappy suit. Feels a pang 
           of sorrow for him. She takes a drag and puts it out.

                                 NINA
                        You’re the new English teacher.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Do I look like an English 
                        teacher?

                                 NINA
                        You could pass for an avant-garde 
                        geography teacher maybe. I just 
                        happen to know that Mrs.Lamb had 
                        a nervous breakdown over the 
                        holiday. I saw her talking to 
                        herself in Shaws. They fired her 
                        and hired you.

           He looks at his shoes.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t feel bad. She was a cunt.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Don’t say that word! What are you 
                        thinking?

                                 NINA
                        No, it’s okay, fine olde English 
                        word, found in Chaucer, in fact. 
                        Women are allowed to use it. 
                        Germaine Greer says so.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        That’s ridiculous. If Germaine 
                        Greer told you to jump off a 
                        bridge, would you?
                                 NINA
                        Maybe, although I don’t really 
                        see how that would serve the 
                        cause.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        So, you’re a feminist?

                                 NINA
                        Uh, yeah, I have a vagina and I’m 
                        not retarded. This isn’t Kansas 
                        you know. Where are you from?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Kansas.

                                 NINA
                        Good. That’s perfect. I’ll see 
                        you in class. 

           But she makes no move to leave. He realizes he has been 
           dismissed. To his greater surprise, he walks away, stealing 
           glances behind him as she resumes napping.

           INT.STAFF ROOM, LUNCHTIME

           Mr.Slattery is chatting, over coffee, with Miss Bloom, an 
           art teacher in her late fifties and his first ally at the 
           school. She is going through a student’s sketch book as he 
           talks.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        I’ve been here twenty-two years.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh. You’re much older than I 
                        thought.

           He rushes to cover his rudeness.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Age is horribly on my 
                        mind. I’m about to turn thirty. I 
                        say, sometimes the wrong...I’m 
                        better at expressing myself 
                        through my writing. 

           She sounds wary.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        You write?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m finishing a novel.
                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Uh-huh.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s sort of an allegory about 
                        the way we’ve allowed bereavement 
                        and love to...It’s hard to 
                        explain. 

                                 MISS BLOOM 
                        Uh-huh.I’d not mention the novel 
                        writing ambitions to anyone here. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You think they’re going to spit 
                        me out.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        I hope for your sake they spit 
                        you out. I hope they don’t just 
                        hold you on their tongue and wait 
                        for you to dissolve, as they have 
                        done me.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You seem pretty together.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        I have more leeway than you. I’m 
                        an art teacher. No right or wrong 
                        answer with art.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But there’s no right or wrong 
                        answer in literature either.

           She laughs. It’s a tinkly laugh. First he enjoys the chime 
           like peal of it, and then he realizes it’s making him 
           nervous.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        They’re going to spit you out.

           He thinks on this. She stops at a page in the sketch book. 
           An immaculately rendered sketch of a young woman giving a 
           man head.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Um. Who did that?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        It’s rather good, don’t you 
                        think?

           He grimaces. Looks at his shoes. He doesn’t remember ever 
           having purchased these shoes.
                                 MISS BLOOM (CONT’D)
                        Nina. Sweet kid. One of the few 
                        students I don’t feel the urge to 
                        trip with an out stretched foot 
                        as they race out of my class.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Ah, I used to be that kid.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        What happened?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I fell in love with a book. 

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        What book?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        ‘Everything Must Go’ by Leon 
                        Gross.

           She laughs hard. There is a nasty edge to it now. He’s 
           feeling more than a little befuddled. She rips out the 
           porno sketch.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Here. This is for you.

           He takes it, bemused.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But...

           She packs up her stuff.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Good luck.

           He takes the picture and quickly folds it into his bag, 
           feeling a criminal.

           INT.CLASSROOM, AFTERNOON

           Mr Slattery’s name is written on the board. They are all 
           reading copies of ‘Jane Eyre’. The girls look rapt in 
           attention, apart from Nina who sits in the back of the 
           class, carving triangles on the desk with a pen-knife.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        So, whilst “Jane Eyre” conjures 
                        “air” “Bertha’ conjures “earth”. 
                        There is a post-Colonialist 
                        school of thought, by the way, 
                        that has Bertha as a black woman.

                                 MR SLATTERY (CONT'D)
                        Can you point to a description of 
                        her in the text that might back 
                        up this notion?

           He looks to Nina for a response. Nina looks daggers at him.

                                 NINA
                        No.

           He clears his throat.

           The bell rings and the class snap out of their rapture and 
           rush out the door. He calls after them:

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Well think on it over the weekend 
                        and we’ll try to figure it out on 
                        Monday.

           As Nina tries to leave he stops her.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        Do you ever speak in class?

                                 NINA
                        I spoke.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        One word. You were giving me a 
                        tough time in there.

                                 NINA
                        I aspire to be tough. In any 
                        situation, I always try to 
                        imagine what Lauren Bacall would 
                        do.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        Lauren Bacall wouldn’t be carving 
                        her school desk with a pen knife.

                                 NINA
                        Right, she’d be out of school and 
                        fucking Humphrey Bogart.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No, that’s not what I mean 
                        and...you really can’t talk like 
                        that in my class.

                                 NINA
                        Class is over.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Class is over when I say it is. 
                        You are my student and you will 
                        accord me the proper respect.
                                 NINA
                        Okay! That sounds fun! 

           A part of him is thrilled that she pays him enough notice 
           to mock him.

           INT.STAFF ROOM, END OF DAY

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        How’d it go?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It went alright. Listen, I have a  
                        question, don’t laugh at me. Is 
                        it okay for the kids to smoke on 
                        school premises?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Of course not. Who told you that?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        A girl who was smoking.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Right.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        First she was asleep under a 
                        tree, then she was awake and had 
                        a lit cigarette in her mouth.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Nina. That’s Nina Gross.

                                 MISS BLOOM (CONT’D)
                        Poor girl.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Why poor girl?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Because she’s Gross as in Gross

           He looks blank.

                                 MISS BLOOM (CONT'D)
                        As in Linda and Leon Gross.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        You’re joking me!

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        No.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh, poor kid. I had no idea they 
                        even had children. 

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        He never writes about them, does 
                        he?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        She looks like her mother.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Spitting image.

           He can’t help himself:

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        Have you ever met him? Leon?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Him and his new wife.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        He waited, what, a year?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Ten months.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        So he...so he comes to school 
                        sometimes?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Never. He doesn’t care how she 
                        does here. Seems like he doesn’t 
                        care about her at all.

                                 MR SLATTERY
                        I don’t believe that. A great man 
                        like him? That’s so sad.

           What he doesn’t say is he is sad both for Nina and for 
           himself, at his diminished chance of meeting Leon.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Yes. It’s awful. She’ll be free 
                        of him soon enough. She’ll 
                        graduate high school and leave 
                        him behind. [beat] Let her sleep 
                        when she wants. But she’s not 
                        allowed to smoke.

           He nods.
           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, AFTERNOON

           The house is incredibly grand with an imposing white 
           staircase. LEON GROSS, a grizzled old guy, is asleep on the 
           sofa in the living room. 

           AMELIA, a strikingly slim mid thirties woman with glossily 
           blown out hair as shiny as her black patent stilettos, is 
           arranging flowers in the kitchen.

           JOEL, her four year old son, is buzzing around her legs. 
           Nina is opening and closing the fridge, looking for 
           something that takes her fancy.

                                 JOEL
                        Why did they kill The Jeeze?

                                 AMELIA
                        The Jeeze?

           Her voice is soft and sultry, as valuable an enhancement as 
           the lips from which it tumbles.

                                 JOEL
                        Yes, up on the cross. Why did 
                        they kill him?

                                 AMELIA
                        Because he was a magician

                                 NINA
                        That’s a bad answer. He’s asking 
                        you about Christ not David 
                        Blaine.

           The doorbell rings. Amelia answers it and sees Asia, a 
           teenage Naomi Campbell lookalike. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Hello Asia. Are you coming to 
                        dinner? Experience a little of 
                        our culture?

                                 ASIA
                        No thank you. Just here to study.

           Asia and Nina go silently up to Nina’s room hand in hand. 
           When they get there, Nina shuts the door tight and screams

                                 NINA
                        ‘Experience Some of our culture’! 
                        She converted. Nobody asked her 
                        to convert. She’s a fucking 
                        shiksa for fucks sake. We never 
                        did Shabbat before she came 
                        along.
                                 ASIA
                        Breathe.

                                 NINA
                        No. Because the more I think 
                        about breathing, the more I worry 
                        I’m doing it wrong.

                                 ASIA
                        You can’t breathe wrong.

                                 NINA
                        I can.

           Cut to

           INT.KITCHEN.

           Amelia is polishing surfaces. Nina has Joel in her arms.

                                 NINA
                        Consuela did that already.

                                 AMELIA
                        And I’m doing it again.

                                 NINA
                        You had your hair highlighted 
                        again. You put streaks at the 
                        front.

                                 AMELIA
                        They’re not streaks. They’re 
                        buttery chunks.

                                 NINA 
                        We’re taking Joel out for a 
                        milkshake.

                                 AMELIA
                        Be back in forty-five minutes.

           INT.DINER, AFTERNOON

           The diner is a 24 hr grease spot, populated by regulars and 
           tired drivers passing through. Everyone is at least twenty 
           years older than Nina and Asia and the waitresses are 
           twenty years older on top of that. The girls sit up by the 
           counter, balancing Joel between them.

                                 NINA
                        Chocolate shake and two coffees 
                        please.
                                 ASIA
                        And a side of fries. 

           Joel looks at Asia slyly

                                 JOEL
                        You’re black.

                                 ASIA
                        Yes I am.

                                 JOEL
                        But that doesn’t make you a bad 
                        person.

                                 ASIA
                        Why, thank you Joel.

           Asia turns to Nina.

                                 ASIA (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to ask me how it 
                        went?

                                 NINA
                        How was it?

                                 ASIA
                        I got the job.

                                 NINA
                        Well, of course you did.

                                 ASIA
                        Did I miss anything in school? 
                        Anything incredibly fascinating?

                                 NINA
                        No. Nothing. Well, the new 
                        English teacher.

                                 ASIA
                        Is she a bitch?

                                 NINA
                        He. And, yeah, he’s kind of a 
                        bitch.

                                 ASIA
                        Is he revolting?

                                 NINA
                        Not that revolting. Just highly 
                        strung.
                                 ASIA
                        Another one whose gonna have a 
                        nervous breakdown...

                                 NINA
                        I’m working on it. Are they 
                        paying you a lot? Remember, you 
                        have to take me with you when you 
                        escape. Get me away from my 
                        father and his Shiksa whore.

           Two nuns walking out of the diner whip their heads when 
           they hear “whore”.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Not you.

           She waits for them to get further away, then whispers:

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Whores.

           Joel is still spellbound as they disappear. He stares at 
           the swinging crucifixes around their necks. 

                                 JOEL
                        You know what I want for 
                        Hanukkah?

                                 NINA
                        What?

                                 JOEL
                        A Nun’s necklace.

                                 NINA
                        Tell Amelia. Be very certain to 
                        tell Amelia that.

           The fries arrive and Asia tears through them, dipping them 
           in an improvised dip of ketchup and mayo. Nina looks on 
           with a combination of disgust and awe.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        The thing is, if I were as thin 
                        as you, I’d develop an eating 
                        disorder just for the hell of it. 
                        I mean if you’re really that 
                        thin, you might as well upset 
                        your loved ones.

           Joel plays with a sugar shaker.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Give me a sip of your shake.
                                 JOEL
                        No.

                                 NINA
                        Go on.

                                 JOEL
                        No thank you.

                                 NINA
                        Jesus would have given me a sip 
                        of his shake. 

           He hands it over instantly. Between slurps:

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        I wasted that on a sip of 
                        chocolate shake. You can only 
                        invoke Christ once, maybe twice 
                        to make a four year old do what 
                        you want. Wasted.

           Joel tugs at her leg.

                                 JOEL
                        You know The Jeeze?

           She hands back his shake.

                                 NINA
                        Yes.

                                 JOEL
                        Was his other name ‘The Lamb of 
                        God’?

                                 NINA
                        Let’s go. P.S: You’re awful.

           She takes another sip of his shake. He looks like he might 
           have a fit, then he calms down, narrows his eyes and says

                                 JOEL
                        Amelia says you eat too much. 
                        Amelia says you’re going to be a 
                        fatty, and then who will love 
                        you?

           Bent elbowed, he raises his arms at his sides in query.

           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, EVE

           The family is at the dinner table. Leon seems disconnected 
           from everyone. A maid hovers in the background.
                                 JOEL
                        Nina told me I was awful.

                                 AMELIA
                        Nina! Leon?

                                 LEON
                        He’s pretty awful.

                                 AMELIA
                        He’s your son!

                                 LEON
                        That’s what I said.

                                 NINA
                        Asia is going to be in the new 
                        Gap campaign.

                                 AMELIA
                        Using such young girls, it’s 
                        immoral. When I was a model...

                                 NINA
                        But you were just an underwear 
                        model, right? Cos you were too 
                        short to do high fashion.

                                 AMELIA
                        I was modeling high fashion 
                        underwear. Hand sewn pieces 
                        from...

                                 NINA
                        Nobody cares.

           Leon looks up.

                                 LEON
                        They don’t.

           He goes back to peppering his dinner.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        That Asia is a knockout. Phew!

                                 AMELIA
                        It seems a little off to be named 
                        Asia when you’re not Asian.

                                 NINA
                        It is. It is really off. Where do 
                        those shvartzes get the nerve?

           Leon laughs
                                 AMELIA
                        I won’t be mocked at my own 
                        Shabbat with food that I cooked.

                                 NINA
                        Consuela cooked it. 

                                 AMELIA
                        It was very nice, Consuela.

           Leon pushes away his food, stands up and grumbles

                                 LEON
                        I’m going to bed.

           INT.SLATTERY’S APT, NIGHT.

           A tiny apartment given life by a huge pile of books, vast 
           mountains of New York Times and a huge cat.

           He feeds his cat and watches Charlie Rose. He remembers the 
           sketch in his bag, unfolds it, looks at it, looks at the 
           bottom: it is signed Nina Gross. He flattens it out 
           carefully and tacks it above his desk amongst his multitude 
           of bills.

           INT.NINA’S ROOM, NIGHT.

           Pyjama’d, she brushes her hair at the vanity mirror at her 
           desk. Her eye falls on a note tacked up on the mirror, 
           something she scrawled many, many years earlier:

           “DEAR DADY,

           I AM MAD AT YOU. GRUMBLE GRUMBLE GRUMBLE.

           YOURS HOPEFULLY

           NINA”

           INT.APARTMENT, NIGHT

           Mr.Slattery is preparing school work for the next day, 
           laying out clothes and trying to organize - though he is in 
           fact just moving piles of mess from one corner of the room 
           to another. He looks at his Casio watch. It’s 1 a.m. 

           From under a pile of newspapers is a flashing pink light. 
           Pulling them aside, he finds a light-up plastic ring. It 
           stops him dead, as though he’s just found out he was being 
           bugged the whole time he was working. He backs away from 
           the ring as if it’s kryptonite. He finds a brown envelope 
           and scoops it up like a dead mouse.
           INT.CAR, NIGHT

           Slattery drives a car in equal disarray to his home. When 
           he breaks hard at a light, he puts his hand instinctively 
           to the passenger seat. But there is no one there. Just the 
           brown envelope.  

           EXT.HOUSE, NIGHT

           A far nicer place than his, both vintage and expensive 
           looking. He creeps up to the door, leaves the envelope on 
           the Welcome mat and starts to slink away. But the door 
           opens before he can escape.

                                 JULIET
                        Dennis?

           We see his grimace before he turns to face JULIET, the most 
           self-assured 23 year old who ever lived. She is a bare 
           footed, bare faced, bra-less beauty, sort of a funny 
           looking beauty, a Lily Cole type, but she has total faith 
           in it, gloriously unaware that the her youthful good looks 
           are not a passport, but a visa. It will run out. But for 
           now she has all the power. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh, hey.

           He is so bummed about being caught. He does not want to see 
           her.

                                 JULIET
                        What are you doing?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I thought you might need this.

           He stoops to pick up the envelope. 

                                 JULIET
                        What is it?

           He opens the envelope.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Your ring. I won it for you?

                                 JULIET
                        At the funfair. I wore it for the 
                        afternoon and then I took it off. 
                        Why would I need it?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You’ve come back three times to 
                        get your stuff. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t want you to have to make 
                        the trip again. That’s it. That 
                        really is everything. So we 
                        agree, all the i’s have been 
                        dotted now?

                                 JULIET
                        What do you want? To make me feel 
                        worse? To make sure I’m not over 
                        it?

           He steps forward and hands her the ring.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Okay. So that really should be 
                        everything. Take care of 
                        yourself, Juliet.

           She looks at it in astonishment. Another ring was, for a 
           time, promised to a different hand.

           She throws the ring as far as it will go, her pretty mouth 
           a snarl. Then she slams the door.

           He just stands there and nods to himself.

           EXT.CAR, NIGHT

           The slam of the door behind him in the dark, he shuffles 
           back to his car. The ring, re-activated by her throw, is 
           flashing on and off by the wheel of his car. It’s lined up 
           perfectly. He could crush it. When he drives away, he 
           crushes it.

           INT.GROSS HOUSE, MORNING

           Nina creeps into Leon and Amelia’s bedroom, after making 
           sure there’s nobody in there.

           She eyes the bed with distaste. She puts a gentle hand on 
           both indents on both pillows. Then, in a swift move to 
           Amelia’s side she shakes out her pillow so the indent is 
           gone.

           The drawer is ajar and she picks through Amelia’s knickers, 
           which are little more than tiny, silken ass-trinkets.

           She replaces them, and moves towards her dad’s walk in 
           closet. 

           Above all of her father’s hanging clothes, on a top shelf 
           she steps on tiptoe to reach, she pulls down a box of her 
           mother’s clothes. Amongst the dresses, she picks out a bra. 
           It still has the fake rubber breast in the left cup.
           She looks at the bra with it’s terrible contents, carefully 
           folds it back, and darts back to her room, shaken with 
           horror.

           INT.BOOKSHOP, SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

           Nina and Leon are browsing together in an independent 
           bookstore. She moves as if her skin shrunk in the wash, 
           Leon as if his got all stretched from loaning it out. She 
           follows as he critiques the books on display one by one, 
           looking down over half moon glasses.

                                 LEON
                        Hack.

           He picks up a book then throws it scornfully back in place.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Drug addict.

                                 NINA
                        Saul Bellow is a drug addict?

                                 LEON
                        He could be.

           He rearranges his own books, making them more prominent on 
           the display.

                                 NINA
                        Dad, why do women buy books by 
                        men but men don’t buy books by 
                        women? I mean, why do half the 
                        books by women have pink covers, 
                        or shoes on the cover, or 
                        lipstick? Yours doesn’t have a 
                        blue cover.

           A male student who has been following them round the store 
           plucks up the courage to say something.

                                 STUDENT
                        Excuse me...

                                 LEON
                        You’re excused.

           The boy hangs back, crushed, as they move swiftly to the 
           checkout. She deliberately buys a bunch of Jackie Collins 
           and makes Leon wait with her on line. 

                                 NINA
                        Dad, I forgot my wallet in the 
                        car.
           Leon grudgingly pulls out his credit card. The teller looks 
           at the books then at him.

                                 TELLER
                        We have an author’s discount.

                                 LEON
                        I don’t want it.

           He pays and on the way out picks up Zadie Smith’s latest.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Child!

                                 NINA
                        You were younger than her when 
                        you had your first book 
                        published.

                                 LEON
                        I was never young. That’s why I’m 
                        still relevant.

           At this exact moment, a pretty college student, who has 
           been following Leon with her eyes steps forward.

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        Mr.Gross, I’m so sorry to intrude 
                        but I had to say: I hope you 
                        realise how important you are.

                                 NINA
                        He realises.

                                 LEON
                        Thank you SO much. That’s such a 
                        wonderful thing for an old man to 
                        hear. If my hair weren’t so 
                        silver I’d invite you to tea.

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        But your silver hair is my 
                        favourite thing about you.

                                 LEON
                        Would you care to join us then? 
                        It’s so important for me to stay 
                        in touch with my readers.

           Nina looks on in horror. Cut to:

           INT.AU BON PAIN, AFTERNOON

           Excruciating tea with the three of them. The student is 
           only a few years older than Nina, but self-posessed and 
           refined in a way that makes Nina want to punch things. 
                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        I studied in Paris for a 
                        semester, at the Sorbonne...

                                 NINA
                        Ah, bon...

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        ...and it’s so gratifying to see 
                        the esteem in which they hold you 
                        in Europe. I was there the year 
                        you received the medal d’arts et 
                        lettres.

                                 LEON
                        Such an honour I can still barely 
                        believe it.

                                 NINA
                        Paris. I remember that. That was 
                        the hotel with the porn on every 
                        channel...

                                 LEON
                        My daughter’s going to Harvard 
                        too.

           The Student, who has barely looked at Nina, nods at him. 
           Nina raises her hand.

                                 NINA
                        That’s me. Hi. Maybe Harvard. 
                        Maybe Brandeis.

                                 LEON
                        Ugh. Full of Jews.

           The student tries not to look put out by this comment.

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        Didn’t you go there?

                                 NINA
                        He didn’t finish. He was doing 
                        drama. He was going to be an 
                        actor. He wanted to be famous. 
                        Very, very badly.

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        But Mr.Gross, If you don’t mind, 
                        I’m confused by what you said a 
                        moment ago since you write so 
                        beautifully about the Jewish 
                        experience in America.

                                 NINA
                        He hates when people say that.
                                 LEON
                        You know, I really don’t see 
                        myself as a Jewish writer. 

                                 PRETTY COLLEGE STUDENT
                        You don’t?

                                 LEON
                        No. I don’t think many people do. 

           The student nods. Nina stifles a giggle. 

           INT.GROSS HOME, EVENING.

           A young-ish male interviewer is in their home - he is just 
           wrapping up a conversation with Leon and is still shaking 
           with nerves. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        It’s been a pleasure Mr.Gross. 
                        I’m sure you hear this every day, 
                        but...

                                 LEON
                        Thank you very much for your 
                        time.

           In a flash Leon is back in his office. Amelia makes small 
           talk with the interviewer, flirting a little.

                                 AMELIA
                        I hope you’ll excuse the mess. 
                        Having a four year child leaves 
                        the concept of ‘house proud’ out 
                        the window.

           He’s still too spooked to flirt back.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Not to mention living with an 
                        artist.

           Amelia bristles.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s not that bad. I tidied 
                        yesterday. 

           Joel cries off screen 

                                 JOEL
                        Mooooooommy!

                                 AMELIA
                        Excuse me.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Of course.

           Left alone, he loiters momentarily. Nina, who has been 
           watching from behind a bookcase, steps out of the shadows 
           and without a word kisses the startled writer. Leon, in 
           turn, startles the interviewer by reappearing. Nina is 
           unruffled.

           INT.SCHOOL COPY ROOM, MONDAY LUNCHTIME

           Mr.Slattery copies pages for class. Nina watches him from 
           the doorway, the din of students echoing from the halls. 
           Slattery look up and sees her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What’s up, Bacall? Have a good 
                        weekend?

           She comes in with a very grave look on her face as though 
           she’s about to announce something tragic.

                                 NINA
                        Mr Slattery, does it ever worry 
                        you that your name sounds like 
                        “slatternly”?

           He stops copying for a second.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You really think that’s the first 
                        thing people think of?

           He looks up at her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t count.

           He gets back to work.

                                 NINA
                        But how about out in the world?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What makes you think this isn’t 
                        my world?

           She leans against the copy machine.

                                 NINA
                        This isn’t anyone’s whole world.

           (sigh)
                        I wish my name were Tamla.

           Distracted, he repeats her sentence back.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You wish your name were Tamla...

                                 NINA
                        Right, like Tamla Motown.

           She stacks copied pages to one side for him.

                        Or Stevie. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Like Stevie Wonder.

                                 NINA
                        It could be a girls name. Y’know, 
                        Stevie Nicks...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Sure. I dated a Stevie.

                                 NINA
                        You dated?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes, I dated. I’m a young man. I 
                        date. That’s what we young folk 
                        do.

                                 NINA
                        I blocked it. How can I learn 
                        about Jane Eyre if I’m thinking 
                        about your love life?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I would have thought the two were 
                        perfect parallels.

                                 NINA
                        Repuggo.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Repuggo? Is that Italian?

                                 NINA
                        I don’t know, I just made it up 
                        right now.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I am totally repuggo. That’s the 
                        word on the street.
           EXT.SIDEWALK, AFTERNOON

           Nina and Asia chat as they exit school together and walk up 
           the street, arms linked.

                                 NINA
                        I’d like to be a lesbian. But one 
                        who only holds hands. 

                                 ASIA
                        I’d like to be a high class 
                        hooker who only holds hands.

                                 NINA
                        That does sound classy. 

                                 ASIA
                        I heard that no woman gives a 
                        good blow job until she’s twenty-
                        seven. So I’m just going to wait.

                                 NINA
                        Oh, Asia, you’re so pretty, 
                        you’ll never have to give a blow 
                        job. Only unattractive people 
                        have to be good at sex. Why do 
                        you think Serge Gainsbourg is 
                        always going on about it?

           Asia looks blank

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        Serge Gainsbourg...oh, never 
                        mind.

           They part ways at the end of the street and we follow Nina 
           home to the strains of ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ by Serge 
           Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot.

           Cut to

           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, AFTERNOON

           Nina undoes her blouse as though stripping the school day 
           away and throws it on the bannister. She walks into Leon’s 
           cluttered office. He is typing and they don’t acknowledge 
           each other. Aside from his library of books, Leon also has 
           an enormous record collection. Nina starts going through 
           it, looking for something. 

           She finds what she is looking for - Serge Gainsbourg’s 
           greatest hits - and goes to leave the room with it. Leon 
           stops her, checks what album she took, lets her go with it, 
           but as she reaches the door calls out:
                                 LEON
                        Stop stealing my culture.

                                 NINA
                        Look after it better.

           She leaves the room and goes to hers, where she plays the 
           record on a vintage player. Soon enough there is a knock on 
           her door. She opens it and Leon comes in to continue the 
           conversation.

                                 LEON
                        What do you want with it?

                                 NINA
                        I find it comforting.

                                 LEON
                        You can’t feel nostalgic for 
                        things you never experienced in 
                        the first place.

                                 NINA
                        Yes you can.

           He thinks about this, nods.

                                 LEON
                        You’re still going to the shrink, 
                        right? I’m still paying for it, 
                        aren’t I?

                                 NINA
                        Yes and yes.

                                 LEON
                        Good.

           He goes back to work in an office so plush it smells like 
           velvet, if velvet had a smell.

           INT.MR. SLATTERY’S APARTMENT, AFTERNOON

           What a shithole. Working on his novel at an old typewriter, 
           when the phone rings.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Hello?

                                 JULIET.
                        I left my diaphragm at your 
                        place. I’m coming over after 
                        dinner.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Excuse me?
                                 JULIET
                        You brought me the ridiculous 
                        ring, but you didn’t give me back 
                        my diaphragm.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And you only just noticed that?

                                 JULIET
                        Yes. I haven’t needed it until 
                        now.

           Appalled, he drops the phone back down onto the receiver 
           with force. It knocks over his mug of coffee. Slattery is 
           mopping up spilled coffee from the typed pages, the 
           newspaper and, when he sees it on the grey tabby, to whom 
           he apologizes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        I’m sorry. Fuck. I was really 
                        concentrating. 

           He puts the mess away and sits back down to focus again, 
           staring at the page in the typewriter, fingers hovering 
           over the keys. He looks at the cat.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        That’s upset me. Can you do the 
                        thing again, the pendulum thing?

           On cue the cat starts to purr deeply. Slattery starts to 
           type. But as he does he says, with the clicks:

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Crap. Crap. Crap.

           INT.SHRINK’S OFFICE

           A garden apartment with the sound of kids playing through 
           the open sliding doors. Beside his diploma’s, the shrink 
           also has old, now banned, over the counter medicines framed 
           in maple and glass boxes. Nina looks at them. The shrink, 
           prematurely middle aged with his pants belted too high on 
           his torso, looks at her.

                                 SHRINK
                        You don’t like being here, do 
                        you?

                                 NINA
                        If I wanted to talk about myself 
                        I would go see a psychic. Or I 
                        would write a novel.

                                 SHRINK
                        Your father is a novelist.
                                 NINA
                        Get the fuck out.

                                 SHRINK
                        Do you think your father’s so 
                        sucessfully encapsulating a 
                        generation has made it hard to...

                                 NINA
                        I don’t read his books.

                                 SHRINK
                        Never?

                                 NINA
                        I started one. His first book he 
                        wrote when he was twenty-five. 
                        But it was full of sex and 
                        jerking off. I mean there was no 
                        story except my dad trying to 
                        fuck blonde women.

                                 SHRINK
                        You say ‘your father’ but it’s a 
                        character to which you refer. 
                        It’s just writing.

                                 NINA
                        It’s never just writing. I 
                        thought it was disgusting.

                                 SHRINK
                        Does sex disgust you?

           She stares out the window.

                                 SHRINK (CONT’D)
                        You don’t want to talk about 
                        yourself?

                                 NINA
                        Of course I do. I just don’t want 
                        anyone to listen.

                                 SHRINK
                        That makes no sense. You think we 
                        should stop these sessions?

                                 NINA
                        It makes my father feel better.

                                 SHRINK
                        You care what your father thinks?

           She eyes the clock on the wall. Time up.
                                 NINA
                        Yes. I do.

           She gets up to leave. The door closes behind her. Sitting 
           in the waiting room she sees ZACH. He is a pale and wan 
           teenage boy with cuts on his arms. His face is beautiful, 
           Bambi with sleep deprivation, a baby Ian Curtis. Hard as he 
           tries not to make eye contact, she forces him to.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You cut yourself?

                                 ZACH
                        Yes.

                                 NINA
                        You shouldn’t do that.

                                 ZACH
                        Okay.

           INT. MR. SLATTERY’S APARTMENT, NIGHT

           Slattery opens his front door, as Juliet pushes past him.

                                 JULIET
                        You smell of weed.

           He nods, inhales deeply as she storms up the hallway.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You smell of honey, still. [beat] 
                        Why am I not attracted to you?

           She ignores him, as she rifles through the medicine cabinet 
           in the bathroom. He arrives at the bathroom just in time to 
           experience the pain of watching her pluck the case she 
           needs from the top shelf. 

           INT.BATHROOM

           Juliet opens the case before moving on.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What was that? Were you checking 
                        I didn’t steal your diaphragm? 
                        That I didn’t re-gift it to my 
                        sister? Or sell it for parts?

           She ignores him again, his childishness, as she sees it, 
           beneath her. 

                                 JULIET
                        You’re stoned.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I was writing.

           She makes it back to the door, is about to leave.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Why do you need your vintage 
                        theme birth control all of a 
                        sudden.

                                 JULIET
                        I’ve been seeing a guy I met on 
                        the tennis court.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        A sleeping hobo?

                                 JULIET
                        A fellow Harvard grad...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t want to know. Just go.

           She passes him.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        God, you’re beautiful.

           She pauses, a flicker of hope. He looks her in the eyes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t I want to be with you?

           She leaves, slamming the door.

           INT.STAFF ROOM

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Can you help me out on the 23rd?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        With what?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        A trip to New York. To the 
                        Guggenheim. I can’t control the 
                        She-wolves by myself.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s my thirtieth birthday.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        You don’t work on your day of 
                        birth?
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Sure, of course, I’ll go if the 
                        Principal approves it. I’d love 
                        to go to New York.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        It’s an over nighter, obviously.

           He frowns.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s my birthday.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        You said that.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I have to get someone to feed my 
                        cat.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        It’s only a night. Just leave her 
                        some extra food. She’ll be fine.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It doesn’t really work like that. 
                        [He thinks a moment before 
                        admitting this next part]: She 
                        prefers to be petted whilst she 
                        eats.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Well obviously. That’s perfectly 
                        understandable.

           He detects the sarcasm in her voice.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        She’s been good to me.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Do you have a lot of friends?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I sort of get lost in my 
                        girlfriends.

           He smiles, weakly.

           INT.CAFETERIA, LUNCH

           Nina is following Mr.Slattery around as he does lunch duty, 
           watching over a packed dining hall as the school chows and

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Cash. You know it’s an over-
                        nighter?

                                 NINA
                        I know. Nick Cave or Tom Waits?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh, that’s a tough one.

                        It’s not a tough one, it’s easy. 
                        Tom Waits...

                        Just checking. Only one of them 
                        is my parents, the other is a

                        No, off ‘The Freewheelin’ Bob

                        Of course I like Bob Dylan, but

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Joan Baez is a moaning old cow.

           She stops in her tracks.

           Two eleven year olds come up to them. One of them tugs at 
           Mr.Slattery’s sleeve and he looks down. They are tiny, but 
           wearing lipgloss and have cell phones slung around their 
           shoulders like guns in holsters.

                                 ELEVEN YEAR OLD 
                        Excuse me. My friend thinks 
                        you’re sexy!

           They shriek with laughter and run away. Slattery looks 
           shell-shocked.

                        What do you expect? You’re a 
                        moderately good looking man in an 
                        all girls prep school.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Moderately good looking?

                                 NINA
                        Yeah and you got that geek chic 
                        thing going.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What?!

                                 NINA
                        The cardigans. The bad haircut.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        That’s a cheap haircut

                                 NINA
                        You’re a grown-up. Why don’t you 
                        have money?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m not even thirty yet!
           Not a good enough answer. She knows it. He knows it. He 
           tries again.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Because grown-ups don’t have 
                        money.

           She’s embarrassed.

                                 NINA
                        Oh. Right.

           INT.NAIL SALON

           Amelia is getting a manicure as Joel waits at her feet. She 
           eyes her nails critically.

                                 AMELIA
                        I wouldn’t call that lilac. 
                        That’s mauve.

           The manicurist answers back in Spanish to one of her co-
           workers.

                                 MANICURIST
                        Para mi, se ven como el mismo 
                        color.

                                 AMELIA
                        No. They aren’t the same colour. 
                        Come on. Take it off. Let’s start 
                        again. 

           Joel sits there bored out of his mind.

           Amelia looks at her out stretched hand.

           INT.SCHOOL, END OF DAY

           The bell is ringing and the students are rushing in and out 
           of the locker room to retrieve their belongings. Nina is 
           zooming out the huge swinging doors when she passes 
           Mr.Slattery. He nods at her and she waves at him, and 
           something makes him turn back and grab her hand. It’s the 
           first time they’ve ever touched.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What’s that on your wrist?

           The whole school is swirling around them.

                                 NINA
                        This? I read it in Miss Bloom’s 
                        history of art class this 
                        afternoon. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        This is from Vincent Van Gogh’s 
                        suicide note. I thought it was 
                        amazing.

           Slattery tips her wrist so he can read it. He reads aloud:

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        “The sadness will never go away”.

           He lets go of her wrist and walks off. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        That’s retarded.

           She is left standing there. He goes to his own corner, 
           around the corner and just stands there. He covers his eyes 
           with his hands. Gets it together. Moves to his next 
           classrooom.

           INT.LOCKER ROOM

           Asia, frustrated by her padlocked locker with a combination 
           she can’t remember, is kicking at it. Nina leans over her 
           and clicks the padlock back and forth until it opens. Asia 
           hugs her. Disturbed by the confrontation with Mr.Slattery, 
           Nina gratefully shudders in her embrace. The girls in the 
           locker room pause their lip-glossing to watch.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Lezzers.

           Nina un-peels herself from Asia, walks up to the girl and 
           ever so slowly licks her face. The girl is rooted to the 
           spot with horror, then screams. Asia and Nina hurry off in 
           hysterics.

           INT.GROSS HOME, LEON’S OFFICE, AFTERNOON

           Amelia brings Leon his scotch as he works. As she places it 
           in front of him, aware he is not to be disturbed, he grabs 
           at her hand and touches her perfectly painted nails.

                                 LEON
                        “When Lilac’s Last In The Doorway 
                        Bloomed...”

           She looks at him, quizzical.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Walt Whitman poem.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s beautiful.
                                 LEON
                        You made me remember it. Well 
                        done.

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you.

           Her face morphs as she is, in a single moment, intensely 
           grateful at being recognized for her efforts and instantly 
           aware of how pathetic they are.

           INT.STAFF ROOM, AFTERNOON

           Slattery is packing up his things for the day and making to 
           get out of there. He cringes as Miss Bloom pulls up beside 
           him.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        So, I’m curious. What’s your 
                        type?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        In women?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        In women.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I like smart women. Partial to 
                        brunettes. Older woman.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Older?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Older than me. But then I got 
                        older...ended up with this girl 
                        who was too young. [he stubs out 
                        the cigarette] We were engaged. 

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        And then?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And then we got...dis-engaged. It 
                        never would have worked.

                                 MISS BLOOM 
                        Did you try? When things got 
                        rough?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        She tried. I didn’t want to. [He 
                        has no intention of admitting 
                        this, so is surprised to hear 
                        himself] Things never got rough. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT'D)
                        As soon as I gave her the ring, 
                        there didn’t seem any point 
                        anymore. 

           EXT.LACROSSE FIELD, DAY

           A game is going on. Nina and Asia are skipping class, 
           hiding behind an oak tree at the back of the field. They 
           lean against it and smoke.

                                 ASIA
                        You LIKE Mr.Slattery.

                                 NINA
                        He’s a dork.

                                 ASIA
                        Yeah, and you LIKE him.

                                 NINA
                        Well it’s not as if there are any 
                        other men around here to like. 
                        What am I going to do, fantasize 
                        about some seventeen year old 
                        from St.Michaels? Get drunk and 
                        let him finger me in the bathroom 
                        of some depressing party, Fallout 
                        Boy playing in the background?

                                 ASIA
                        I didn’t say you were wrong to 
                        like him. Everyone else does. It 
                        wouldn’t have to be Fallout 
                        Boy...

                                 NINA
                        He doesn’t like me. I scare him.

           Asia kisses her cheek.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        See, you’re not scared of me. 
                        What’s his problem?

                                 ASIA
                        His problem is you’re sixteen.

                                 NINA
                        So?

                                 ASIA
                        So, you’re officially jailbait.

                                 NINA
                        That’s good, isn’t it?
                                 ASIA
                        That’s bad. That means he could 
                        go to jail.

                                 NINA
                        You know it’s such a ridiculous 
                        thing Americans have about young 
                        women’s sexuality. That’s why 
                        they went after Monica Lewinsky 
                        so hard. They always suspected 
                        that little girl’s lust had the 
                        power to bring down men, bring 
                        down the president, bring down 
                        the free world. And then they 
                        tried to make it come true.

                                 ASIA
                        Wait. Wait...you honestly relate 
                        to Monica?

                                 NINA
                        A zaftig Jewish girl who made a 
                        fool of herself over a powerful 
                        older man who didn’t care about 
                        her? Fuck, yeah.

           They watch the game for a moment, though both are glazed 
           over with their own thoughts.

                                 ASIA
                        I guess it’s good to know you can 
                        make a fool of yourself and bring 
                        down the leader of the free world 
                        at the same time.

           Nina flicks ash.

                                 ASIA (CONT'D)
                        You still think about Andy?

                                 NINA
                        Yes. Sometimes. 

           She takes a big last drag.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I like Slattery. I do. There’s 
                        something oddly touching about 
                        him. He’s kinda pathetic. I get 
                        him.

                                 ASIA
                        So what if you get him? Don’t you 
                        want someone to get you?

           Nina shrugs, brushing it off.
                                 ASIA (CONT’D)
                        I get you.

           Nina stubs out her cigarette and packs up her book bag.

                                 NINA
                        I have to go to class. I feel bad 
                        about ditching.

                                 ASIA
                        That’s new. What have you got?

                                 NINA
                        English.

           She tries to make this sound breezy.

           INT.ENGLISH CLASS, AFTERNOON

           Nina peers through the pane of glass on the door. She sees 
           the class rowdy, looking like they’re enjoying themselves. 
           Mr.Slattery is laughing. She takes a breath and slinks in. 
           As she passes his desk, she sees his open briefcase, and 
           inside, peeking out, one of her dad’s books. She doesn’t 
           like that.

                                 NINA
                        I had to go to the dentist.

           They don’t hear her, so she gingerly takes a seat. 
           Mr.Slattery suddenly snaps up

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You had to go to the dentist?

                                 NINA
                        Yes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Nothing wrong I hope?

                                 NINA
                        I had a toothache. 

           The class laughs at her or they could be laughing at a 
           private joke from before she walked in because Mr.Slattery 
           collapses into laughter too. Nina angrily stands up and 
           grabs the Jane Eyre of the nearest girl on the page to 
           which she’s opened it.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Hilarious. 

           She turns to face the class.
                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you for laughing.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No cursing!

                                 NINA
                        And fuck you for letting them 
                        laugh!

           They laugh even harder now. She throws the book on the 
           ground and storms out. He follows after her.

           EXT.HALLWAY

           In hushed tones:

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Do you want me to send you to the 
                        Principal’s office? Because you 
                        are driving me insane.

           She takes a bottle of zoloft out of her bag, opens the 
           bottle and dumps the pills on the hall way floor.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing that for?

                                 NINA
                        I already am insane so don’t talk 
                        to me about being driven insane.

           She starts grinding them with her heel.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        There are needy maniacs out there 
                        who we can donate these pills to 
                        if you don’t want them. Some of 
                        them are even my friends. 
                        Imaginary, obviously, I have no 
                        friends.

           She laughs and bends to pick them up. He helps her, picks 
           up the bottle, which is prescribed to Amelia.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        These aren’t even yours.

           She smiles meekly.

                                 NINA
                        Props.
           They are still on their knees when he asks

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        So, who drove you mad then?

                                 NINA
                        The world.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        The world did? The world has a 
                        conspiracy against you?

                                 NINA
                        Yes.

           He stands up.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You must be a very important 
                        person, then.

           She pulls herself up.

           He sighs.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        I know you know the answers to 
                        everything...

                                 NINA
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        ...but if you don’t write them 
                        down, you’re going to fail this 
                        class.

                                 NINA
                        I’ll be okay. I’m going to get an 
                        A in Philosophy.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Be hard not to, with your father.

           Her heart sinks.

                                 NINA
                        Right, my father.

           He sneaks a glance through the classroom window, see the 
           girls amusing themselves, figures he has a few seconds 
           more.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I didn’t want to say, I know you 
                        must hear this all the time...

                                 NINA
                        I do...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        ...but I’m such a huge fan of his 
                        work. I write...myself...because 
                        of him. He changed my life.

                                 NINA
                        From what? 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        From?

                                 NINA
                        This is a life saved? 

           It knocks the wind right out of him.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You should get back to class.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Okay.

           He has his hand on the classroom door, turns to face her 
           before he pulls the handle.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t screw this up for 
                        me.

                                 NINA
                        How could I...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You know what I mean. Just don’t. 
                        Please?

           Something clicks in her. She laughs and walks back into 
           class with him. She sits down at her desk and the lesson 
           resumes. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        So to get back to the question I 
                        posed friday: what proof are the 
                        post-colonialist essayists using 
                        to suggest Bertha is black? Let’s 
                        refer to the text...
           INT.CLASSROOM. 

           Class ends with the bell. Idling, Nina stops at his desk on 
           her way out.

                                 NINA
                        I like you.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m glad.

                                 NINA
                        I don’t like people.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You gotta get over that.

                                 NINA
                        Fuck, have you read my father’s 
                        books or not?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Maybe we interpret them 
                        differently. Isn’t that the joy 
                        of literature?

           She cocks her head.

                                 NINA
                        Would you like me to read your 
                        writing one day?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        My novel? It’s not finished. It’s 
                        not even a first draft yet. But, 
                        sure. Yes. I’d like that.

           He’s searching her eyes. Is it something she would then 
           show to her father if she thought it good enough? She gives 
           nothing away.

                                 NINA
                        Okay. Give it to me before we go 
                        to New York. 

           INT.CAFETERIA, LUNCH.

           Nina and Asia are huddled together over a shared tuna 
           casserole.

                                 NINA
                        What does he mean ‘Please don’t 
                        screw this up for me’?
                                 ASIA
                        He means he likes you too.

                                 NINA
                        Disgusting!

           She looks thrilled.

           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, EVE

           Nina walks in to find Amelia and Joel fussing over a box of 
           books that have just been delivered: preview copies of 
           Leon’s new novel. 

                                 LEON
                        It’s just another book for 
                        chrissakes. Seventeen before it.

                                 AMELIA
                        Eighteen.

           She looks excitedly at the jacket photo.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, but this is really elegant!

           Joel lays on his stomach with a book open in front of him 
           and pretends to be reading intently. As he flips the pages 
           he occasionally shrieks “No way!” and “Oh, that was a good 
           one!”

           The only disinterested parties are Leon, who is laying on 
           his back on the sofa, and Nina, who marches straight up to 
           her room.

           INT.COPY ROOM, LUNCHTIME

           Mr.Slattery is copying pages for class when Nina pops her 
           head round the door.

                                 NINA
                        I have something to send you. 
                        Give me your address.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You can’t just bring it to 
                        school?

                                 NINA
                        It’s my father’s new novel. He’s 
                        very secretive. Doesn’t want me 
                        to bring it here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        Stupid I know, but...it’s my 
                        early birthday present to you.

                                    MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh, wow. Of course. I understand.

           He grabs a piece of paper and writes it down.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        How did you know it was my 
                        birthday?

                                 NINA
                        I know everything.

           He looks at her and realizes: he’s quite scared of her.

           EXT.CINEMA LOBBY,AFTERNOON

           Leon and Joel are lining up to buy tickets for the new 
           Pixar movie, standing behind scores of other parents 
           holding the hands of their children. Leon is unashamedly 
           reading a piece about himself in the New York Times, 
           ignoring his son. Suddenly Joel pipes up, at maximum 
           volume:

                                 JOEL
                        From now on, I’m going to call 
                        you ‘Shitter’.

                                 LEON
                        What?!

                                 JOEL
                        Because whenever you drop 
                        something you say “shit”. 
                        Sometimes you stop yourself from 
                        saying it but I know it’s what 
                        you were going to say. So I’m 
                        calling you ‘shitter’ from now 
                        on.

                                 LEON
                        Fine. Fine. Nothing I haven’t 
                        heard from The New Yorker. 

           He returns to his paper. The other parents are staring. 
           Joel waves at them.

           INT.HOUSE EVENING

           Joel and Leon return from the cinema, Joel repeating his 
           favorite lines from the film.

           Amelia is watching Tom Brokaw read the news. On seeing 
           this, Joel exclaims

                                 JOEL
                        Oh God, I hate piggy eyes. He’s 
                        always ruining everything.

           He bursts into tears and starts kicking the floor. Amelia 
           takes him out as Nina comes downstairs from her bedroom

                                 NINA
                        Hey Dad. I read the piece in The 
                        Times. 

                                 LEON
                        Nice piece.

                                 NINA
                        Yeah, dad, except they made a 
                        mistake. You didn’t see it?

                                 LEON
                        What?

           She holds the paper in front of her and reads from the 
           story:

                                 NINA
                        “Gross, father of one son”

                                 LEON
                        I am the father of one son. And 
                        one daughter. They just didn’t 
                        put that part in.

                                 NINA
                        Dad...

                                 LEON
                        Big deal. It’s a mistake. Stupid 
                        bastards. Come on, you know what 
                        they’re like.

           Nina is holding back tears.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        What? Now you’re going to start 
                        crying? What are you, Joel?

                                 NINA
                        Joel is four. Joel is in his room 
                        crying over Tom Brokaw.

                                 LEON
                        Tom Brokaw’s in his room crying 
                        over Tom Brokaw! Come on!

           Amelia walks in.
                                 AMELIA
                        What’s wrong? What’s going on?

                                 LEON
                        The New York Times made her cry.

                                 AMELIA
                        What are you talking about? What 
                        do you mean?

                                 NINA
                        Forget it!

           She’s really crying now. He can’t stand it. 

                                 LEON
                        Okay. Okay.

           He backs slowly out of the room as though menaced by a 
           shark.

           Nina grabs her coat and her bag and storms out into the 
           rain.

           EXT.MR.SLATTERY’S DOORSTEP, EVENING

           Nina rings the doorbell. She’s soaking wet, holding a copy 
           of her father’s book in her hand. No answer. She rings it 
           again. Mr.Slattery opens it, bleary eyed.

                                 NINA
                        I have this for you.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Um, thanks.

                                 NINA
                        It’s raining

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Right. Do you want to...come in?

                                 NINA
                        Thank you. A vampire has to be 
                        invited in.

           He looks bemused.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                         I’m joking.

           They stand in the hallway.

                                 NINA (CONT’D) 
                        Can I come in further?
           He lets her in.

           She sees the small apartment, typewriter set up, the cat 
           staring at her.

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        You have a cat.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I do.

                                 NINA
                        That’s kind of old lady-ish. 
                        Isn’t that what women have when 
                        they live alone?  

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Nina, you need to learn how the 
                        concept of conversation works.

                                 NINA
                        I heard your last girlfriend was 
                        really pretty.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You see, that’s not how it works.

                                 NINA
                        Can I look at your records?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No.

                                 NINA
                        No, your girlfriend wasn’t pretty 
                        or no I can’t look at your 
                        records?
                        Ooh, look, you have the original 
                        British 12 inch of ‘White Man In 
                        The Hammersmith Palais’. Amazing! 
                        Where did you get this? 

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        Right. Can you stop looking at my 
                        records?

           She hands him The Clash single.

                                 NINA
                        Put this on.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No.

                        She sighs and puts it on herself.
                                 NINA
                        It smells of weed in here. Were 
                        you smoking weed? 

           She notices the typewriter has been left mid-sentence.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Is that your novel?

           Mr.Slattery seems to resign himself to the fact that she’s 
           not going to leave.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes. It is.

                                 NINA
                        Would you like me to read it?

           She sits down at the desk. Looking into the ashtray she 
           finds the remnant of a joint and lights it up. The lighter 
           sparks a few times and just as it flares into flame she 
           spots, above his desk, her blowjob sketch, with her 
           signature. She inhales the whole joint in a few puffs. He 
           dives towards her, ripping it from her lips.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        Okay, I’m driving you home now.

                                 NINA
                        You are?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yep. Get up.

           She doesn’t get up. She can hardly sit up.

                                 NINA
                        How will I read your novel? 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Here. Take it with you.

           He’d do anything at this point to get her out. 
           Unfortunately she is wasted.

           He puts her on his back and carries her to his car. He 
           turns on the radio and drives. ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My 
           head’ by Kylie Minogue comes on and he turns it up. Nina 
           wakes up a bit.

                                 NINA 
                        Ugh, Kylie Minogue. Revolting. 
                        Change it.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        On the contrary. I think the song 
                        has an undercurrent of tremendous 
                        darkness.

           She grimaces.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        What, it’s not old enough for 
                        you? You know what Nina? You’re 
                        too cool for school. Just because 
                        a singer is currently popular 
                        doesn’t mean they’re terrible. 
                        Sometimes the people are right. 
                        You believe in the people?

                                 NINA
                        Of course not.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You’re missing out.

           He turns up the song even louder. They arrive at her home 
           and he waits until the song finishes then turns down the 
           volume.

                                 NINA
                        How did you know where I live?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Everyone knows where you live.

           Thinking she will be too stoned to remember this he tells 
           her. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        When I was at college, I stood 
                        outside, hoping for a glimpse of 
                        your father.

                                 NINA
                        You can come in and meet him if 
                        you want.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Not tonight. Out you get. Here’s 
                        the manuscript. Don’t lose it. 
                        Stoner.

           She stares at him as though waiting to be kissed.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Hop out. I’ve got a lot of 
                        work. So I can take that day off 
                        to come with you guys to the 
                        Guggenheim.
                                 NINA
                        Have I done something wrong?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No you haven’t. But please get 
                        out of the car. I don’t like 
                        being made to feel like [he sings 
                        a snatch of Don’t Stand So Close 
                        To Me by The Police] “the old man 
                        in the book by Nabokov”.

           She looks miserable.

                                 NINA
                        You’re not the first you know. 
                        Andy was older than you...he was 
                        thirty three...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t want to know. Go on, get 
                        out. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           She steps out. He starts to rev the engine. As he’s pulling 
           away she calls out

                                 NINA
                        Mr.Slattery!

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes?

                                 NINA
                        It’s not NA-bo-kov. The correct 
                        Russian pronounciation is Na-BOK-
                        ov. Sting got it wrong.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Sting always gets it wrong.

           INT.NINA’S ROOM, NIGHT

           As she reads his pages, the manuscript fanned out across 
           her chest, she smiles to herself, to the tune of the 
           aforementioned Police song. 

           EXT.STREET, NIGHT

           After he’s let her out, Mr.Slattery drives around for a 
           while, listening to the radio, aimless. He looks at the 
           Leon Gross book on the seat where Nina had been. Then he 
           pulls up to the kerb under a street light, parks and starts 
           reading. 
           INT.SCHOOL

           Slattery passes Nina in the hallway.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Nina! Nina!

           Nina flushes with happiness.

                                 NINA
                        Yes?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I loved your father’s book. It 
                        kept me up all night. Please 
                        thank him from me.

           Her face barely hides her disappointment.

                                 NINA
                        It kept you up all night. Sounds 
                        like a quote for the jacket. 

           He smiles and starts to walk away. She calls after him:

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know that I want a 
                        teacher whose been up all night.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You know that I...

                                 NINA
                        Oh. Yeah. Okay.

           He walks back to her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I know you won’t have had a 
                        chance to read my pages.

                                 NINA
                        I have actually.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And?

                                 NINA
                        It’s a longer conversation for 
                        another time. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Right.

           Crushed, he goes to class.
           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, EVE

           They are at dinner, Consuela hovering in the background. 
           Amelia is trying to make Joel eat. Leon is reading the 
           paper.

                                 NINA
                        I hate having dinner on time, the 
                        same time every night.

                                 LEON
                        What’s to hate?

                                 NINA
                        The certainty. 

                                 LEON
                        If you’d lived a writer’s life, 
                        had years of struggle, years of 
                        uncertainty, not knowing where 
                        your next meal was coming from, 
                        let alone what time it was 
                        coming, you might be more 
                        appreciative.

                                 NINA
                        But that’s exactly what I do 
                        want. 

           Amelia’s diamond rings sparkle in the candle light.

                                 AMELIA
                        Your father struggled...

                                 NINA
                        So that you wouldn’t have to.

                                 AMELIA
                        Exactly. So that you wouldn’t 
                        have to.

                                 NINA
                        No he didn’t. That’s not why he 
                        wanted to write, not so he could 
                        send his daughter to private 
                        school. If that was the reason, 
                        he would have been a horrible 
                        writer. It would show in his 
                        work. He did it because he loved 
                        writing. 

           Leon folds his paper and puts it aside.
                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I just want to love something so 
                        much it puts my future in 
                        jeapordy.

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s a very stupid thing to 
                        say.

                                 LEON
                        No it’s not.

           Amelia looks chagrined. Dinner continues in silence.

                                 NINA
                        Dad, I have a new English 
                        teacher.

                                 LEON
                        Mmm-hmmm.

                                 NINA
                        He’s a huge fan of yours.

                                 LEON
                        Yeah? And?

                                 NINA
                        I gave him a copy of the book. He 
                        loved it.

                                 AMELIA
                        What? You did what?

                                 NINA
                        I gave him ‘The Trees’. He used 
                        to stand outside the house when 
                        he was at college hoping for a 
                        glimpse of you, dad.

                                 LEON
                        Yeauch.

                                 AMELIA
                        You gave him the book? What are 
                        you talking about? It isn’t in 
                        stores yet. He could leak it.

                                 NINA
                        He won’t do that...

                                 AMELIA
                        You’ll have to get it back.

                                 NINA
                        Oh, chill out.
                                 AMELIA
                        Immediately. Tonight. This is 
                        extremely serious. We’ll have to 
                        find out where he lives.

                                 NINA
                        I know where he lives.

           Leon looks interested.

                                 LEON
                        How do you know where he lives?

                                 NINA
                        I just know. Everyone at school 
                        does.

                                 LEON
                        Oh yeah?

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re getting it back right now.

                                 LEON
                        Ah, who cares?

                                 AMELIA
                        I care, Leon. And so should you. 
                        This is your work. It isn’t out 
                        for another ten days. We don’t 
                        know this man.

                                 NINA
                        I know him. He won’t...

                                 AMELIA
                        If you won’t protect your work, 
                        Leon, I will.

           EXT.MR.SLATTERY’S, NIGHT

           Amelia rings the bell. No answer. She rings it again. 
           Slattery comes to the door.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes? Can I help you?

           He is so taken by Amelia’s beauty that it takes a moment 
           for him to notice Nina standing behind her. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Nina? Um, what’s up?

                                 AMELIA
                        You’re the English teacher?
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m Dennis Slattery.

           He puts out his hand to shake hers, but she ignores it.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Is there a problem?

           He looks at Nina for help.

                                 AMELIA
                        Wait in the car.

           As soon as Nina hangs back, Amelia’s tone changes.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m terribly, terribly sorry to 
                        trouble you so late at night.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s okay, I wasn’t doing 
                        anything.

           She peers past him and notices the cats, Charlie Rose again 
           playing in the background TV.

                                 AMELIA
                        Well, this is very embarrassing, 
                        but I’m afraid Nina made a 
                        mistake. I believe she gave you a 
                        copy of ‘The Trees’, my husband’s 
                        new book.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You’re Mrs.Gross. Oh! Hello. Nice 
                        to meet you. God, I loved it. I’m 
                        a huge, huge fan.

           He puts out his hand to shake.

                                 AMELIA
                        Right, well I’m afraid I have to 
                        get it back. It isn’t available 
                        to the public yet and Mr.Gross is 
                        going out of his mind...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I thought it came from Mr.Gross 
                        himself.

                                 AMELIA
                        No. It came from his office but 
                        he had no idea that Nina took 
                        it...he’s terribly upset. You 
                        know how writers are. Very 
                        protective of their work.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I had no idea. How embarrassing. 
                        I feel really bad. I’ll go get 
                        it.

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you.

           She flutters her eyelashes. Nina sits in the front seat of 
           the car, her feet on the dashboard, fiddling with the 
           radio. Slattery watches Amelia walk back to the car. She 
           gets in and slaps Nina’s hand off the dial.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        That was a very stupid thing you 
                        did. Thankfully he is a 
                        reasonable man. He understood and 
                        asked me not to punish you.

                                 NINA
                        Punish me? Every day with you is 
                        punishing.

                                 AMELIA
                        That’s enough.

                                 NINA
                        “That’s enough”. You think you’re 
                        Mary Poppins? You think I’m a 
                        kid? 

                                 AMELIA
                        You’re sixteen.

           Nina eyes her slyly.

                                 NINA
                        You miss it don’t you?

                                 AMELIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 NINA
                        Had you hooked your first rich 
                        old man by sixteen? 

                                 AMELIA
                        I went to convent school. I was a 
                        virgin. Not that that’s any of 
                        your business.

                                 NINA
                        I bet you had hooked ‘em. I bet 
                        the thrill is never quite the 
                        same...the older you get. It’s 
                        not the same for them either. And 
                        you know it. 
           Amelia stares at her, blinking back something. Is it the 
           possibility of tears? Of rage? Of a smile?

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Your “buttery chunks” can’t help 
                        you now.

           Amelia pulls the car over, turns off the ignition, calmly 
           turns to Nina and slaps her hard across the face. Nina 
           doesn’t react at all. Amelia turns her head back to the 
           steering wheel, starts the car and they drive home in 
           silence.

           INT.NINA’S HOUSE, NIGHT. 

           Leon and Amelia’s bedroom. The room is dark save the light 
           from Amelia’s walk in closet, the door ajar, rows of 
           exquisite shoes visible.

           Amelia approaches Leon in bed. He is snoring on his side. 
           He opens one eye. She peels off her clothes slowly and 
           climbs in beside him. She straddles him and thrusts her 
           cleavage in his face.

                                 LEON
                        Aw, leave off.

           She shakes her head in disbelief and climbs off him.

                                 AMELIA
                        Am I...just not your thing? 
                        Sexually?

                                 LEON
                        That is true. I don’t know why. 
                        Nothing specific. Just chemistry.

                                 AMELIA
                        Then why did you marry me?

           He smiles.

                                 LEON
                        You have a very beautiful voice. 

           He rolls over and closes his eyes, absent mindedly patting 
           her side with one hand, like he’s trying to get a puppy to 
           go to sleep.

           She goes into her walk in closet and sits down among the 
           array of beautiful stilettos. Sobs echo through the door. 
           Leon sighs and goes back to sleep.
           INT.NINA’S ROOM, NIGHT

           Nina is laying on her back on the floor, looking at her 
           poster of Joe Strummer. She has her headphones on full 
           blast so that we can hear the music almost as loud as she 
           can.

           INT.SCHOOL, MORNING

           Slattery and Nina pass in the crowded hallway, the bell 
           ringing and kids rushing back and forth to class. They both 
           stop and think about turning back but neither does. 

           INT.STAFF ROOM, LUNCHTIME

           Mr.Slattery And Miss Bloom are lunching together.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        You look distracted.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I am a little distracted. Nina 
                        Gross. She just...smart kid. Head 
                        fuck, excuse my language.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        You’re excused. 

           She takes a sip of coffee, holding it in her mouth to stop 
           herself from saying what she says next.

                                 MISS BLOOM (CONT’D)
                        You know, you must know, there 
                        are rumours. All those meetings 
                        you seem to take in the 
                        photocopying room...

           He looks up sharply.

                                 MISS BLOOM (CONT’D)
                        But I would never presume to 
                        ask...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Ask what?

           She gapes a little and opts to stay silent.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT'D)
                        If what?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        Forget it. It’s not my place.
           But he won’t let it lie.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You’re gay, right?  

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        My partner and I...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Your girlfriend.

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        My girlfriend. Yes. I’m gay.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And you teach at an all girls 
                        school. Is that a problem for 
                        you?

                                 MISS BLOOM
                        I haven’t actually told anyone. 
                        It’s completely unnecessary. For 
                        those who assume such things...

           He is curt

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I have to get ready for third 
                        period. Excuse me.

           INT.COPY ROOM, LUNCHTIME

                                 NINA
                        Hey.

           She bounces merrily in and leans against the photocopier. 
           He doesn’t say anything

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        This is our room, right. This is 
                        our assigned spot.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        There is no assigned spot. What 
                        would we need an assigned spot 
                        for?

                                 NINA
                        Why are you being weird?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m busy.

                                 NINA
                        I’m sixteen. I’m busy.
           Under his breath but loud enough for her to hear

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You’re crazy.

                                 NINA
                        Do you want to know what I 
                        thought of your book?

           He can’t help himself.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes. Of course.

                                 NINA 
                        Fuck you!

           Unbeknownst to them, the principal, passing in the 
           corridor, overhears. A short, stout forty-something, she 
           bursts in on them and their expressions are more 
           appropriate to people caught having sex than fighting.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I want you both in my office. 
                        Now.

           They follow her. They both look like kids. They sit down in 
           her spartan office, apart but side by side on wooden chairs 
           as she faces them in her leather swivel chair.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        What is going on? This is highly 
                        inappropriate. From both of you. 

           She’s just talking about their language but they both know 
           there’s something else under the surface.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s okay.

                                 NINA
                        It’s not okay. He’s a fucking 
                        lousy teacher.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Nina!

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Principal Moore, I am so sorry.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Can you control her, or not?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t know.
                                 PRINCIPAL
                        What do you mean, you don’t know? 
                        You’re the teacher, she’s the 
                        student.

           He doubts this. Nina sees it in his face.

                                 NINA
                        You’re right. I’ve been very 
                        disrespectful. God! How could I 
                        have said that?

           She shakes her head exaggeratedly.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, Principal Moore. 
                        I’ve been going through a rough 
                        time...

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I know, dear, and you should know 
                        we’re rooting for you.

                                 NINA
                        But it’s no excuse. I fully 
                        apologize Mr.Slattery. I don’t 
                        know what got into me.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s okay...

                                 NINA
                        No it’s not. It absolutely won’t 
                        happen again. Never.

           This frightens him.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Nina...

                                 NINA
                        It won’t happen again. If you’ll 
                        excuse me, Principal Moore, I’m 
                        going to the bathroom to get 
                        myself together.

           She stands up. Slattery half stands up, but Nina is already 
           out the door. He sits down again. It is clear the Principal 
           has more to say to him, although we don’t hear it, as we 
           follow Nina outside to the other side of the closed door, 
           where she leans against it, catching her breath.

           INT.SHRINK’S

           Nina and the shrink stare at each other in silence. This 
           appears to be a stand off. Nina is winning.
                                 SHRINK
                        Time’s up.

           She stands and leaves without saying a word. Outside the 
           door, she sees Zach waiting in a chair, reading a magazine. 
           His scars are healing. She is almost out the second door, 
           when she turns to him.

                                 NINA
                        Hey.

           He puts down his magazine.

                                 ZACH
                        Yes?

                                 NINA
                        You wanna get out of here?

           He looks momentarily nervous before the sound of the shrink 
           moving behind the other door inspires him to answer:

                                 ZACH
                        Sure.

                                                             CUT TO:

           Nina and Zach hailing a cab. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           Inside the cab, they sit on other sides, suddenly awkward 
           like Elaine and Benjamin at the end of The Graduate. Nina 
           breaks the silence.

                                 NINA
                        So. How old are you?

                                 ZACH
                        Nineteen.

                                 NINA
                        Wow, you look a lot younger.

                                 ZACH
                        Yeah, that’s my problem.

                                 NINA
                        That’s it? That your whole 
                        problem?

                                 ZACH
                        No. I mean, I guess that’s maybe 
                        part of it.
                                 NINA
                        Don’t get me wrong. That’s 
                        actually a good problem.

                                 ZACH
                        Why? What’s your problem?

                                 NINA
                        My mom got breast cancer and 
                        died.

                                 ZACH
                        That’s a good problem. I mean, 
                        not good but...

                                 NINA
                        She was a really cool chick, you 
                        know?

           He doesn’t, but he answers very sweetly

                                 ZACH
                        I know.

                                 NINA
                        She was just really, really 
                        awesome.

           Zach reaches over and puts his hand on hers. It is a 
           gesture simultaneously kind and creepy. She looks at his 
           scarred arm. Seeing her stare, he offers, by way of 
           explanation:

                                 ZACH
                        She’s older than me. I love her.

                                 NINA
                        And she doesn’t love you? 
                        [sarcastic] What’s not to love?

           She gestures at his wrists.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Does it work?

           He shakes his head

                                 ZACH
                        She won’t see me anymore.

                                 NINA
                        Well, a word of advice. Grown ups 
                        want vitality and enthusiasm to 
                        feed off in their young. No 
                        interesting adult picked the 
                        sixteen year old Morrissey to 
                        hang about with.
                                 ZACH
                        I’m gonna get out here.

                                 NINA
                        You don’t want to do something?

                                 ZACH
                        This was enough.

                                 NINA
                        Okay. Bye.

           INT.ASIA’S PHOTO SHOOT, AFTERNOON

           Nina drops by. She sees from afar Asia being primped and 
           fussed over by a make-up artist. She wanders over to the 
           catering table and picks up a bagel.

                                 MEAN STYLIST
                        Hey! Can I help you?

                                 NINA
                        No. I’m good.

                                 MEAN STYLIST
                        What are you doing here? This is 
                        a fashion shoot.

                                 NINA
                        I know, asshole, I was invited...

           Asia sees her and comes bounding over. She falls into a hug 
           on her and clutches her close as Nina tries to get her 
           breath. Eventually she pulls away.

                                 ASIA
                        You came!

                                 ASIA (CONT’D)
                        Raphael, this is my best friend 
                        Nina. Nina this is Raphael.

           Nina stretches out her hand.

                                 NINA
                        So nice to meet you.

           He shakes her hand wanly and wanders away.

                                 ASIA
                        What’s doing?

                                 NINA
                        Actually, I just met this really 
                        interesting freak.

                                 NINA
                        He looks fourteen. Anyway. 
                        Beautiful little boy. Waiting at 
                        the shrink’s when I came out. 
                        Cuts all over his arms. I mean 
                        they really stand out, this 
                        beautiful pale skin.

                                 ASIA
                        You said he was beautiful 
                        already. You like him?

                                 NINA
                        Oh God no. Far too mopey. But 
                        sort of fascinating. I was 
                        thinking perhaps we might adopt 
                        him.

                                 ASIA
                        Does he want to be adopted?

                                 NINA
                        EVERYBODY wants to be adopted. 
                        Everybody wants to believe their 
                        parents are really someone 
                        fabulous and important. We’re 
                        fabulous and important.

           Asia stares at her a beat too long because of course Leon 
           Gross is fabulous and important. Nina knows what she’s 
           thinking and glosses over.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think?

                                 MEAN STYLIST
                        Asia, we need you.

                                 ASIA
                        I’m needed.
                                 NINA
                        Truly you are.

           She kisses her on the mouth out of love. But for Asia we 
           see in her eyes: hope.

           INT.BLOOM HOUSE, EVENING

           Amelia walks in, laden with designer shopping bags. The 
           sound of typing echoing from Leon’s office stops and he 
           calls out

                                 LEON
                        Where have you been?

           She tiptoes into his office.

                                 AMELIA
                        Out shopping.

                                 LEON
                        Come here.

           She walks towards him.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Sit on my knee.

           She happily complies.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been writing more today. 
                        It’s just flowing.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m so glad, my love.

                                 LEON
                        You want to hear something?

                                 AMELIA
                        Always.

                                 LEON
                        Always she wants to hear. Well, I 
                        think you’ll like this one. It’s 
                        a story about what happens to 
                        trophy wives once they get past 
                        the age of thirty-
                        five...listen...

           She interrupts.

                                 AMELIA
                        Were you this cruel to her?
                                 LEON
                        Sometimes. Not often. I’ve become 
                        far crueller since I’ve been with 
                        you. Or maybe it’s just the 
                        ageing process. Mine and yours.

           She smiles small and gets off him.

           INT.GROSS HOUSE, SATURDAY MORNING

                                 AMELIA
                        Nina are you coming swimming with 
                        us or not?

           Nina shouts from the top of the stairs

                                 NINA 
                        NO! I said no already!

           INT.SWIMMING POOL DRESSING ROOM

           The changing room is full of girls changing after swimming. 
           Old, be-capped ladies barely mask their irritation as 
           clusters of teenage girls hoot and holler. Amelia is 
           changing as Joel watches her intensely. He looks from the 
           teenage girls to her. She looks at him as if to say “what?” 
           He points at her.

                                 JOEL
                        Why are they saggy?

           Amelia hurriedly finishes changing. Her hair is still wet 
           as she walks towards her car. They pass Mr.Slattery, who 
           has a gym bag over his shoulder.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Hey!

           She keeps walking.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Mrs.Gross!

           She turns. She doesn’t register.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Dennis Slattery? English teacher?

           She wears an expression like he’s trying to sell her 
           something.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Nina’s English teacher?
                                 AMELIA
                        Ah yes. The book thief. 

           She keeps walking.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you need a ride?

           He scurries to catch up with her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I was going to walk. But...

                                 AMELIA
                        Get in. 

           She secures Joel into the back of her Porsche as Slattery 
           straps himself into the passenger seat.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Your hair’s wet.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ve been swimming.

           She starts to pull out of the parking lot, silent until 
           they hit the main road.

                                 AMELIA (CONT'D)
                        How old are you, Mr.Slattery?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Funny you should ask. I’m nearly 
                        thirty.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m thirty-five.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        How’s it going for you?

           She doesn’t speak until she makes her turn.

                                 AMELIA
                        I used to be seventeen. 

           He is confused. More silence.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Didn’t that suck!

                                 AMELIA
                        No. It was wonderful.

           Silence.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m over here on the right.

                                 AMELIA
                        I remember.

           She pulls over outside his house. She looks back at Joel 
           who has fallen asleep.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s not going to be fun to wake 
                        him.

                                 AMELIA
                        Have you ever felt like your life 
                        was becoming a landslide?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes.

           She just nods her head. Then she turns to face him directly 
           for the first time and stares at him. She is weighing 
           something up. He is nervous. Looks like she might be about 
           to kiss him. She doesn’t.

                                 AMELIA
                        I made a mistake.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Just one?

                                 AMELIA
                        A big one.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What did you do?

                                 AMELIA
                        I got involved with someone with 
                        a big age difference. It 
                        shouldn’t have happened.

           Slattery looks back nervously at sleeping Joel.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        I need to be with someone my own 
                        age. I need to. I need to be made 
                        love to. You know the kind of sex 
                        that rearranges the chemistry of 
                        your body?

           He stares at her. Then at his shoes. Then at her again.

           She opens the door and lets him out. 
           INT.BAR, EVENING

           Asia and Nina sneak in with fake ID’s and a ridiculous 
           amount of make-up. They find Zach is by himself at the bar, 
           drinking. 

                                 NINA
                        That’s him.

           They walk over.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You came.

                                 ZACH
                        You tracked me down.

                                 NINA
                        It wasn’t hard.

           He has clearly already had quite a lot to drink. The white 
           lines on his arms are bubbling up.

                                 ASIA
                        Oh my God! What is that?

                                 ZACH
                        Just a reaction with the alcohol. 
                        It happens sometimes.

                                 NINA
                        That’s awesome!

                                 ZACH
                        It isn’t. 

                                 NINA
                        Pretty good party trick. 

           She shrugs.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You want us to leave you alone? 

           He pays for his drink.

                                 ZACH
                        No.

           INT.ASIA’S BEETLE

           They’re parked at the back of an empty lot. Asia’s in the 
           front seat, like a chauffeur. Nina and Zach are in the 
           back.
                                 NINA
                        This is Asia’s car.

                                 ZACH
                        It’s nice.

                                 NINA
                        It’s her actual car that she 
                        bought with her money. No-one 
                        else paid for it.

                                 ZACH
                        Why would they?

                                 ASIA
                        I’m doing modelling right now. 
                        It’s stupid, but it will pay for 
                        college.

                                 ZACH
                        I don’t think it’s stupid at all. 
                        I collect photos of models.

                                 NINA
                        Oh my god, that’s so sad!

                                 ASIA
                        Thanks a lot!

                                 NINA
                        No, but come on...

                                 ZACH
                        My favourite right now is Daria 
                        Werbowy, but historically my 
                        favourite is Jerry Hall. She 
                        looks like she would overwhelm 
                        you. 

           At this, Nina kisses Zach hard on the mouth. His response 
           is dead. She takes his hand and puts it on her breast. 
           Nothing. Asia looks away, intently staring out at the sky.

                                 NINA
                        Are you gay? That’s okay you 
                        know. But save me the wasted 
                        time. 

                                 ZACH
                        You don’t strike me as much of a 
                        time waster.

                                 ASIA
                        Excuse her. She has ADD. Can I 
                        go?
                                 ZACH
                        What do you have?

                                 NINA
                        Attention deficit disorder. ADD 
                        just takes less time to say. 
                        Don’t go Asia! 

           He turns to face Asia, flashing his Bambi eyes.

                                 ZACH
                        Don’t go, Asia. 

           Watching in the rear view mirror, she notices Zach stealing 
           glances at Asia. Although Nina is not attracted to him, she 
           is jealous.

                                 NINA
                        I told you, right, Zach and I 
                        have the same shrink?

                                 ASIA
                        Uh-huh. I’m waiting for the day I 
                        can afford to go too.

                                 NINA
                        I gotta say, there is something 
                        worthwhile about employing 
                        someone whose job is to listen to 
                        your problems.

                                 ZACH
                        That something the shrink told 
                        you? 

                                 NINA
                        Yes it is, actually.

                                 ZACH
                        I shut it all out. I answer all 
                        his questions but in my head, I 
                        just hum the whole time.

                                 NINA
                        And that’s why you’re doing so 
                        well.

                                 ZACH
                        You don’t know how I’m doing. You 
                        didn’t know me before and you 
                        don’t know me now. You sure as 
                        hell won’t know me after.

                                 ASIA
                        After what?
                                 NINA
                        Let me out of here.

           She fiddles with the door. Zach leans across, physically 
           close to her, it’s sexy, and lets her out.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Do you have scars on the rest of 
                        you?

           He lifts his shirt ever so slowly. Pure beautiful virgin 
           white. She slams the door. He sits there for a while and as 
           she walks away he climbs over the seat next to Asia. They 
           start driving, opposite way from Nina.

           INT. ZACH’S DORM ROOM.

           Asia has no idea why she agreed to come here. It isn’t what 
           she wants. There are photos of models everywhere. To her 
           horror, amongst the Marie Helvin’s and Kate Moss’s, Asia 
           sees a photo of the young Amelia in her underwear at her 
           model heyday. Then she notices it is signed. To Zach. Zach 
           sees her notice it. He kisses her. She has her eyes open, 
           looking at it, as she’s being kissed.

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA, MORNING

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I didn’t know you ate breakfast 
                        here.

                                 NINA
                        Sometimes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m on morning duty.

                                 NINA
                        What are your duties?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Got to make sure no-one throws 
                        food at anyone else and that no-
                        one throws up food.

                                 NINA
                        How’s it going for ya?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You sound more and more teenage 
                        every day.

                                 NINA
                        You say that. I don’t know how to 
                        take it.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s good. It’s a good thing. It 
                        makes me happy. Because I worry 
                        about you and your brilliant 
                        mind.

                                 NINA
                        You do?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Of course I think you are. 
                        Brilliant.

                                 NINA
                        No. I mean: you worry about me?

           By this she means “You think about me?” He knows it.

           Beat

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        You ready for the trip to the 
                        city?

                                 NINA
                        Super excited. I’ve not been to 
                        the Guggenheim since I was a 
                        little girl.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        That surprises me.

                                 NINA
                        Don’t be surprised. I’m really a 
                        philistine.

           Beat

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        So’s Leon.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Where will we be staying? 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I guess we’ll stay the night in 
                        some delightful inn befitting you 
                        fine young ladies.

                                 NINA
                        Again Howard Johnson’s. Just like 
                        the trip to the opera last year.

           He looks blank.
                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You hadn’t been invented yet.

           He chooses to ignore this.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I saw your stepmother yesterday. 
                        Did she say anything?

                                 NINA
                        I didn’t see her. Why would she 
                        say anything?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        She wouldn’t say anything if you 
                        didn’t see her. 

                                 NINA
                        She talks to herself.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Being married to your father, she 
                        would have to talk to herself.

                                 NINA
                        What do you mean?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I mean, to get a word in 
                        edgeways.

                                 NINA
                        You don’t know anything about my 
                        father. You’ve read all his 
                        books, right?

           Slattery nods.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        You know nothing.

           INT.LEON’S OFFICE, MORNING

           Voice off screen of Amelia

                                 AMELIA
                        Timothy Seifert is on the phone.

                                 LEON
                        I don’t know any Timothy Seifert.

           Amelia walks in holding coffee for him.

                                 AMELIA
                        Your daughter’s psychiatrist. 
                        We’ve visited him several times?
                                 LEON
                        Put him through.

           She walks out feeling like a secretary.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Hello Mr.Seifer. Excuse me, 
                        Seifert. What can I do you for? 

           He holds the phone away from him.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Well that’s good to hear. Uh-huh. 
                        Uh-huh. Of course. If you think 
                        it would help her work through 
                        the...uh...grief. 

           He yells

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Amelia, are we free this friday 
                        at 4.30? We’re free. Good enough.

           He hangs up.

           INT.BOOKSTORE

           Slattery browses the art section, picking up a book on the 
           Guggenheim collection.

           INT.SLATTERY’S APT, EVE

           Book in hand, he walks in to find ansaphone blinking. One 
           message. He presses play and hears Juliet’s voice.

                                 JULIET
                        I got your letter. Um...Why? Why 
                        would I want to be friends? You 
                        don’t want to marry me. You don’t 
                        want to be my boyfriend. You 
                        don’t even want to fuck me. I’m 
                        over this Dennis. I’m over it. 
                        Jesus Christ, I can smell the pot 
                        through the ansaphone. I’m over 
                        this and I’m over you. You need 
                        to get help. Get help, Dennis. 
                        Look in the mirror. 

           He looks in the mirror, which, as it so happens, is hung 
           over the telephone. Eyes bloodshot. Skin sallow. He can’t 
           tear himself away. Then he starts to sneeze. At first an 
           “achoo”. And soon something quite uncontrollable, all the 
           while watching his reflection in horror and confusion.
           INT.NINA’S BEDROOM, NIGHT

           Leon walks in as Nina is falling asleep. 

                                 NINA
                        Have you ever heard of knocking?

                                 LEON
                        No. Is it like dadaism?

                                 NINA
                        What do you want?

                                 LEON
                        If I knew the answer to that I 
                        wouldn’t have to keep writing.

                                 NINA
                        (under her breath) You don’t have 
                        to keep writing.

                                 LEON
                        Hmm?

                                 NINA
                        You don’t HAVE to keep writing. 
                        You just keep writing the same 
                        book anyway.

                                 LEON
                        You’re probably right.

                                 NINA
                        Why are you being so nice?

                                 LEON
                        I feel bad that I never talked 
                        about your mother’s passing. 

                                 NINA
                        You did talk about it. In the 
                        novel.

                                 LEON
                        But not to you.

                                 NINA
                        No.

                                 LEON
                        Can I...can I try to make 
                        recompense?

                                 NINA
                        No.
           He nods, leaves, and closes the door. She cries herself to 
           sleep.

           INT.COACH

           Bus full of girls chattering on their way from Boston to 
           New York. Nina and Asia are near the back, sharing an ipod, 
           one earphone per person, listening and singing aloud to 
           ‘Umbrella’ by Rihanna.

                                 ASIA AND NINA
                        “ella-ella-ella!”

           At the head of the bus, Slattery allows himself a small 
           smile. Now and then he locks eyes with Nina.

           INT. LEON AND AMELIA’S BEDROOM, DAY

           Amelia is in her walk in closet.

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s time. Leon let’s go.

                                 LEON
                        Why are you getting all worried 
                        about what to wear? You think he 
                        cares?

                                 AMELIA
                        Patent heels or maryjanes?

                                 LEON
                        What are we going in to talk 
                        about your foot fetish? Or are we 
                        going in to talk about Nina?

                                 AMELIA
                        Useless fucking Nina! 

           She straightens herself.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        We’re going in to talk about 
                        Nina.

           INT.SHRINK’S

           They are seated on a cosy couch, too cosy. Leon looks 
           ridiculous sunk down into the cushions. He tries to re-
           arrange himself.

                        him and making him carry me and 
                        yet assure myself and others that 
                        I am very very sorry for him and

                        I’ll take your word for it. If 
                        ever there were anyone’s word to 
                        take.

                                 LEON
                        Good. 

                                 SHRINK
                        Have you had therapy Mr.Gross?

                                 LEON
                        Fourty years of it.

                                 SHRINK
                        So you had therapy when Mrs Gross 
                        passed away.

           Amelia shifts uncomfortably.

                                 LEON
                        No. No. I white knuckled it.

           He looks at his hands.

                                 SHRINK
                        Well, Nina seems to be white 
                        knuckling it, as you say, and she 
                        isn’t doing quite as well as I’d 
                        like. She’s not opening up to me. 
                        Of course it could be I’m the 
                        wrong person.

                                 LEON
                        Of course.

                                 SHRINK
                        But I felt before we came to that 
                        conclusion it would be worth my 
                        time talking to you.

                                 SHRINK
                        No. That would, obviously, breach 
                        the doctor/patient 
                        confidentiality agreement. About 
                        you. Both of you.
           Amelia shifts again.

                                                             CUT TO:

           Amelia emerges from the office teary eyed. Leon follows 
           behind, his face red with rage. On the way out they see 
           Zach in the waiting room. He looks horrified when he sees 
           her with Leon. Zach opens his mouth as if to talk to her. 
           She brushes past him. Leon stares at him, his pale, cut 
           arms. When they get outside he whispers

                                 LEON
                        Poor little freak.

           INT. OUTER NEW YORK COFFEE SHOP, LUNCH TIME.

           The girls are spread out, so it’s hard for the two teachers 
           to keep an eye on all of them. Slattery looks incredibly 
           nervous.

           INT.GUGGENHEIM

           As the groups of girls descend the curling ramp of the 
           museum, Nina hangs back so that she is always looking over 
           the balcony one floor at Slattery’s head. He senses he is 
           being looked at. He keeps looking at the painting in front 
           of him. Finally, he has to look up. She does not look away. 
           Calls down to him, so everyone hears and he blushes:

                                 NINA
                        Happy birthday.

           EXT.GUGGENHEIM

           Nina is outside smoking. She waits for the rest of the 
           girls to emerge. Asia sees how Nina looks at Slattery and 
           she can’t bear it. She has to loudly dress her down in 
           front of him.

                                 ASIA
                        Your tits look bigger. Are you 
                        stuffing your bra?

           Nina doesn’t answer, just stubs out her cigarette and 
           slowly moves her gaze from him to her. Asia instantly looks 
           ashamed.

           INT.HOWARD JOHNSON’S

           Nina and Asia pick a room together. Dressing for bed, Nina 
           looks at herself in the mirror as though psyching herself 
           up.
           Asia falls asleep with her arms around Nina.

                                 ASIA
                        I love you.

                                 NINA
                        I love you too.

           But when Asia is asleep, she creeps out from under her arms 
           and out into the hall, picking up her ipod on the way. She 
           opens the door of Mr.Slattery’s room.

           He is half asleep and wakes with a start.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        What are you doing?

                                 NINA
                        I can’t sleep. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Well, I can.

           She climbs onto the bed. He is under the covers, she over 
           them.

                                 NINA
                        Listen.

           He is pretty much frozen with fear. She puts one ear piece 
           in his ear and one in hers and they listen to Steely Dan. 
           He enjoys it then takes it out. Setting himself up he says

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        This isn’t going to help you get 
                        to sleep.

                                 NINA
                        You got any pot?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No!

                                 NINA
                        I think you do.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I think you need to go back to 
                        your room.

                                 NINA
                        I think, you need to not 
                        celebrate your thirtieth birthday 
                        alone.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        How did you know?
                                 NINA
                        I know everything.

           He blinks.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s not a big deal.

                                 NINA
                        Okay.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’ve never been so afraid in my 
                        life.

           She puts her hand on his.

                                 NINA
                        What are you afraid of?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        That I’ll never...

                                 NINA
                        I mean, I know thirty is the 
                        oldest you’ve ever been.

           She opens the bedside drawer, pulls out a bible and a half 
           smoked joint. She lights it up. Takes a drag.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll stay with you tonight so you 
                        don’t get scared.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        NO.

           She looks at him, straight in the eyes. 

                                 NINA
                        I’ve nothing much to offer.

           She waits a beat. He is so freaked out by her, he can 
           barely hear properly, let alone speak.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing much to take.

           She smiles.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        But I absolutely love you.

           He grimaces. She touches his hand.
                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        With eyes completely open. But 
                        nervous all the same.

           With her words, he is just floored by her. And as she gets 
           what she wants, as he moves towards her with a kiss, he 
           comes into sharp focus. Too sharp. To her own surprise, and 
           to his horror, she does not respond as he kisses her on the 
           mouth.

           She pulls away and kisses him on the cheek.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m so sorry. I’m confused. I’m 
                        so sorry I did that. What you 
                        said...

                                 NINA
                        Forget it.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Okay.

           She hops out of bed, goes back to her room, without looking 
           over her shoulder. 

           INT.NINA’S HOTEL ROOM

           Nina falls asleep in Asia’s arms. 

           INT.SLATTERY’S HOTEL ROOM

           He is up all night. 

           INT.NINA’S HOTEL ROOM

           When she and Asia wake up, Nina is rolled towards the wall. 
           Asia is spooning her. Without turning to face Asia the 
           first words out of her mouth are

                                 NINA
                        Did you make out with Zach after 
                        I left?

           Silence.

                                 ASIA
                        Yes.

                                 NINA
                        Was it fun?

                                 ASIA
                        No. It was sad.
           Asia starts to cry.

                                 ASIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be mad, Nina. The whole 
                        time I wished...I wished that he 
                        was...

           She turns to face Asia.

                                 NINA
                        Shhh. Shhh, don’t say it. You 
                        don’t need to say it.

           She strokes her hair.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        I love you as much as I can love 
                        you. And beyond that, there will 
                        be someone, someone very soon, 
                        who...

                                 ASIA
                        Let’s just go back to sleep.

                                 NINA
                        Okay, baby. Okay.

           INT.SLATTERY’S APT.

           He walks in, blood drained from face, and all but falls 
           into the “arms” of his cat at the door. He picks her up and 
           holds her tight to him. Almost immediately he starts 
           sneezing. He holds her away from him, aghast, searching her 
           whiskered face for clues. In his peripheral vision, he 
           sees, stacked in the corner, his vinyl collection. 
           Something makes him put down the cat, walk to the records, 
           and start flicking though. He flicks and flicks until he 
           gets to one (we don’t see yet what it is).

           He puts it on the turntable. First we hear the needle in 
           the grooves. Then we hear the start of the song, no words 
           yet. He picks up the needle, moves it forward, a look of 
           fear in his eyes. Then we hear it:

           “I’ve nothing much to offer/There’s nothing much to take/I 
           absolutely love you/With eyes completely open/But nervous 
           all the same”....

           It’s exactly what Nina said to him in the hotel room.

           We see the album cover in his hand: ‘Absolute Beginners’ by 
           David Bowie.

           He has to laugh out loud.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Little bitch!

           He sneezes.

           INT.DOCTOR’S OFFICE

           Slattery is slumped at the doctor’s desk as the doctor goes 
           over a set of results.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        How, all of a sudden is it 
                        possible to be allergic to the 
                        cat that I’ve had for twelve 
                        years? It doesn’t make sense.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, the only sense it, it’s 
                        just to do with ageing. Happens 
                        sometimes as you get older.

           He can’t quite take this in.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        As my cat is ageing?

                                 DOCTOR
                        No [confused by his confusion]. 
                        You. As you age.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        What can I do about it?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I can give you these pills to get 
                        you through as best as possible. 
                        But, honestly, I’d start looking 
                        for a good home for her. I love 
                        ‘em, I’d take her myself if we 
                        didn’t already have three. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I can’t give her away.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You don’t want her if you can’t, 
                        you know, engage with her. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP, LUNCHTIME

           Stricken, Slattery pops a pill from his prescription whilst 
           he waits for his coffee to be handed over. Amelia is at the 
           back. They see each other. Amelia has clearly been crying. 
           He doesn’t want to see her but she wants to talk to him. 
           She walks towards him as he swallows his pill, and clutches 
           his arms as if she’s going to faint. Just managing not to 
           gag, he is polite as he can be but very much wants to get 
           away, especially when he hears her opening line.

                                 AMELIA
                        How was the New York trip?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        [nervous...what has she heard?] 
                        It was good.

                                 AMELIA
                        I fucked that kid up.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        [relieved it’s not about him] I 
                        don’t think she’s that fucked up. 
                        I really don’t. And if she is, it 
                        isn’t because of you.

                                 AMELIA
                        You don’t understand.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t understand.

           He sneezes.

                                 AMELIA
                        Go, now.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Okay.

           The paper coffee cup is handed to him and he backs away. 
           She is alone. Camera pans down and we see that Joel clings 
           silently to her knee, calm for the first time. She closes 
           her eyes, momentarily soothed. Then the din of the coffee 
           shop comes back to her, and she gulps back tears.

           INT.MR SLATTERY’S APT, LATE NIGHT

           He is sadly posting a notice on a cat web forum, with the 
           offender curled adoringly in his lap, as his eyes burn:

           LOVING HOME WANTED FOR WORLD’S BEST CAT

                                                             CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, LATE NIGHT

           Nina, hair in braids, in cherry print pyjamas, on her 
           princess phone, laying on the floor of her bedroom. As 
           young as she’s ever looked. 
           Slattery’s phone rings as he looks sadly at his cat notice.

                                 NINA
                        Mr.Slattery? It’s Nina.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s late.

           In every sense.

                                 NINA
                        I know. Are you working on your 
                        book?

           He looks at the forum page and lies, such tenderness for 
           her, so eager to say “yes” to anything she wants.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes.

                                 NINA
                        Mr.Slattery. The version I’ve 
                        read...as it stands...is not 
                        good.

           Knife. Through. His. Heart.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Not good?

                                 NINA
                        No. It’s quite bad. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Why?

                                 NINA
                        It’s shallow, and rather 
                        unfocused.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No. Why? Why are you telling me 
                        this now?

                                 NINA
                        Because you asked me and...

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s not because of the kiss?

                                 NINA
                        ...and, I’m ready to tell you 
                        now. It just reads as insane. Do 
                        you know what the definition of 
                        insanity is?
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I think so.

                                 NINA
                        It’s the inability to connect to 
                        another human being and the 
                        inability to love another human 
                        being. Have you loved another 
                        human? Not fallen in love, but 
                        loved them? They’re different, 
                        Mr.Slattery. From the book, it 
                        seems as if you never have. I 
                        don’t mean to be unkind.

           He is silent.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever lost someone close 
                        to you?

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        Not in my immediate family...

                                 NINA
                        That’s not what bereavement feels 
                        like either. I don’t know why you 
                        wrote about it. 

           She puts the phone to her chest a moment as a tear rolls 
           down her cheek. The other end of the wire, he knows that 
           tear is there and he wants so badly to hold her, it erases 
           his own hurt. Instead he says:

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        Juliet thought I was a brilliant 
                        writer.

           Nina sucks back her tears, wipes her face with her sleeve.

                                 NINA
                        With all due respect, 
                        Mr.Slattery, Juliet is only 
                        twenty-three. What the fuck does 
                        she know?

           He smiles. He has to. She’s so mad. And so lost. And so 
           lovely.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Thank you for reading it. 

           A thought occurs...

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll definitely not show it to 
                        your father?
                                 NINA
                        Why would I do that? I don’t tell 
                        him anything.

           He never would have met him, anyway.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Okay.

                                 NINA
                        Okay, Mr.Slattery. Good night.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Night....

           He hangs up the receiver gently before finishing his 
           sentence:

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        ...love.

           INT.SLATTERY’S APT.

           An incredibly kind looking middle aged woman coaxes the cat 
           into a carrier case as Slattery watches from the edge of 
           the doorway.

                                 KIND WOMAN
                        There you are my angel, off to 
                        your new house. Daddy can visit 
                        any time he likes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I can’t bear it. I just have to 
                        walk away.

                                 KIND WOMAN
                        But...

           He calls from the other room:

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Please just take her.

           INT.SLATTERY’S APT.

           He drinks a glass of whisky as he dangles a scratched cat 
           toy from his other hand. Something crosses his face. He 
           puts down the toy, and the drink. He goes to his desk 
           drawer and rummages to the bottom. And there, beneath his 
           college thesis, he finds his first edition, original and 
           well thumbed copy of ‘Everything Must Go’ by Leon Gross.
           EXT, GROSS HOME, LUNCH TIME

           Slattery walks up the winding path, step in front of step, 
           letting his eyes close from time to time as though 
           meditating on what he’s about to do, ‘Everything Must Go’ 
           in hand. He stands on the doorstep for a very long time 
           before ringing the bell. No-one answers and he is about to 
           walk away when Leon opens the door looking as though he’s 
           been awakened.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Mr.Gross?

           He sees the book in his hand and eyes the stranger warily.

                                 LEON
                        Yes?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m Nina’s teacher.

                                 LEON
                        Uh-huh.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Have I woken you?

                                 LEON
                        Yes you did.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m very sorry.

                                 LEON
                        You don’t sound very sorry.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Well, I’m quite sorry. May I come 
                        in?

                                 LEON
                        You may. 

           He leads him through the grand entrance and opulent living 
           room in to his office. Slattery has dreamed of seeing this 
           since he was a teenager. He looks like he’s in Disney 
           world. Leon’s computer is on and this he eyes as though it 
           were kryptonite.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Oh my God. Were you writing?

                                 LEON
                        Yes. I’m a writer.

           Slattery tries to compose himself.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’m the one she gave the book to.

           No response.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        It was a great book.

                                 LEON
                        The New Yorker doesn’t seem to 
                        think so.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        The New Yorker can go fuck 
                        itself.

           Nerves. But it makes Leon smile.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        You write every day?

                                 LEON
                        As I said, I’m a writer. This is 
                        a good time to do it. My wife is 
                        out with my son and my daughter 
                        is out with her anger. I assume 
                        that’s what you’ve come to talk 
                        about.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Actually, she’s in Philosophy 
                        right now. At which she excels. 
                        Unlike English. She could be 
                        brilliant at it. But the shadow, 
                        I imagine, is very hard to 
                        escape. So she doesn’t try at 
                        all.

           He notices, on the shelves, Leon’s dozens of books, printed 
           in every conceivable language. His facade collapses.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        I used to stand outside your 
                        house when I was in college, 
                        hoping to see you. You’re the 
                        last great American writer. 

                                 LEON
                        Oh dear. What will happen when I 
                        die?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t know. I don’t know. I’ve 
                        wondered that. I jerked off to 
                        your first novel.

           Nerves again. He wants to kick himself.
                                 LEON
                        I don’t know how to take that. 

           He frowns.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps we’d better sit down.

           He motions to the couch which is really more of a love 
           seat. They sit uncomfortably close as though one is a 
           teenager summoning up the courage to make a move on the 
           other. Silence and twiddled thumbs as Leon waits for 
           Slattery to speak.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Do you think an artist has to be 
                        a good person? I mean do you 
                        think it matters that James Brown 
                        was a wife beater? 

                                 LEON
                        An artist creates their own moral 
                        universe.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But what if you’re not an artist? 
                        What if you’re just an ordinary 
                        person?

                                 LEON
                        Are you an ordinary person? You 
                        don’t seem like one.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And if I’m not an ordinary 
                        person? And our two worlds 
                        collide? And your ambiguous moral 
                        universe over-laps with mine? Say 
                        I was connected to your daughter?

                                 LEON
                        You are sleeping with my 
                        daughter?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        God no! No! She’s a young girl! 
                        I’m an old man.

           Leon raises his bushy eyebrows. The camera sees Leon’s age, 
           the pores in his skin, his grey whiskers, his shaking 
           hands. And it picks up Slattery’s vibrance in a way it 
           hasn’t before.
                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        No. I said “connected”. Your 
                        second book, ‘Reckonings’, 
                        weirdly enough it kind of 
                        parallels my feelings. When I say 
                        “connected”, I speak, of course, 
                        of love.

                                 LEON
                        Of course.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t know what to do. Can you 
                        help me?

                                 LEON
                        This is a most unusual request, 
                        you understand?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I understand.

                                 LEON
                        Are you drunk?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes, yes I am.

                                 LEON
                        Are you a drunkard?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No sir, not at all. I’m actually 
                        a stoner. My girlfriend thinks 
                        so.

           Leon raises his eyebrows.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        My ex-girlfriend. [awkward beat] 
                        Sign my book?

           Leon signs without looking at it.

                                 LEON
                        Mr.Slattery, I understand you are 
                        enamoured of my work. Did you 
                        ever want to be a writer?

           Slattery looks at the signature.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Wow. Scribbly. 

           He looks up.
                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Yes. I write. I am a writer. I 
                        wrote a book. Your daughter 
                        thinks it’s bad. So I’m going to 
                        stop now. I wouldn’t want to be 
                        anything other than a great 
                        writer. But I would also like to 
                        be a good person.

                                 LEON
                        Not all of them are like me.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You know what you are? 

                                 LEON 
                        I’ve read the books. Sometimes, 
                        when I can’t sleep, I creep down 
                        here and read them translated 
                        into French.

           Slattery nods, as though taking tea with a vicar.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        In French and Spanish. In Spanish 
                        I’m really quite sympathetic. 

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Nina’s very gifted.

                                 LEON
                        She’s troubled. It’s different. 
                        These qualities are easily 
                        confused in our culture.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        She is not so troubled. And she 
                        is very gifted. She’s 
                        extraordinarily compassionate. 
                        But you read that as troubled?

                                 LEON
                        She makes her life harder than it 
                        need be.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Sir, her life has not been easy.

                                 LEON
                        I went through it too.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You wrote through it. All she 
                        could do was live through it.

                                 LEON
                        That was my wife.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        That was her mother. God, what’s 
                        wrong with you?

           A key is heard in the door. It is Nina home early from 
           school. Slattery, bounces up off the sofa gets and makes 
           his way out as fast as possible, turning abruptly like a 
           negligent party guest.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Uh, yeah: thanks for having me.

                                 NINA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I was just leaving.

           He is out the door in a trice. Nina storms into her 
           father’s office, where he sits looking a little dazed. 

                                 NINA
                        What did he want?

           Leon lies.

                                 LEON
                        He thinks you’re very gifted. He 
                        wants you to apply for the 
                        creative writing program at Yale. 
                        He says, in fact, you can go 
                        anywhere you want.

                                 NINA
                        Really?

           She sinks down into the place Slattery just vacated.

                                 LEON
                        Yes. Really. I’m very proud of 
                        you.

           A thought crosses her mind.

                                 NINA
                        Dad. He was drunk. I could smell 
                        it.

                                 LEON
                        So what are ya gonna do?

           He holds his arms out to her, pulls her onto his lap and 
           they hug.
           INT.SLATTERY’S

           He goes into his bedroom and flops onto the bed in his 
           clothes. The cat litter tray makes him squeeze his eyes to 
           keep from crying. But that’s not what he’s really crying 
           about.

           INT.LEON’S BEDROOM, NIGHT.

           Amelia lays beside Leon, staring at the ceiling.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ve got to go.

                                 LEON
                        I know.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’m taking Joel.

           He nods.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll let me go?

           He nods. They kiss.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        Sleep tight.

           When she wakes up the next morning the bed is empty. He is 
           already in his study. The door is closed. She goes and 
           stands next to it with a cup of coffee and listens to the 
           clacking of his typewriter. She lays a hand on the door, 
           and decides to leave him be. Unbeknownst to her it is in 
           fact Nina behind the door clacking away. Then she notices 
           the car and Joel are gone. She runs back to the room.

                                 AMELIA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                        I’m...

                                 AMELIA
                        Where’s Joel?

                                 NINA
                        Dad took him out for breakfast.

                                 AMELIA
                        Where did they go?

                                 NINA
                        Where do they always go?
                                 AMELIA
                        WHERE do they always go?!

                        I want sausages!

           Amelia jumps into her car, her hair wet and races there. 
           She walks in to find them paying the check. She’s huffing 
           and puffing.

                                 AMELIA
                        What’s going on?

                                 LEON
                        We had breakfast. And I explained 
                        the situation.

           Joel is snuggled against him.

                                 JOEL

                        No he’s not. He’s insecure and he 
                        married too soon. He never got 
                        over his first and greatest love. 
                        Nor should he.

                                 JOEL
                        He’s an asshole. He said so.

           She gives up. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Then it must be true.

           INT.AU BON PAIN, AFTERNOON

           The scene of their excruciating tea with Harvard girl. Now 
           it is just Nina and Leon, silent, comfortable. 

                                 NINA
                        Daddy, did you have a muse?
                                 LEON
                        Your mother. For a time.

                                 NINA
                        What happened?

                                 LEON
                        I grew to love her. You don’t 
                        write about people you love. As 
                        Muriel Spark said “Love is not 
                        the opposite of hate. The 
                        opposite of hate is 
                        indifference.”

                                 NINA
                        Where did she write that?

                                 LEON
                        Oh, no she said it. To me.

                                 NINA
                        Oh.

           Pause.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        That’s bullshit.

                                 LEON
                        Well, it is and it isn’t.

                                 NINA
                        How? How can it be both?

                                 LEON
                        Because life is full of grey 
                        areas.

           She stares intently at her croissant.

                                 NINA
                        Well, it is and it isn’t.

                                 LEON
                        Are you having an affair with 
                        your English teacher?

           Girlish outrage.

                                 NINA
                        No!

           He is non-plussed.

                                 LEON
                        But you thought about it.
                                 NINA
                        No! I mean, no. For a minute 
                        there, perhaps. Yes I did. I 
                        think about him. But I’m not 
                        going to do anything.

                                 LEON
                        He seems to care about you very 
                        much. Besides...you’re going to 
                        be seventeen in two weeks. He’s 
                        not old enough to be your father. 

                                 NINA
                        When you told me what he said, 
                        that I was good enough to apply 
                        for that writing program... 

                                 LEON
                        But I could have told you that...

                                 NINA
                        But it doesn’t mean anything from 
                        you.

           Irony not lost on them.

                                 LEON
                        I see.

                                 NINA
                        You do?

                                 LEON
                        Sort of.

                                 NINA
                        I mean...you’re my dad. And 
                        besides...your novels, dad, 
                        they’re just not my kind of 
                        thing.

           She looks up nervously from where she has been ripping a 
           napkin to shreds.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Is that okay?

                                 LEON
                        Of course it’s okay.

           Silent tea drinking as each reflects on what has been said.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        So what about this Slattery? He’s 
                        got himself pretty fucked up over 
                        you. You have to let old men down 
                        gently.
                                 NINA
                        Don’t worry, dad. He’s a 
                        gentleman. I’ll figure it out.

                                 LEON
                        You could always just graduate 
                        and see where it goes.

           She raises her eyebrows. He raises them back.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Life is 
                        very...fucking...sad...and you 
                        have seen more than most your 
                        age. If he would distract you 
                        from that, for a long time, or a 
                        little while, then he’s okay by 
                        me.

           It’s the closest Leon will ever come to talking about his 
           wife’s death.

           INT.SCHOOL, MORNING

           Nina walks trepidously into the photocopying room. Slattery 
           looks up, a mess.

                                 NINA
                        Mr. Slattery. Would it be 
                        possible for you to meet me on 
                        the lacrosse field tonight, at 
                        9pm?

           Terrified, he chokes out the answer.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yes.

           EXT.LACROSSE FIELD, NIGHT.

           Slattery and Nina are laying side by side on the lacrosse 
           field at night. Stars in the sky. Moon bountiful and 
           bright. He has his head on Leon Gross’ novel.

                                 NINA
                        My father says it’s okay. You and 
                        me.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But it’s not okay. Not with me. 
                        It’s totally inappropriate. It’s 
                        wrong. I would never do it and 
                        it’s driving me crazy. 

           She kisses him. She isn’t scared this time. He’s terrified.
                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what you want from 
                        me? 

                                 NINA
                        Really? You really don’t know? 
                        It’s easy. I wanted to be 
                        admired. By someone I admire.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But it doesn’t make sense...I’m 
                        nothing. I’m a shitty English 
                        teacher in a shitty all girl’s 
                        prep school and I wrote half a 
                        book you think is shit. You have 
                        your father...

                                 NINA
                        It’s not the same. For you, but 
                        not for me. The other half of the 
                        book may come out brilliant, 
                        anyway. Old Juliet might be right 
                        about your talent.

           He sits upright.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I admire you. I mean, you want me 
                        to tell you you’re pretty? You’re 
                        pretty. You didn’t have to try 
                        and sleep with me for that. 

                                 NINA
                        Did I try and sleep with you?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I don’t know. I think so. I’m not 
                        sure.

                                 NINA
                        I think that I did.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yeah. You did.

                                 NINA
                        Did you want to?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yeah. I did. Does that make me a 
                        bad person?

                                 NINA
                        I’m not sure. 

           Breath.
                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Mr.Slattery, I think you should 
                        try and smoke less pot. I think 
                        it’s screwing up any writing 
                        skill you do have. I think it’s 
                        why your book is so unfocused.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I know.

                                 NINA
                        I think that you’re a really good 
                        teacher.

           He laser focuses on her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        You do?

           He seems excited by this, as if he’d never thought of it 
           before.

                                 NINA
                        Yeah. You’re good at it. Not just 
                        with the popular ones. You see us 
                        all. That’s all I was waiting 
                        for. Was to be seen. Not every 
                        teacher is like that. You’ve been 
                        a gift. Why? Don’t you like 
                        teaching?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Yeah. I do. But it’s not what I 
                        meant to be.

                                 NINA
                        I don’t think we get to pick what 
                        it is that we’re good at. The 
                        teacher you replaced, by the way, 
                        was awful.

                                 MR.SLATTERY 
                        I like teaching. That’s weird. I 
                        never thought of it before you 
                        said it.

           A thought clouds his face.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        And...you know I really don’t 
                        like teenage girls. Juliet was 
                        twenty-three.

                                 NINA
                        You said.
                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        And she was all wrong for me. 

                                 NINA
                        Not many women would be right for 
                        you. If I leave when I graduate 
                        and never come back to you, will 
                        you get over it?

           He laughs. Not mean. Just feeling utterly ridiculous, out 
           on a lacrosse field with a sixteen year old girl, baring 
           his soul.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I’d like to think so.

                                 NINA
                        Good. I want you to. I want you 
                        to be happy.

           She rolls over onto her stomach. He looks at the Hebrew 
           tattoo he had asked about before.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        It’s for your mother, you said? 
                        What does it say?

                                 NINA
                        It isn’t for my mother. It’s to 
                        piss off my father. I did it 
                        after she died but it doesn’t say 
                        anything. I mean, it may say 
                        something. I just wanted someone 
                        to put needles in me. I found the 
                        writing on the back of a box of 
                        stale matzoh.

           He puts his hand on her back.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        This has been declared kosher.

           He looks at her.

                                 MR.SLATTERY (CONT’D)
                        Come here to me.

           She snuggles up against him. He puts his arm around her, 
           totally true in affection, lack of sleaze and real 
           friendship, whatever else becomes of them. He holds Leon’s 
           book in other hand and starts to read the back copy.

                                 NINA
                        I have a secret.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Mmm-hmm.
                                 NINA
                        You know Andy? The older guy I 
                        told you about? I never slept 
                        with him. I got scared.

           They stare at the moon.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        I have a secret.

                                 NINA
                        Yes.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        Your father’s new book...it 
                        wasn’t that good. Not as bad as 
                        mine. But it wasn’t good. 

                                 NINA
                        It wasn’t?

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        No.

           She smiles.

                                 NINA
                        You’re not just saying that?

           He shakes his head.

                                 MR.SLATTERY
                        But, you know, when I met him, 
                        when I finally met him, I liked 
                        him. I thought he would 
                        disappoint me, that he would have 
                        to. The old man surprised me.

                                 NINA
                        He’s really not a bad guy.

           Slattery puts the book aside, takes a deep breath and says

                        You know what’s great about your 
                        father?

           Without missing a beat...

                                 NINA
                        Yes.

           She draws her hand around in front of her and blocks out 
           the moon with her palm. Screen falls dark.

           THE END
