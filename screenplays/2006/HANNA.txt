           EXT. FOREST FLOOR. DAY.

           Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Soft snow falls. Then 
           the sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person 
           running.

           HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, glides through the 
           trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She is dressed in 
           animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost completely 
           into the landscape of trees and snow.

           She stops dead. Her breath visible in the icy air.

           Her eyes are suddenly alert. She has spotted something. We 
           see what it is. A REINDEER nuzzling the snow, trying to 
           unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head pops up - danger. 
           Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of an arrow 
           piercing its skin.

           The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its 
           feet dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws the icy air. Steam 
           pouring from its nostrils.

           HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She pats the animal. 
           Looks at it quizzically. She speaks in English but in a 
           very soft Germanic accent.

                                 HANNA
                        I just missed your heart.

           Then pulls out an old pistol and shoots it in the head.

           EXT. FOREST FLOOR. LATER.

           A knife enters the deer near the anus and HANNA’s hand 
           pulls out the internal organs - stomach, intestine. She 
           cuts off the scrotum, penis. She works calmly, without 
           expression. 

           HANNA suddenly twitches. Senses danger. Turns. To find 
           ERIK, a forty five year old man staring at her. Dressed in 
           skins, beard, wild face, weather-beaten, tough. He speaks 
           in a soft Germanic accent.

                                 ERIK
                        Too late. 

           HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings 
           her fist right to ERIK’s face. He blocks and thumps an open 
           palm on to HANNA’s shoulder sending her sprawling into the 
           snow.

           She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She 
           dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her 
           pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away and pins her to the 
           ground. 
           HANNA smashes her knee into his stomach, then grabs his 
           neck, wrapping her arms around it, preparing to snap. Then 
           she relaxes as ERIK turns to her.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Better. But I’ve already killed 
                        you. You don’t get a second 
                        chance.

           She releases, and ERIK stands, looks at the deer.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Clear up and bring it back.

           He walks into the forest. 

           EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN. LATER.

           HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on 
           to a stick. No sign she was ever there.

           EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN. LATER.

           HANNA drags the 200lb deer on a makeshift sled. She walks 
           steadily, with purpose.

           Now we see ERIK amongst the trees watching her, observing 
           her strength.

           EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. EVENING

           An ancient log cabin in the thick forest. HANNA is standing 
           in the snow, stripping the deer with a knife. It’s a tough 
           job but she does it no fuss. She hangs the meat in a small 
           wooden smoke house beside the log cabin.

           INT. LOG CABIN. EVENING.

           An oak table. Lit by kerosene lamps. Very cold and HANNA 
           and ERIK sit in furs and eat soup. HANNA feels her arm as 
           she eats. ERIK notices.

                                 ERIK
                        Are you hurt?

           HANNA shakes her head - bravely but it’s a lie.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        I was standing behind you for 
                        three seconds. It’s too long.

                                 HANNA
                        I’ll do better next time.
                                 ERIK
                        German.

                                 HANNA (IN GERMAN)
                        I’ll do better next time.

                                 ERIK 
                        Spanish

                                 HANNA (IN SPANISH)
                        I’ll do better next time.

           ERIK nods. HANNA smiles slightly - pleased but hiding it. 
           He starts the next game. It’s playful but with intent.

                                 ERIK
                        Four American football teams.

                                 HANNA
                        Minnesota Vikings, Los Angeles 
                        Raiders, New York Giants, 
                        Pittsburg Steelers.

                                 ERIK 
                        Top three best bands ever?

                                 HANNA
                        David Bowie, Beatles, Ramones.

           ERIK smiles. HANNA smiles back in the warm glow of the 
           lamp. An intimate moment.

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

           HANNA expectant slightly. Eyes wide.

                                 ERIK
                        Nothing. Eat your soup.

                                 HANNA
                        I’ve eaten. May I go to sleep?

           ERIK nods. She leaves the dining area and enters her room. 
           He watches her as she slides into a rough wooden bed and 
           covers herself in furs.

           HANNA lies there, looking at the ceiling. Silently, under 
           her bed-clothes she takes out a small metal nail and carves 
           a dash into the wooden wall. There are thousands of such 
           lines all over the wall. She stares at the wall.

           In the dining area, ERIK sits at the table, thinks. He 
           stares at HANNA sleeping in the room.
           EXT. LOG CABIN. DAWN.

           HANNA watches ERIK as he walks off into the forest. He 
           raises a hand as he goes without looking back.

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. DAY.

           HANNA stands under the canopy. Listening for an animal’s 
           movements, bow in hand.

           Then she hears a different sound. An aeroplane overhead. 
           She tries to see it through the trees. But cannot and it 
           fades away. She returns to focus on the animal she is 
           hunting and starts to sprint. She is sprinting faster and 
           faster through the trees. She is busting a gut and her face 
           has a determination that is close to desperation.

           She suddenly stops. Red marks on a tree. Then on others. 
           Red marks, painted on with blood, form a perimeter fence. 
           The animal has gone beyond it. Looks at her. HANNA looks at 
           it, resigned, then turns back the way she came.

           EXT. LOG CABIN. DUSK.

           HANNA stands cooking soup and watches as ERIK HELLER 
           returns through the forest with a dead animal. He comes and 
           sits by the cabin.

                                 HANNA
                        Where do you go each time?

                                 ERIK
                        Just hunting.

           He sits to eat his soup. HANNA stares at him. Does she 
           believe him?

           INT. CABIN. LIVING ROOM/ 

           Dark outside and only dim light in the cabin as HANNA 
           washes the dishes in a bucket of water. She watches her 
           father as he sits outside the cabin. 

           INT. HANNA’S ROOM. NIGHT.

           ERIK is telling HANNA a story from a small old book as he 
           sits at her bedside. ERIK’s soft Germanic accent lends the 
           story a strange mystery. 
                                 ERIK
                        The poor child was now all alone 
                        in the vast forest, She was so 
                        frightened that she just stared 
                        at all the leaves on the trees 
                        and had no idea where to turn. 
                        She started running. Wild beasts 
                        hovered round her but did her no 
                        harm. She raced over sharp stones 
                        and through thorn bushes until at 
                        last night fell and she 
                        discovered a little cottage and 
                        went inside to rest.

           ERIK stops. He kisses her head, gets up and leaves her 
           room.

           HANNA slides deeper under the bedclothes and scratches 
           another line in the wall.

           INT. CABIN DINING AREA. NIGHT.

           ERIK watches to check HANNA is asleep then turns and walks 
           into the Log Smoking Room. He closes the door.

           EXT. CABIN - SHOOTING RANGE -- DAY

           A GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart. 

           Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and 
           fires.

           She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.

           ERIK watching.

           EXT. CABIN - NORTH SWEDEN -- DAY

           A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin 
           acts as a chin-up bar. 

           Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give 
           up. ERIK observing HANNA’s power. Both have the sense that 
           he is judging her. HANNA’s face fiercely determined.

           EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN.

           ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge 
           forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of 
           the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.
                                 HANNA
                        I live in Leipzig. German city. 
                        Population 0.7 Million people. We 
                        live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz.
                        I go to school at the Klaus Kohle
                        Gymnasium and my best friends are 
                        Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I 
                        like literature and sport, in 
                        particular tennis and athletics. 
                        I have a dog called Trudi. She 
                        always shits on the carpet.

           ERIK looks askance at her. HANNA giggles. She added that 
           for fun. Just that tiny hint of rebellion surfacing in her 
           mischievous smile.

           EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN.

           ERIK plunges HANNA’s head into a bucket of water. He keeps 
           his hand on her head. The seconds pass. Longer and longer. 
           He looks at his watch. Still he does not release.

           EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN.

           HANNA, wet hair, is looking at ERIK watching her in the 
           middle of the forest. Suddenly she throws her voice.

                                 HANNA 
                        I’m over here.

           Then back to herself but with a different voice, older, 
           deeper.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        No I’m here.

           Throws her voice again, her normal voice.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        No over here.

           ERIK nods. Then HANNA, slightly bored, suddenly shouts.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m here. I’m here! I’m here!

           Top of the lungs. Her voice echoing in the tall trees of 
           the endless forest. But her eyes dark with the odd 
           disquieting knowledge that however loud she shouts, 
           absolutely no one can hear her.
           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST.

           HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost 
           anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - RIVER. DAY.

           HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the 
           fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay 
           still. They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their 
           lungs bursting.

                                 ERIK
                        Don’t give up! Don’t give up!

           HANNA’s arms burst as she fights against the stream and she 
           screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and 
           is pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in 
           darkness but ERIK’s hand pulls her back up and she breaks 
           the surface with a gasp of relief. 

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK.

           On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but, 
           moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.

                                 HANNA
                        I didn’t need your help.

           Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares 
           after her.

           HANNA walks and walks, full of anger, until she reaches the 
           trees marked with red paint. Looks at them. Thinks about 
           running through them, bursting through the forbidden zone. 
           She approaches one of the trees. Puts her head against the 
           paint. 

           INT. CABIN. HANNA’S ROOM. NIGHT.

           ERIK telling more of the story from the small book to HANNA 
           under the covers. But HANNA is only half listening. Other 
           thoughts preoccupy her. 

                                 ERIK
                        The queen was so terrified that 
                        she just stood there and couldn’t 
                        move an inch. Iron slippers had 
                        already been heated up for her 
                        over a fire of coals. They were 
                        brought in with tongs and set up 
                        right in front of her. She had 
                        to...
           ERIK pauses. Stares at HANNA.

                                 HANNA
                        What is it?

                                 ERIK
                        These stories are too young for 
                        you now.

           And he just closes the book and leaves the room. HANNA 
           stares after him confused.

                                 ERIK (CONT'D)
                        Good night.

           Outside in the main room, ERIK stands alone, thinking.

           INT. CABIN. HANNA’S ROOM. NIGHT.

           HANNA is asleep. Another line is carved on the wall.

           ERIK enters the room. HANNA sleeping. ERIK approaches the 
           bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and aims it at HANNA. 
           He is tense with expectation.

           Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol 
           from ERIK’s hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She 
           grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert, 
           eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.

                                 HANNA
                        I told you I’d do better.

           ERIK nods, relaxes. It’s a false beat. Then he suddenly 
           lunges again at her, really violently, seeming really to be 
           trying to hurt her. But HANNA is ready. She has reached 
           under her mattress and there is a knife - in an instant it 
           is at ERIK’s neck. She pricks his neck slightly. It bleeds 
           just slightly. Stillness and silence. HANNA breathless, 
           angry.

                                 ERIK
                        You didn’t tell me you had a 
                        knife.

                                 HANNA
                        You told me to think for myself. 
                        Isn’t that what you want? 

           She angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just 
           stares at her. 
           INT. CABIN DINING AREA. DAWN.

           HANNA is drinking hot milk as morning light filters through 
           the door. ERIK enters, HANNA does not look up.

                                 HANNA
                        We need more wood. I’ll sharpen 
                        the axe.

           HANNA looks up. ERIK is in a suit. It’s dated and with a 
           strong Eastern European feel, grey, simple, severe. A touch 
           of the old communism, of the Party. ERIK has shaved. He is 
           unrecognisable. HANNA stares at him, her eyes slightly 
           glistening. This is a huge moment between them.

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        I thought it was many years away.

                                 ERIK
                        That was to stop you hoping.

           HANNA stands slowly and follows ERIK to the Log Smoking 
           Room. She is still in shock. ERIK clears some logs. Behind 
           them is a large cupboard door, locked. He unlocks it with a 
           key. 

           ERIK opens it and HANNA looks inside. ERIK climbs behind a 
           mass of newspapers. HANNA stares in shock at the 
           newspapers. They reach back for years. One a month. 1st 
           December, 1st November, 1st October. All are Berliner 
           Zeitungs. Photographs of politicians, sportsman, events. 
           The real world. HANNA has never seen them before.

           HANNA’s eyes focus on a recent newspaper. A headline: “Bank 
           collapse signals global crisis”. 

           Her eyes flick across at ERIK who is reaching to pick up a 
           small tracking device. He slowly gives it to her.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        Give me until dusk then turn this 
                        on. They’ll come for you.

                                 HANNA
                        I want to come with you.

           ERIK shakes his head.

                                 ERIK
                        I need you to do this, you’re the 
                        only who can. You remember 
                        everything?

           HANNA nods. 
                                 HANNA
                        Marissa Wiegler.

                                 ERIK
                        And then?

                                 HANNA
                        Photograph and postcard.

                                 ERIK
                        Then?

                                 HANNA 
                        Get to Berlin. Meet you at 
                        Wilhelm’s house.

           ERIK nods. HANNA looks attentive, just a little scared. 
           ERIK looks at her with kindness, but can’t hide the fact 
           that he is slightly troubled. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           He smiles comfortingly.

                                 ERIK
                        Nothing. Nothing at all.

           ERIK turns to go. HANNA suddenly holds him, animal-like 
           burying her face in his chest.

           ERIK delicately cups her face in his hands and looks at her 
           reassuringly. 

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        You showed me. You are ready.

           He hugs her but over his shoulder we see a tension that 
           belies his reassuring tone. Then he turns and walks into 
           the forest. HANNA stares after him. 

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. DAY.

           HANNA alone in the forest. She sits on a tree stump 
           watching a bird feed its young in a tree. Early spring 
           flowers creep through the snow. Hanna alone. She feels the 
           quiet. She turns suddenly. No one there.

           EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. EVENING

           HANNA stares at the tracking device. It is CIA standard 
           issue. She looks round at her world - the trees, the snow. 
           Eerie silence. Still and beautiful. 
                                 HANNA
                        Marissa Wiegler.

           She turns on the tracking device.

           INT. CIA EUROPEAN OPERATIONAL HQ. DAY.

           A large, modern, open-plan room of desks, all with CIA 
           officers sitting, staring at screens or on the telephone. A 
           young CIA OFFICER sees a pop-up flash on to his computer 
           screen. He stares in surprise

                                 CIA OFFICER
                        What the...

           He walks fast across to a private office where WILLIS, 35, 
           American and suited, is on the phone.

                                 CIA OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Sir, you should see this.

                                 WILLIS
                        Jack I have to call you back.

           WILLIS hangs up, and walks with the OFFICER across to his 
           desk.

                                 CIA OFFICER 
                        We’re picking up a satellite 
                        signal from one of our tracking 
                        devices.

                                 WILLIS
                        Where’s it coming from?

                                 CIA OFFICER
                        The middle of the North Swedish 
                        Forest, one hundred and twenty 
                        miles North West of Jokmokk.
                        Moose and reindeer country. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Whose signal is it?

                                 CIA OFFICER
                        That’s the thing. It has none of 
                        our current coding.

                                 WILLIS 
                        Why not?

                                 CIA OFFICER
                        It looks to me like old stock. 
                        Whoever’s talking to us has got 
                        to be using kit that’s fifteen 
                        years old.
                                 WILLIS
                        So look up the old codes.

                                 CIA OFFICER
                        I don’t have access sir.

           WILLIS goes on to the computer and logs on. He uses an 
           access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the 
           tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER. 

                                 CIA OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Erik Heller.

                                 WILLIS 
                        I thought he was dead.

           He clicks on a link. HELLER’s file comes up. HELLER’s face 
           pops on to the screen, but as a younger man. 14 years ago. 
           East German look and feel. Under his name: COVERT AGENT 
           1991-95. MISSING. 

           WILLIS clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes 
           on to the screen: The headline: MAN KILLS GIRLFRIEND AND 
           DISAPPEARS. A picture of Heller in the article and a 
           smashed car on a rural road. The two men stare at his face.

           EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. EVENING

           Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As 
           peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of 
           impending night on the snow.

           HANNA is climbing out of the back window of the cabin, her 
           feet in ERIK’s huge boots. She then walks very deliberately 
           across the snow, checking that she is leaving the print of 
           his boots in the snow. She reaches the red perimeter marks. 
           With a secret grin of pleasure, she carries on beyond the 
           red marks, until she reaches the deep undergrowth. Then she 
           stops, takes off the boots, and climbing into a tree, 
           begins the journey back to the cabin above the ground.

           EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT.

           Fifty US Special Forces are leaping out of helicopters on 
           the fringe of the forest. 

           WILLIS is one of them. He greets the HEAD of SPECIAL OPS 
           and they walk together as they talk.

                                 HEAD OF OPS
                        Is this guy one of ours? 
                                 WILLIS
                        Used to be. Tread carefully, he’s 
                        been in there a long time, he’s 
                        damaged goods, and he knows we’re 
                        coming.

           EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT.

           HANNA sits outside the cabin. She listens to the night. 
           Suddenly her ears prick though we hear nothing. Instantly 
           she goes inside the cabin, turns the kerosene light on and 
           waits. Her face is oddly calm.

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT.

           The Special Ops team head through the forest with infra-red 
           vision-goggles on. The Leader of the Op follows the tracker 
           signal. We see through the infra-red vision the endless 
           trees in the pitch blackness.

           A sudden swerve in our vision as a noise disturbs the 
           peace. But it is only a deer footing it through the 
           forest’s darkness.

           EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT.

           The special ops forces get closer. They see the cabin in 
           the night - the light that Hanna has turned on. They 
           approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the breathing of 
           men in the icy cold.

           The HEAD OF OPS waves two men forward. The rest of the 
           forces surround the cabin but at a distance.

           The two men approach the cabin. They approach the wooden 
           door, then suddenly smash it down and enter.

           There is a pause outside the cabin. Silence.

           The rest of the forces wait for a radio signal. The HEAD of 
           SPECIAL OPS radios.

                                 HEAD OF OPS
                        McCullum? Can you hear me?

           No response. The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men 
           closer to the cabin. Guns at the ready. 

           The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin. 
           INT. CABIN DINING AREA.

           To find HANNA sitting quietly, looking timid and unsure. 
           The two SPECIAL FORCES are dead on the floor. Necks broken. 
           HANNA looks towards the bedroom.

           The HEAD of OPS and two other men rush through into the 
           bedroom. The back window is wide open. The HEAD OF OPS 
           looks out into the night, sees what would appear to be 
           tracks of Erik’s boots in the snow - the tracks that HANNA 
           made. Two men go through the window out into the night.

           The HEAD of OPS stays inside and radios.

                                 HEAD OF OPS
                        He got away. He’s killed two of 
                        my men.

           He looks back into the dining area.

                                 HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)
                        And sir? There’s someone else 
                        here.

           And through the door we see HANNA’s face as she sits, 
           apparently frightened and innocent but actually nursing her 
           fingers with which she has just broken two men’s necks.

           EXT. CIA HQ LANGLEY VIRGINIA.

           A smart 45 year old woman in a smart modern suit drives an 
           American car into a designated spot in the CIA HQ’s car 
           park. 

           As she gets out, we see the car parking space is designated 
           for MARISSA WIEGLER.

           MARISSA’s phone rings. She answers.

                        Sir, I have a call from Dan 
                        Willis in Paris. 

                                 MARISSA
                        I’ll call him back.

                        It’s about a man called Erik 
                        Heller. He said you’d know.

           MARISSA’s face changes.

                                 MARISSA
                        What about him?

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        Erik Heller. High level Stasi
                        agent in 1980’s East Berlin. I 
                        recruited him to our side just 
                        after the Wall came down.

           A video-briefing. Visual aids show photos of Heller in 
           Stasi days, alone, with fellow officers, and then with 
           Marissa’s team, and with a younger Marissa herself. 

           MARISSA is on a public video-phone link to WILLIS and his 
           team of CIA OFFICERS who are all assembled in the Paris 
           office.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Despite our efforts Heller never 
                        adapted to the new political 
                        climate. He missed the old East, 
                        became increasingly isolated and 
                        disturbed. Summer of 1995 his 
                        girlfriend took him and their two 
                        year old daughter for a weekend 
                        on the Baltic coast. He shot the 
                        girlfriend dead in his car. We 
                        never heard from him again.

           We see the article about the killing of the girlfriend. The 
           face of the dead woman, a bullet in the side of her head. 
           Her name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.

                                 PARIS OFFICER
                        In the article there’s no mention 
                        of the child. 

                                 MARISSA 
                        We thought it best to keep the 
                        daughter out of it. It might have 
                        stoked just a little too much 
                        human interest for our taste.

           She smiles.

                                 WILLIS
                        What do you want us to do?

                                 MARISSA 
                        Take the girl to Camp G. Find out 
                        what she knows.

                                 MARISSA  (CONT'D)
                        Close down the Swedish borders 
                        and operate a shoot on sight 
                        policy on Heller. And be careful. 
                        Erik Heller still believes in the 
                        old Soviet Idea. I have very 
                        little faith in his state of 
                        mind.

           The video screen flickers off. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in 
           the darkness.

           INT. CAMP G. HOLDING CELL.

           ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION: 

           A cement box. HANNA lies on a small bed. Not moving. Two 
           American voices.

                                 VOICE 1 (GUARD)
                        She hasn’t moved since we brought 
                        her in sir.

                                 VOICE 2 (BURTON)
                        Ok wash her up and bring her 
                        through. 

           INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING CENTRE.

           An apparently near-catatonic HANNA, hair now washed, oddly 
           clean, is being walked by a GUARD along an institutional 
           corridor in the Camp. She walks past a door with an exit 
           sign. It clearly leads out of the high security briefing 
           area. 

           We focus close on her face as HANNA watches a soldier going 
           through the door out of the area, pressing a number code on 
           the entry-phone. and swiping a security card. HANNA’s 
           apparently catatonic eyes register the soldier’s fingers on 
           the number-pad. The order of the numbers. The shape of his 
           fingers. 

           INT. CAMP G. INTERROGATION ROOM.

           A bright, white-walled room with a long dark mirror.

           HANNA, silent, in a regulation US uniform, is led in and 
           sat down in a chair by a GUARD. She immediately gets off 
           the chair and sits on the floor against the wall. 

           We focus in on HANNA half-looking through half-opened eyes. 
           She stares at the fluorescent light. The grey-white walls. 
           All new. All strange.

           A MILITARY DOCTOR comes in with a syringe.
                                 MILITARY DOCTOR
                        I just need to take your bloods.

           HANNA moves away fast, looks in quiet hostility at the 
           DOCTOR. He tries to take her arm.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        It won’t hurt.

           But she smacks his arm away. He tries again, there is a 
           small tussle and he seemingly gives up.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Ok. We’ll leave it til another 
                        time.

           He smiles, turns and leaves. 

           HANNA alone with the silent guard. White light. Silence. 
           Then a military psychologist, BURTON, enters the room and 
           approaches the UNIFORMED GUARD.

                                 BURTON
                        Has anyone managed to talk to 
                        her?

           Silence. HANNA curls into a ball, foetus-like.

                                 GUARD
                        She still hasn’t spoken a word 
                        sir. She was scared of the 
                        shower.

                                 BURTON
                        OK I’ll take it from here.

           He approaches HANNA.

                                 BURTON (CONT’D)
                        Hello there.

           Hanna lies motionless.

                                 BURTON (CONT'D)
                        My name is Dr. Burton. I’ve been 
                        asked by Lieutenant Hayles to 
                        come and talk to you.

           Nothing.

                                 BURTON (CONT'D)
                        This must all be very strange for 
                        you. You’ve been in the forest a 
                        long time. But I want you to know 
                        no one’s going to hurt you. We 
                        just want to talk to you about 
                        your father.   
           Nothing.

                                 BURTON (CONT’D)
                        Can you hear me?

           Nothing. He offers her a bar of chocolate. She stares at 
           it. She slowly takes it. Tries it. Spits it out. Doesn’t 
           bother to clear the spit from her mouth. BURTON stares 
           nervously at the dark window in the room.

           HANNA stares ahead at the dark window, which we begin to 
           realise is a two way mirror behind which someone is 
           watching...

           INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM.

           Behind the mirror, WILLIS sits with the MONITOR watching 
           carefully.

                                 WILLIS
                        Plug the CCTV through to Langley. 
                        Extension 247.

           MONITOR presses some buttons as WILLIS calls on his phone 
           and speaks into it. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT'D)
                        You should have visual on the

           INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT.

           MARISSA, alone in a Langley OBS ROOM. No one else there. 
           Late at night in America. Something secret about Marissa 
           here.

           On the screen she sees HANNA in the Interrogation Room. Her 
           screen tells she is watching CAMP G - Interrogation Room 3. 
           MARISSA watches HANNA intently. HANNA does not move under 
           the white glare of the lights.

                                 MARISSA
                        What’s she saying?

                                 WILLIS
                        Nothing. She’s not responding to 
                        any form of stimulation.

                                 MONITOR
                        Could be extreme trauma due to

           INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT.

           MARISSA watches HANNA closely. The face. The eyes. 

                                 MARISSA 
                        Could she be faking?

                                 MONITOR (O.S.)
                        She could be Dorothy from Wizard 
                        of Oz as far as I’m concerned. 

           MARISSA stares at her screen, at the blank face of the 
           fourteen year old HANNA. Focus in on MARISSA’s face as she 
           studies this strange young woman. The sense that MARISSA 
           knows more about this girl than she is letting on. 

           On the screen BURTON continues to probe.

                                 BURTON 
                        Can I get you something? What do 
                        you like? Music? Magazines? Just 
                        say. Anything at all.

           HANNA leans forward. Looks at BURTON, who encourages her 
           with his eyes, and whispers.

                                 HANNA
                        I want to speak to Marissa 
                        Wiegler.

           Stunned silence in the room. In the Camp G observation room 
           WILLIS speaks into his intercom.

                                 WILLIS
                        Did you hear that?

           In Langley, MARISSA pauses. Looks at the girl on the 
           screen.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Tell her I’ll be there tonight.

                                 WILLIS
                        But...

                                 MARISSA
                        Just do it.

           MARISSA turns off the comms. Darkness in the room as she 
           sits alone.

           INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY.

           A white space with specialist lighting and the hum of 
           specialised air pressurisers.
           A protected environment - this is the DNA lab. MILITARY 
           DOCTOR 1, the one who tried to take HANNA’s bloods, is 
           looking at the result of something on a computer. It has 
           shocked and intrigued him. He calls across to another 
           doctor.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 1
                        John come and have a look at 
                        this. 

           MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees what DOCTOR 1 is 
           doing. 

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 2
                        I thought you didn’t get bloods.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 1 
                        I took a sample of her hair from 
                        the shower.

           MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results. He stops in shock.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 2
                        That must be contamination.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 1
                        I don’t think so.

           He looks at DOCTOR 2 in slight alarm. 

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR 2 
                        Run the B sample.

           INT. CAMP G. HANNA’S ROOM. SECURE BRIEFING AREA.

           An institutional room with a bed. HANNA is coiled up in 
           bed, still in uniform.

           A metal door drags open. BURTON enters.

                                 BURTON
                        Chief Officer Wiegler is coming 
                        to talk to you. OK?

           He smiles. HANNA does not react as she lies there. The door 
           suddenly opens. A pair of smart female shoes enters the 
           room, accompanied by the military boots of two guards. 

                                 FALSE MARISSA (O.C.)
                        My name is Marissa Wiegler. You 
                        wanted to speak to me?

           HANNA turns to look. It is a completely different woman, 
           dressed in similar clothes to MARISSA but not her. HANNA 
           stares at her.

           MARISSA hears the question. Thinks fast, her mind totally

           As the argument continues, we see and hear on the screen 
           the False Marissa continuing to talk to HANNA.

                                 FALSE MARISSA 
                        Do you know where your father is? 

           In the OBS room WILLIS, half watching the screen, explains 
           to MARISSA on intercom.

                        Send the results straight to me. 

           On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.

                                 FALSE MARISSA
                        Did he tell you where he was 
                        going? We’re all worried about 
                        him.

           On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She starts to 
           cry. To weep. She holds out her arms. 

           INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM.

           The MONITOR sees her cry and turns to WILLIS who is still 
           half-embroiled in the tests discussion.

                                 MONITOR

           Hanna holds out her arms to the FALSE MARISSA. The FALSE 
           MARISSA tentatively takes her in her arms. 

                                 FALSE MARISSA
                        It’s OK. It’s OK.

           She looks up to the security camera, slightly concerned. 
           Hanna wriggles in her arms. 

           INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY.

           MARISSA watches this strange image of her false self 
           hugging this young girl. HANNA begins to weep more and 
           more, flailing uncontrollably On the CCTV we hear.

                                 BURTON (V.O.)
                        You want me to give her 
                        something?

           INT. CAMP G. HANNA’S ROOM IN SECURE BRIEFING AREA.

           HANNA clutching on to FALSE MARISSA, weeping, moaning.

                                 FALSE MARISSA 
                        I think it might be necessary.

                        Abort. I repeat. Abort.

           Hanna hugs, weeping, on to the FALSE MARISSA. BURTON hears 
           the instruction to abort but too late...

           ...as suddenly and with total efficiency HANNA SNAPS the 
           FALSE MARISSA’s neck. 
           INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY. CONT.

           MARISSA stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to 
           the floor.

           INT. CAMP G. HANNA’S ROOM IN SECURE BRIEFING AREA. CONT.

           HANNA grabs the FEMALE GUARD, slips the handgun from the 
           Female Guard’s holster-- 

           --She fires two rounds into Burton’s skull-- 

           --And two more into the FEMALE GUARD’s chest.

           The other Guard tries to drag the metal door shut. He hits 
           a fleshy door jam - Burton. Hanna is upon him. Two shots.

           MARISSA watches HANNA run out of the room. A fear in her 
           eyes. 

           INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING AREA.

           Alarms are sounding and red lights flashing in the 
           corridor.

           HANNA walks fast along the corridor. She ducks into a door 
           to avoid two Centre Guards running past, dives down another 
           corridor and walks through a pair of double doors with 
           warning signs on them. PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT.

           INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. CONT.

           And finds herself in the specialist Military DNA 
           Laboratory. The MILITARY DOCTORS stare at her. One of them 
           reaches for an alarm but HANNA is too fast. She flies 
           across the desk and smashing a glass test tube, she cuts 
           the doctor’s neck, then turns and does the same to the 
           other one. Both lie dead on the floor. 

           HANNA looks round, trying to find a way out herself. Then 
           she sees something on the desk. It is a photo of herself. 
           And the result of her DNA test.
           But before she has time to read them, ears pricked, she 
           hears a female voice from outside the lab.

                                 FEMALE GUARD
                        This is Sanders. I’m checking 
                        Zone eleven.

           A FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses 
           something. The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The 
           buzz of the lab’s specialist lighting and the whirr of the 
           specialist air-pressuriser are the only sounds as the GUARD 
           looks around. Then the GUARD hears a female voice, 
           apparently from behind her.

                                 HANNA
                        I’m over here.

           The FEMALE GUARD turns. Then unseen behind her, HANNA rises 
           up and smashes a lab microscope on to the guard’s head.

           INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN SECURE BRIEFING CENTRE.

           HANNA, dressed in the FEMALE GUARD’s uniform runs along the 
           corridor. She has in her hands her DNA results. She takes 
           out the swipe-card as she reaches the exit from the Secure 
           Area. She punches in the numbers she remembered from 
           before, and swipes the card. Then goes through.

           INT. CAMP G. MAIN AREA. CORRIDOR. CONT.

           In the main military area of the complex, HANNA passes a 
           large number of military personnel all running to the 
           Secure Briefing Area. 

           INT. CAMP G. LOCKER ROOM. CONT.

           HANNA enters the locker room and takes out some keys from 
           the GUARD’s UNIFORM and opens the locker with one of the 
           keys. Inside are civilian clothes, some money, and a 
           passport which she also takes. HANNA puts the clothes, 
           money and DNA results into her ruc-sac. She looks at the 
           passport - it is a special US Military passport. Name: 
           Rachel Sanders. The woman is 23 years old, short hair 
           (military style). HANNA pockets the passport, tucks her 
           hair under her cap. Then she exits.

           INT. CAMP G. CORRIDOR IN BRIEFING CENTRE. CONT.

           Back in the corridor, she spots a sign pointing one to way 
           to HOLDING and the other way to a Fire Exit sign. She runs 
           towards the Fire Exit sign. Then, struggling for a second 
           with the radio to see how it works, she radios in, in a 
           perfect American accent, mimicking the real Sanders.
                                 HANNA
                        This is Sanders. We have her in 
                        Holding. She’s under control. 
                        Release all doors.

           She walks towards the Fire Exit door and as she gets there 
           hears the security catch release. She presses the Exit 
           release button.

           A compression BURST. A door slides open. 

           Blinding white. 

           HANNA stands half blinded and in shock and walks out of the 
           door.

           EXT. CAMP G COMPOUND / MOROCCAN DESERT

           It’s now that the heat hits her. HANNA stands in the 
           scalding desert sun staring in shock at the exterior of a 
           desert compound. US military trucks and buses. Motorbikes. 
           Dust, red sand, burning sun. HANNA almost blinded by the 
           glare. The heat new to her but no time to think. There are 
           fifty yards to the compound wire that encloses the camp 
           from the desert. Beyond the wire, an alien desert of almost 
           lunar formation. Sand and white rock. She looks round, 
           locates the Camp Gates, with station-post. Guarded. Beyond 
           the gates the dirt track disappears into the desert. 

           US military running across the compound. Camp is on alert. 
           HANNA knows she does not have long. She sees a SOLDIER 
           climb into a truck and start it. Keeping her cap over her 
           face, quickly she walks to him.

                                 HANNA
                        Hayles wants me to come with you.

           It’s a big risk but the soldier just nods and the truck 
           exits the gates, with both HANNA and the SOLDIER flashing 
           their ID as they pass. Beyond the gates, the truck recedes 
           into the desert landscape until it has disappeared behind 
           the white rock.

           MONITOR leaves and WILLIS rewinds the CCTV of the moment 
           HANNA snapped the false Marissa’s neck...
           INT. MARISSA’S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA.

           MARISSA enters fast a stunning but somewhat lonely 
           apartment. She lives alone, clearly. No kids. No real 
           feeling of life. 

           She goes into her hallway, fetches a ladder and climbs into 
           an attic space.

           In the attic she pushes stuff aside to get to a blue file 
           at the back of the attic. She takes the file, gets off the 
           chair and, grabbing a metal bucket, walks through her 
           living room on to her outside balcony. She puts the file in 
           the bucket and sets it alight.  

           She watches it burn. As it does we see the name GALINKA on 
           the file.

           MARISSA’s face stares at the burning file.

           Sudden FLASH-BACK to 1995 and a much younger MARISSA 
           watching a very fast-moving car on a deserted forest road. 
           She takes from her pocket a small detonating device and as 
           the car approaches a bend, presses it. There is a small 
           explosion and the car swerves off the road and smashes 
           headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare. MARISSA 
           approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks 
           through binoculars at the car. She sees a woman, on the 
           passenger side, head thrust forward. JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood 
           everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the head just to be sure. 
           But the driver’s seat is empty. MARISSA stops dead. Then 
           the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger 
           ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child 
           in his hands. The child’s coat is covered in blood. MARISSA 
           stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to her eye 
           to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement and 
           throws himself to the ground. Through the rifle viewfinder 
           we see just a glimpse of ERIK and the red glare of the coat 
           covered in blood, ERIK HELLER grabbing the child and 
           sprinting for the forest, MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and 
           then firing as HELLER dives into the forest.

           Back on the balcony of the apartment, MARISSA stares at the 
           embers of the burnt file.

           She takes out her phone, calls.

                                 MARISSA
                        Leslie this is Marissa. Cancel my 
                        meetings for the next four days. 
                        Get me on a flight to Paris 
                        tomorrow morning.
           EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT

           We are in the middle of the desert. The military truck is 
           stationery. Nothing around for miles. We hear a military 
           voice on a radio.

                                 MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)
                        473 are you receiving me? Can you 
                        confirm your position. Subject 
                        has escaped. 

           INT. MILITARY TRUCK. CONT. 

           The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.

                                 MILITARY VOICE
                        Can you confirm your position 
                        473? Banks? Banks can you hear 
                        me?

           The camera wheels round to see the SOLDIER trussed up, arms 
           tied, his mouth gagged, lying in the front of his van. The 
           GPS positioning tool smashed beside him.

           EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY.

           Later. The sun moving towards evening. HANNA is walking 
           fast across the hot desert, ruc-sac over her shoulders, 
           between the pale rocks - it’s a lunar landscape and offers 
           her concealment. The sun tears into her eyes. She has never 
           felt heat like this, never seen such a parched landscape. 
           She puts her US military jacket in her ruc sac so she just 
           has on just a simple green top and plain khaki trousers. 
           Hiding between the rocks, she can see in the distance a US 
           ARMY truck pouring along the dirt desert road looking for 
           her.

           Quickly HANNA switches direction and moves between the 
           rocks. Seeking shade, she crawls between two rock 
           formations and walks out to find:

           A GIRL standing about thirty yards away from her on a rock. 
           Staring at her. They must be about the same age but there 
           the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and bruised in 
           military top, trousers and boots stares at this perfect 
           image of western adolescence. Nicely dressed in a top and 
           hot pants, red shoes, drinking a can of coke, no concession 
           to where she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE. She speaks in 
           French.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hi. Are you ok?
           HANNA stares at her. Not sure. Who is she? SOPHIE equally 
           wary. HANNA begins to walk away. But sees the US military 
           trucks in the distance. Turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a 
           wary animal.

           HANNA speaks in perfect French. Testing her.

                                 HANNA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ask my dad. It’s his stupid idea 
                        of a holiday. What about you?

           HANNA doesn’t answer. Then her ears prick. The roar of an 
           engine. She panics, is about to run, but suddenly sees a 
           white Land Rover pull up behind the rock SOPHIE is sitting 
           on. 

           In the back of the Land Rover are a group of tourists. Two 
           Japanese, two Spanish. And a french family. EMIL DOMERC, 
           his English wife RACHEL and their son THIERRY, aged eight. 
           The Berber driver, YUSUF waits in the front as EMIL cries 
           out.

                                 EMIL
                        Sophie didn’t you hear us call 
                        you? We have to go!

           But now EMIL sees HANNA and pauses. In the Land Rover the 
           tourists stare at HANNA, sunglasses over their eyes, with 
           cameras round their necks, not sure whether to take a 
           picture. HANNA stares at them. She looks uncertainly at the 
           cameras. Who are these people?

           INT. LAND ROVER.

           HANNA sits in the back of the Land Rover as they drive back 
           across the desert. HANNA takes in the tourists. Two 
           Japanese with cameras. A Spanish couple, middle aged. And 
           EMIL, RACHEL, THIERRY, and SOPHIE. THIERRY whispers to 
           SOPHIE.

                                 THIERRY (IN FRENCH)
                        Do you think she lives in the 
                        desert?

                                 SOPHIE (IN FRENCH)
                        Shut it will you.

           HANNA overhears that and also the Japanese talking. She is 
           understanding every word.

                                 JAPANESE WOMAN (IN JAPANESE)
                        She looks American.
                                 JAPANESE MAN (IN JAPANESE)
                        Is she a soldier? 

           EMIL offers HANNA some water with a smile. HANNA looks 
           cagily at him, but takes and swigs. RACHEL speaks in 
           English.

                                 RACHEL
                        How did you end up all the way 
                        out there?

           HANNA does not reply. THIERRY tries his English.

                                 THIERRY
                        Do.. You.. Talk.. English?

                                 HANNA
                        Oui mais je parle aussi bien le 
                        francais.

           THIERRY looks surprised. RACHEL looks at HANNA, confused.

                                 RACHEL
                        Alors vous etes... Francais?

                                 HANNA
                        Non.

           The FAMILY wait for more but do not get it. HANNA stares 
           out at the landscape. They pass two ARAB WOMEN on the road. 
           HANNA stares at them, all covered up in their burkas. Then 
           she looks at the Spanish woman, who is in a rather 
           revealing top. Then back to the ARAB WOMEN whose black 
           figures recede into the distance. Taking it all in. 
           Thinking: where am I?

           INT. PARIS CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT.

           WILLIS meets MARISSA at the airport in Paris as she exits 
           the special diplomatic exit. They move as they talk.

                                 WILLIS
                        She’s somewhere in the desert 
                        east of Essouiara.

                                 MARISSA
                        Have you got the tests?

                                 WILLIS
                        We can’t find them. It’s possible 
                        she has them on her.

           MARISSA takes this in.
                                 MARISSA
                        OK. I want you to focus on Erik 
                        Heller. Get him back in our hands 
                        by this time tomorrow. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        And the girl?

                                 MARISSA
                        Leave her to me.

           An awkward pause.

                                 WILLIS 
                        Why would she want to kill you 
                        ma’am?

           WILLIS fishing here - a small curiosity.

                                 MARISSA
                        Just find Heller. OK? 

           EXT. OASIS TOWN. 

           A busy village centre - motorbikes, trucks, mules and 
           goats. The truck pulls up at a small oasis “hotel”, in 
           reality no more than a few simple concrete buildings and 
           some rather beautiful fake Berba huts, for the tourists. 
           YUSUF climbs out.

           HANNA climbs out of the back of the truck along with the 
           rest of the tourists. 

           The impact of the mass of people at market knocks HANNA 
           backwards. The smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, 
           couscous cooking at market stalls. The babble of Arabic. 
           Hanna’s ears, nose and eyes sensitive to every 
           conversation, every aroma. All new. An old broken-backed 
           woman inches her way to market. HANNA stares at her in 
           astonishment. Her wrinkled skin. And animals everywhere. 
           New animals. Chickens. Goats. Even a camel, which Hanna 
           can’t help finding slightly hilarious. 

           A motor-scooter flashes by and HANNA clicks back to 
           operation mode. Checks the town for US presence. Nothing. 
           Across the busy square, HANNA watches SOPHIE sit down in 
           the cafe and start to read a magazine. The FAMILY sit with 
           her. From forty yards away, and despite the noise of the 
           village, the chickens, goats and bikes, HANNA overhears. 
           The family speaking in French.

                                 THIERRY (O.S.) 
                        Can we go again tomorrow mum?
                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        No we have to drive back to 
                        France tomorrow morning.

                                 THIERRY (O.S.)
                        Can’t we stay an extra day?

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        Your father has to go to work on 
                        Monday. And you have school.

           HANNA hears this and walks into the hotel which is 
           signposted HOTEL SAHARA-SKY. YUSUF is with his brother 
           behind the token “reception” area. 

                                 HANNA
                        I would like to stay here one 
                        night.

                                 YUSUF
                        You have money?

                                 HANNA
                        Money.

           HANNA gives him some money from the GUARD’s wallet, loads 
           of dollars. YUSUF smiles.

                                 YUSUF 
                        I wish it was that much.

           He takes just one note.

                                 YUSUF (CONT'D)
                        What were you doing in the 
                        desert?

                                 HANNA
                        I got lost.

                                 YUSUF
                        Where’s your family?

           HANNA does not answer. She stares at the wall - a tourist 
           poster advertising Morocco as a country of excitement and 
           culture. There is also a map. HANNA approaches it and 
           quietly talks to herself.

                                 HANNA
                        Capital city MELILLA. Places of 
                        interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira.
                        Religion Islam.

           She turns back to receive a key from YUSUF. Stares at it in 
           confusion.
                                 YUSUF
                        The key to your room?

           HANNA nods.

           EXT/INT. BAR IN PARIS. 

           A working class district of Paris, tough, unglamorous.
           MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of a taxi, checks the sign of the 
           bar and crosses the road. She is on the phone and we hear.

                                 WILLIS (O.S.)
                        The Swedish borders are sealed. I 
                        have Swedish, Norwegian and 
                        Danish police all on high alert.

                                 MARISSA
                        Let me know when they find him.

           MARISSA hangs up, walks down some steps into a dark and 
           silent basement bar. Just old French men drinking alcohol 
           too early in the day. 

           But in the corner, the reason she is there. MICHAEL ISAACS, 
           drinking a beer, smoking. Mid fifties. English. Rumpled 
           suit, slightly unshaven. A real sense of quiet threat about 
           him. Witty, dangerous. This man does business. 

           ISAACS smiles at MARISSA.

                                 ISAACS
                        Ten years. Did you miss us?

                                 MARISSA
                        I missed the coffee.

           ISAACS smiles and signals to the bar. Coffee.

                                 ISAACS
                        Welcome to the last place in 
                        Europe where you can smoke. I 
                        thought the Frogs would hold out 
                        against the tide but there you 
                        go.

           He leans in conspiratorially.

                                 ISAACS (CONT’D)
                        Also no cameras. Which is a 
                        bonus. 

           He puts out the cigarette.

                                 ISAACS (CONT’D)
                        So. I thought the days of us 
                        meeting were over.
                                 MARISSA
                        Officially they are.

           ISAACS is hooked. 

                                 ISAACS
                        So?

           He waits as MARISSA sips her coffee.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Erik Heller’s alive.

           ISAACS glances up.

                                 ISAACS
                        And just as you begin your new 
                        era.

                                 MARISSA
                        I hear you run a private 
                        operation now.

                                 ISAACS
                        I run several.

                                 MARISSA
                        There’s only one I’m interested 
                        in.

           MARISSA looks at him, passes him a newspaper. He opens it. 
           Hidden inside is a picture of Hanna. He looks up.

                                 ISAACS 
                        Is that ... ?

           MARISSA nods.

                                 ISAACS (CONT’D)
                        Where have they been?

                                 MARISSA
                        In a forest in Sweden. He trained 
                        her, sent her to kill me. 

                                 ISAACS
                        I never liked him. No joie de 
                        vivre.

                                 MARISSA 
                        We need to close this down. The 
                        search for Heller can be 
                        official, he’s a criminal who 
                        killed his girlfriend. 

           ISAACS raises his eyes slightly here. MARISSA eyeballs him. 
           He sips his beer.
                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        But she’s different.

                                 ISAACS
                        She certainly is.

           This said with a slight meaning. 

                                 MARISSA
                        She’s in Morocco. She’ll be 
                        trying to get out of the country. 
                        I’d like her to be unsuccessful.

                                 ISAACS
                        Permanently unsuccessful?

           No answer, she just drinks her coffee and then ups and 
           leaves. Pause as ISAACS considers this. He notes that 
           MARISSA has left an envelope filled with money on the 
           table. ISAACS lights another cigarette. Looks at the money. 
           Takes it.

           INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM. EVENING.

           HANNA in the hotel room. She can hear sounds from adjoining 
           rooms, her ears able to separate the chatting of Arab 
           cleaners, a German couple making love, the sounds of a 
           crackly radio transmitting French-Moroccan pop music. 

           HANNA looks at a switch on the wall. Presses it. A fan 
           starts to blow. For a second it frightens her. Then she 
           gets it - it’s to cool her. She likes it, the air on her 
           skin, in her hair. She sways in the moving air. Then she 
           enters the small simple bathroom. She sees the tap. Turns 
           it. Water comes out. Turns it off. It stops. Turns it 
           again. Water again. She puts her hand under the water. She 
           wipes her face. Looks in the small mirror. Her face. 

           She reaches into her ruc-sac. She finds the DNA report. She 
           takes it out, sits down, reads.

           The test reads: HANNA HELLER - “SGM+ test results. 
           Interfering sequence present. Abnormal. B sample confirms 
           result” 

           HANNA stares at the words. “Interfering sequence present. 
           Abnormal.” HANNA looks at the photo of herself and those 
           words. What do they mean? 

           Now she hears another sound from a distant room. RACHEL the 
           English mother.

                                 RACHEL (O.S.)
                        We have to leave at eight 
                        tomorrow. I want you to pack now.
           HANNA thinks. Listening hard, she walks out of the 
           bathroom. Quickly she takes off the US military clothes and 
           slips on the civvies she took from the locker. She notices 
           that there are no shoes. She slips barefoot out of the 
           bedroom into the corridor. She passes two other doors 
           outside one of which are a pair of sandals. She steps into 
           the sandals, walks on, then stands outside the hotel room 
           door where the family are staying. She can hear them 
           talking.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why do we always have to get up 
                        so early?

                                 EMIL
                        Eight is not early. If you were a 
                        Berber shepherd, you’d get up at 
                        dawn. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m not a Berber shepherd.

                                 EMIL
                        Well whatever you are I’m not 
                        missing that ferry. It’s a long 
                        enough journey as it is.

           HANNA listens and with a slight intake of breath, knocks at 
           the door. 

           INT. CAR. DAY.

           HANNA, still in the civvie clothes she stole from the 
           locker, and with the sandals she stole from outside the 
           door, is sitting in the back of a large car, between SOPHIE 
           and THIERRY. In the front EMIL drives. RACHEL sits and 
           chats to HANNA in English as do they all. SOPHIE looks 
           sulkily out of the window. THIERRY plays a small computer 
           game. HANNA looks at the computer game.

                                 HANNA
                        What is it?

           THIERRY doesn’t even look up.

                                 THIERRY
                        It’s a DS.

           HANNA stares in curiosity. SOPHIE intervenes. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Let her try.

           He isn’t willing.
                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Go on jerkhead.

                                 EMIL
                        Sophie!

           THIERRY gives HANNA the game. It’s a kind of car race. She 
           tries to play but it is too difficult. He explains it super-
           fast, not helping, just nerdily showing off.

                                 THIERRY 
                        C is accelerate, B slow down,  
                        use the back button to use your 
                        turbo, try to hit the golden 
                        casks then you get on to 
                        superdrive.

           HANNA starts to play. But it is really hard. She crashes. 
           THIERRY smiles a trifle smugly. RACHEL speaks in English.

                                 RACHEL
                        So your father is meeting you at 
                        the port?

           HANNA nods, cool as you like. She is still playing the DS.
           Getting it.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        And your mother?

                                 HANNA
                        My mother is dead.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh I’m sorry.

                                 EMIL
                        Why isn’t your father with you?

                                 HANNA
                        There was a problem at work. He 
                        had to stay in Germany.

                                 RACHEL
                        What’s his job?

                                 HANNA
                        He’s an accountant.

                                 EMIL
                        Do you live with him?

                                 HANNA
                        Yes. In Leipzig. I go to the 
                        Klaus Kohle Gymanasium. It’s a 
                        very good school.
           This totally natural. No one doubts it for a second.

                                 EMIL
                        And you often travel alone?

           HANNA nods, eyes still on the game.

                                 HANNA
                        I’m encouraged to be independent.

           Looks between the parents here. HANNA still playing the DS.
           THIERRY surprised how quickly she is mastering it.

                                 EMIL
                        He shouldn’t let you come to a 
                        place like this alone. It’s not 
                        safe.

                                 HANNA
                        I can look after myself.

           EMIL is about to continue this line of questioning but 
           RACHEL looks at him and mouths to him that he should leave 
           it. She lightens the tone. HANNA still playing. Intensely.

                                 RACHEL
                        You speak very good English.

                                 HANNA
                        My father taught me.

                                 RACHEL 
                        Have you been to England? 

           HANNA shakes her head.

                                 EMIL 
                        Don’t bother. No emotion and lots 
                        of rain. 

           HANNA finishes the race in first place. Gives the DS back, 
           Thierry surprised how good she is. HANNA sees SOPHIE 
           looking at her. SOPHIE has noticed that HANNA’s trousers 
           are too long for her. The hems go over her stolen sandals. 
           HANNA braves it out, staring out of the window at a 
           landscape so utterly different to the one she knows.

                                 HANNA
                        No trees.

           And they drive on through the desert.

           EXT. MELILLA FERRYPORT. MOROCCO.

           A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions. 
           ISAACS is standing at the entrance. He gets out a 
           cigarette, lights it with a HOTEL SAHARA-SKY box of 
           matches.

           He looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His 
           men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.

           INT. HIRE CAR. DAY.

           HANNA sees they are approaching the ferry-port. She 
           quickly, but with apparent relaxation, turns to RACHEL.

                                 HANNA
                        Thank you. You can let me out 
                        here.

                                 RACHEL
                        You sure you’ll find your father 
                        ok?

                                 HANNA
                        I’m sure.

           They stop the car.

                                 RACHEL
                        Goodbye then.

           HANNA says nothing, just gets out and walks into the crowd. 
           SOPHIE watches her, slightly entranced.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        That girl isn’t telling us 
                        everything.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I think she’s cool.

           SOPHIE impressed by HANNA’s independence. RACHEL looks with 
           maternal care after the oddly dressed girl as HANNA 
           disappears amongst the throng.

           EXT. MELILLA PORT. MOROCCO. CONT.

           HANNA, looking for US presence, blends into the crowds of 
           tourists and Moroccans and African pedestrians waiting to 
           walk on to the ferry. She scans the scene, her eyes and 
           ears at their most acute. It’s like she’s back in the 
           forest. Suddenly she hears something. High pitched. Might 
           it be a radio signal? She traces the sound, sees two men 
           amidst the crowd, standing apparently queuing. Yes, radios. 
           They are looking for her. Another look round - ninety 
           degrees. Two more men checking cars as they enter. Another 
           look round ninety degrees. 
           She sees ISAACS in a cafe at the ferryport entrance, 
           sitting relaxedly reading a book, smoking, dark glasses. 
           Yes, he’s after her. It’s as if she can smell it.

           She keeps a firm distance from them. She sees customs are 
           checking all the passports of pedestrians entering the 
           boat. She takes out the passport and studies the face of 
           the guard. She enters a small cafe and asks for the 
           toilets.

           EXT. MELILLA PORT. EMBARKATION POINT. MOROCCO.

           HANNA, with her hair now cut short, and now dressed back in 
           the full US Military Guard uniform walks towards the 
           passport checkpoint. We notice that her long khaki fatigues 
           are covering up the fact that she is still wearing the 
           sandals. HANNA walks close to one of ISAACS’s men, 
           REYNOLDS, but as he turns HANNA takes a sharp right and 
           heads towards the STAFF ENTRANCE. As she does she sees a 
           tiny baby crawling along the dusty ground, her mother a way 
           off. HANNA momentarily fascinated by the sight of the baby. 
           She has never seen one before. Then clicks out. 

           HANNA walks towards a Spanish BARMAN who is entering the 
           ship. She speaks in an American accent.

                                 HANNA
                        Passport and staff I.D.

           He stares at her. Takes out his passport and staff I.D..

                                 BARMAN
                        What’s going on?

           She doesn’t answer.

                                 HANNA
                        I’ll take you on.

           She accompanies the BARMAN on to the ship, past the 
           passport check. She flashes her and his passport at the 
           MOROCCAN clerk.

                                 HANNA (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) (CONT'D)
                        It’s OK he’s bar staff

           HANNA enters the ship.

           INT. FERRY DECK. MELILLA-MALAGA FERRY.

           The FRENCH FAMILY walk along the internal deck of the 
           Ferry. 
                                 EMIL 
                        Listen next year you can go on 
                        your own to some fleapit where 
                        you can spend all the time going 
                        to discos and trying to kiss 
                        boys...

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don’t want to do that!

                                 EMIL
                        But at least you’ve learnt 
                        something here. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah I’ve learnt I don’t want to 
                        come back.

           SOPHIE leaves the rest to go to the toilet.

           INT. LADIES TOILET. FERRY

           SOPHIE enters the ladies toilets on the ferry. She bumps 
           straight into HANNA who has obviously just changed back 
           into her civvies. She has the ruc-sac on. For a second 
           SOPHIE does not recognise her with her short hair. HANNA 
           slightly shocked at having bumped straight back into her.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh my God, your hair! It’s so 
                        cool!

           HANNA smiles.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Wait. I have to pee.

           She enters the cubicle and pees, not bothering to close the 
           door. HANNA meanwhile is looking at the electric hand 
           dryer. She puts her hand under and jumps slightly when it 
           flicks on.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        So - where’s your father?

                                 HANNA
                        He couldn’t come to meet me. A 
                        tax problem in the office.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Oh I don’t think so. 

           She smiles at HANNA, leans in, looks her dead in the eyes. 
                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Why were you all alone 
                        in Morocco? What’s the real
                        story?

           HANNA shocked - SOPHIE does not believe her. Almost 
           panicking, her hands tensening, about to act, possibly to 
           attack. But SOPHIE smiles.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        It was a boy wasn’t it?

           Pause. SOPHIE looking dead at her. HANNA smiles just enough 
           to lead Sophie on.

                                 HANNA
                        Maybe.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        I knew it! Did you have a massive 
                        row and walk out?

           HANNA smiles again. SOPHIE laughs, gets off the loo and 
           grabs HANNA’s hand. Sudden teenage earnestness.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t worry I won’t say anything. 
                        It will be our secret ok?

           She smiles. HANNA smiles.

           INT. FERRY. SHOPPING DECK. CONT.

           SOPHIE is walking fast through the retail outlets. HANNA 
           following. It’s all new to HANNA. Her first view of the 
           commercial western world. Slot machines, cafes, shops, duty 
           free. Lots of Western families laden with touristic gear. 
           HANNA watches the families, ordinary parents with ordinary 
           kids, hand in hand, nuclear families, and teenagers with 
           bright clothes, tanned legs, eating sweets, drinking cans 
           of pop. A consumerist zoo.

                                 HANNA
                        Why are all these things on a 
                        boat?

                                 SOPHIE
                        So people buy them silly.

           HANNA curious but bemused by this. Then she sees a 
           photograph booth.

                                 HANNA
                        I have to have a photograph taken 
                        of myself. I promised my father.
                                 SOPHIE
                        Cool! I’ll help you.

           HANNA looks at the booth. No idea how to work it.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you have any coins? Hold 
                        on. My dad is always giving me 
                        money to keep me quiet.

           HANNA opens the booth and goes in. SOPHIE chucks the coins 
           in. The light flashes, unnerving HANNA. The photo is taken. 
           HANNA about to come out of the booth.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Hold on. Let’s do one together!

           She piles in and HANNA follows as they take three different 
           photos, each time SOPHIE rejecting it so they can do 
           another one. Hugging, Sophie kissing Hanna’s cheek. SOPHIE 
           saying “one for the boys” and pouting then bursting into 
           hysterics. HANNA laughing. Laughing for the first time in a 
           while.

           INT. FERRY BAR.

           SOPHIE and HANNAH walk into the bar. HANNA is looking out 
           for trouble. So is SOPHIE.

                                 SOPHIE
                        If you see my parents, then make 
                        a run for it. Ok?

           She walks up to the bar HANNA sees it is the same barman 
           whose passport she “checked” earlier. HANNA puts a brave 
           face on it defying him to recognise her. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Two bacardis and coke.

                                 BARMAN
                        How old are you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Old enough for you.

                                 BARMAN
                        Do you have proof?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Don’t be an arsehole man.

                                 BARMAN
                        Don’t talk to me like that. 
           He looks at HANNA. Flicker of recognition but he can’t work 
           out where. She stares back blankly.

                                 BARMAN (CONT'D)
                        You can have two cokes.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Bastard.

           They pay and sit at a table. SOPHIE sips her drink and 
           looks at HANNA. HANNA is trying her coke. She smiles, 
           hiding her huge delight at the new taste. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re pretty, you know that?

           HANNA smiles and shakes her head.

                                 HANNA
                        Not really.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Sure you are. You’re tall. I 
                        always wanted to be tall. If you 
                        were a man I might fancy you.

           She laughs. 

                                 HANNA
                        I’m not a man.

           SOPHIE laughs even more. HANNA checks out the barman who is 
           still looking at her.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You should get some different 
                        clothes. Show off your figure 
                        more.

                                 HANNA
                        What is my figure?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Your body...

           HANNA looks down at her body. Then she looks across at a 
           Moroccan woman dressed in a Burka.

                                 HANNA
                        Why is she dressed like this. Has 
                        she done something wrong?

                                 SOPHIE
                        They all dress like that here. 
                        It’s twisted misogynist bullshit.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        And meanwhile all the men think 
                        they can fuck the Western girls 
                        whenever they want to. Sick.

                                 HANNA
                        What is fuck?

           SOPHIE looks at her.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re joking right?

           HANNA smiles, hiding her ignorance. SOPHIE laughs. Then 
           HANNA turns to see the Barman staring at her and calling on 
           his phone. Thinking fast, she leans forward.

                                 HANNA
                        Ok. Dress me more like you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Really?

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah. Make me beautiful.

           HANNA suddenly sees two men in plain clothes enter the far 
           side of the bar. Two of ISAACS’s men. They have not seen 
           her. Animal senses heightened, she knows they’re after her. 
           She gets up leaves through another door.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        All right, hold on... jesus let 
                        me finish my drink...

           But HANNA is gone.

           INT. FERRY CAR DECK.

           EMIL, RACHEL and THIERRY are walking back to the car. They 
           are met by SOPHIE.

                                 EMIL
                        Where did you go? We were worried 
                        about you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Get a life dad. Look who I met.

           It’s HANNA. She has one of Sophie’s tops on and pink 
           sunglasses still with the UV label on. With her short hair, 
           it makes her look completely different. French, sexy.

                                 EMIL
                        I thought you were meeting...
                                 SOPHIE 
                        He couldn’t make it. She has to 
                        get back to her home in Leipzig. 
                        I said we could give her a lift 
                        to Lille.

           SOPHIE puts her arm round HANNA. HANNA echoes the gesture. 
           Her arm round SOPHIE’s shoulders. Slightly embarrassed 
           moment.

                                 EMIL
                        No Sophie... it’s not 
                        appropriate...

                                 RACHEL
                        Emil.. wait...

           They talk apart. An argument. HANNA overhears. She begins 
           to get worried. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        She’s obviously in some kind of 
                        trouble. 

                                 EMIL
                        If she’s in trouble, we should 
                        tell the authorities...

                                 RACHEL
                        What and leave her with a bunch 
                        of Spanish customs officers?

           They continue to debate. The noise of the ferry doors 
           opening drowns what the parents are saying. We hear 
           snatches of:

                                 EMIL
                        We have no idea what’s going on.

                                 RACHEL
                        Which is why if we give her a 
                        lift we can find out more about 
                        her... I’m not leaving her in 
                        Malaga, she probably can’t even 
                        speak the language...

           HANNA waits, breath baited, her arm round SOPHIE’s 
           shoulders. On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck, 
           looking for her. HANNA watches in tension. Are they going 
           to give her up?  Still the parents discuss. ISAACS is 
           getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry gates 
           are open and the noise subsides. Almost without noticing 
           HANNA’s arm is tightening slightly round SOPHIE’s neck, as 
           if she could break it any second. Then just as SOPHIE feels 
           the discomfort, RACHEL turns to HANNA.
                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        We can give you a lift to Lille. 
                        OK?

           HANNA releases her arm. SOPHIE smiles triumphantly. EMIL 
           suppresses a protest. HANNA quickly climbs into the car. 
           THIERRY turns to SOPHIE and speaks in French.

                                 THIERRY 
                        That’s your top she’s wearing.

           SOPHIE smiles as they climb in.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why, do you fancy her?

           And they drive off.

           INT. KITCHEN. SMALL HOUSE IN FRANCE.

           A well-dressed seventy year old German woman is sitting 
           alone drinking tea in the kitchen of an immaculately tidy 
           and conventional suburban house built in the 60’s.  
           Pictures of children and grandchildren on the walls of the 
           kitchen. Through the window and over the fence she sees her 
           male 70 year old neighbour pruning his plants for spring. A 
           cat leaps on to the table as the woman sits listening to 
           the French radio. The cat’s ears prick as...

           There is a door-bell ring. The woman, SARA FISCHER gets up 
           slowly and approaches the door. A female figure in the 
           glass.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        Who is it?

           No reply. She opens the door a small amount. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Hello Sara.

           SARA looks in slight fear. MARISSA WIEGLER.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        What do you want?

                                 MARISSA 
                        Has Erik Heller been in touch 
                        with you?

                                 SARA FISCHER 
                        Erik Heller is dead.

                                 MARISSA
                        No. He’s not. 
           She smiles.

           INT. KITCHEN. SMALL HOUSE IN FRANCE.

           MARISSA sits at the kitchen table as a shaken SARA FISCHER 
           makes coffee in as civilised a way as she can manage. 
           MARISSA watches through the window the neighbour pruning 
           his dead plants from the winter. An atmosphere of quiet 
           menace pervades the room as MARISSA watches the old woman 
           make the coffee.

                                 MARISSA 
                        It’s a very nice set-up you have 
                        here.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        Would you like milk with your 
                        coffee?

           She looks across nervously. MARISSA nods.

                                 MARISSA
                        Hot.

           SARA heats the milk, then turns.

                                 SARA FISCHER 
                        Please I don’t want anything to 
                        do with this. I have a new life 
                        now.

                                 MARISSA
                        So I can see.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        What do you want?

                                 MARISSA
                        Everything you still kept from 
                        the old one.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        But I have nothing from those 
                        days.

           MARISSA looks at the man pruning his roses.

                                 MARISSA
                        I don’t suppose he knows about 
                        your previous life, does he?

           She smiles. Real threat here. SARA looks at her in fear.
           EXT. GARDEN OF SMALL FRENCH HOUSE.

           SARA leads MARISSA to the shed at the bottom of the garden. 
           She unlocks it.

           INT. GARDEN SHED. SMALL HOUSE IN FRANCE.

           MARISSA enters the shed. It’s packed full of memorabilia. 
           Photo albums, files. MARISSA looks at the walls. Pictures 
           of Sara in Stasi uniform. With Heller. Other men. Heller 
           with other Stasi men. In groups. The network. MARISSA takes 
           out a camera and takes photos.

                                 SARA FISCHER
                        It’s just a memory. Nostalgia.

           MARISSA takes some more photos.

                                 MARISSA
                        Someone will come to collect all 
                        of these.

           SARA bows her head. MARISSA finishes her photographs. Turns 
           to the old woman in her little suburban garden.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        I thought I’d won you all over. 
                        How naive I was. 

           She heads out of the shed and walks down the garden. We 
           hear the front door click shut. A very frightened SARA 
           FISCHER remains in the shed, trembling. She stares at the 
           pictures of the young and handsome ERIK HELLER. 

           EXT. / INT BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN

           ERIK HELLER, twenty years older, more worn, more rugged, in 
           the suit in which we last saw him leaving Hanna in the 
           forest, enters a tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and 
           walks up to the counter. He checks around to make sure no 
           one is following him before talking to the portly BUTCHER.

                                 HELLER
                        Three pounds of goose fat.

           EXT. SOUTH SWEDISH COAST

           A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. ERIK 
           HELLER arrives. He has a rucsac on his back. 

           HELLER undresses and puts his suit and shirt in a plastic 
           bag that he knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucsac
           and puts it on his back.
           Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he 
           bought in the butcher’s. He stares across the water towards 
           DENMARK in the distance.

           EXT. SPANISH MOTORWAY. DAY.

           Establisher as the French family’s car makes its way on a 
           fast-moving motorway up through Spain on their way home. 
           The car comes off the motorway and heads into a service 
           station.

           EXT. SERVICE STATION ON MOTORWAY. SPAIN. DAY.

           Emil is filling up the car with petrol. The radio is 
           playing quietly in the car. RACHEL is asleep. THIERRY is 
           buried in his Nintendo DS. Only SOPHIE is watching, 
           listening to music on her IPOD, but staring out of the 
           window at HANNA who is in the service station. And what 
           Sophie notices through the window of the service station, 
           is that HANNA is stealing. A postcard, a stamp-book. A pen. 
           All stolen with utter silent skill. Then HANNA is writing 
           on the postcard, putting it in an envelope, along with the 
           photograph of herself, and posting it with a stamp. It’s 
           like watching a ballet to the tune of whatever is on 
           SOPHIE’s Ipod. SOPHIE watches amazed and impressed. Just 
           who is this girl?

           HANNA returns to the car. Smiles at SOPHIE. Nothing to be 
           said. 

           Now EMIL has paid and gets back into the car. He has no 
           idea what has just happened.

                                 EMIL
                        All done. Let’s go.

           HANNA smiles at SOPHIE. She can’t help liking the fact that 
           Sophie is so impressed. It’s a new feeling. The respect of 
           one’s peers.

           INT. CAR. SPAIN. DAY.

           In the car as we drive along. HANNA looking at the arid 
           Spanish landscape. Wind in her hair. SOPHIE is listening to 
           the IPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE takes one earphone out 
           of her own ear and puts it in HANNA’s. MUSIC pours into 
           HANNA’s ear and she jumps slightly. SOPHIE smiles but says 
           nothing. HANNA listens to the music. Likes it. Feels its 
           rhythm. The two girls together. But interrupted by:

                                 RACHEL
                        This is all my fault Hanna. I’m 
                        afraid of flying. 
                                 SOPHIE
                        I think it’s good we came by car. 
                        Otherwise we wouldn’t have met 
                        Hanna.

           But EMIL is still intent on finding out more.

                                 EMIL
                        So you live in Leipzig?

                                 HANNA
                        With my father. And my dog Trudi.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You have a dog? That’s so cute.

                                 HANNA
                        He shits on the carpet.

           This as if she has never said it before. They crack up. 
           Girls together. The parents raise eyebrows to each other.

                                 RACHEL
                        You must have school on Monday.

           HANNA nods. 

                                 HANNA
                        Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.

                                 SOPHIE
                        School sucks.

                                 EMIL
                        Sophie.

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah it does.

           SOPHIE giggles. HANNA smiles, enjoying the lie.

                                 RACHEL
                        And you get on well with your 
                        father?

           She’s fishing. HANNA realises RACHEL is after answers. She 
           looks to SOPHIE.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Stop asking stupid questions mum. 
                        Leave her alone.

           SOPHIE flashes a conspiratorial smile at HANNA who returns 
           it. SOPHIE is convinced she’s found a new friend. In the 
           front RACHEL and EMIL exchange a glance.
           INT. HARBOUR CONTROL. MALAGA. SOUTHERN SPAIN.

           In a small harbourside office, ISAACS is sitting smoking. 
           His HENCHMEN have tied up the Port Security Camera Monitor 
           who is watching in terror. ISAACS smiles at him.

                                 ISAACS
                        I’d have a little siesta if I 
                        were you. We could be a while.

           ISAACS and his henchman REYNOLDS continue to look at the 
           ferry CCTV.

           EXT. SPANISH HOTEL.

           The car is parked and the French family are entering the 
           hotel with HANNA. HANNA looks around and sees a SPANISH BOY 
           standing in the car park looking at her, fancying her. 
           HANNA not used to this feeling of being looked at. This is 
           FELICIANO. He is handsome. She looks away and enters the 
           hotel.

           INT. SPANISH HOTEL.

           The family are at reception. HANNA with them. HANNA looks 
           at the smart, rather corporate hotel. It’s not like 
           anything she’s ever seen.

                                 EMIL
                        Emil Domerc. We have two rooms 
                        booked for the night.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes. Two adults, two children, 
                        correct?

                                 SOPHIE
                        But we have an extra child.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        There is no bed.

                                 SOPHIE
                        That’s ok. She’ll stay with me.

           She smiles at HANNA. They make their way to a lift. HANNA 
           stops as the door opens. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t you like lifts? Would you 
                        rather take the stairs?

           HANNA nods. SOPHIE smiles.
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll come with you.

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           THIERRY is in his bed. SOPHIE is sitting on Sophie’s bed 
           looking on her laptop at an internet webpage about pop 
           stars etc.

           HANNA sits on a couch eating popcorn. She likes the taste. 
           The glow of the television flickers across Hanna’s 
           mesmerised face.

                                 HANNA
                        Have you ever seen this before?

           SOPHIE turns to the television.

           ON SCREEN: Tom and Jerry up to their old tricks.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Uh like a thousand times. 

           Hanna’s eyes widen.

           ON SCREEN: Tom chases Jerry until, finally, he leaps and 
           slams into a wall.

           Hanna pops back in shock. A hard CHUCKLE bursts from her 
           lower intestines.

                                 HANNA
                        HA-HA!... 

                                 THIERRY
                        Haven’t you ever seen a TV? 

                                 HANNA
                        We don’t have one.

                                 THIERRY
                        So what do you do in the 
                        evenings?

           HANNA ignores him and watches the screen again as Tom 
           shatters into a thousand pieces. SOPHIE is on the internet, 
           looking at a pop starlet.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hanna look. This is Alizee. She’s 
                        gorgeous. She’s so thin. A real 
                        “Lolita!”

           HANNA comes to have a look.
                                 HANNA
                        Why is she bending over?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why d’you think? To show her ass 
                        of course! Thierry. Turn the TV 
                        off and go to sleep.

                                 THIERRY
                        I’ll go to sleep if you shut up!

           SOPHIE in a triumph of secrecy:

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well we’re going out in a moment 
                        so we won’t disturb you any more.

           Thierry desperate to know more.

                                 THIERRY
                        Where are you going?

                                 SOPHIE
                        None of your business.

                                 THIERRY
                        I’ll tell mum.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’ll kill you! (to HANNAH) Come 
                        in the bathroom. Come on.

                                 HANNA
                        Why?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Come on! 

           She drags HANNA into the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM. CONT.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I am going to make you look SO 
                        HOT!

           She starts to makeover HANNA’s face. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God your eyes look amazing. 
                        I don’t know why I’m doing this, 
                        you’re going to steal all the 
                        best guys off of me.

                                 HANNA
                        What do you mean?
                                 SOPHIE
                        Don’t play the innocent with me 
                        my little thief. 

           A smile between them. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. 
           She has suddenly become sexualised - mascara, eye liner, 
           lipstick. A woman. The feelings this provokes in her are 
           exciting but also disquieting.

           SOPHIE finishes HANNA’s face, looks at her in the mirror.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Alizee eat your heart out.

           EXT. HOTEL CAR PARK. NIGHT.

           As dark descends, SOPHIE and HANNA sneak out of the back 
           door of the hotel together and move secretly between the 
           parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of SOPHIE’s clothes, 
           including a short skirt and has the make-up on. They are 
           excited, SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.

                                 HANNA
                        I can’t walk in this.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Come on you look supercool.

                                 HANNA
                        Where are we going?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Shhhhh! Into town. 

           HANNA uncomfortable. Is it too dangerous?

                                 HANNA
                        I’m not sure. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        OK then I’ll go on my own.

           She heads off down the road. HANNA stops for a second. Then 
           thinks - fuck it - and follows.

           EXT. DANISH COASTLINE. NIGHT.

           Rain pours down in the darkness on to a beach on the Danish 
           coast. The water ripples and we see a figure come out of 
           the water. ERIK HELLER. His lungs bursting with the 
           exertion. Water dripping from his body. He collapses for a 
           while then stumbles across the beach. He approaches a car 
           park by the beach. Suddenly he sees a POLICE CAR swinging 
           into the car park. He tries to run but too late as its 
           headlights illuminate him. 
           HELLER starts to walk away but the car starts to follow 
           him. HELLER stops and turns towards the police car. The two 
           policemen get out and approach HELLER who stares at them.

           INT. SPANISH NIGHT CLUB. NIGHT.

           SOPHIE pulls HANNA into a loud, packed provincial Spanish 
           night club. HANNA not used to the pumping music. SOPHIE 
           goes to the bar, HANNA following.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No age limit here!

           She orders some drinks. Hands one to HANNA. HANNA sees the 
           boy from the car park across the dance floor. He is looking 
           at her. Now she is approached fast from the other direction 
           by another couple of SPANISH LADS. They speak in Spanish.

                                 SPANISH LAD 1
                        Where are you from?

                                 HANNA
                        Me?

                                 SPANISH LAD 1
                        Yes of course you? Who else?

                                 SPANISH LAD 2
                        Don’t you know where you’re from? 
                        She’s pretty vacant this one huh!

                                 SPANISH LAD 1
                        But she’s pretty pretty. Aren’t 
                        you?

           He smiles at her. Fancies her. HANNA’s anger rises here. 
           It’s as if we see a click into a different person, wildly 
           violent. She is about to attack. But then SOPHIE 
           intervenes.

                                 SOPHIE (IN FRENCH)
                        Get lost tosser.

                                 SPANISH LAD 1
                        French! You’re French.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hey genius, how’d you work that 
                        out?

           She grabs HANNA’s hand.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Come on. Let’s lose the losers.

           She leads HANNA to a bar-high table near the dance floor. 
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Drink. To our friendship.

                                 HANNA
                        What is this?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Vodka cocktail. 

                                 HANNA
                        I shouldn’t.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why not?

                                 HANNA
                        Alcohol slows the reactions.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who told you that?

                                 HANNA
                        My father.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        And are you always going to do 
                        what daddy says?

           A challenge. HANNA looks at her and drinks, it tastes 
           bitter and she winces slightly. SOPHIE laughs then grabs 
           HANNA.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Come on.

           They start to dance. HANNA has not danced like this before 
           and is hesitant. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Dance!

           HANNA dances nervously at first but swigs her drink down 
           and begins to enjoy herself. Her body starts to move with 
           increasing energy to the music. Her dance becomes animal, 
           wild in its intensity and SOPHIE whoops as she watches her.

           INT. MALAGA PORT OFFICE. NIGHT.

           The Port Security Officer is still tied up. Beers, crisps 
           and fag ends litter the small sweaty office as two of 
           Isaacs’ henchmen snooze on the floor. ISAACS himself 
           watches the screen. His face has lit up.
           This is because he has suddenly found footage of HANNA and 
           SOPHIE laughing as they come in and out of the photography 
           booth. ISAACS watches quietly, focusing on the two girls’ 
           faces.

           INT. SPANISH NIGHT CLUB. LATER.

           SOPHIE and HANNA are sitting at a table, after a long 
           dance. Exhausted, slightly drunk. HANNA not used to it. 

                                 HANNA
                        I feel strange. Everything is 
                        tingling.

           She laughs. A new feeling. She has not laughed like this.

                                 SOPHIE
                        We have to go in an hour. Enjoy 
                        it while you can.

                                 HANNA
                        Why is that boy looking at me?

           SOPHIE turns. The handsome Spanish boy FELICIANO, from the 
           car park is looking at her, accompanied by a friend. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Take a wild guess. They’re coming 
                        over. Play it cool.

           FELICIANO approaches with the friend. The friend eyes up 
           SOPHIE. FELICIANO talks to HANNA.

                                 FELICIANO
                        Hi. 

                                 HANNA
                        Hello.

           HANNA not sure what to say. Shy suddenly.

                                 FELICIANO
                        You dance well. What’s your name?

                                 HANNA
                        Hanna.

                                 FELICIANO
                        Have you been here before?

                                 SOPHIE
                        We’re always coming here aren’t 
                        we?

           Playing it cool. HANNA joins in. Loving it.
                                 HANNA
                        Yeah we’re absolute regulars.

           SOPHIE giggles. HANNA laughs, drunk. FELICIANO takes 
           HANNA’s hand.

                                 FELICIANO
                        Do you want to take a walk?

           EXT. SPANISH URBAN PARK NEAR NIGHT CLUB.

           HANNA and FELICIANO are sitting on a bench in a small 
           SPANISH PARK in the town. HANNA intense, rigid as he tries 
           to kiss her.

                                 FELICIANO
                        Have you kissed a boy before?

           HANNA shakes her head.

                                 FELICIANO (CONT'D)
                        Open your mouth.

           She does. He kisses her. She responds. Fast.

                                 FELICIANO (CONT'D)
                        Slowly.

           She slows down. They kiss properly.

                                 FELICIANO (CONT'D)
                        Better.

           They kiss, lengthily. He holds her breast. HANNA’s reaction 
           is instant, making to grab him by the throat. Then she 
           stops herself. 

                                 HANNA
                        Sorry.

           FELICIANO retreats a little.

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        Please. Don’t.

           She grabs his hand, puts it to her breast. He looks at her. 
           They kiss again and she holds his hand against her breast. 
           Then she moves his hand down, between her legs. She is 
           being guided now by instinct. What she wants. She starts to 
           unbutton his trousers. Her passion is feral. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hanna!

           HANNA stops. SOPHIE looking at her. Shocked.
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        We have to go.

           HANNA stares at FELICIANO.

                                 HANNA
                        I want to stay.

                                 SOPHIE
                        We have to go. The hotel locks up 
                        at three.

           HANNA stares at SOPHIE.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Hanna! You don’t know him!

           HANNA gets up, walks away.

                                 FELICIANO
                        Can I see you again?

           HANNA does not turn. Walks away ahead of SOPHIE. Fast, 
           disturbed by the emotions she has felt. SOPHIE chases, for 
           a moment really shocked and angry.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What the hell do you think you 
                        were doing? 

                                 HANNA
                        It just felt right.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah eventually maybe! But not on 
                        a first date!

           A possibility of a real argument. HANNA furious. SOPHIE 
           suddenly diffuses as only teenagers can.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Christ I thought you were going 
                        to eat him alive!

           She giggles. HANNA smiles too. Then laughs. She makes a 
           fake “roar” sound. SOPHIE bursts into hysterics. They laugh 
           together as they drunkenly weave up the street.

           INT. SPANISH HOTEL. 3. A.M.

           The NIGHT RECEPTIONIST of the Spanish hotel looks up to see 
           a silhouetted man entering the hotel. Behind him another 
           man

                                 NIGHT RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?
           The man comes into the light. It is ISAACS and his sidekick 
           REYNOLDS.

                                 ISAACS
                        I’d like a twin room. With a 
                        balcony.

           EXT. DANISH COASTLINE. EARLY DAWN.

           MARISSA walks along a stunningly desolate patch of Danish 
           coastline. She approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on 
           the ground. WILLIS is there.

           MARISSA looks down.

           On the ground lie the two DANISH POLICEMEN. Their throats 
           have been cut.

                                 WILLIS
                        The Danes have spotter planes 
                        across the country. They’ve 
                        doubled the number of officers on 
                        the ground.

           MARISSA nods. Looks out at the sea. Did he really swim it?

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           A dark hotel bedroom. The sound of sleeping. The door 
           clicks open. ISAACS and REYNOLDS enter the room. They shine 
           a torch on the beds. Thierry sleeping. But no one else 
           there. ISAACS has a moment of confusion. Where is she? 
           Quietly he signals to REYNOLDS and they leave the room.

           A pause in the dark room. And then two giggling girls are 
           heard climbing up the balcony and entering the hotel room 
           through the bedroom window. HANNA and SOPHIE. Drunk and 
           entirely oblivious to how close that was to catastrophe.

           INT. SPANISH HOTEL ROOM. EARLY DAWN.

           HANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Can’t you sleep?

                                 HANNA
                        No.

           SOPHIE giggles.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re not in love are you?
                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Looked like you did to me...

                                 HANNA
                        Have you been in love?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh babe. A thousand times...

           HANNA smiles. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        No not really. I mean not REALLY.

           SOPHIE turns serious. Grabs her laptop.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey I want to add you to my 
                        Facebook friends. Then we can 
                        chat when you’re back in Leipzig.

           SOPHIE brings up Facebook. HANNA looks at her. Confused.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Aren’t you on Facebook?

                                 HANNA
                        What is it?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hello, it’s only how everyone
                        meets everyone! Hanna, what 
                        planet are you on? 

           SOPHIE giggles. HANNA smiles. SOPHIE nuzzles her face next 
           to HANNA’s.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Well then, I’ll have to come to 
                        Leipzig and visit you.

           HANNA stops smiling. Her loneliness rears up.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t you want me to?

           HANNA stares at her. Yes she wants her to but...

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t live in Leipzig. 

           SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her. 
                                 SOPHIE
                        What do you mean? Where do you 
                        live?

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know.

           This with a sadness. SOPHIE confused. HANNA suddenly, 
           quietly confides.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to Berlin. I have to 
                        meet my father at Wilhelm’s 
                        house. 

           Real need here. She has broken her confidence.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who’s he?

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know. 

           HANNA looking worried here. Serious. SOPHIE snuggles 
           closer.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why do you have to go there? 
                        Can’t you say?

                                 HANNA 
                        My father has been protecting me 
                        from people who were trying to 
                        hurt me.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What people?

                                 HANNA
                        He didn’t say.

           Suddenly she reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA 
           report. Shows it to Sophie. They read. Interfering 
           Sequence. Abnormal.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What is it?

                                 HANNA
                        I think it’s about me. What does 
                        it mean?

                                 SOPHIE
                        DNA is kind of how we’re made I 
                        think. I mean like who we are.
                                 HANNA
                        Why does it say Abnormal?

           They look at it.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Where did you get it?

           HANNA says nothing. She just can’t.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        You know what I think we should 
                        do with this?

           She scrunches it up. HANNA smiles, grabs the paper, rips it 
           into shreds and throws it in the toilet. She flushes it 
           down the toilet. SOPHIE laughs and HANNA laughs too. But 
           then HANNA looks suddenly terribly vulnerable, there are a 
           few tears on her cheek. SOPHIE kisses her, then takes a 
           bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Keep this. To remember me.

           HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never met anyone like you.

           Eye to eye. Teenage love here, intense. But it’s getting 
           too close, too painful.

                                 HANNA 
                        Go to sleep.

           SOPHIE nuzzles against HANNA. HANNA strokes her hair and 
           stares at the ceiling as SOPHIE starts to sleep. 

           Beside them we see that THIERRY has woken and has been 
           listening in the darkness.

           INT. DANISH HOSTEL. EARLY MORNING.

           ERIK HELLER walks into a small long-established family 
           hotel on a Danish road near the coast. He is in his 
           slightly dated suit he wore when he left the forest. A 
           sixty year old Danish woman stands behind the counter as if 
           she has stood there all her life. Which she has. He speaks 
           to her in Danish.

                                 ERIK
                        My name is Peter Olsson. I called 
                        yesterday. I have a booking for 
                        today.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes Mr Olsson.

                                 ERIK
                        I am sorry but I am not able to 
                        stay after all.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That’s all right. But some post 
                        came for you.

                                 ERIK
                        Thank you.

           He takes the letter. HANNA’s letter. Opens it. Reads the 
           postcard. “Holiday went as planned. See you at Wilhelm’s”. 
           In the envelope are two of the passport photos of Hanna 
           that she took on the ferry. ERIK smiles and pockets both.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        I stayed here fifteen years ago. 
                        It hasn’t changed. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        We don’t much like change here.

           He smiles at her. Then he leaves the hotel and walks down 
           the road.

           INT. CAR. FRANCE.

           The family are driving. HANNA in the middle of the back 
           seat. She is wearing SOPHIE’s bracelet and looks a bit 
           worse for wear. SOPHIE asleep. THIERRY in computer-game 
           world. Emil driving. RACHEL turns and asks quietly.

                                 RACHEL
                        So how was last night?

           HANNA looks at her. There’s enough in RACHEL’s eyes for it 
           to be clear RACHEL knows she and Sophie went out.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        I was young once too you know.

           HANNA smiles shyly. 

                                 HANNA
                        Were you like Sophie?

                                 RACHEL 
                        No, I was actually much more like 
                        you.

                                 HANNA
                        What am I like?
                                 RACHEL
                        More of a loner. But look at me 
                        now. Married, two kids...

           HANNA looks away hiding a sadness. Will she ever have that?

                                 HANNA
                        How long until you drop me off?

                                 RACHEL
                        This afternoon. From Lille you 
                        can get a train to Berlin. 
                        Leipzig’s just a few hours 
                        further.

           HANNA nods. But looks worried.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Do you not want to go home?

           HANNA does not know how to answer. Too complicated a 
           question. She looks out the window. Guilty that she feels 
           no longer sure she wants to return to Erik.

           HANNA feels a hand on hers. RACHEL, looking forward through 
           the windscreen, has reached back with her hand and placed 
           it on HANNA’s. A simple maternal gesture. EMIL pretending 
           not to notice. HANNA looks at the hand. Wants to put her 
           left hand on top. So wants to. But doesn’t. 

           Behind her we see another car following them. Isaacs’ car. 

           EXT. COPENHAGEN TRAIN STATION. MORNING.

           A commuter train pulls into Copenhagen train station and 
           amongst the morning commuters alighting the train, we see 
           ERIK HELLER. Still in the suit. He looks furtively around, 
           and tries to blend in with the crowd.

           Now we move to a POV from a walkway above the station. 
           Someone is watching HELLER as he tries to conceal himself 
           within the throng. A DANISH OPERATIVE, hidden on a metal 
           walkway above the platform.

                                 OPERATIVE 1
                        This is Henson. I think I have 
                        him.

           On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters. He 
           walks past the ticket collectors, checking for any 
           suspicious behaviour, any “tells”.

           As he moves we hear a CIA voice.
                                 CIA VOICE
                        Subject may be armed. Proceed 
                        with caution. Wait until he’s 
                        clear of the crowds. Then deal 
                        with him.

           HELLER walks past an AGENT posing as a commuter but lingers 
           on him. Something not right about him.

           HELLER enters a small bar. He walks through the bar into 
           the toilets, finds a FIRE EXIT and walks through the fire 
           exit.

                                 AGENT (V.O.) 
                        He’s entered a bar. Watch the 
                        back exit.

           HELLER comes out of the fire exit, finds himself in a goods 
           yard adjoining the train station. He walks through the 
           goods yard, then suddenly, and apparently for no reason, 
           stops dead, then throws himself behind a skip of empty 
           bottles.

           As he does two SPECIAL OPS run round the corner into the 
           goods yard. They radio in.

                                 SPECIAL OPS
                        He’s not here.

           They scour the yard. Closer to HELLER’s hiding place. 
           HELLER suddenly jumps out of the hiding place and takes the 
           two men on. After a fight in which he injures his leg, he 
           kills both of them. Then takes the radio and radios in, in 
           a perfect imitation of the voice he just heard.

                                 ERIK
                        He’s going back in the bar. We 
                        have him cornered.

           Then he turns and walks, limping, the other way out of the 
           goods yard. The radio suddenly responds.

                                 VOICE ON RADIO
                        OK bring him to Marissa Wiegler. 
                        She wants to talk to him.

           HELLER stops dead. MARISSA WIEGLER is alive...  He speaks 
           again in a perfect imitation.

                                 ERIK
                        Is that what she said?

                                 VOICE ON RADIO
                        That’s what she said.

           ERIK stands in shock. 
           INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT.

           ISAACS’s car draws up to a lovely roadside family French 
           restaurant. ISAACS gets out. He looks between bushes and 
           sees...

           The FAMILY and HANNA are dining at the restaurant. They are 
           in a covered conservatory, the late winter sun is shining 
           and they are having a great time. Laughter, jokes. End of 
           holiday meal. 

                                 EMIL
                        No no wine for you!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Just a glass dad. Je t’en prie!!!

                                 EMIL
                        No way darling. Hanna, we let her 
                        have red wine at New Year. She 
                        fell asleep at eleven!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Dad you’re embarrassing me!

                                 EMIL
                        Well it’s true! Rachel, back me 
                        up!

                                 RACHEL
                        And then when she did wake up she 
                        did this funny dance.

           RACHEL does the dance and they all laugh.

                                 HANNA
                        That wasn’t how she danced last 
                        night in the club.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Don’t you dare!

                                 RACHEL
                        Go on Hanna. Do it!

           HANNA, loving the feeling of it all, does the Sophie sexy 
           dance. They all laugh. SOPHIE goes red but laughs too. 
           RACHEL does the dance. EMIL does the dance. SOPHIE does the 
           dance. HANNA and SOPHIE fall into each other’s arms 
           laughing. HANNA looks at SOPHIE - a true friend. Then 
           THIERRY speaks with the seriousness that only a ten year 
           old can muster.

                                 THIERRY
                        My family is so frivolous.
           They pause and look at him. Then all burst into laughter. 
           HANNA laughing, sees RACHEL looking at her with a deep 
           love. HANNA looks into the eyes of this mother she never 
           had.

           ISAACS smokes his cigarette and watches.

           INT. HOTEL INTERCONTINENTAL COPENHAGEN.

           MARISSA sits, quietly furious in her room. WILLIS 
           approaches her. Other officers, security etc. Rain on the 
           windows outside.

                                 WILLIS
                        We’ve got roadblocks on every 
                        route out. We’ll find him.

           MARISSA does not respond. The hotel phone rings.

                                 MARISSA
                        Yes.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Madam this is reception. I have 
                        Erik Heller on the line.

           MARISSA stops dead. She signals to WILLIS and the others to 
           leave. She is left alone.

                                 MARISSA
                        Put him on.

           The line connects. 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        How did you get this number? 

           A phone booth in a Danish park. ERIK HELLER shivering in 
           the cold as icy rain falls behind him. 

                                 ERIK
                        I have one of your radios. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Then you’ll know I’m very much 
                        alive.

                                 ERIK 
                        But so is she.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Erik she’s not safe to be out 
                        there.

                                 ERIK
                        Safe for who?
                                 MARISSA
                        For anybody. We have no idea how 
                        she may behave. You need to give 
                        her back to us.

           ERIK stands in the rain.

                                 ERIK
                        And then what will you do with 
                        her?

                                 MARISSA
                        Hanna was part of something that 
                        should never have happened. We 
                        both know that and we both know 
                        she shouldn’t be alone. Just tell 
                        me where you are meeting her.

           The line goes dead. MARISSA sits alone.

           EXT. RURAL FRENCH ROAD.

           HANNA in the back of the car, smiles sleepily as her head 
           rests on SOPHIE’s shoulder. RACHEL driving. EMIL snoozing. 
           HANNA and SOPHIE’s hands are entwined.

           Behind them we see Isaacs’s car. But HANNA is unaware. For 
           the first time her defenses are down.

           EXT. WAR MUSEUM VERDUN.

           The family’s car draws up at the War museum in Fleury near 
           Verdun.

           INT. WAR MUSEUM VERDUN.

           The family enter the small museum. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        More “education” dad?

                                 RACHEL
                        Keep your voice down Sophie.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m only joking. I know this 
                        place means a lot to you.

           SOPHIE goes to her dad and gives him a hug.

                                 EMIL
                        Look at that, Rachel. A sign of 
                        affection from my daughter.
                                 SOPHIE
                        You know I love you really. Even 
                        though you’re an idiot. 

           She hugs him. He holds her and strokes her head. RACHEL 
           smiles too, a family moment. HANNA watches this. It’s a 
           moment of acute isolation for her, seeing the family 
           together. HANNA turns away and enters a room in the museum.

           INT. MUSEUM MEMORIAL ROOM.

           HANNA looks at the memorial. The list of men who died. 
           Hanna runs her hand along the names. She sees an old woman 
           sitting in silent mourning by the epitaph. The meaning of 
           death.

           SOPHIE’s voice.

                                 SOPHIE (O.C.)
                        You ok?

           HANNA is buried in thought. But makes no reply. Instead she 
           reads.

                                 HANNA 
                        Thirty thousand men killed in one 
                        day.

           SOPHIE looks at her quietly. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        What is it?

           HANNA replies whilst still reading the epitaph so we don’t 
           see her face.

                                 HANNA 
                        I don’t want to leave.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well don’t then. We all want you 
                        to stay.

           HANNA turns to look at SOPHIE. She sees that she has tears 
           in her eyes. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh Hanna...

           She goes to hug her. Then HANNA suddenly bristles. A sense 
           of something.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        What?
                                 HANNA
                        Can’t you hear it?

                                 SOPHIE
                        No.

           HANNA looks out the window to the car park and indeed they 
           both suddenly see ISAACS’ car enter the car park. Instantly 
           HANNA is on high alert. She watches as the four men get out 
           of the car and approach the family’s car. Among them - 
           ISAACS - directing operations.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 HANNA
                        Nothing. Go back to your mum and 
                        dad.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No way.

           But HANNA is walking out of the room and up some stairs. 
           SOPHIE follows. 

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Hanna!

           They are in a quiet upstairs part of the museum, and HANNA 
           can see the rest of the family downstairs. EMIL is reading 
           the history while THIERRY hugs his mother.

           Suddenly HANNA sees down the stairwell to two of Isaacs’s 
           henchmen entering the museum. She quickly moves away across 
           the room. 

                                 HANNA
                        Get away from me.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why?

                                 HANNA
                        I’m not safe to be with.

           Now there is a voice behind her. HANNA stops dead.

                                 ISAACS
                        Hanna? We have your father. You 
                        should come with us.

           SOPHIE stares.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who is he?

           HANNA does not move.
                                 ISAACS
                        Erik is back at the hotel. He 
                        wants to see you.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        It’s all over Hanna. Everything’s 
                        ok.

           REYNOLDS moves forward. Hanna double-kicks him in the 
           chest. SOPHIE screams. REYNOLDS stumbles to the ground.

           HANNA runs back across the room towards the stairwell. Now 
           HENCHMAN 3, Scottish and hard as nails, blocks the path.

                                 HENCHMAN 3
                        I don’t think so.

           Hanna leaps the railing and free-falls twenty feet into the 
           main vestibule. Screams from a couple of tourists.

           MUSEUM SECURITY hears the noise and approaches.

                                 SECURITY
                        What do you think you’re doing?

           HANNA elbows SECURITY. From the mezzanine above SOPHIE sees 
           REYNOLDS who is running down the stairs.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hanna!

           HANNA turns just in time to confront him. She grabs an old 
           first world war bayonet that is on the wall and smashes it 
           against REYNOLDS who collapses to the ground. Now HENCHMAN 
           4 enters. He lunges at her, ripping her shoulder but she 
           kicks him off, smashes one of the museum chairs over his 
           head and out of pure instinct, grabs his gun.

           HANNA takes the gun in her hand, her face coils in rage and 
           determination. Erik’s training. HANNA is about to shoot 
           him...

           When she sees SOPHIE staring at her in horror. Everything 
           slows down. HANNA’s face melts. Utter confusion in her 
           eyes.

           A strange moment of quiet. Two 14 year old girls looking at 
           each other. 

           Then HANNA drops the gun and runs back up the stairs past 
           Sophie. She returns into the upstairs gallery and sprints 
           through several museum rooms, past bewildered tourists, 
           past photos of war, memorials, weapons and war memorabilia. 
           She reaches the final room. She runs to the window. 

           HANNA turns from the window to see SOPHIE staring at her. 
           There is an eerie silence. 
                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Who are you?

           HANNA shakes her head. 

                                 HANNA
                        I can’t tell you. 

           SOPHIE approaches.

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        Don’t come near me.  

           On the other side of the room HANNA sees a Fire Exit. She 
           dashes to it, quickly smashes open the Fire Exit door. The 
           alarm sounds.

           HANNA turns and raises her hand slightly in a mute 
           farewell. SOPHIE stares at her. 

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Wait.

           But there’s not time. HANNA turns and with a brief look 
           back closes the door behind her.

           SOPHIE stares after her as RACHEL approaches.

           EXT. FRENCH FIELD

           HANNA is sprinting, full tilt across a field, towards a 
           railway line. Busting a gut. 

           She reaches a railway, then sees a station up ahead. A 
           train is leaving. She sprints, faster than she has ever 
           run, lungs bursting, along the railway line towards the 
           small station. She leaps up on to the train as it departs, 
           people staring at her in amazement.

           INT. FRENCH TRAIN. DAY. CONT.

           HANNA looks out of the window as outside the Museum, ISAACS 
           escorts the DOMERC family towards his car. She feels the 
           loss of the family, her chance of an ordinary life 
           disappearing as the train rolls onwards. Holding back the 
           tears, only one life possible now, onwards towards her 
           father.
           INT. FRENCH POLICE STATION.

           The DOMERC family are ushered into an interrogation room. 
           They sit together. 

           Now a door opens and ISAACS AND MARISSA enter.

                                 ISAACS
                        I’m sorry to delay your trip home 
                        but we’d like to ask you some 
                        questions.

           He smiles. MARISSA steps forward.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Tell me about Hanna.

           EXT. LILLE STATION. EVENING.

           HANNA gets off the small local train with a suitcase we 
           have not seen before.

           She looks up at the giant signboard showing trains. There 
           is a train to BERLIN. She moves quickly to a ticket office.

           Back inside the train that HANNA has just left, an 
           attractive young woman is shouting at a guard about her 
           luggage having gone missing.

           INT. TRAIN. NIGHT.

           The train is hurtling through the late February night 
           towards BERLIN.

           HANNA sits in the compartment in new clothes. They are 
           fashionable, rather more sophisticated than what she has 
           worn before and she looks older as a result. The door 
           opens. HANNA instantly recoils. But it is only the TICKET 
           COLLECTOR that enters.

                                 TICKET COLLECTOR
                        Ticket please.

           HANNA shows her ticket.

                                 TICKET COLLECTOR (CONT'D)
                        Are you alone?

           She nods.

                                 TICKET COLLECTOR (CONT'D)
                        If you are tired, you can fold 
                        the seat over to make a bed.
           He does so.

                                 HANNA
                        Thanks.

                                 TICKET COLLECTOR
                        Sweet dreams.

           The COLLECTOR leaves. HANNA stares at the ceiling. No 
           chance of sleep tonight.

           EXT. DANISH COUNTRYSIDE.

           A Danish bus drives out of the city, reaches a roadblock. 
           The Bus Driver, fat, in cap and dark spectacles, stops the 
           bus. On pour Danish police. Every car is being looked at. 
           The driver asks in Danish one of the policemen.

                                 DRIVER
                        Manhunt?

                                 POLICE
                        Guy killed two coastguards. You 
                        heading to Aufsburg? Keep an eye 
                        out.

           He hands him a picture of ERIK HELLER.

           On the bus the police check all the passengers. Then they 
           nod and leave the bus which drives on out of Copenhagen. 
           The driver turns the radio back on. Looks in the mirror. 
           It’s only now we see that the driver is ERIK HELLER.

           INT. FRENCH POLICE STATION. 

           ISAACS and MARISSA talking to the family.

                                 RACHEL
                        I told you, she said she lived in 
                        Leipzig. She went to the Klaus 
                        Kohle Gymnasium.

                                 ISAACS
                        There is no Klaus Kohle
                        Gymnasium. It closed five years 
                        ago.

           Shock on Rachel’s face.

                                 MARISSA
                        Did she give any idea of where 
                        she was going?
                                 EMIL
                        Who are you? Why have you brought 
                        us here?

           MARISSA shows him her official authorisation.

                                 MARISSA
                        I work for the American Central 
                        Intelligence Agency. We need to 
                        find Hanna for her own 
                        protection.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I think she needs protecting from 
                        you.

                                 RACHEL
                        Don’t be stupid Sophie. 

                                 EMIL
                        What has she done? 

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s not what she’s done. It’s 
                        what her father’s done.

           MARISSA passes a photo of the two dead DANISH POLICEMEN. 
           The family go silent.

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        Three days ago Erik Heller killed 
                        two Danish policemen.

                                 EMIL
                        Where is he now?

           Pause.

                                 MARISSA
                        He’s still at large. He’s a 
                        danger to Hanna.

           Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa 
           notices.

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        If you know anything it all, it’s 
                        vital you tell us for her own 
                        safety. We’re worried about her.

           But SOPHIE doesn’t say a word. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Sophie?

           Still nothing. They all look at her. Thierry suddenly 
           speaks.
                                 THIERRY
                        She’s going to Berlin. To 
                        Wilhelm’s house.

                                 SOPHIE (TO THIERRY)
                        I’ll kill you!

                                 RACHEL
                        How did you know that? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You traitor!

           SOPHIE lunges at THIERRY but EMIL pushes her back.

                                 EMIL
                        Sophie for God’s sake.

                                 RACHEL
                        What has she told you?

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Nothing.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Is that all she said? Wilhelm’s 
                        house?

           THIERRY nods. SOPHIE refuses to speak. Loyal to the last.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sophie her father is a violent  
                        man, he could hurt her.

           SOPHIE confused, looking at the photo of the dead men.

                                 SOPHIE
                        She said he was protecting her 
                        from danger.

                                 RACHEL
                        He would say that. 

           RACHEL turns to MARISSA

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Will you make sure he doesn’t 
                        hurt her? Please.

           She stares at MARISSA who bats it back with utter sincerity 
           as ISAACS stands beside her.

                                 MARISSA
                        We’ll do everything we can.
           EXT. BERLIN RAILWAY STATION.

           A cold late winter’s day as HANNA, in her new clothes, 
           stands in the railway station. It is packed with people, 
           and she is disorientated by the sheer mass of humanity. She 
           looks out for anyone following her, sees German police. She 
           enters the Ladies restrooms.

           INT. RESTROOMS BERLIN STATION.

           HANNA enters the restrooms. They are lit by UV light to 
           prevent drug use. She stares at the unusual light - it’s 
           new to her. She goes to a mirror, checks her appearance, 
           adding make-up for disguise. Then she spots something in 
           the mirror that shocks her. A small fluorescent mark on 
           both sides of her face, only visible in the UV light. She 
           looks at the marks in alarm.

           Then out of instinct she turns and pulls up her top 
           revealing her back. Two fluorescent lines stretching right 
           down her back. HANNA looks in horror.

           Then she turns to see a middle aged woman also in the 
           restrooms, looking at her in amazement.

           HANNA pulls down her top and walks very fast towards the 
           exit. 

           EXT. BERLIN AIRPORT. / INT. CAR.

           MARISSA exits a helicopter at BERLIN airfield carrying a 
           small briefcase. Cold, wintry. She walks fast to a waiting 
           car. Gets in. ISAACS is waiting inside.

                                 ISAACS
                        I’ve looked through Heller’s 
                        contacts from the 1980’s. There’s 
                        no one called Wilhelm.

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s because Wilhelm’s dead. He 
                        died two hundred years ago.

           She shows ISAACS one of the photos she took at SARA 
           FISCHER’S house. ISAACS looks at a photo of two men outside 
           an unusual Berlin building. The men are a young ERIK HELLER 
           and an older man who we will later realise is KLAUS 
           KNEPFLER. The house is very odd - we see fairy tale 
           features - trolls, witches, fairies.

                                 ISAACS
                        What the hell is this?

           MARISSA smiles slightly.
                                 MARISSA 
                        That’s his house.

           EXT. BERLIN STREET

           HANNA, still shocked by seeing the markings on her skin, 
           arrives in a taxi outside the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE. It’s the 
           house from the photo, a tourist attraction, slightly kitsch-
           folk, with lots of fairy tale decor, kids entering and 
           leaving. HANNA stands on the street in deep anticipation. 
           Cars pour by as HANNA gathers herself. Then she enters the 
           building.

           INT. WILHELM GRIMM’S HOUSE

           HANNA approaches the reception desk. She speaks in perfect 
           English.

                                 HANNA
                        Excuse me. I’m looking for Erik 
                        Heller.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Does he work here?

                                 HANNA
                        No.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, I don’t understand. Do 
                        you want to go into the house?

           HANNA shakes her head. She hides a terrible sense of 
           disappointment. Then: a voice.

                                 KNEPFLER
                        Excuse me young lady?

           She turns. A sixty-five year old man is looking at her. It 
           is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small, 
           with a wiry intensity.

                                 HANNA
                        Are you Wilhelm Grimm?

                                 KNEPFLER
                        Not exactly. Come this way.

           He leads her into the office.

                                 KNEPFLER (CONT’D)
                        You are Hanna?

           HANNA nods. KNEPFLER looks at her, quietly moved.
                                 KNEPFLER (CONT’D)
                        I am Herr Knepfler. I run the 
                        house. Erik used to come here a 
                        great deal. 

                                 HANNA
                        Have you heard from him?

           He nods.

                                 KNEPFLER
                        You must wait. He will be here 
                        soon.

           HANNA stares at him.

                                 HANNA
                        Was it you who sent him the 
                        newspapers?

           KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her some money, and new 
           identities, ID cards. 

                                 KNEPFLER 
                        Here is some money. And this is 
                        your new name.  

           HANNA looks at the ID cards. To her amazement the photo she 
           sent Erik is in one of the ID cards - with a new name - 
           ANNA-MARIE ELKAN. She takes a deep breath.

                                 HANNA
                        What is this?

                                 KNEPFLER
                        We have an apartment ready for 
                        you in the south of the country. 
                        The car will take you there 
                        straight away. You will be based 
                        there from now on.

                                 HANNA 
                        Who are you?

                                 KNEPFLER
                        We are old friends of your 
                        father. And now we are friends of 
                        you. Your father will explain 
                        everything.

           He says this with a deep meaning. HANNA does not 
           understand.  Then she senses something. And indeed two cars 
           are approaching the house. 

           KNEPFLER looks at her. KNEPFLER turns to the RECEPTIONIST.
                                 KNEPFLER (CONT’D)
                        You never saw her. Clear?

           The RECEPTIONIST nods, scared. KNEPFLER leads HANNA up some 
           stairs into the fairy tale house, kitschily made out with 
           references to all the Grimm Stories. Dolls, monsters, 
           witches. Below several OFFICERS, led by MARISSA and WILLIS 
           enter but HANNA does not see them as she is led further up 
           the house. OFFICERS start to spread through the house.

                                 KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
                        Go through the bedroom, take the 
                        door at the back. It leads on to 
                        the roof. Go to the Heine Hotel. 
                        He’ll meet you there.

           HANNA nods. She moves fast across the writer’s 19th century 
           bedroom, complete with wooden desk, drawings of fairy tale 
           characters. But as she is about to reach the back door, she 
           senses something. Forest training. She ducks down as 
           OFFICERS suddenly pour through the back door. HANNA hides 
           under the small 19th century bed. Breathing as quietly as 
           she can. She hears voices on the main stairs.

                                 KNEPFLER (CONT'D)
                        I told you. There is no one here.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        Check the attic.

           Footsteps to the attic.

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        Erik Heller? Do you know him?

                                 KNEPFLER
                        I have never heard of him.

                                 MARISSA
                        Really?

           MARISSA shows him the photograph of the two men outside the 
           house. 

                                 KNEPFLER 
                        I don’t know this man.

                                 MARISSA
                        Don’t lie to me!

           HANNA holds her breath as she hears MARISSA grab KNEPFLER 
           by the throat. He speaks in gasps.

                                 KNEPFLER
                        He called me. She’s coming soon. 
                        To meet him. 
                                 MARISSA
                        When?

                                 KNEPFLER
                        Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning.

           MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.

                                 MARISSA
                        Take him in there. Find out what 
                        he knows.

           The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room, 
           the door shutting, leaving MARISSA alone in the room. HANNA 
           silent under the bed. The shoes of MARISSA in sight, 
           nothing else.

           The shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress compress 
           as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes as she 
           hears her call. 

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        Leslie this is Marissa Wiegler. 

           HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she 
           had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        I‘m going to be a day later than 
                        I thought... Yup... It’s all 
                        fine.

           HANNA hears MARISSA hang up as into the room comes another 
           pair of shoes. Male. ISAACS.

                                 ISAACS
                        His name’s Klaus Knepfler. He’s 
                        been running a network of old 
                        communists, waiting for Heller’s 
                        return. 

                                 MARISSA
                        And the girl’s.

           HANNA under bed, listening to every word.

                                 ISAACS 
                        How much do you think she knows? 

                                 MARISSA
                        He’s East German. He’ll have told 
                        her nothing. She probably still 
                        thinks she’s his daughter.

           HANNA’s eyes widen in shock. She can barely control her 
           breath.
                                 ISAACS
                        I’ll see what else he has to 
                        offer.

           He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she 
           hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under 
           the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe. 

           MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door. 
           They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in 
           mid-air, not breathing. The shoes leave. HANNA breathes.

           EXT. BERLIN ROOFTOPS.

           HANNA running across the rooftops. Springing, leaping 
           across roofs. All the forest skills in evidence here. HANNA 
           ducks into a rooftop doorway... and starts to descend....

           EXT. BERLIN STREET.

           Back on street level, HANNA walking fast, in total shock 
           and confusion. Who is she? She walks head down, determined 
           not to be seen. Not knowing where she is going. Her world 
           turned upside down. She sees an internet cafe. Ducks into 
           it. 

           INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN.

           HANNA sits down at a computer. The young OWNER comes up to 
           her.

                                 OWNER
                        Excuse me. You have to pay first.

                                 HANNA
                        How much?

                                 OWNER
                        3 Euros for half an hour.

           She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains 
           Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.

                                 HANNA 
                        How does it work?

                                 OWNER
                        You’ve never used the internet?

                                 HANNA
                        No.

           He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner 
           brings up a search engine.
                                 OWNER
                        Just type whatever it is you’re 
                        looking for here.

           He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. The name she 
           types is DNA INTERFERING SEQUENCE. 

           EXT. WILHELM GRIMM’S HOUSE

           ERIK HELLER walks, head bowed, up the street towards the 
           Wilhelm Grimm house. He suddenly stops dead. There is a pot 
           of red flowers on the window sill of the house opposite. 
           HELLER pauses. Looks closely and sees two CIA AGENTS 
           sitting in a car outside the house.

           Heller turns and goes in the opposite direction. He is 
           thinking furiously.

           INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN.

           HANNA sits at the computer, looking at the screen 
           breathless with tension. On the screen she is looking at an 
           image very similar to the lines she saw on her back in the 
           Rest-room. Two flourescent lines on a human body. 

           Phrases from the text leap out at her. “An interfering 
           sequence within the DNA” , “intervention to the mother’s 
           uterus during pregnancy.” “The trans-gene colour-tagged for 
           future monitoring”

           HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. “intervention to 
           the mother’s uterus” 

           HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her 
           mother’s name. JOHANNA ZADEK.

           Immediately the article about JOHANNA’s death comes up. 
           HANNA stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. 
           There is an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the 
           Heizinger Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. 
           HANNA writes it down. Gets up. 

           Thinks. Sits back down.

           Quickly she goes on to Facebook and is staring at Sophie’s 
           facebook page. It’s all pop music, gossip, celeb chat and 
           boys. Hanna thinks about sending her a message. But she is 
           told “You have to create a facebook identity”. Hanna 
           thinks. A moment of longing. No, it’s too risky. She quits 
           the Facebook site, gets up and leaves. 
           INT. TAXI IN EAST BERLIN SUBURB

           HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a 
           grim concrete jungle of old East German estates. It’s like 
           a journey into the past - the bleak world of the old East 
           Berlin, made worse by the inequalities of modern 
           capitalism. Neglected roads. Poor buildings. She has never 
           seen urban poverty like this before.

           INT. WILHELM’S HOUSE. BERLIN.

           MARISSA and ISAACS wait in the bedroom. ISAAC’s phone 
           rings.

                                 ISAACS
                        Isaacs.

           He listens. Puts the phone down.

                                 ISAACS (CONT’D)
                        A computer in a Berlin internet 
                        cafe went on to Sophie Domerc’s
                        Facebook page twenty minutes ago.

                                 MARISSA
                        Hanna.

                                 ISAACS
                        The same computer also did a web 
                        search for the name Johanna 
                        Zadek.

           MARISSA stops dead. Looks at ISAACS.

                                 MARISSA
                        She’s not coming here.

           EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS. EAST BERLIN

           HANNA gets out of the taxi. A series of concrete 60’s high-
           rise estates towards the sky. She approaches one, Heizinger
           building. Enters the dilapidated building. Looks on all the 
           buzzers. Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.

           INT. ESTATE BUILDING. EAST BERLIN

           HANNA climbs the stairs, until she reaches Number 14. 
           Knocks.

           Nothing for a while. Then a voice from behind the door.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK (O.S.)
                        Who are you?
           HANNA answers.

                                 HANNA
                        My name is Hanna Zadek. My mother 
                        is Johanna Zadek. 

           Pause. A fifty year old woman, looking worse for wear, 
           opens the door. Evidence of alcohol habit. Tired. 
           Depressed. 

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        Johanna Zadek is dead.

                                 HANNA
                        I know.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        She did not have a child.

           She tries to shut the door. HANNA firmly puts her foot in 
           the door, and gently but with strength pushes the woman 
           back into the flat and closes the door.

           INT. FLAT IN EAST BERLIN.

           HANNA stands in the old living room. It has not been 
           modernised at all for at least fifteen years. It has not 
           even been cleaned. It has many photos of Johanna Zadek on 
           the wall. It’s like a shrine to her. HANNA stares at the 
           photos. Her mother. The similarities are obvious. 

           The old woman looks at her with terrified hostility.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        I’m calling the police.

           HANNA walks to the phone, snaps the phone line. 

                                 KATRIN ZADEK (CONT’D)
                        What do you want from me?

                                 HANNA
                        I want to know what happened to 
                        me when I was born.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        My daughter did not have a child. 
                        She died in 1995, killed by her 
                        boyfriend.

           HANNA stares at her in total confusion. KATRIN is 
           suppressing her emotion, scared. HANNA wondering - what is 
           the truth? HANNA approaches her.

                                 HANNA 
                        Look. I look just like her.
           KATRIN looks at her. Close. Tempted to believe. But 
           refusing.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        She did not have a child.

                                 HANNA
                        Did she live here?

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        With her father and me.

           Answering HANNA’s silent question...

                                 KATRIN ZADEK (CONT’D)
                        He’s gone. Please leave.

           But HANNA bars the front door.

                                 HANNA
                        Which was her room?

           KATRIN looks at her, then silently gets up, leads HANNA 
           down a corridor into a small room.

           The shock - the room has not been changed in 12 years. This 
           family clearly never recovered from her death. HANNA 
           enters, sits on the bed. Stares up at KATRIN. It’s as if 
           KATRIN is seeing a flashback, her own daughter on the bed. 

           Tears in the old woman’s eyes. HANNA suddenly starts to 
           search. She looks in the cupboards. 

                                 KATRIN ZADEK
                        What are you doing?

           The 90’s teenage clothes are still there. Nothing has 
           changed. HANNA fingers a purple top. Her mother’s. But it’s 
           not what she is looking for. She searches harder. Throws 
           stuff around.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking for?

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know.

           But now HANNA is ignoring her, just searching. Pulling 
           bedclothes up, tearing at the carpet, just desperate to 
           know what is really going on.

                                 KATRIN ZADEK 
                        Stop this!

           She tries to stop her but with a terrifying ease of 
           strength, HANNA throws her off and continues to plunder the 
           room.
           The OLD WOMAN leaves the bedroom in distress. HANNA 
           searches, searches, in more and more desperation. Books are 
           ripped open, carpet ripped up, her fingers tear at the 
           walls, desperation, just to know, to know what is really 
           going on. Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.

                                 ERIK (V.O.)
                        You won’t find anything.

           HANNA turns in shock.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        We were much too careful for 
                        that.

           HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        Sit down Hanna.

                                 HANNA
                        Are you my father?

                                 ERIK
                        Sit down.

                                 HANNA
                        Are you my father?

                                 ERIK
                        Please.

                                 HANNA
                        Are you?

           Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing 
           but she knows the answer is no.

                                 ERIK
                        I was going to tell you.

           HANNA sinks on to the bed. Breathing fast.

                                 HANNA
                        What’s wrong with me?

           ERIK flinches slightly. 

                                 ERIK
                        Nothing.

                                 HANNA 
                        Where was I born?

           ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.
                                 ERIK
                        At Galinka.

           HANNA recognises the name from Isaacs. 

                                 HANNA
                        What’s that?

                                 ERIK 
                        It was a secret CIA research 
                        programme in rural Poland.

                                 HANNA
                        What kind of research?

                                 ERIK
                        Children. 

           HANNA stares at ERIK.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        It was run by Marissa Wiegler. 
                        The science came from the old 
                        East Germany. The money from the 
                        CIA.  The intention was to 
                        explore whether small genetic 
                        changes could be made to 
                        embryos... to improve them

                                 HANNA CONT’D)
                        Improve?

           ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost.

                                 ERIK
                        Reduce capacity for fear. For 
                        pity. Increase muscle strength. 
                        Heighten senses. Anything that 
                        might make a better soldier.

           HANNA looks up, stares at him. It’s her he’s talking about.

                                 HANNA
                        How did you know about it?

           ERIK’s stares right at her.

                                 ERIK
                        I worked for it. 

           She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his 
           pocket.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        This is what you were looking 
                        for.
           HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to 
           participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of 
           arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995. 
           An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American 
           dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no 
           legal claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller. 

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        I recruited your mother at an 
                        abortion clinic in May 1994. She 
                        was about to terminate an 
                        unwanted pregnancy. Some boy at a 
                        disco.

           HANNA looks at the paper in shock.

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        I had recruited twenty women. She 
                        was the last. Two years later I 
                        heard the programme was to be 
                        terminated. The research 
                        “disposed of”.

                                 HANNA
                        Disposed of?

                                 ERIK
                        We tried to save all of you. But 
                        you were the only one I was able 
                        to rescue. 

           HANNA stands in shock. She reaches to the window of the 
           room to get some air. She is reeling - faint. 

                                 ERIK (CONT’D)
                        Hanna listen to me.

                                 HANNA
                        Keep away from me.

           ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.

                                 ERIK
                        It worked. You worked. 

                                 HANNA
                        You mean I’m a killer?

                                 ERIK
                        No... no..

           He makes to touch her. HANNA springs in violent repulsion.

                                 HANNA 
                        Don’t touch me.
                                 ERIK
                        We have a new identity for you. A 
                        new life. A new beginning.

                                 HANNA 
                        We?

           She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes 
           her back but then HANNA grabs a cheese knife. 

                                 ERIK 
                        Don’t.

           She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A 
           fight in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, 
           crockery smashing, lamps and bookshelves falling. HANNA 
           murderous, ERIK just defending himself, not willing to kill 
           her. But then she overpowers him, has a knife to his 
           throat.

                                 HANNA 
                        Let me go. 

           He releases her. She goes to the door. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        I believed every word you said. 
                        You were my world.

           And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK 
           knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave 
           down the fire escape. ERIK calls after her. 

                                 ERIK
                        Hanna wait.

           He looks out to watch her go. It’s then ERIK sees the cars 
           coming across the estate scrubland.

           ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, 
           runs through the destroyed living room, and down the main 
           stairs. As he leaves the main stairs he runs into full view 
           of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.

           INT. MARISSA’S CAR. CONT.

           MARISSA’s car is a about to turn the corner and bump 
           straight into HANNA when suddenly...

           MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block. 
           She speaks to ISAACS.

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s him.
           And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly 
           away from the slight figure of HANNA who has just reached 
           the bottom of the fire escape. HANNA can see the cars in 
           full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.

           EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN.

           HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible 
           athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his 
           pursuers for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for 
           Marissa. Looking to finish it off. 

           Just as he has done this, REYNOLDS and another HENCHMAN 
           approach from the end of the street. HELLER fires in their 
           direction, starts to run down an alley. He vaults a 
           dividing wall, scratching himself on barbed wire. He 
           sprints round a corner and sees a doorway ahead of him. He 
           walks towards the doorway.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        Drop it.

           Then, suddenly out of the doorway steps a woman gun trained 
           on him. MARISSA. HELLER stops dead. Drops his gun. Silence 
           between them. HELLER turns. There are men at the end of the 
           alleyway. No escape.

           MARISSA hands him some German cigarettes. 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Your favorites. They’re hard to 
                        get these days. 

                                 ERIK
                        Everything’s American.

           ERIK, exhausted, broken, smiles. Lights one. Inhales 
           deeply.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Where is she?

                                 ERIK
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARISSA
                        Why did you tell her you were her 
                        father?

           ERIK slightly abashed.

                                 ERIK
                        She was too young to understand 
                        the truth.
                                 MARISSA 
                        I’m sure she really appreciates 
                        that now. 

           MARISSA smiles coolly at ERIK. ERIK takes a drag on his 
           cigarette.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m willing to offer you a deal. 

           ERIK laughs drily.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you hadn’t noticed but 
                        we’re not at war any more. The 
                        Wall fell down twenty years ago, 
                        people danced on it...

                                 ERIK
                        They’re not dancing any more.

                                 MARISSA
                        What does that mean?

                                 ERIK
                        All systems come to an end. Even 
                        yours.

           He smiles. As he does he feels MARISSA’s gun on his temple. 
           She’s had enough. Her cold breath on his face. Lethal. 

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s... enough...

           ERIK smiles, the gun right on his temple.

                                 ERIK
                        You want to know where she’s 
                        gone, let me go. I’ll lead you to 
                        her.

                                 MARISSA 
                        I’m not taking that risk.

                                 ERIK
                        I don’t see what choice you have. 

           ERIK smiles, throws the butt on the ground, turns and walks 
           back up the alleyway fast. MARISSA watches him go..

                                 MARISSA
                        I was always very fond of you. 

           HELLER ignores her. Continues walking. His face grimly 
           determined as he heads towards the end of the alleyway and 
           as MARISSA’s eyes bear into the back of his head.
           EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS.

           HANNA is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main 
           road. Suddenly she hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. 
           Knows what it means. An intense conflict of emotions inside 
           her. Her breathing stops for a moment, her world seems to 
           go silent. 

           Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her 
           over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
           pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops 
           and she is on board. 

           EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN.

           MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Leave him here.

           And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin 
           dirt.

           INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN.

           HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death, 
           bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers 
           stare at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in 
           her pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the 
           letter Erik showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the 
           address. Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.

           HANNA makes a decision. She is going to where she was born. 
           She must find out who she is. 

           INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK’S FLAT.

           MARISSA enters the apartment. KATRIN ZADEK sitting in shock 
           amidst the mayhem caused by the fight. MARISSA looks at the 
           chaos. ISAACS comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door.

                                 ISAACS
                        They had a fight.

                                 MARISSA
                        She must know the truth.

                                 ISAACS
                        Where do you think she’s gone?

                                 MARISSA
                        Where would you go? 
           MARISSA turns to ISAACS.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m closing the CIA operation 
                        down. Heller is dead, that’s all 
                        that matters to them. This we do 
                        alone.

           ISAACS nods and leaves. MARISSA sees the photos on the 
           wall. Contains her emotions. She walks through the 
           apartment. She stops on seeing Johanna’s room. Trashed, 
           utterly trashed.

           Enters the room. Shuts the door. Sits in the room. The 
           woman she killed. MARISSA for the first time truly showing 
           the strain of her suppression. 

           INT. POLISH TRAIN.

           HANNA’s head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the 
           train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted, 
           many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. 
           Needing resolution. 

           In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her 
           child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The 
           peace of the innocent.

           EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT.

           The train entering a Polish train station. The town is 
           called Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North 
           of Poland and it’s very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA 
           exits, approaches a station guard.

                                 HANNA
                        I am looking for a train to 
                        Galinka.

                                 GUARD
                        Galinka is a small village. No 
                        trains. You must wait for bus in 
                        the morning.

                                 HANNA 
                        Where can I stay?

           He points. HANNA sees the hotel.

           INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the 
           filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV. 
           Cartoons. More Tom and Jerry type stuff. 
           But she doesn’t laugh. She flicks channel. Then stands dead 
           still. She is looking at ERIK HELLER’s dead body on the 
           ground. The report depicts him as a dangerous criminal. 
           HANNA stares at the image. The death of the man she spent 
           her life with. Lost forever. HANNA’s face oddly still in 
           the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off. Leaves the room.

           INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR. NIGHT.

           HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the 
           shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty 
           room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
           drinking men stare at her. HANNA is still in the slightly 
           sexy clothes she stole on the train. She is uncomfortably 
           aware of her looks as goes to the bar. A forty-five year 
           old BUSINESSMAN stands there, drinking.

                                 HANNA
                        Do you have a sandwich?

                                 BARMAN
                        Kitchen is closed.

           The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Get her something. Poor girl’s 
                        hungry.

           The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m from Leipzig. Here on 
                        business.

           HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT’D)
                        You?

                                 HANNA
                        The same.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        You’re too young to be a 
                        businesswoman. 

           He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich 
           arrives. It’s grim. She leaves it, walks out.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 HANNA
                        I am tired. I need to sleep.
           She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs. 
           BUSINESSMAN follows. 

                                 BUSINESSMAN 
                        Hey.

           She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN 
           follows.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        I was just making conversation. 
                        You shouldn’t dress like that if 
                        you don’t want attention.

           As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Let’s talk about this.

           HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey! What the fuck!

           He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on 
           to the bed. He is strong. HANNA is thrust on to the bed, 
           but suddenly turns him over her head and smashes him 
           against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN grabs her hair and tries to 
           force her on to the bed.  

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                        You fucking whore. I’ll teach 
                        you!

           He grabs her and throws her on the bed. Ripping at her 
           dress.

           But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It’s like an 
           animal, like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his 
           face, grabs a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. 
           Pure animal rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood 
           pouring from his eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks 
           him, punches him, repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until 
           she is spent of her primal fury.

           When she looks up she sees a mangled bloody body on the 
           floor. He is moaning quietly, pleading for help. She 
           suddenly recoils in horror. Erik’s words echo in her mind. 
           “You have less capacity for pity”. She goes to the phone.

                                 HANNA
                        Yes I have a problem in my room. 
                        Could you come please?

           Then HANNA grabs the man’s wallet, and leaves the room.
           EXT. POLISH STREET

           Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down 
           the street, in a daze, past drunk men, leering at her, no 
           idea where she is going. She starts to run, faster and 
           faster, just running to run out of herself.  

           Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi’s 
           yellow light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the 
           businessman’s wallet to see how much money is in there. She 
           approaches the taxi.

                                 HANNA
                        I have this much. Can you take me 
                        to Galinka?

           EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD.

           HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest 
           road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is 
           arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. 
           Tall snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the 
           road, just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It 
           is as if from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA  
           checks the paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her 
           hands from the businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, 
           secretly, she wipes it clean.

           Suddenly the taxi stops.

                                 DRIVER
                        This is as far as the money gets 
                        you.

           HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.

                                 HANNA
                        How much further?

                                 DRIVER
                        Twelve miles.

                                 HANNA
                        Please.

           But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to 
           walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came. She 
           is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just 
           about dawn. Cold as hell.

           She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies 
           past fast. Blows icy air in her face. 
           She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead. 
           It’s hilly, winding, she isn’t going to make it. Too tired. 
           Too shattered.

           Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering 
           every ounce of energy.

           Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by, 
           ignoring her waves and cries.

           HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on. 
           Carries on walking.

           Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can 
           she make it?

           Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, 
           almost magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds 
           down.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to Galinka. Can you 
                        help me?

           A woman’s voice, German, in German.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Yes I can take you there.

           And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling 
           face of MARISSA WIEGLER. 

           INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA.

           MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her. 
           HANNA has no idea who she is. MARISSA speaks in perfect 
           German. Calm, soft, comforting.

                                 MARISSA
                        You’ve hurt your arm.

                                 HANNA
                        It’s OK.

           MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.

                                 MARISSA
                        I’m Dagmar.

                                 HANNA
                        You’re German. 

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s right.
                                 HANNA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MARISSA
                        I’m on my way to my parents. They  
                        live out here. You?

           HANNA does not know how to answer.

                                 HANNA
                        Visiting some friends. 

                                 MARISSA
                        Well we’ll get you there.

           MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the 
           first time in ages. She feels the tears come.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Are you in trouble?

           HANNA nods. She fights the tears. 

                                 HANNA
                        Sorry.

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s OK.

           MARISSA gently holds her hand. HANNA weeping. 

                                 HANNA
                        I don’t know what to do.

           MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the 
           emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth. Then HANNA 
           detaches. Dries her eyes.

                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        I have to be strong.

                                 MARISSA
                        Who told you that?

           HANNA does not answer but goes pale. MARISSA knows who said 
           it.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        You look tired. 

           HANNA nods, the tears beginning to flow. MARISSA puts on 
           some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.

                                 HANNA
                        It’s beautiful.
                                 MARISSA
                        Sleep why don’t you? It will take 
                        half an hour on this road.

           HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has 
           slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the 
           window. She is asleep. Vulnerable. 

           MARISSA drives on down the tiny road. Looks at the sleeping 
           HANNA. MARISSA represses her emotion. HANNA suddenly 
           looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent. 
           Can she kill this girl?

           The rush of emotion shocks her and she nearly crashes the 
           car. Just avoids a tree, jolting HANNA awake.

                                 HANNA
                        Where are we?

           MARISSA calms herself instantly.

                                 MARISSA
                        Nearly there.

           EXT. GALINKA

           MARISSA’s car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.

                                 MARISSA (V.O.)
                        This is it. 

           INT. MARISSA’S CAR.

           HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is 
           confused.

                                 HANNA
                        It’s so small.

                                 MARISSA
                        Yes. Just a few cottages. And the 
                        old house.

                                 HANNA
                        Old house?

                                 MARISSA
                        Through those trees. I think it’s 
                        deserted. Well I hope you find 
                        your friends.

           MARISSA looking kindly at HANNA.

                                 HANNA
                        Thanks.
           MARISSA nods. Watches as HANNA gets out.

           EXT. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA looks around. Desolate. Very rural. Mountainous. Snow 
           on the ground. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then 
           drives off.

           HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not 
           used for many years. She reaches a hidden entrance off the 
           track. By the entrance there is an old battered sign. 
           GALINKA - REFUGE. HANNA looks at the old iron gate. Rusted, 
           locked. It has not been opened in a long time.

           She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then 
           she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the 
           spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and, 
           exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up 
           the snow-covered narrow tree-lined driveway.

           EXT. GALINKA HOME. CONT.

           HANNA approaches the house itself. Tall, grey, imposing. 
           Dilapidated. And suddenly, with remarkable intensity, as 
           she sees it, she remembers.

           An instant Flashback. The same house, but with young 
           children running on the lawns. Summer. Green grass. Nurses. 
           It’s idyllic, beautiful. Heaven.

           Back to now. HANNA’s face. She knows she has been here 
           before. What contrast. Now there is snow on the ground. No 
           children. And as she looks closer, she sees the garden is 
           filled with dogs. Dogs sleeping, dogs barking. Some try to 
           rush towards her, but are strained by leashes. Others roam 
           free. Dogs everywhere. And nothing else but cold, greyness 
           and collapse.

           HANNA approaches the windows of the house. She sees that 
           many windows are broken. The place is run-down, almost 
           abandonned. Dogs wander in and out of the front door. It’s 
           like they’ve taken over.

           Very carefully HANNA enters the front door of the house. We 
           can’t help feel that as she does so, she is being watched.

           INT. GALINKA HOME. CONT.

           At reception there is no one. Inside the main hall dogs 
           play. It is chaos, as if civilisation had been over-run. An 
           empty shell of a building.

           Very quietly HANNA enters the reception. The dogs bark but 
           no one comes. HANNA sees a side office and enters. 
           INT. GALINKA HOME. OFFICE. CONT.

           HANNA is in a miserable, bare small office. Nothing in it. 
           HANNA searches through an old metal filing cabinet. But 
           there is nothing there. No computers. No paperwork. No 
           phone. Nothing. She slams the cabinet in frustration.

           INT. GALINKA HOME. CONT.

           HANNA leaves the office and walks up the main staircase to 
           the first floor, past dozens of dogs snarling, barking. The 
           noise is incredible.  She smashes through some double doors 
           into a long corridor. Dogs everywhere, they have over-run 
           the place.

           The corridor has various rooms. All filled with animals. 
           She walks down the corridor. Looks through the window in 
           each door. Just dogs. Dogs. Reaches the end. Then stops. 

           She looks into an empty room with two bay windows, no 
           longer decorated. Two dogs prowl around it. HANNA turns and 
           sees three huge broken UV lights in the corners of the 
           room. The same UV as the restroom.

           Another FLASH MEMORY - the room where she slept. A UV lit 
           room, her and three other girls playing. Nurses, kind 
           observing faces, the faces coming into focus in her memory. 
           Observing small fluorescent marks on the children’s bodies, 
           lit up by the UV. One of the adult faces gains clarity. 
           ERIK HELLER.

           A voice shakes her from her reverie. A female voice.

                                 CARETAKER 
                        Who are you? How did you get in?

           An OLD WOMAN stands in front of her.

                                 CARETAKER (CONT’D)
                        This place is not open to the 
                        public.

                                 HANNA
                        I was born here.

           The CARETAKER looks at her in shock.

                                 CARETAKER
                        What do you mean?

           HANNA, shaking with tiredness, shows her the letter. She 
           looks at it.

                                 CARETAKER (CONT’D)
                        That’s not possible.
                                 HANNA
                        What is this place?

                                 CARETAKER
                        We collect dogs from the street. 
                        Bring them here. We are paid by 
                        the government.

                                 HANNA
                        Since when?

                                 CARETAKER 
                        It has always been like this.

                                 HANNA
                        That’s not true.

           HANNA fierce but controlled. Then looks closer at the 
           CARETAKER.

                                 CARETAKER
                        Please leave or I will call the 
                        police.

                                 HANNA 
                        Were you here then?

           The old woman afraid now. Not speaking.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        What happened to the others? 
                        Please tell me.

                                 CARETAKER 
                        This is a dogs home. 

                                 HANNA
                        Tell me!

           She grabs her. The OLD WOMAN looks at her in fear. But just 
           simply says.

                                 CARETAKER
                        It’s a dogs home.

                                 HANNA
                        No. There must be proof.

           And HANNA walks past the caretaker, moving into a run, room 
           to room, desperate to find the evidence she needs. As she 
           does so, she flashes back to two-year-old games of hide and 
           seek, in the then beautiful house. Running through the 
           house. Laughing. But now every room is empty. Bleak, and 
           with no evidence of what once happened here. Increasing in 
           despair, HANNA runs along a corridor into and through a 
           final small door where she sees...
           ISAACS standing staring at her. Gun in hand. HANNA freezes. 
           The gun trained on her.

                                 ISAACS 
                        Don’t do anything stupid. Turn 
                        round. Walk down the stairs.

           HANNA turns, looks into the calm eyes of ISAACS. She slowly 
           walks down the stairs.

                                 ISAACS (CONT’D)
                        Through there.

           HANNA walks through a wooden door that leads outside. 

           EXT. GALINKA. THE BACK GARDEN. CONT.

           ISAACS ushers HANNA into the back garden. HANNA sees a 
           woman sitting on a bench, back to us. It’s the woman from 
           the car. HANNA now sees the shoes, the same shoes as in 
           Wilhelm’s house. MARISSA WIEGLER.

           HANNA starts to shake. 

           ISAACS holds back, gesturing HANNA to MARISSA’s side. Gun 
           trained on her. HANNA’s dilemma. Does she run? Fight?

                                 HANNA
                        You’re Marissa Wiegler.

           MARISSA does not move. Dead silence. HANNA now sees three 
           other men, ISAACS’ HENCHMEN, also in attendance, at a 
           distance, all with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her 
           should she attack or run. HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA 
           speaks in English.

                                 MARISSA
                        Don’t do anything. I don’t want 
                        to hurt you. Sit down.

           HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered. 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        I could have killed you when you 
                        were asleep. Sit down.

           HANNA sits slowly. Shaking. 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Did Erik tell you about me?

           HANNA trembling slightly. Yes he did.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        About here?
           Silence.

                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        I want to help you.

                                 HANNA
                        Did you kill him?

           Pause. MARISSA knows that HANNA knows she did. HANNA 
           stands, backs away but knows she is surrounded.

                                 MARISSA 
                        You won’t find what you’re 
                        looking for. There is no evidence 
                        that this place ever existed. 
                        Except you.

           And suddenly HANNA knows this is true. She feels terribly 
           alone.

                                 HANNA
                        Where are the other children?

           MARISSA does not reply. HANNA looks at the old overgrown 
           flower beds.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        What did you do to us?

           She looks at MARISSA. Who pauses then answers quietly. 

                                 MARISSA 
                        At the start of the second 
                        trimester we opened up the 
                        pregnant woman’s belly. We 
                        inserted other foetal material to 
                        sit alongside the human embryo. 
                        We had no idea if it would be 
                        accepted or what would happen.

                                 HANNA
                        What “material”?

                                 MARISSA
                        It was different in each case. 

           MARISSA evading but HANNA burning with quiet anger.

                                 HANNA
                        What was it in mine?

           MARISSA looks at the dogs prowling through the grounds. 
           HANNA stares in shock.

           MARISSA turns to her. A new sincerity in her.
                                 MARISSA 
                        I can protect you. Give you a new 
                        life. No one need know a thing. 
                        But you have to trust me.

           HANNA looks at her. The killer of her father. 

                                 HANNA
                        And if I say no?

           MARISSA looks at HANNA. The alternative is clear. HANNA 
           smiles, looks round the garden. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        Is this where you offered the job 
                        to Erik Heller?

           She looks at MARISSA. And in that moment MARISSA knows that 
           all is lost. HANNA is not going to agree.

                                 MARISSA 
                        Don’t.

           But before she can move HANNA has started to run. 

           ISAACS raises his gun but HANNA has already thrown herself 
           over a low wall in the garden. She dives down as bullets 
           spatter the stonework.

           And in a second HANNA is back in the mode of the forest. 
           She is crawling through the undergrowth. Smells, hearing, 
           sight all operating at high level. She zooms in on the 
           three POLISH henchmen, mapping their positions. She senses 
           ISAACS moving. She hears the dogs barking. She makes a high-
           pitched whine/whistle. The dogs howl wildly, giving her 
           noise-cover. The dogs start to run madly through the 
           gardens.

           HANNA makes a sudden dash for the kitchen door. Bullets 
           miss her by inches as she hurls herself through.

           HANNA in the kitchens, reaches for the huge fridge door. 
           She finds huge amounts of meat, grabs it and pulls it all 
           along the floor. Dogs start to howl, smelling the meat. 
           They start to sprint towards the kitchens. Hungry, 
           ravenous.

           HANNA runs with the meat, throws it through a door. A dog 
           pelts after the meat, sprints through the door and is 
           instantly shot. HANNA turns the other way, tries another 
           door, another dog is shot and she turns again and rushes 
           through the pantry areas into the coalyard. No one there.
           EXT. COALYARD. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA shins up the piping to the first floor. She can see 
           one of the HENCHMEN in the gardens, one on the wall of the 
           outhouse.

           Suddenly they turn and see her. She leaps from the 
           guttering to a window ledge as gunfire spatters the 
           masonry.

           She creeps through a smashed pane in the window into the 
           first floor.

           INT. BEDROOM. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA runs through the ghostly bedrooms. She senses steps 
           coming up the stairs towards her. She hides in a bay 
           window, then sees another HENCHMAN staning outside in the 
           drive directly below the window. He has not seen her.

           She turns to see ISAACS and a HENCHMAN coming down the 
           corridor.

           And makes her decision.

           HANNA smashes through the window and falls thirty feet on 
           to the back of the HENCHMAN.

           EXT. FRONT DRIVE. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA smashes her fist into the HENCHMAN’s stomach. She 
           grabs the shotgun and uses the butt end to crack his skull.

           She turns and instinctively dives under the porch as ISAACS 
           shoots at her from above.

           Dogs scatter as the bullets pound at the gravel driveway.

           HANNA turns and shoots up through a hole in the porch’s 
           ceiling. The HENCHMAN with ISAACS is hit and plunges from 
           the bay window down on top of the porch and then down on to 
           the gravel where he lies spreadeagled.

           But then she feels a presence behind her, turns with the 
           gun to protect her as MARISSA WIEGLER shoots at her through 
           the front door from within the hall.

           A bullet grazes HANNA’s shoulder, drawing blood. Another 
           bounces off the body of the gun, causing her to drop it. 
           HANNA runs out from under the porch, ISAACS shooting at 
           her, and round the side of the house.

           HANNA finds another side door in the house and enters. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA, unarmed, is now in the abandoned living room of the 
           house. A smashed up old sofa. A broken hanging light. A 
           disused fireplace. Furniture broken and smelling of dog 
           hair and shit. HANNA checks the exits. The door she came in 
           through. One other door that leads into the house. Two 
           windows looking out on to the back garden. That’s it. HANNA 
           feels herself surrounded. ISAACS coming round the side of 
           the house, covering that exit. The final HENCHMAN covering 
           the windows. MARISSA in the hall covering the exit into the 
           house. HANNA stuck, nowhere to go.

           In the hall MARISSA calls through.

                                 MARISSA (V.O.)
                        Hanna, give yourself up. It isn’t 
                        too late.

           Nothing.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Walk out the door with your hands 
                        on your head.

           Still nothing. MARISSA looks through into the living room 
           but she can’t see all of it. She can see ISAACS in the 
           opposite door. She nods at him and they pepper the living 
           room with bullets. The HENCHMAN in the garden follows suit. 

           Then slowly they all creep into the living room. 

           It is empty. 

           MARISSA checks behind the sofa - nothing.

           ISAACS spins round in utter confusion

           Then MARISSA looks at the fireplace. 

           INT. CHIMNEY. GALINKA. CONT.

           HANNA is pulling herself up through the filthy chimney. She 
           only just fits. The light at the top approaches as she 
           almost chokes on soot. Below she hears a gun being cocked 
           and gasps as she reaches the top and throws herself out on 
           to the roof as a bullet whizzes past her. 

           EXT. GALINKA. ROOF. / GARDEN. CONT.

           HANNA sprints across the roof then jumps down on to a lower 
           roof and on to the ground where she runs into the 
           undergrowth. She reaches a fence, climbs it, cuts herself 
           on the barbed wire and jumps over and into the forest.
           Behind her ISAACS sees where she has gone and begins the 
           chase.

           EXT. WOODLAND. POLAND. CONT.

           Freezing cold morning as HANNA, with the rucsac, sprints 
           through woodland, which becomes thicker and thicker. She 
           feels her bleeding hand from the barbed wire. She tears at 
           her clothes, bandages the hand, continues running. 
           Exhaustion level total. Nothing left to give. Just run.

           INT/EXT. GALINKA HOUSE. CONT.

           ISAACS and the HENCHMAN tear through the woodland, chasing 
           HANNA. 

           EXT. WOODLAND. POLAND CONT.

           HANNA sprinting, busting a gut, memories of the first 
           scenes in Sweden. Pure terror. 

           Suddenly she senses something. Stops dead still. Turns. 
           Everything slows down. She sees a deer staring at her. She 
           stares at it. Is it real? So oddly peaceful. He looks at 
           her. Then they hear noises. The deer foots it into the 
           forest. HANNA snaps out, and sprints the other way. 

           EXT. WOODLAND. POLAND. CONT.

           ISAACS tearing through the forest. Moving fast. 

           EXT. FOREST. POLAND. CONT.

           HANNA runs on through the cold. Every tree a danger. Using 
           all the skills Erik taught her.

           HANNA moves on, desperately. But she senses the men behind 
           her. Getting closer. Too close. She can’t out-sprint them.

           She hears something. A stream, a river. HANNA runs towards 
           it. 

           EXT. FOREST RIVER. POLAND. CONT.

           HANNA arrives at a small river cutting down through the 
           forest. It is ice cold. HANNA wades in, winces at the cold. 
           She listens, hears steps approach, then goes under the 
           water, disappearing into the icy water. Under the water she 
           holds her breath. 
           ISAACS and the HENCHMAN approach the river with a terrible 
           slowness. They look round. Utter stillness. The river just 
           babbling along.

           Under the water HANNA holds her breath. Longer and longer. 
           Just as ERIK taught her. 

           ISAACS waves the henchman across the river. They slowly 
           wade across. Guns high.

           HANNA still under water. Lungs bursting. 

           The HENCHMAN is right above her. His leg nearing her face. 
           His gun trained on the water.

           It’s now that HANNA attacks.

           With one hand HANNA reaches from under the water and grabs 
           the barrel of the gun. She rears up and smashes the gun 
           into his head. Then kicks him in the face and in one 
           movement, pulls the gun round and shoots him.

           ISAACS turns to shoot but in one movement HANNA has reached 
           round and shot him in the head. His look is of total 
           astonishment even as he falls into the icy water. 

           HANNA stands shattered, soaked, freezing, no sleep, no 
           food. She pauses. Thinks. Then turns, climbs out of the 
           river, and goes back the way she came.

           EXT. GALINKA. EARLY MORNING.

           MARISSA stands on the gravel drive outside the empty 
           Galinka waiting, looking into the forest. Revolver in hand.

           She hears a noise behind her. Turns. It’s HANNA who smashes 
           the revolver from MARISSA’s hand even as she raises it to 
           shoot.

           HANNA knocks MARISSA to the ground. Holds the gun and 
           points it at MARISSA. Wanting to kill, desperate to kill. 

           But then looking at MARISSA’s eyes. And changing her mind. 
           Lowering the gun.

                                 HANNA
                        Don’t ever come looking for me.

           She grabs the revolver, turns and walks slowly down the 
           driveway of GALINKA. MARISSA watches her go until at last 
           the small lean figure of the girl finally disappears.
           EXT. MAIN ROAD. POLAND/GERMANY. DAY.

           Cold rain on the windscreen as MARISSA drives through the 
           German-Polish border. Her face scratched and bruised 
           slightly. Nothing that won’t heal.

           For MARISSA this is a journey back out of the past, the old 
           wars. She goes through the border and continues into 
           Germany.

           She talks hands free on the phone.

                                 MARISSA
                        Leslie I’ll be on the plane 
                        tonight. 

           Pause

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        No there’s nothing else I need.

           She hangs up and drives out of Poland back on to the fast 
           Autobahn of the new Germany. The West.

           INT. THE DOMERC HOUSE. 2 MONTHS LATER. DAY.

           It’s late spring. Warm. Blue sky outside the window.

           THIERRY and SOPHIE DOMERC are watching TV. Cartoons. EMIL 
           enters.

                                 EMIL
                        Hey I want to see the news. Turn 
                        over.

                                 THIERRY
                        After this one.

                                 EMIL
                        Now!

           He turns over. THIERRY sulks. On the News, we see a 
           reporter. 

                                 REPORTER
                        ... the new directives announced 
                        by the President at the press 
                        conference at Langley today are 
                        an example of the direction

                        this administration.

                                 REPORTER (CONT'D)
                        My sources tell me that inside 
                        the CIA there has been a lot of 
                        concern and conflict over just 
                        how far the measures go and that 
                        the focus on human rights may 
                        weaken America’s ability to 
                        defend...

                                 SOPHIE
                        Boring.

           She gets up and walks away from the television. She goes to 
           the open plan kitchen and opens the fridge. Takes out a 
           carton of juice. Swigs.

                                 RACHEL
                        Drink from a glass!

           RACHEL has just entered from the garden. Sophie sighs, puts 
           the carton back.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        And why don’t you get some air 
                        instead of watching TV all day? 
                        It’s so beautiful outside.

           SOPHIE shrugs, grabs a peach from the fruit bowl and walks 
           out of the kitchen door into the garden.

           EXT. GARDEN. THE DOMERC’S HOUSE. DAY. CONT.

           SOPHIE stands in the garden. It’s a warm day. She walks on 
           to the lawn and lies down to eat her peach on the grass. 
           Behind her a barbecue is on. 

           She looks around the garden.

           Suddenly her eyes seem to see something. A flicker in the 
           hedgerow. A face?

           She gets up. Walks towards the hedge. Looks again.

           Nothing. She looks questioningly for a while, then returns 
           to the grass and lies down, slightly sad. Behind her 
           THIERRY comes out of the door and starts to play football 
           on the grass.

           EMIL comes out with some meat and places some meat on the 
           barbecue.

           Now we switch to a different POV. That of HANNA who we see 
           is watching through the hedge. HANNA is cleaner, fresher-
           looking. Still with Sophie’s bracelet on her wrist.

           She studies the family closely, with expectation. Cooking, 
           eating fruit, playing football on the grass. All so normal. 
           Her face is suffused with a quiet longing.
           EMIL starts to tickle SOPHIE who laughs. THIERRY joins in. 
           They wrestle on the ground. RACHEL comes out of the kitchen 
           and sets the table for lunch.

           HANNA moves round to the gate. There is a bell on the gate. 
           She sees it. Looks at it. Nervous. 

           She moves her hand to ring it. Holds her hand there. 
           Unsure.

           As she remains motionless we hear the laughter of the 
           family like tinkling bells.

           Her face smiles as she hears the laughter.

           She does not move as the warm summer sun falls on her face.

           THE END
