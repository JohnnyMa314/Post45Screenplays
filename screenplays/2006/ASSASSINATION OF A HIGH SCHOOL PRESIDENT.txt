HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           A dark hallway unfolds before us. Its brick and marble walls 
           built at the turn of the century are Gothic, looming. The 
           noir appearance suggests the interior of an abandoned mansion 
           or bygone museum...but in fact this is a HIGH SCHOOL. 

           Shadows fall on lockers and trophy cases. A banner bearing 
           the school colors, black and white, hangs from the ceiling 
           exclaiming VERITAS UNITAS CARITAS (Truth Unity Love). 

           A pair of girls’ brown leather PENNY LOAFERS stride down the 
           deserted hall. They belong to FRANCESCA FACHINI (Junior). 

           The voice of BOBBY FUNKE (Sophomore) narrates. The tone of 
           his voice is unique for this day and age. Think a younger 
           version of JACK NICHOLSON or even HUMPHREY BOGART.  

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        She wore penny loafers and a smile 
                        most seniors couldn’t pull off with 
                        a few beers in them. 

           Francesca is cute in her standard Catholic school uniform, 
           but only cute in appearance. She brims with sexuality. 

           Her skirt, while criminally short, is regulation. It's her 
           ass doing all the lifting. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Francesca Fachini stayed late last 
                        Thursday as she’d done every other 
                        Thursday this month. She knew he’d 
                        be there finishing up.  

           Francesca turns a corner, walks by a group of BOYS on the 
           TRACK TEAM heading in the opposite direction. They stop to 
           gawk as she passes.   

                                 BOY
                        Hey Francesca.

           Francesca crinkles her nose, barely acknowledging the group, 
           not even breaking stride. The boys fall to the wayside. 

           Francesca passes a locker with the phrase “Francesca Fachini 
           Hottest Girl Ever” poetically written in graffiti.  

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 

           STEVEN LOPEZ (Junior) writes the final answer in his SPANISH 
           WORKBOOK. He closes the book, stuffs it into his backpack.

                        Steven Lopez, Junior honors student 
                        on work ethic alone. Nice, 
                        considerate, straight.

ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Steven exits the library and walks down an empty hallway.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Poor kid didn’t stand a chance. 

           Steven rounds a corner and runs directly into Francesca. 
           Francesca places a seductive hand on Steve’s chest. She 
           slides up to him, her face inches from his. 

                                 STEVEN 
                        Hey Francesca. 

           Francesca slides her hand around Steven’s torso. She pulls 
           his backpack in front of him and opens it. She pulls out his 
           Spanish workbook while placing a hand on his cheek.

           FREEZE ON: The workbook entitled “Leones y Tigres y Osos, Oh 
           Mi!” 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Lions and tigers and bears, indeed. 
                        A week before, a run of identical 
                        incorrect answers in Spanish III 
                        had caught my eye. It seemed the 
                        whole class was regurgitating 
                        whatever they’d been passed over 
                        the weekend.

           Francesca clutches the book close to her chest and smiles. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        “Toco la flauta del piel” does not 
                        mean “I went to the library”. It 
                        means “I play the skin flute”. 

           FREEZE ON: Steven’s sighing face, his half-open mouth. If 
           Francesca had a skin flute he’d be playing it.  

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        And twenty two kids gave that as an 
                        answer last week. Wasn’t sure about 
                        the skin flute, but somebody was 
                        playing something alright. 

            Francesca takes the book and walks off down the hall. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        If everyone copied the same Spanish 
                        homework, it had to start 
                        somewhere.

                        I just happened to have a hunch 
                        where. 

           A DARK FIGURE stands in the shadows unnoticed by Steven or 
           Francesca. He packs a pack of cigarettes into the palm of his 
           hand. We only get a glimpse of his eyes.

           her workbook as the car pulls out of the school parking lot.

                        No slouch herself, Fachini had it 
                        copied in a matter of minutes.

           The DARK FIGURE watches from a shadowy corner. At a photo

           where the DRAMA CLUB practices the school play.

           A FLAMING DRAMA KID runs into the auditorium waving his 
           Spanish workbook like a gay pride flag. 

           All of the drama kids copy the homework.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S HALLWAY - DAY

           A sign reads “SAT TESTING TODAY. LEAVE ALL BOOKBAGS IN THE 
           HALL”. Inside classrooms kids diligently take the SAT’s. 
           Dozens of backpacks line the halls. 

           The figure opens up several bags and examines answer number 
           seven in several Spanish workbooks. They all read 
           “SALCHICHA”.

He is 
           BOBBY FUNKE (Sophomore), the classic leading man but in his 
           most awkward years. The tough guy before he becomes tough. 

           Funke wears a long coat over his slightly disheveled school 
           uniform. Shirt, tie, khakis. If not for the fitted baseball 
           cap, he’d be a dead ringer for an old school private eye. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        St. Dominick’s, it’s one prickly 
                        pear. You want something juicy, you 
                        just gotta know where to bite. 

           The “cigarettes” Funke has been packing is actually a pack of 
           gum. He slides a stick of it in his mouth and chews, smiling.   

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        The name’s Bobby Funke. I write for 
                        the paper.

           TAD GOLTZ (Senior, Sports Editor) stares at the front of the

                                 TAD
                        Who? 

           Funke stands in the front of the room amidst a sea of charts 
           and blurry surveillance photos regarding this Spanish case. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Bobby Funke. I write for the paper. 

           The STUDENT NEWSPAPER STAFF stares blankly at Funke. 

                                 TAD
                        No, you don’t. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Yes, I do. 

                                 TAD
                        No. You don’t. I’m Tad Goltz. I 
                        write for the paper. You don’t 
                        write for anything. 

           A few chuckles. Funke is heating up. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Then what am I doing up here? What 
                        is all this, Taaad? 
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 TAD

                                 FUNKE
                        Is it?

           Funke picks up a piece of carbon copy paper amidst his 
           sloppy, well worn research. He examines it thoughtfully.

           PEI-MIN INIMI (Senior, the paper’s editor in chief) stands at

           and smart. She speaks with a slight Asian accent.

                        give you a story like this when 
                        there is nothing written and no

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - SPANISH CLASS - DAY 

           Funke sits at his desk staring at an application for THE 
           COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM HIGH SCHOOL SUMMER PROGRAM. He 
           has neatly written his name and contact information on it. 

           The first question reads: “Why do you want to attend this 
           program?”. Answer: “To become the greatest journalist the 
           world has ever known.” Funke underlines “greatest”. 
                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           Under “Extra curricular activities” Funke lists: 
           “Wiretapping, long range photography, Scrabble, unraveling 
           international conspiracies”. 

           Funke looks up to see students file into the classroom, the 
           ones he watched copy homework over the weekend.

           Funke looks back down to the application. A line reads “Title 
           of Article for submission.” The space is BLANK. 

           WHACK! A hand slaps Funke in the ear, gives him a violent 
           “wet Willy”. The hand belongs to CIPRIANO (Junior, big, 
           strong, not too smart). Cipriano sits behind Funke. 

                                 CIPRIANO 
                        Gimme a piece of loose leaf. 

           Cipriano has no backpack, no books, nothing. He talks like he 
           has a perpetual head cold. He’s tough, but lazy about it. 
           Funke hands him a piece of looseleaf. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Gimme a pen. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Where’s the last pen I gave you? 

           Cipriano gives another “hurry up slap”. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Gimme a pen. 

           Funke hands over his pen. He reaches into his backpack to get 
           another. Cipriano looks around the class. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Who’s got it? 

           A student tosses the Spanish WORKBOOK to Cipriano. He copies 
           down the answers at a rapid pace. 

           Steven walks into the room. He looks at Francesca for his 
           book. She doesn’t even acknowledge him. 

           Cipriano tosses the book back to the student, who tosses it 
           to Steven. He sighs relief. Funke grits his teeth knowingly.   

           SENOR NEWELL (40’s, Spanish teacher) enters. The bell rings. 

                                 SENOR NEWELL 
                        Buenos Dias. Ahora, pagina numero 
                        ventidos. Ah...senor Funke? The 
                        homework from the weekend, 
                        enlighten us.

                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           Funke looks down at his workbook. He hasn’t done any of the 
           homework. He grimaces, this isn’t the first time. 

           EXT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - LATER 

           Funke hunches over the water fountain drinking.

                                 PEI-MIN (O.S.)
                        Bobby.

           Startled, Funke looks up. Water shoots onto his shirt pocket 
           soaking his Columbia application. He shakes it dry.   

                                 FUNKE
                        Awesome. 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I want to talk to you.

                                 FUNKE
                        Failing Spanish right now, Pei-Min. 
                        No habla con queso.

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Look, I feel bad about what 
                        happened in there. I know you’re 
                        going for that Columbia summer 
                        scholarship, and, well I’ve got an 
                        assignment for you. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Take you to Homecoming? Heard 
                        you’re going with Tad, yikes. You 
                        know what Tad’s short for right? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Theodore. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Nope. Vagina. Look it up. Listen, I 
                        don’t want some charity story, Pei-
                        Min.  

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I want you to write a story on the 
                        student body president. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Really? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Really. Just get it on paper this 
                        time.
                                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Funke sharpens pencils. Noisy and annoying. 

                                 PAUL MOORE (O.S.)
                        Are we gonna do this or what? 

           Paul Moore sits in a chair reading Sports Illustrated. 

           Funke gives one last sharpen. Sits next to Moore. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Would you please state your name, 
                        date of birth, and social security 
                        number?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Paul Moore, January 29th, 1988. I’m 
                        not gonna give you my soc.

           Funke scrawls something in his notebook. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Fair enough. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Aren’t you the freshman they tied 
                        to the snowman penis? 

                                 FUNKE 
                        Sophomore. Why don’t we start out 
                        slow and work our way into it? If 
                        you had to describe your high 
                        school experience in a word, what 
                        would it be? 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Let’s see...I’d have to say random. 
                        See...

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                      (over Moore’s answer)
                        Random. An evil word that had 
                        downloaded its way into my 
                        generation’s vernacular.

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        ...and then shit just happens and 
                        I’m like there. 

                                 FUNKE
                        That was great. As president how 
                        would you say you’re handling the 
                        recent drop in ACT and SAT scores 
                        along with the drop schoolwide 
                        grade point average?

           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 PAUL MOORE
                        There’s a drop in grade point 
                        average? 

                                 FUNKE
                        It’s been pretty significant 
                        actually over the past two years. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        What do you want me to do about it?  

                                 FUNKE
                        Oh...kay. Let’s talk about the 
                        student council as a whole, as a 
                        living breathing institution. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Well I’m the head, I’ll tell you 
                        that much. And the mouth.

           INTERVIEW MONTAGE IN:

           We move in and out of Paul Moore’s answers to questions. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Plus, I don’t take crap from 
                        people. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Some Junior library representative 
                        wants, y’know, more copies of The 
                        Davinci Code in the library, that’s 
                        gotta go through me. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Kids look up to me. Those little 
                        freshman, they need Paul Moore.  

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        You’re at a party with a thousand 
                        high school seniors, how do you 
                        know which one is Paul Moore? 
                        Answer, he’ll tell you.  

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        That’s how we do, you know what I’m 
                        saying? Just get me the ball and 
                        I’ll run with it. Seriously, you’ve 
                        seen me on the boards. I’ll do 
                        whatever it takes to get it done. 
                        That’s a Paul Moore promise. To 
                        you, to St. Dominick’s, to Paul 
                        Moore. You know what I’m talking 
                        about?

           Funke nods at Moore.

                        I didn’t. I didn’t have the 
                        faintest idea what he was talking 
                        about. Maybe no one did. Maybe 
                        that’s why everybody loved Paul 
                        Moore.    

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        So that’s it? How did I do? 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET CORNER - NIGHT 

           Funke paces back and forth under a street light. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        In my experience, assholes came in 
                        a few sizes. Before I could figure 
                        for certain which one Paul Moore 
                        was I needed to see him in his 
                        element. I needed to see him play 
                        ball. 

           A huge Chevy Suburban pulls up next to Funke. The window 
           rolls down revealing FALDO (20’s). Faldo is a tiny Guatemalan 
           with a tiny brain and a tiny voice. Faldo is not retarded, 
           but he’s not far from it.  

           INT. FALDO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Funke gets in, closes the door.

                                 FALDO
                        Helloooooo.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        My neighbor. Faldo Kribbeljuez. A 
                        mad Guatemalan with a cantaloupe 
                        for a brain. 

                                 FALDO
                        Do you have any--?

           Funke tosses a pack of Skittles at Faldo. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Yeah, I got your Skittles. 

           Faldo looks them over, smiles. 

                                 FALDO
                        Do you have any...Starbursts?

                                 FUNKE
                        No, Faldo.

           Faldo continues on a never-ending spree of requests.

                        He was always asking me for things 
                        except he called them ‘theengs’.  
                        The world was Faldo’s scavenger 
                        hunt and everything was on the 
                        list. All I needed was a ride. 
                        Lately me and the DMV weren’t 
                        seeing eye to eye.

           INT. STUDENT DRIVER CAR - DAY

           Funke is behind the wheel. A LADY DRIVING INSTRUCTOR sits 
           shotgun with a clipboard. The car is parked on an uphill 
           slope.

           Funke turns the steering wheel to the left.

           Funke approaches a busy intersection. The light turns yellow.

           Funke speeds up at an alarming rate, taps the roof of the car 
           and makes a left narrowly missing several cars. Horns blare.

Funke looks confused.

           INT. STUDENT DRIVER CAR - MOMENTS LATER 

           Funke rests his head on the wheel. In front of him a crowd 
           gathers as a POLICE OFFICER fires a euthanasia round into the 
           dying dog lying under Funke’s bumper.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 

           The frenzy that is high school basketball. A huge CROWD fills 
           the stands. Everyone on their feet. Cheering, stomping. 

           On the floor, the ST. DOMINICK’S FRIARS play the ABINGTON 
           COMETS. The scoreboard reads HOME 33 - AWAY 34. 

           Paul Moore grabs a board off the glass. On a fast break, he 
           takes the ball downcourt. With a chance to take the lead, he 
           throws a wild pass that sails out of bounds.   

           COACH D (40s, surly, Italian) and ASSISTANT COACH BYRON (30s, 
           thin, aloof) stand side court. 

                                 COACH D
                        Goddamnit! Byron, get me Wennig!

                                 COACH BYRON
                        Which Wennig, Coach?

           The WENNIG TWINS (Juniors, identical) sit on the bench.

                                 COACH D
                        The fuckin’ good one.

                                 COACH BYRON
                        Wennig.

           The fuckin’ good Wennig twin stands up. Coach D slaps Wennig 
           on his fanny as he subs in. 

           At the score table, Tad Goltz mans the microphone. Funke sits 
           beside him, jotting notes into a small notebook. Goltz keeps

                        She really gave you that story? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Uh huh.

                                 TAD
                        That’s so surprising because, 
                        y’know, you suck so hard.

                                 FUNKE
                        You would know.

           We see that Funke has written under NOTES: TAD = VAGINA.

                                 FUNKE
                        He didn’t give me a whole lot.

                                 TAD
                        Didn’t give you a whole lot?

                      (to Funke)
                        How could he not give you a lot? 
                        Look at the guy. People love him. 
                        He’s like JFK. Smart, charismatic, 
                        good-looking. A tenacious athlete. 

           On the floor, Moore bricks his freethrow.

                        Well, maybe not tonight.

                        Geez, Tad, I didn’t know you felt 
                        that way. You want me to see if 
                        he’ll go to prom with you?

                        Dear Funke, Nobody thinks you’re

                        Time out Friars. 

           The Friars huddle up on the sideline. The ST. DOMINICK’S 
           CHEERLEADERS take to the court wearing PINK ROLLERBLADES.

                                 COACH D
                        Okay guys, we look like a dump I 
                        took last Thanksgiving out there. 
                        P. Moore, what’s goin’ on?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I don’t know, Coach. I’m not 
                        feeling it.

                                 COACH D
                        Not feeling it, huh? Well you got 
                        to, son. You’ve got to feel the 
                        flow, you hear me? Feel that flow 
                        and go. To the hoop, son. Feel. 
                        Flow. Go. Hoop. Win. 
                      (claps)
                        You get me?

           Coach D notices the rollerblading cheerleaders.

                                 COACH D
                        Are those roller blades? Those are 
                        roller blades! 

                                 COACH BYRON
                        I know, I know. Spicing it up. 

                                 COACH D
                        They’re tearing up my court! Get 
                        ‘em off my court! Jesus-cockamamie-
                        Christ! 

           Byron trots off to attend to the cheerleaders.  

           Funke watches Moore take a seat on the bench, bury his head 
           in his hands. He looks up and locks eyes with Francesca who 
           sits in the stands. Francesca looks as worried as Moore.  

           The buzzer sounds. Moore trots back onto the floor.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 

           Funke buys a Coke. He notices Marlon and the Mullen brothers 
           enter the building. They walk towards him on their way into 
           the gym.   

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Marlon, Bobby Funke. I’m doing 
                        this piece on Paul Moore, wonder if 
                        I could get a few comments from the 
                        VP on his-- 

           Marty Mullen pushes Funke into a locker as he walks by and 
           grabs Funke’s coke. Matt Mullen grabs Funke’s small notebook 
           and throws it in his face. They all walk into the gym.   

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Piss off, dork. 

           Inside the gym the crowd groans. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Funke rushes into the gym. Paul Moore lies on the floor 
           clutching his knee. His teammates circle him. The coaches 
           pick Paul up and carry him off the court out of the gym. 

           EXT. ST. DOMINICK’S HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT DAY

           Funke hops out of Faldo’s Suburban, leaves frame. 

           A beat. Faldo lays on the HORN with both hands, non-stop.  

           Funke trots back, tosses a framed picture of JORGE CAMPOS, 
           Mexico’s soccer goalie through the car window. 

           Faldo catches it, smiles, then looks closer.  

                                 FALDO
                        Where is the autograph?

           Funke heads toward the school’s front entrance. He notices 
           large groups of students milling around.

                        You haven’t heard the--?

           Cipriano stops mid-question to tear a no-nonsense fart. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh... Oh shnap.  

           Cipriano smells it, he’s proud of it. He begins to waft his 
           fart up to his nose with his hand.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh yeah. Bon apetite. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Wow.

           Cipriano keeps wafting the fart and smelling. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Somebody stole all the SAT scores 
                        last night. All of ‘em. Cracked the 
                        safe open before scan-tron was 
                        supposed to pick them up this 
                        morning. We gotta retake ‘em now.    

                                 FUNKE
                        Seriously? 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        You think I make jokes? You got 
                        some fruit in your lunch? Gimme 
                        your lunch. 

           Cipriano puts Funke in a head lock.

           PRINCIPAL JOHN T. KIRKPATRICK (40s, tough, Desert Storm 
           veteran) and the school secretary NANCY MARGLE (30s) squat 
           before the safe, which is both open and empty.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        What kind of f-ing a-hole would do 
                        something like this, Nancy?

                        No, but double check with him to be

           DUTCH MIDDLETON (Sophomore) lays on a cot. He smokes a 
           cigarette as he reads Maxim magazine.

           Gym class. A small FRESHMAN boy stands next to a rope that

           The Freshman looks up the rope to see TIM LANDIS (Junior) 
           sitting on the rafters holding a water bottle. 

           Landis looks down, spits water and hits the Freshman.

                                 FRESHMAN
                        Quit it!

           Landis smiles devilishly.

           The basement. Dark and creepy. Various students work on shop 
           projects. Alone at the end of the room is RICKY DELACRUZ 
           (grade unknown). Sparks fly as he welds two pieces of metal.

           standing before him, they wear arm bands with the school 
           crest on them. Matt and Marty Mullen lead the pack. 

           Delacruz sneers.

                        Stealing the SAT’s was like 
                        stealing a Junior’s soul. I could 
                        only imagine the round up 
                        Kirkpatrick was getting together. 
                        It must have been something pretty 
                        fierce.

                        No way. 

                                 MATT AND MARTY MULLEN
                        Way. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           The usual suspects--Landis, Middleton and Delacruz as well as 
           Cipriano stand against the wall. Funke stands at the end of 
           this line-up chewing gum as usual.

           Principal Kirkpatrick paces in front of them. Behind him in 
           his office are plaques and pictures from Desert Storm. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        I assume you all know why you’re 
                        here.

                                 DELACRUZ
                        You finally wanna start that boy 
                        band you’ve been dreaming about?

           The troublemakers have a laugh.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        WATCH IT! 

                                 FUNKE
                        Actually sir, I’m not sure why you 
                        called me down.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Oh no? 

           Kirkpatrick sticks his fingers in Funke’s mouth and removes 
           his chewing gum. Everyone groans in disgust.

                        You’ve got a gum problem and it’s 
                        chewing its way right into an 
                        attitude problem, maybe even theft. 
                        You’re here because I don’t like 
                        gum, I don’t like your snooping 
                        around, and I don’t like you, 
                        Funke.

           Everyone shuts up. Kirkpatrick resumes pacing.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Gentlemen, you are filth. Your 
                        parents have either spoiled or 
                        abused you to such a degree that 
                        your hearts have become black and 
                        lifeless. Your brains are warped, 
                        your souls doomed. There is no hope 
                        for any of you.

                        Kirkpatrick had the tired, crazed 
                        demeanor of an old soldier of 
                        education. The kind that wakes up 
                        one morning only to realize that in 
                        fifteen years he hasn’t made a bit 
                        of difference. It’s a dangerous 
                        thing to wake up to.

                        One of you vermin stole the SATs 
                        out of this very office. I am 
                        certain of it. But please, I 
                        beseech you, do not come forward. 
                        Because I am going to enjoy 
                        tracking you down. Just like I 
                        enjoyed tracking down that camel 
                        humping ammunitions envoy two 
                        clicks east of the Tigris. Do you 
                        know what the Arabic “laa hriiq” 
                        translates to, Cipriano?

                                 CIPRIANO
                        No sir. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        It means “don’t shoot”. I’d be sure 
                        to learn it.  

           The boys stand there, slightly scared. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Dismissed.

           Funke walks with Delacruz. Delacruz hands him a stick of gum. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Thanks. 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        You do it? 

                                 FUNKE
                        No way. Did you?

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Naw, man. I got picked up for 
                        underage possession last night. 
                        Spent the night in holding.   
                      (he leans in, whispering)
                        Fucked up.

                                 FUNKE
                        That’s some alibi. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - BOYS’ BATHROOM - LATER - DAY 

           Funke stands at the sink. He splashes water on his face and 
           reads the GRAFFITI on the mirror in front of him. It reads, 
           “Special Ed Neck Exercises, See Other Mirror.” 

           Funke turns to the adjacent mirror. More graffiti reads 
           “Special Ed Neck Exercises, See Other Mirror.” Funke returns 
           to the original mirror to find Francesca in its reflection.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I hope you know how bad that is for 
                        your skin. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Francesca.

           Francesca walks to the sink. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I wouldn’t recommend washing your 
                        face here at all, what with all 
                        that lead in the school’s water, 
                        but if you insist--
                      (turning hot water knob)
                        --you should use warm water. Cold 
                        water dries the skin out.

           Francesca takes Funke’s hand and puts it under the water.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        See. Isn’t that better?

                                 FUNKE
                        What are you doing in the men’s 
                        room? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I thought I might find a man in 
                        here. Are you a man, Funke? 

           Funke wants to answer, but can’t quite pull it together. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I’m screwing with you. I need your 
                        help.

                                 FUNKE
                        Help with what?

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Whoever stole the SATs, I need you 
                        to find them and get them back. I 
                        aced that thing and I don’t want to 
                        have to do it again. I can get in 
                        early to Penn with that score.
                        And the next SAT test isn’t for 
                        another two months. I’m not waiting 
                        that long. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Why me? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Whoever did it is on the lookout 
                        for Kirkpatrick, not you. And I’ve 
                        got a feeling about you, Funke. 
                        This stuff’s right up your alley.   

           Francesca places a hand on Funke’s chest, gives him a pat and 
           walks off. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - SPANISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Senor Newell begins to hand out today’s test. Funke sits in 
           his desk. Cipriano sits behind him. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Hey Funke. You want a gumball? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Not falling for the gumball trick 
                        Cipriano, so you can put your

           One by one, we see Funke talking with Middleton and Landis at 
           different intervals in the day.

                        From what I got off of Ruben the 
                        guard, I figured that the tests had 
                        to have been stolen during the 
                        game, between the hours of seven 
                        and eight. I grilled Middleton and 
                        Landis. Figured the first one to 
                        hit me probably did it. I didn’t 
                        even get two for flinching. They 
                        were either all innocent or all in 
                        on it. That left me right back 
                        where I started.

ST. DOMINICK’S - COACH D’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Coach D sits at his desk on the phone. He tosses a pink 
           rollerblade into a box filled with pink rollerblades.

                                 COACH D
                        Uh huh. You tell Hanold she can 
                        come talk to me when they play 
                        basketball games during cheerleader 
                        halftime. Yeah. Make it a foot long 
                        spicy Italian, Byron. Yeah, foot 
                        long spicy Italian, yeah. Yeah I 
                        want one and I got one.

           Coach D hangs up.

                                 COACH D
                        Sorry about that, kid. Where was I?

           Funke sits across from Coach D.

                                 FUNKE
                        Paul Moore.

                                 COACH D
                        P. Moore, that’s right. Well, I’d 
                        say his stats speak for themselves.  

           Coach D hands Funke a sheet of paper with Moore’s STATS. 

                                 COACH D
                        Best all around captain I’ve ever 
                        had here. 100% effort every game, a 
                        born leader. Problem is, there’s 
                        not too many big time programs with 
                        room for a six foot white kid. 

                                 FUNKE
                        So no colleges are recruiting him?

                                 COACH D
                        Ivy leagues and a bunch of D-III’s. 
                        Hey, you’re that kid they tied to 
                        the big snow dick, right?

                                 FUNKE
                        Uh huh. And I’m in your tenth 
                        period gym class. 

           Coach D shrugs as if to say, who gives a shit.

                                 FUNKE
                        How are his test scores? Can he 
                        even get into an Ivy league school?

                        I’ve known Paul since he was a 
                        seventh grader and grades have 
                        never been his strong suit. But 
                        believe me, if he wants to go Ivy, 
                        he’ll figure out a way to get in.  

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Funke sits on a cot facing NURSE PLATT (26), who somehow 
           makes the combination of hippie and school nurse extremely 
           hot. She’s not the sharpest tool in the shed. 

                                 FUNKE
                        So how did Paul’s knee look?

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        Okay. Why? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Well, because Nurse Platt, Paul 
                        injured it. That’s why they brought 
                        him here. 

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        Oh. I thought he had diarrhea. But 
                        he was limping so I guess his knee 
                        could have been injured. Yeah. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Okay. Were you here with him in the 
                        office the whole time?

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        Yeah. Well except I got hungry and 
                        Paul said I should get something to 
                        eat. His treat. So I went across 
                        the street and got a gyro at that 
                        Greek place, Little Nikos. Have you 
                        ever been there? It’s so good. 

                                 FUNKE
                        You mean to tell me that Paul was 
                        alone in here?

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        I mean, so good. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Nurse Platt. For how long did you 
                        leave Paul on his own that night?

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        Um, hey Drew, when I go get Greek 
                        food how long does it take me?

He’s still 
           smoking. 

                                 MIDDLETON
                        ‘Bout twenty minutes.

           Faldo drives, Funke sits shotgun. Funke is deep in thought. 

                                 FUNKE
                        We’re onto something Faldo. 

                                 FALDO

           INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE’S - DAY

           Funke sits at a tiny kids’ table. Sitting across from him is 
           CHRISSY MOORE (9). LITTLE KIDS run around behind her.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Chrissy Moore. Hi. Thanks for 
                        meeting me here. I’m a friend of 
                        your brother Paul. 

                                 CHRISSY 
                        No you’re not. 

                                 FUNKE
                        How do you know? Now I just want to 
                        ask you some questions because I’m 
                        going to write a story about your 
                        brother in the school newspaper. 
                        How does that sound? 

                                 CHRISSY
                        Stupid. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Okay. Now your brother is a really 
                        good basketball player. Have you 
                        ever seen him play at his school? 

                                 CHRISSY
                        I want a candy necklace.

                        I WANT A CANDY NECKLAAAAAACE! 

           From afar a few KIDS and GIANT MOUSE take note. Funke smiles 
           at them, waves politely. 

                                 FUNKE
                        You can’t have a candy necklace, 
                        Chrissy. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        He has one. 

           Funke glances at Faldo, who operates the ARCADE CRANE MACHINE 
           next to him. Faldo is mesmerized by the ocean of junk prizes 
           inside. He’s in “theeng” heaven. 

           He wears a huge candy necklace around his neck. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Don’t worry about him, Chrissy, 
                        he’s just my driver. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        You can’t drive a car? You’re a 
                        high schooler and you don’t have a 
                        license? 

                                 FALDO
                        I have my license. 

                                 FUNKE
                        And your necklace, Faldo, now shut 
                        up. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        I want a candy necklace. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’ll get you a candy necklace as 
                        soon as you answer a few questions. 
                        I’ll have Faldo here drive us down 
                        to Candy Haven and get you a whole 
                        box of candy necklaces. Now--

                                 CHRISSY
                        I want his necklace. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Chrissy. 

                                 CHRISSY
                        You give me his necklace and I’ll 
                        tell you everything about my 
                        brother. Everything. I read his 
                        journal.

Faldo quickly goes to 
           take his first lick of the necklace. Funke grabs him, the two 
           begin to wrestle for it. 

                                 FALDO
                        Theeeeengs! 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER 

           Funke walks down the road. He’s lost his ride. Cars whiz by. 
           Funke is a little disheveled, but happy. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Chrissy Moore was one candy 
                        necklace well spent. I was on the 
                        verge of breaking this thing wide 
                        open.  

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NEWSPAPER OFFICE  - NIGHT 

           Funke sits staring at a blank computer screen.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        All I had to do now was write it.  

           A long beat. Funke continues to stare.  

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        All I had to do now was write it.

                                 FUNKE
                        Fuck.

           Funke slowly types. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NEWSPAPER OFFICE  - DAY

           Wide-eyed, Pei-Min reads Funke’s story now neatly typed out.  

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Bobby. This is amazing.

           Funke looks tired. He’s been up all night.

                                 FUNKE
                        Can I send someone out for some 
                        coffee? Preferably Tad. 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Is it true?

                        Every word.

                        Nice.

           Tad peers his head around the corner of the sports cubicle.

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I want you to fact check Funke’s 
                        story.

                                 TAD
                        Yeah. I’ll get on it right after I 
                        sell my grandmother into a life of 
                        sexual slavery. 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Just do it!

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Paul Moore rounds the corner from the showers wearing a towel 
           and holding a bottle of shampoo. He yells as he walks.  

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I won’t tell you again Ongatumamwe. 
                        It’s Paul Moore’s shampoo. I got 
                        enough clout around here to get 
                        your ass deported for less. 

           Moore notices the Mullens standing in front of his locker. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        What are you homos doing down here? 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Funke walks into the school. Everyone’s cracking a copy of 
           the St. Dominick’s Daily. The headline reads “Hail To The 
           Thief”. A picture of Paul Moore eating a banana accompanies 
           it.

           WHITE KID WITH CORNROLLS walks up to Funke holding a paper.

                                 WHITE KID
                        This story’s gonna start, like, a 
                        friggin’ coup de’tat in this bitch. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Thanks a lot. I like your dreads.

           Funke continues down the hallway to his locker. He’s greeted 
           with high fives, pats on the back.

           There’s a COMMOTION at the other end of the hall.  
                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I didn’t do it! This is crazy! I’m 
                        the president! I’m the president!

           Kirkpatrick and Paul Moore stride down the hall. 
           Kirkpatrick’s got his arm in a deathlock. The Mullens follow.  

           Kirkpatrick, Moore and the monitors walk past Funke. They 
           stop in front of a locker. Funeral silence.  

           Kirkpatrick pulls a tiny Swiss army knife out of his pocket 
           and twirls it expertly. Moore’s eyes widen. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Fire in the hole. 

           Kirkpatrick jams the knife into Paul Moore’s locker door and 
           pries it open. The SAT TESTS spill out onto the floor. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I, I don’t know how those--

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Office. 

           The monitors grab hold of Moore and take him away. Moore 
           struggles. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I didn’t do anything! I’m a patsy! 
                        I’m a patsy!

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NEWSPAPER OFFICE - LATER 

           Funke sits on the desk at the front of the room. Pei-Min 
           reads over his shoulder. The staff hangs on every word.  

                                 FUNKE
                        “But in the end Paul Moore’s high 
                        school experience was far from 
                        random. It was plotted and planned 
                        out right down to the very safe 
                        that held his unsatisfactory SAT 
                        scores. Bobby Funke.” 

           Funke lowers the paper.

                                 FUNKE
                        I write for the paper. 

           The entire staff applauds. Pei-Min puts her arm around 
           Funke’s shoulder. She leans in. 
                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)

                        I just wanted to let you know, 
                        Bobby, I’m submitting this article 
                        to the Columbia people with my 
                        highest commendation. 

           Funke smiles ear to ear. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hey Funke? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Yeah, Dave. 

                                 DAVE
                        How’d you get his little sister to 
                        talk?  

                                 FUNKE
                        Gave her a candy necklace. 

           The whole room cracks up. 

           A door opens, Francesca enters. The place quiets down as she 
           walks up to Funke.

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Francesca. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I wanted to thank you for finding 
                        the SATs. And for showing me what a 
                        sketchball Paul really is. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Okay.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Thing is I seem to have lost my 
                        date to Homecoming. And I can’t 
                        think of anyone I’d rather go with 
                        than St. Dominick’s own Wolf 
                        Blitzer.  

           The rest of the room hangs on every word. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Blitzer’s a TV reporter. I’m more 
                        of a Woodward and Bernstein. Except 
                        just one guy.

                                 FRANCESCA
                      (leans in, whispers)
                        But I like Wolf Blitzer. I like the 
                        Wolf a lot.

                        Okay. I can be Wolf Blitzer, sure. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I knew that you could. Pick me up 
                        at eight.

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Marlon, wearing an expensive suit, opens the door. Funke 
           stands on the porch in a suit of his own. He holds a corsage.

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Marlon.

           Marlon opens the door without a word. Funke walks inside. 
           Marlon’s date, AMY EARLY (Junior), lies passed out on the 
           couch cradling a bottle of Southern Comfort. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Kill anybody today? 

                                 MARLON
                        I’ll let you play with her tits for 
                        twenty bucks.

           Marlon lights a Lucky, slumps down on the couch next to Amy.

           Funke has a look around the place. It’s gorgeous. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Nice place. 

                                 MARLON
                        Have a good look while you can. I 
                        doubt you’ll be stopping by again. 

                                 FUNKE
                        That’s great. I guess I should 
                        congratulate you on your new 
                        presidency. Isn’t it funny how 
                        somebody can be your average cake 
                        walk VP one day and head of the 
                        school the next?

                                 MARLON
                        Yeah. It’s kind of like how 
                        somebody can be the school joke one 
                        day and then go to Homecoming with 
                        the hottest girl at St. Dominick’s 
                        the next. Isn’t it? 

                                 FUNKE

           Francesca walks down the stairs in a dress that compliments 
           her every curve, school girl becomes super model.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Hey Funke.

                                 FUNKE
                        Francesca. You look stunning.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Thank you.

                        She doesn’t have to go to the 
                        hospital again, does she?

                                 MARLON
                        Eh.

           Francesca takes Bobby’s hand, leads him to the door.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Alright. We’ll see you at the 
                        dance.

           INT. FALDO’S SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Funke opens the back door to Faldo’s Suburban.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You got us a driver? Cool.

           Francesca and Funke get inside.

                                 FUNKE
                        Yeah. Cool.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 

           Standard fare for a Homecoming Dance. Balloons, streamers, 
           colored lights. A BAND plays cover tunes on-stage. 

           Funke slow dances with Francesca on the dance floor.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Do you think I’m a bitch, Funke?
                        You can be honest. I don’t really 
                        care either way, I’m just curious.

                                 FUNKE
                        I used to think so, but now I don’t 
                        know. I think maybe you’re just 
                        misunderstood.

                        Nobody’s misunderstood. That’s just 
                        what people say when they don’t 
                        like who they are. If people think 
                        I’m a bitch, it’s because I am. 
                      (leans in)
                        So I guess you’re going to have to 
                        come to terms with the fact that 
                        you’re into a girl who’s a bitch.

                                 FUNKE
                        How do you feel about newspaper 
                        dorks?

                                 FRANCESCA
                        When I see one I’ll let you know. 

           Funke takes that one to heart. The song ends. The lead singer 
           steps up to the mic.

                                 VILLAGE IDIOT ONE
                        Here’s a tune for all you 
                        hellraisers out there.
                      (singing)
                        We don’t need no education...

           Cipriano raises a lone fist in the air.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        YEAH!

           Francesca steps back from Funke.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I’m gonna sit this one out. I’ll 
                        lose my cred in the ladies room if 
                        I don’t make an appearance.

           Francesca makes her way to the ladies’ room.

           Middleton and Delacruz sit on the bleachers. Middleton has an 
           unlit cigarette between his lips. EYE PATCH GIRL (Freshman, 
           with an EYE PATCH) walks past them. Delacruz makes EYE 
           CONTACT. 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Dude, I think that chick just 
                        winked at me.

           Funke sits down between Middleton and Delacruz. 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        You’re light on your feet, Funke. 
                        But we noticed you’re having a 
                        problem out there.

                        That close to a girl like her, it’s 
                        natural.

                        What you wanna do is tuck that 
                        thing into the side of your boxer 
                        shorts so it’s running down your

                        Okay, yeah. Thanks.

                        Yeah, and you have to jam it down

                        That sounds frightening, sir.  

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Funke. I wanted to take this 
                        opportunity to express my gratitude 
                        for helping get the SAT’s back. I 
                        admire your persistence and your 
                        thirst for blood.

           Kirkpatrick tosses Funke a stick of gum.

                                 FUNKE
                        Thanks, Principal Kirkpatrick. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        And Funke. Chew it on your own 
                        time. Or I’ll be on you faster than 
                        you can say Juicy Fruit. 

           EXT. ST. DOMINICK’S HIGH SCHOOL - LATER - NIGHT 

           Funke exits the main doors of the gym. He sighs and pops in a 
           stick of gum.  

           Funke rounds the corner straight into Paul Moore’s FIST. He 
           hits the pavement. Moore stands over him.  

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        How does it feel? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Like someone just punched me in the 
                        mouth. 

           Funke starts to get up. Moore holds him down with his foot. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        My life here is over now, dick! I 
                        didn’t steal those SAT’s!

                                 FUNKE
                        Then where were you between 7:45 
                        and 8:10 that night? 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Screw you, Funke. I hope Francesca 
                        chews you up and spits you out. Do 
                        you really think I’d chance 
                        everything for an SAT score? Who 
                        the hell do you think you are? 
                        Inspector Gadget?

                                 FUNKE
                        Go go gadget dickhead repellent.

           from his back pocket.

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        You’re not a reporter, Funke, 
                        you’re a leech! And a phoney. 

           Moore crumples up the paper, throws it at Funke’s face. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        You couldn’t find the truth if it 
                        was staring you in the face. 

           Moore spits, then walks away.

           Funke touches his bloody lip, picks up the crumpled paper, 
           unfolds it. It’s a CORNELL UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - THE NEXT WEEK - DAY

           Start of the day. Funke, now healing nicely, places books 
           from his locker into his bookbag. He closes his locker door.

           Pei-Min waits behind it holding a letter marked COLUMBIA. 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Congratulations, Bobby.

           She hands Funke the letter. He takes it, nearly in disbelief.

                                 PEI-MIN
                        They just need to verify all the 
                        detail and you get the summer 
                        scholarship. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Homeroom. Funke sits in his desk reading through the letter. 
           The opening line reads “Congratulations, Mr. Funke”. 

           Funke reads on. “Prior to acceptance, your story will be 
           thoroughly proofed by one of our graduate students. Your fact 
           checker is: Ben Striedel, M.A. Journalism.” 

                                 FUNKE
                        Striedel.

           Funke sits in fron of Cipriano, who engages in his AM routine-
           - farting and wafting the foul smell toward his face. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh yeah. Blueberry pie, eh Funke?

           The PA crackles on.

                        Good morning, students. As I’m sure 
                        you’re all aware, there’s been a 
                        regime change here at St. 
                        Dominick’s. Your new president, 
                        Marlon Piazza would like to say a 
                        few words. 

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        Thank you. I wanted to take this 
                        opportunity to talk to the student 
                        body about some changes I plan to 
                        make.

           Cipriano tears ass again. Funke raises his hand.

                                 FUNKE
                        Bathroom?

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Funke walks past the boys’ bathroom.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Funke peers through the IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION ROOM where 
           delinquents are held. It is a tiny room, almost like an attic 
           located on the school’s top floor.

           Paul Moore sits on one side of the room, baseball mitt on his 
           hand, repeatedly whipping a TENNIS BALL against the wall in 
           anger. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        In school suspension. Cruel and 
                        unusual punishment reserved solely 
                        for dangerous offenders. Rumor had 
                        it that Rocky Raccoon was doing 
                        time for spray-painting 
                        Kirkpatrick’s car.

           ROCKY RACCOON (Junior) sits at the other end of the room 
           wearing sunglasses, reading a book.  

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Everyone called him Rocky Raccoon 
                        on account of the Beatles' song.

           Rocky removes his sunglasses to reveal two BLACK EYES.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        The black eyes didn't help much 
                        either. He and Moore had a history.

ST. DOMINICK’S - CHEMISTRY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Rocky works diligently on a series of test tubes. He writes 
           figures down on a lab sheet. Francesca sits next to Rocky at 
           the lab table casually reading STAR magazine. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Rocky and Francesca dated. For a 
                        week last year while Paul and 
                        Francesca were broken up. 

           Rocky gives Francesca some figures. She pats Rocky’s head, 
           and goes back to her magazine.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        She was his lab partner. You know 
                        how that works. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Francesca and Rocky walk down the hallway during change of 
           class. Rocky smiles.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Poor sap really fell for her. 
                        Didn't realize she was stringing  
                        him along for a grade and a 
                        reaction. 

           As they pass Paul in the hallway, Francesca slips her hand 
           into Rocky's. Paul fumes.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        She got both. 

           INT. MOORE HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Paul and Francesca suck serious face on the couch. A few of 
           their FRIENDS idle around the house drinking, smoking.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        When Paul and Francesca inevitably 
                        got back together, she gave Rocky 
                        the big adios. But he wanted her 
                        back.

           The front door swings open. Drunk, Rocky walks into the 
           living room holding a bottle of GIN. He swoons, grins.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        So while Paul was throwing a minor 
                        soiree, Rocky burst in and grinning 
                        a grin, he said--
                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 ROCKY
                        P Moore, my boy, this is a 
                        showdown.

           All the guys bum rush Rocky, Paul leads the charge. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        And as the song goes, Rocky 
                        collapsed in the corner.

           Now with two black eyes, Rocky collapses in the corner.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Moore thought he looked so funny, 
                        he made sure that Rocky had a pair 
                        of shiners at all times.

           ROCKY’S BLACK EYE MONTAGE:

           Paul gives Rocky a black eye.

           The Mullens give Rocky a black eye.

           A BUTCH-LESBIAN FIELD HOCKEY PLAYER gives Rocky a black eye.

                                         BACK TO:

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - SUSPENSION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Sitting on a small stool in the hallway outside the 
           suspension room is a Hall Monitor. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        I need five minutes with Moore. 

           Funke tosses the Hall Monitor a stick of gum. He stands and 
           opens the door with a set of keys latched to his belt. 

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        You got three. 

           Funke walks into the room. Moore and Rocky look up at him. 
           The door locks behind him. 

           Rocky and Moore look like they’re each in their own little 
           jail cell. Rocky has clippings on the wall, piles of books at 
           his table. He reads thoughtfully. He’s been there for awhile. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Long time no see, Rocky. 

                                 ROCKY 
                        Weekends and holidays, man. 

           Moore looks up at Funke.  
                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Aren’t you supposed to be in home 
                        room? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Maybe I got to thinking. 

           Funke sits down in a chair facing Moore. Moore continues to 
           throw the ball against the wall. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Maybe you should have done that 
                        sooner. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        “Maybe humans are the pet 
                        alligators that God flushed down 
                        the toilet.” 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        What?

                                 FUNKE
                        Chuck Palahniuk said that.

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Who’s Chuck Palahniuk? 

                                 ROCKY (O.S.)
                        He wrote Fight Club, numbnuts. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Stow it, fag.

           The Hall Monitor bangs on the wall, signals to shut up. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Tell me where you were that night. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        You think it’s that easy? You think 
                        that I can just tell you where I 
                        was and that’s gonna set it all 
                        straight? Look around, Funke! I’m 
                        screwed no matter what I say now.  

                                 FUNKE
                        So just tell me the truth. 

           Moore says nothing.

                                 FUNKE
                        Listen, you’re in here right now 
                        for the rest of the year with a guy 
                        who hates your varsity guts.  
                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 ROCKY (O.S.)
                        Eat a dick, Moore! 

           Moore throws the tennis ball at Rocky, just missing his head. 
           The Hall Monitor bangs on the wall again. 

                                 FUNKE
                        If you didn’t do it, I’m all you 
                        got. And you only have me for one 
                        more minute. Now spill it. 

           Moore agonizes. 

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Last year I did some things on the 
                        basketball court I’m not proud of. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Like what?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Like shaving points. Twice last 
                        season. It was two times too many. 
                        I only did it because I needed the 
                        money. 

                                 FUNKE
                        For what?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        It doesn’t matter. When I was 
                        approached this year, I turned it 
                        down. We had a shot at State, I’m 
                        not gonna mess that up my Senior 
                        year.  

                                 FUNKE
                        So this person who approached you, 
                        you think he might have set you up?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        I don’t know. Maybe. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Gimme his name.

           Funke removes his notebook. Moore says nothing.

                                 FUNKE
                        If you don’t get cooperative, 
                        you’re gonna convince me that 
                        you’re completely full of shit. 
                        You’ve gotta-- 
                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 PAUL MOORE
                        No, you’ve gotta start thinking 
                        with your head! Anybody could have 
                        set me up! Do you know how many 
                        people benefit when the president 
                        goes down?!

           The Hall Monitor opens the door. He grabs Funke’s arm.

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        Time’s up, Funke. You’re gettin’ 
                        the animals all riled up, startin’ 
                        a rumpus. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What’s this guy’s name, Moore?

           The Hall Monitor starts to pull Funke out of the room.

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        I said, time’s up.

                                 FUNKE
                        What’s his name?

                                 PAUL MOORE
                        Freddy Bismark.

           Funke and the Hall Monitor wrestle a bit. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Where do I find him? Where is he? 
                        Moore!

           The door closes and locks. The Hall Monitor smirks and begins 
           to slide the stick of gum into his mouth. Funke flicks it 
           away with his index finger. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - LATER - DAY 

           Funke walks down the hall during a change of class. He sees 
           Francesca at the other end of the hall going into her class. 
           She smiles, waves. Funke waves back. The PA crackles on.  

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Bobby Funke please report to the 
                        office, immediately.   

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 

           A bit uncertain, Funke holds a telephone.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Hello? 
                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           On the other end is Ben Striedel (Grad Student), the guy who 
           sits in the front row of class and never shuts up. 

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                      (mispronounces)
                        Robert Funk. Ben Striedel, 
                        Columbia. I’m proofing your story 
                        here, chief. It’s not bad. Not 
                        exactly good either-- 

                                 FUNKE
                        Excuse me?  

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        So I’m gonna need the following 
                        from you: transcriptions of your 
                        interviews, a bibliography, MLA 
                        style natch, your notes, pretty 
                        much anything pertaining to the 
                        story.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Uh, I’ll need some time to gather 
                        this. Can I get your number? 

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        No.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - LIBRARY - STUDY HALL - DAY

           Students sit at tables diligently doing homework. Funke 
           chomps on gum as he peruses a shelf of books.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        I found Freddy Bismark where all 
                        high school graduates go on to live 
                        in infamy. 

           We see that Funke is looking at YEARBOOKS. He takes an old 
           St. Dominick’s yearbook, opens it. 

           He locates Freddy’s senior photo. He has a fiendish look 
           about him, a smile that implies he’s done something wrong.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        They say a picture’s worth a 
                        thousand words. But a senior quote 
                        is worth a goddamn encyclopedia.

           Freddy’s senior quote: “Cash Rules Everything Around Me. 
           CREAM Is The Money. Dolla Dolla bills, y’all--Wu-Tang Clan.”

                                 EYE PATCH GIRL (O.S.)

           Funke glares up at the frat house. The place is a shithole, 
           it sits high atop a very large hill.

           Funke walks into the frat house to find a group of PLEDGES 
           sitting on the floor, wearing diapers, sucking their thumbs.

                        Um, I’m looking for the business. 

           PLEDGE ONE points upstairs.

           INT. SIGMA PI FRAT HOUSE - THE BUSINESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Funke knocks on a door, it swings ajar. FREDDY BISMARK 
           (college junior) waves Funke inside. 

           The place looks more like a bookmaker’s than a dorm room, 
           sports play on numerous TV’s. Bismark sits at a desk with his 
           feet up skimming through Cliff Notes while on his cell phone.  

                                 BISMARK
                        ...you want ten times on Villanova. 
                        And ten on Syracuse. No problem.

           Bismark hangs up.

                                 BISMARK
                        Let me guess. Fake ID?

                                 FUNKE
                        No. Do you mind if I sit?

           Bismark gestures ‘go ahead’. Funke sits.

                        I’m here about Paul Moore.

                        It sure is. I was actually going 
                        through some old St. Dom’s 
                        yearbooks and I came across your 
                        senior quote. I see that cash still

                        Sounds like fun, kid. Sorry but I 
                        don’t know any Paul Moore.

                        Well he seems to know you. Said you 
                        asked him to drop a few games last 
                        year in exchange for some cheddar. 

                                 BISMARK
                        That sounds like an illegal 
                        practice to me and I wouldn’t know 
                        anything about that. I’m just a

           INT. SIGMA PI FRAT HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 

           BROTHERS mingle around nonchalantly hazing the pledges who 
           crawl on the floor picking up empty beer cans. 

           Bismark stands before a Pop-A-Shot basketball game. He puts 
           up shots as Funke grills him. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Let me tell you some more about 
                        this guy you don’t know. Somebody 
                        stole the SAT’s from Kirkpatrick’s 
                        safe and everyone thinks that it 
                        was Paul Moore. Thing is, Moore 
                        swears he’s been set up.

                        a busy man. 

           Bismark finishes a beer, whips it at a pledge. 

                                 BISMARK
                        Pick it up!

                        Moore seems to think you might have 
                        something to do with it. Says you 
                        might have been sore cause he 
                        wouldn’t shave points this year. 

           Bismark stops shooting.

                        To me, his name is Small Potatoes. 
                        I got kids on half the teams in the 
                        district. If I had to go out and 
                        frame every one that didn’t want to 
                        brick a few lay-ups, I wouldn’t 
                        have time to spend my money. Get 
                        it?

           Funke looks Bismark over. He didn’t do it.

                        You can take that garbage out with 
                        you. I don’t have time for these 
                        reindeer games, kid. Pledges!

           Two PLEDGES swing Funke back and forth over the porch 
           banister. The rest of the FRAT watches on while drinking.

                                 FUNKE
                        What did he need the money for?

                                 BISMARK
                        I don’t know. I heard he was having 
                        girl problems. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What’s that supposed to mean? 

                                 BISMARK
                        He was having problems with girls.

           The pledges toss Funke over the bannister down the hill.

                        She was some chick from Northridge, 
                        man. That’s all I know.  

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - THE NEXT MORNING

           Funke stands on the corner drinking a cup of coffee. Faldo’s 
           Suburban pulls up. Funke opens the door. 

                                 FALDO
                        You know you’re going to have to 
                        give me many theengs for such a

                        I’m well aware of that, Faldo.

           EXT. NORTHRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER 

           Faldo’s car parks in front of the school. The building is 
           massive, built out of red brick. A public school.

           Funke catches sight of ELLIOT DUNCAN (Sophomore). He wears 
           khakis and a button down. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Elliot Duncan. An old grade school 
                        acquaintance I’d kept in contact 
                        with throughout the years. Proved 
                        to be useful.

           Funke gets out of the car.

                                 ELLIOT
                        There’s the old smartass. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Elliot.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Those pubes come in yet? 

                                 FUNKE
                        You still eating Crayolas? 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Only when I’m hungry. How’ve you 
                        been?

           INT. NORTHRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Funke and Elliot stride down the hallway. They pass students 
           on their way to class. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Well, as I mentioned on the phone, 
                        I managed to implicate our school 
                        president in a sordid theft, one 
                        that basically ruined his life in a 
                        fashion so perverse and horrible 
                        that he’s now in in-school 
                        suspension with his arch enemy. And 
                        I’m dating his girlfriend. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        So what’s the problem? 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m not sure the guy did it 
                        anymore. You’ve seen this kid?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yeah. That’s Valerie’s boyfriend. 
                        You’re dating Valerie?

                                 FUNKE
                        The plot thickens, Elliot. 

           INT. NORTHRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Funke and Elliot walk into the room where VALERIE TORRES 
           (Junior) sits at a desk. She is Mexican. Cute, petite, dark 
           hair. Her thrift-store wardrobe makes it clear she’s poor. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Hi Valerie, I’m Bobby Funke.

           Funke holds out his hand. Valerie doesn’t shake it. 

                                 VALERIE 
                        I know who you are, I know what you 
                        did. So tell me, why should I tell 
                        you anything? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Cause I’m a swell guy and you’re a 
                        nice girl. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Not gonna do it for me. 

           INT. NORTHRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Valerie strides down the hall. Funke pursues her.

                                 VALERIE
                        Man, all you St. Dominicks guys are 
                        the same. You don’t know the first 
                        thing about Paul.  

                                 FUNKE
                        When did you two break up? 

                                 VALERIE
                        It’s kind of hard to break up with 
                        someone when you’re not officially 
                        going out. 

           Funke catches up, places a hand on Valerie’s shoulder. She 
           stops, faces Funke.

                        Look, it’s quite possible that Paul 
                        was framed. All I’m trying to do is 
                        find out what really happened. If

                        My father’s gambling debt. He owed 
                        the Diaz brothers a lot of money. 
                        They were ready to get it out of 
                        him whatever way they could. Paul 
                        wouldn’t stand for it. He hated 
                        seeing me or my family pushed 
                        around. Somebody told him about

           Kirkpatrick leads the students in song.

He’s looking for something, but he’s not 
           sure what it is... 

           Then he finds it. Funke glares up at the A/V Room, which sits 
           atop the stands. Paul Moore stands at the projector window 
           with a RIFLE cocked professionally in his arms.

                                 FUNKE
                        Moore.

           Funke’s up and bolting for the gym doors.

           The song ends, Kirkpatrick salutes. Coach D takes to the 
           podium. 

                                 COACH D
                        St. Dominick’s, today’s MC and your 
                        president. Marlon Piazza! 

           The Roots’ “THE SEED 2.0”, a high tempo hip-hop anthem blasts 
           over the PA. The SCHOOL BAND plays along with the song.  

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - A/V ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Moore’s POV through the sight of the rifle. He watches Marlon 
           take to the podium. He wets his lips. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Funke bounds up the stairs two, three at a time.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS 

           The crowd applauds Marlon as he takes the mic.

                                 MARLON
                        We are the Friars and the Friars 
                        are great! 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - A/V ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Moore gets Marlon in his sights.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Funke reaches the glass A/V door. He turns the knob. Locked.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Applause dies down. 

                                 MARLON
                        I have one prediction for Friday’s 
                        game. And that prediction, is pain.

           silenced when a burst of BLOOD explodes across Marlon’s 
           chest. Marlon falls back behind the podium.

           Then, pandemonium. Everyone panics. Students run in all 
           directions. Screaming, shouting, crying. 

           By the exit, Kirkpatrick expertly waves combat signals.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Over here, students! This way to 
                        saftey!

           Everyone ignores him.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Funke kicks the door, nothing. He kicks it again. Again.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - A/V ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Off Funke’s kicking, Moore glances over his shoulder, sees 
           Funke. He gets back to the rifle.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Coach D crawls to where Marlon lies behind the podium.

                                 COACH D
                        Marlon! Can you hear me, son?

           Marlon sits up. He wipes blood from his chest, looks at it. 
           It’s not really blood, but the paint from a RED PAINTBALL.

           Coach D dabs at the paint.

                                 COACH D
                        It’s a friggin’ fugazi.

           Moore starts to pick targets off at will. He nails Matt and 
           Marty Mullen. Kirkpatrick gets a HEAD SHOT. He hits 
           Ongatumamwe in the balls. The kid doubles over in pain.

           Moore blasts three rounds into the ST. DOMINICKS BANNER 
           covering the word VERITAS (Truth) in paint. 

           Francesca stands in the middle of the gym floor with her arms 
           folded staring up at Moore. Moore gets her in his sights. A 
           tear rolls down his cheek. 

           INT. ST. DOMINCK’S - HALLWAY/A/V ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Funke picks up an old film strip projector, heaves it through 
           the glass door. Funke dashes toward Moore, pushes him away 
           from the window. Still, Moore manages to get his shot off.

           Moore’s shot misses Francesca’s body. Instead, it smears her 
           penny loafers in crimson paint.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - A/V ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Moore fires a close range shot that hits Funke’s THIGH. Funke 
           screams, grabs his leg.

                                 FUNKE
                        You dick.

           Moore bolts past Funke out the shattered glass door. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NURSE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Funke lays on the nurse’s table with his pant leg rolled up. 
           Funke’s leg is bruised and cut up. 

           Nurse Platt hands Funke a cup of GATORADE and two MIDOL.

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        Here. Take these.

                                 FUNKE
                        Midol? Are you serious? Lady, I got 
                        shot in the leg with a paintball.

                                 NURSE PLATT
                        I'm gonna go to the vending machine 
                        for some pretzels. Do you want 
                        anything from downstairs? 

                                 FUNKE
                        A bandage? 

           Nurse Platt just stands there. It’s over her head. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Forget it. 

           Nurse Platt leaves. Funke closes his eyes, sighs. The phone 
           next to him RINGS...and RINGS...and RINGS. Funke picks it up.

                                 FUNKE
                        Nurse Platt’s phone.

                        I have not, yes yes, have not 
                        received your notes on the story, 
                        boss.

                                 FUNKE
                        I know. I had to do some back-
                        tracking. To locate everything.

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        Backtracking, huh. You know, there 
                        was a kid a few years back, said he 
                        was doing some backtracking. Turned 
                        out he fabricated a whole story to 
                        get into the program. Made the 
                        whole thing up. They kicked him out 
                        of course, blacked balled him from 
                        all national publications. Last I 
                        heard he was working as a 
                        pharmaceutical test subject for 
                        carpal tunnel syndrome.

                                 FUNKE
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        Your story’s thin kid. I want your 
                        notes. Stat.

           Funke hangs up. Closes his eyes, sighs. When he opens them, 
           Francesca is standing above him. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Francesca. 

           Francesca fondles Funke’s hair. 

                                 FUNKE
                        There’s something I need to tell 
                        you. 

                                 FRANCESCA 
                        Not before I get to say thank you.

           Francesca leans in and kisses Funke passionately. 

                                 FUNKE
                        For what? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        For saving my life out there. 

                                 FUNKE
                        It was a paintball gun.

                        But you didn’t know that did you. 

           Francesca moves in again. Funke kisses back, then pulls away. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        Francesca, as a professional 
                        journalist and a man who is 
                        dedicated to his work I think you 
                        should know, your boyfriend was 
                        framed. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I already told you. He’s not my 
                        boyfriend. I have a new one. 

           Francesca moves in and the two go at it some more.

           Out the window, three stories below, Paul Moore is being led 
           in handcuffs into the back of a police car. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - FOYER - DAY

           The next morning. Students file into school.

           Two NEW GUARDS man the front and back entrances.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - SUSPENSION ROOM - LATER - DAY 

           The same Hall Monitor that guarded Moore and Rocky sits 
           outside the room. He has a FAT LIP and eats a doughnut.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Moore?

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        Uh huh.

                                 FUNKE
                        Looks good on you. I need five 
                        minutes with Rocky. 

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        He’s not in there. They moved him 
                        down to the library until they fix 
                        up the door. 

           The window of the room has been shattered. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Why do they still have you here?

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        Red tape.

ST. DOMINICK’S - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Study Hall. The library is packed. Students study superhard. 
           It’s kind of freaky. A sign reads “SATs will be held Saturday 
           the 15th”.

           Funke notices the quiet, unnerving demeanor of the room. 

                                 DELACRUZ (O.S.)
                        Freaky, isn’t it?

           Funke turns to find Delacruz standing behind him.

                                 FUNKE
                        What’s going on?

                                 DELACRUZ
                        It’s getting down to the college 
                        admissions wire. GPA’s are down, 
                        and apparently they just got the 
                        results back from the ACT’s. 
                        Everybody bombed it.

                                 FUNKE
                        Everybody? 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Look at it this way. You see Seamus 
                        Fenelon over there? 

           Funke looks to see SEAMUS FENELON (Senior, pale, Irish). His 
           teeth chatter and his hand taps his book as he studies. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Yeah. 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Tanked it. Third generation Notre 
                        Dame and it’s not looking good. 

                                 FUNKE
                        His teeth are chattering.

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Probably from the Ritalin. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Ritalin? I didn’t know Seamus had 
                        ADD.

                                 DELACRUZ
                        For a reporter, you’re really out 
                        of the loop. Fenelon doesn’t have 
                        ADD. Half the school’s on Ritalin

                        Wow. Good talk, Delacruz. Listen, 
                        you seen Rocky Raccoon around here?

                        They’ve got him over in American

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Funke walks to Rocky Raccoon who sits at a table in the 
           facing the wall. The table is covered in books. He flips 
           through some pages, deep in thought. Barely notices Funke. 

                                 ROCKY
                        I was wondering when you were gonna 
                        pay me a visit. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Why’s that? 

                                 ROCKY
                        Don’t play dumb with me. I was the 
                        last person who saw Moore before he 
                        busted out. You might even think I 
                        helped him get out of there. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Did you? 

           Funke sits. Rocky smiles slightly.

                                 ROCKY
                        You’re big on quotes, aren’t you, 
                        Funke?
                      (reading aloud from book)
                        “I am only slightly less astonished 
                        by the egotism of the assassin, the 
                        inflated self esteem it requires to 
                        kill a president, than I am 
                        astonished by the men who run for 
                        president. These are people who 
                        have the gaul to believe they can 
                        fix us.” 

           Rocky holds up the book Assassination Vacation. 
                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 FUNKE
                        So what, you’re saying that 
                        presidents and assassins are the 
                        same type of people?

                                 ROCKY
                        No, in Paul Moore’s case, the same 
                        person. Guy was the president, but 
                        when he lost it all, he took 
                        matters into his own hands. Got me 
                        to thinking, presidents, assassins, 
                        it’s all a matter of circumstance. 
                        The only constant is that they’re 
                        both assholes. 

           Rocky picks up another book entitled John Wilkes Booth. Rocky 
           locks eyes with Funke. 

                                 ROCKY 
                        “Never saw Booth”. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What? 

                                 ROCKY
                        Another quote. Right before Moore 
                        went Columbine he snapped his cell 
                        phone shut and muttered that under 
                        his breath. “Never saw Booth”. He 
                        was looking right at me.  

                                 FUNKE
                        John Wilkes Booth? 

                                 ROCKY
                        Lincoln never saw him coming, man. 
                        Creepy ass shit. Couldn’t even 
                        sleep last night. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Rocky. You hate Paul Moore, don’t 
                        you?

           Rocky takes his sunglasses off exposing his two black eyes. 

                                 ROCKY
                        What do you think? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Do you think he stole those tests?

                                 ROCKY
                        I hate to admit it, but it doesn’t 
                        seem like something that any decent 
                        president would do, or assassin for 
                        that matter.

ST. DOMINICK’S - LUNCHROOM - LUNCHTIME - DAY

           Eye Patch girl and an OVERWEIGHT GIRL sit next to each other 
           at a lunch table quietly sharing french fries and ketchup.  

           Marlon, Alex, and the Mullens move through the lunch line. 

                                 ALEX
                        Check it out. It’s that slut Laura 
                        Hoffner.

           LAURA HOFFNER (Sophomore) walks past the line. 

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        You know what I did to that ass?

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Probably the same thing I did to 
                        your mom’s ass. 

           Mimics banging ass.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Dude. That’s Mom.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Shit.

                                 ALEX
                        I'd give Laura a nice Strawberry 
                        Shortcake. Pow. 

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Respect. 

           Funke cuts through the line to get up to Marlon. The group 
           makes its way toward a table. Funke struggles to keep up.   

                                 FUNKE
                        Marlon. You mind if I have a word 
                        with you?

                                 MARLON
                        What about? 

           The group sits down. There are no seats for Funke.

                                 ALEX
                        Then I’d give her the old Hoover.

           Funke searches for a chair. He finds one, sits down. 

                                 ALEX
                        I've got this move I call The

           on a napkin in the middle of the table. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Why do you suppose Paul Moore would 
                        target you, Marlon? 

                                 MARLON
                        How should I know? 

           Alex grabs another fry and dips it into some ketchup. 

                                 ALEX
                        It's when I'm railing a girl and I 
                        steal her cell phone and call up 
                        her father so he can listen to me 
                        do her. Yeah, yeah.

                        The Father's Day Special.

           All the guys laugh. Marlon grabs the whole package of fries. 

           We now see that the fries that the guys are eating actually 
           belong to the Eye Patch Girl and the Overweight Girl. The 
           girls are shocked and disgusted. Marlon could care less.

                                 MARLON
                      (to the girls)
                        What’s going on? 

                                 FUNKE
                        You know what? I don’t think you 
                        guys have done any of this shit 
                        you’re talking about. In fact...

           Funke stands up, takes the package of fries from Marlon and 
           hands it back to the girls. Marlon stares him down. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m positive you haven’t.

           Matt Mullen flashes his hall monitor badge. 

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        You want JUG for the rest of the 
                        week, Funke? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Why’d he shoot you, Marlon?

                                 MARLON
                        He shot you too, didn’t he?

                                 FUNKE
                        He shot you first.

                        Yo, screw this guy Marlon. 

                                 MARLON
                        ‘Course he shot me first, I took 
                        his spot. What do you want me to do 
                        about it? That’s what the VP does 
                        when the Pres gets the boot. It’s 
                        not my fault the dude went apeshit.

                                 FUNKE
                        You and Moore didn’t argue at all 
                        before the SAT’s were stolen? 

                                 MARLON
                        Dude, I barely know Moore. You saw 
                        how he ran things, I wasn’t even in 
                        the equation. 

                                 FUNKE
                        That doesn’t answer my question. 

                                 MARLON
                        Tell you what, Funke. Come by the 
                        house on Friday, I’m having a 
                        party.   

                                 ALEX
                        Aw, come on dude. 

                                 MARLON
                        It’s alright. He wants to ask me 
                        some questions for the paper. He 
                        can come. I don’t want to get on 
                        his bad side. I mean, look what 
                        happened to Moore. 

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - NIGHT 

           A high school party how you remember it, not like what you 
           see in movies. No band, no strobe-light dancing, no jumping 
           in the pool. Just underage drinking, music, Play Station.  

           Alex clutches a 40oz as he raps along with the music in front 
           of a large mirror. He’s no Jay-Z.  

                                 ALEX
                        If you’re havin’ girl problems I 
                        feel bad for you son, Schneider’s 
                        got some problems but a bitch ain’t 
                        one. Hit me. 

           Matt & Marty Mullen and Cipriano stand together.

                        All I know is, me personally, I’ve 
                        tried to smoke banana peels many, 
                        many times. Got me nowhere.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        These were Chiquita bananas?

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Don’t front, Cipriano.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Yeah, don’t front.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        You know what really messes you up 
                        is toothpaste. You put it on a 
                        cigarette and smoke it.    

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Uh uh. No way. Toothpaste is good 
                        for you. That shit kills tartar.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        No he’s right, Cipriano. Steve Ives 
                        tried it last week at that party at 
                        the caves. He was wasted.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        I guess you didn’t hear me. Kills 
                        tartar. Prevents gum disease. 
                        Tastes minty fresh. Nothing minty 
                        fresh can be bad for you.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        I guess you’ve never heard of 
                        peppermint schnapps.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Or menthols. Dipshit.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Twenty bucks says that toothpaste 
                        doesn’t do a goddamn thing.  I’ll 
                        smoke it myself. 

           Matt and Cipriano shake hands.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        You’re on.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        I’m gonna go find some toothpaste. 
                        BRB, sucker. 

           Cipriano bounds up the stairs.
                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Dude, I hope you’re right. 

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Don’t worry about it. Cipriano’s 
                        gonna get so wasted, he’ll think it 
                        was the toothpaste. 

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        You see all the angles, bro.

           Matt and Marty pound fists.

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS 

           A knock at the front door. Francesca opens it, looking 
           insanely hot. Funke stands on the doorstep.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Funke.

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Francecsca.

           Over Funke’s shoulder, Francesca spots Faldo in his car. 
           Faldo honks the horn.

                                 FALDO
                        Theee--!

           Funke slams the door shut behind him. He has a look around. 

                                 FUNKE
                        So this is a party. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You knew enough to show up 
                        fashionably late. 

                                 FUNKE
                        No, Faldo needed a universal 
                        remote. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I’m really glad you’re here. 

           Francesca kisses Funke on the cheek. In the background, Tad 
           sits on the couch. He takes note of the two of them. 

           Francesca takes Funke’s hand, leads him to the keg. As Funke 
           passes KIDS at the party, they pound fists with him, slap him 
           on the back. Funke smiles, nods in quiet recognition. He’s 
           getting used to being cool...and he’s liking it.  

           Francesca pours a beer from the keg into a red plastic cup.
                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 FUNKE
                        You know what, I have to get up 
                        early for my driver’s test. So--

           Francesca hands him the beer she’s just poured.

                                 FUNKE
                        Alright.

           Funke takes a sip, lowers his cup. Marlon stands before him.

                                 MARLON
                        Funke. You made it.

           Funke struggles ever so slightly with the taste of beer. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Thanks for the invite, Marlon. 
                        This, this is some good brew. It’s 
                        you know, cold. 

                                 MARLON
                        I’m glad you like it.

           Funke spots Pei-Min across the room. She waves to him.

                                 FUNKE
                        Would you two excuse me?

           As Funke walks across the room to meet Pei-Min, he passes the 
           Mullens and Cipriano. Cipriano squeezes toothpaste onto a 
           cigarette, lights it, takes a drag and coughs horribly.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oof.

           Pei-Min and Funke stand together in a corner. Amy Early sits 
           slumped, passed-out in an armchair next to them.

                                 PEI-MIN 
                        What’s up, Bobby? Fancy seeing you 
                        here.  

                                 FUNKE
                        How am I doing? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I’d say you’re at the top of your 
                        game. That’s the power of the 
                        press.

                                 FUNKE
                      (sighing)
                        Yeah. 
                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 PEI-MIN
                        What the matter? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Have you ever second guessed a 
                        story? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        You’re second guessing your Paul 
                        Moore story?

                                 FUNKE
                        I don’t know. You don’t know where 
                        he is now, do you?

                                 PEI-MIN
                        One of the secretaries said his 
                        parents took him to some sort of 
                        private mental institution upstate. 
                        The real press can’t even get to 
                        him. What do you have cooking? 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m not sure yet. What do you know 
                        about Ritalin? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I’ve been trying to write something 
                        about it since my sophomore year. 
                        It’s a problem. I could name 
                        fifteen kids who are definitely 
                        using it to help with studying on a 
                        regular basis. 

                                 FUNKE
                        So why haven’t you written 
                        something? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I don’t know its source. Nobody 
                        will tell me where it comes from. 

                                 FRANCESCA (O.S.)
                        Funke!

           Funke looks up. Francesca waves him toward the kitchen.

                        You better go. Your girlfriend 
                        calling you.

                                 FUNKE
                        Maybe she wouldn’t be my girlfriend 
                        if you let me take you to 
                        Homecoming.

She doesn’t know what to say.

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Francesca leads Funke to a Beirut game (beer pong) already in 
           progress. Marlon stands at one end of the table, Tad and his 
           partner Dave at the other end. A small crowd watches. 

           Marlon hands Funke a ping-pong ball.

                                 MARLON
                        Go ahead, Funke. Take a shot.

                                 FUNKE
                        What I am I aiming for? Those cups?

                                 MARLON
                        That’s right.

           Funke sinks the head cup. The crowd cheers.

                                 MARLON
                        Atta boy.

           Tad drinks his cup. He lines up for a shot. 

                                 FUNKE
                      (to Marlon)
                        Marlon, you and Paul had been the 
                        head of student council for two 
                        years. In all that time--

           Tad hits a shot. Marlon holds the cup up for Funke to drink. 

                                 MARLON
                        Hey Funke. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Yeah? 

                                 MARLON
                        It’s a party. 

           Funke deliberates. He takes the cup from Marlon, drinks it.

                                 MARLON
                        Good. Now let’s beat these 
                        faggotmasters.  

           Marlon smiles. Funke takes the ball from Marlon, nails his 
           shot. Marlon pulls up to shoot his ball. 

                                 MARLON
                        Rebate! 

           Marlon nails it. Funke and Marlon high five.

           Francesca hugs Funke’s waist.

           The games goes on. Time passes. Funke hits numerous shots, 
           drinks numerous beers. Francesca hangs all over him. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You’re a natural, baby.

           Just as Funke’s about to shoot a winning shot, Cipriano 
           stumbles into the room. He’s got toothpaste smeared around 
           his mouth and a cigarette hanging from his lips. He pushes a 
           few kids out of the way. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        I got winners!

           Cipriano falls onto the pong table. It collapses into a V. 
           All the remaining beer spills onto him. 

                                 TAD
                        You stupid asshole.

           Matt & Marty Mullen rush into the room. As they wrestle 
           Cipriano up off the floor he licks beer from his fingers. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        TARTAR CONTROL! FLUORIDE’S ALL UP 
                        IN THIS SHIT! 

                                 MATT MULLEN
                      (to Marlon)
                        Sorry, Marlon. What should we do 
                        with him?

                                 MARLON
                        He’s too wrecked to go home. Let me 
                        see...yeah, tie him up. In the 
                        study.

           Cipriano struggles to get free. It’s futile.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        TARTAR CONTROL IN THE HOUUUSE! 

           Amidst the commotion, Francesca whispers in Funke’s ear. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Let’s go upstairs. 

           Francesca takes him by the hand.

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - MARLON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Francesca opens the door. Funke, pretty drunk, glances around 
           the room. It isn’t hers.

                        Stepbrother’s. Somebody already 
                        passed out in my bed.

                                 FUNKE
                        Won’t he mind that we’re in here?  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Marlon doesn’t care.

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Cipriano wrestles as the Mullen brothers tie him up to a 
           chair with EXTENSION CORDS. He looks over the cords. 

                                 CIPRIANO 
                        What are ya gonna do now, plug me 
                        in? 

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - MARLON’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Francesca and Funke make out as Francesca shuts the door 
           behind her. She kisses Funke’s neck.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Francesca, listen, I need to know 
                        where they took Paul. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I don’t know why you keep bringing 
                        him up. Paul’s gone, Funke. What 
                        you wrote was true and he’s gone. 
                        I’m yours now.  

           Francesca kisses Funke on the mouth. The two tumble onto 
           Marlon’s bed. Francesca pulls back for a moment, locks eyes 
           with Funke and stares lovingly at him.  

                                 FUNKE
                        What are you doing with me? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        What kind of question is that? 

                                 FUNKE
                        A good one. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I like you. I like the way you look 
                        at me, like it’s for real. Like you

                        Like if tomorrow St. Dominick’s 
                        just went away, you’d still look at 
                        me the way you do. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I can’t stop thinking about you. I 
                        tried on eleven shirts before I 
                        came over here. 

           Francesca starts unbuttoning Funke’s shirt. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        It’s cute. I want you to spend the 
                        night.

                                 FUNKE
                        What about your parents? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Shh...My dad’s out of town. He 
                        won’t be back until Tuesday.  

                                 FUNKE
                        What about your mom?

                                 FRANCESCA
                        My mom’s dead, Funke. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m sorry. 

           The two go at it passionately. 

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - HALLWAY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Beer cans litter the hallway. Marlon’s bedroom door opens. 
           Funke walks out into the hallway and shuts the door behind 
           him. He’s a bit disoriented. He rubs his eyes and then...

           Funke’s face lights up. He raises his arms in victory. 

           Funke sees a clock in the hall it reads 8:30. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        Shit. 

           Funke takes off running. 

           INT. FACHINI HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS 

           Cipriano is wide awake. He calmly sits in a chair, still tied 
           up. He licks his lips curiously. 

           Amy Early rolls over in her sleep on the couch. Her pants are 
           all WET, getting wetter. Cipriano takes note.

                        Hey Early, you’re pissing yourself. 

           Funke comes bounding through the room, trying to run while 
           putting on his shoes. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Funke! 

           Funke stops, smiles. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Cipriano.  

           Funke runs out of the house.

                                 CIPRIANO
                        FUNKE! You son of a-- 

           Cipriano tears a no-nonsense beer fart. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh. 

           A beat. Cipriano smells it. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh. 

           Unable to waft with his hands, Cipriano cocks his leg at a 
           right angle and wafts the smell with his leg. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oh yeah. 

           INT. STUDENT DRIVER CAR - LATER 

           Funke drives. The DMV lady sits shotgun. 

                                 DMV LADY
                        You’re doing considerably better 
                        this time around, Mr. Funke. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Thanks. I had a good night’s sleep.

           Funke winks at her. She blinks.

                                 DMV LADY
                        Take a right here onto Grand.

           Funke signals, makes a right.

           As he rounds the corner, Funke sees Alex Schneider walking 
           out of a PHARMACY holding a BAG. Alex gets into the backseat 
           of the Mullen brothers’ Dodge Caravan. 
                                            (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           Funke passes the Caravan. He slows and pulls to the side of 
           the road so that Marty can pull out and drive past him.

                                 DMV LADY
                        What are you doing?

                                 FUNKE
                      (adjusting rearview)
                        Sorry. Just wanted to adjust this 
                        mirror a smidge. Safety first.

                                 DMV LADY
                        That’s very good of you, Mr. Funke. 

           Funke pulls out, tails the Caravan.

           Two or three blocks down, the Caravan pulls over in front of 
           another pharmacy. Funke slows to a stop. 

                                 DMV LADY
                        Now what are you doing?

                                 FUNKE
                        Oh, I thought I’d parallel park 
                        here.

                                 DMV LADY
                        Well I was just going to have you 
                        do that back at the DMV lot. 

           Funke eyes an open spot across the street from the pharmacy.

                                 FUNKE
                        But this is such a challenging 
                        spot. I’m really feeling it today.

           Funke throws it in reverse.

                                 FUNKE
                        For me, it’s about the aesthetic. 

                                 DMV LADY
                        The aesthetic?

           Funke backs into the spot quickly, perfectly. He hits the 
           roof with his fist.

                                 FUNKE
                        Put it on the board...

           The DMV Lady pauses, then checks off PASS on the parallel 
           parking segment on her clip board. 

                                 FUNKE
                        YES! DMV Lady you are awesome!
                                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           Funke drums his hands on the wheel and watches as Matt comes 
           out of the pharmacy, bag in hand.

                                 DMV LADY
                        Well I must say Mr. Funke, that was 
                        some mighty fine parking. 

           Funke doesn’t respond. He watches the Caravan pull out of the 
           parking lot across the street and then pulls out to tail it.

                                 DMV LADY
                        I never thought I’d see the day 
                        but, I’d say you’re about to get 
                        yourself a driver’s license.

           Funke is stopped short at a red light. He watches in agony as 
           the Caravan speeds through the intersection.

                                 FUNKE
                        Really?

           Funke takes a deep breath. 

                                 DMV LADY
                        Really.

                                 FUNKE
                      (to himself)
                        Woodward and Bernstein. Woodward 
                        and Bernstein.

                                 DMV LADY
                        All you have to do is get me back 
                        to the DMV in one piece and--

           Funke guns it as he spits his gum out the window. He tears 
           around the corner and makes a U-turn, in the direction of the 
           Caravan, avoiding numerous cars.

                                 DMV LADY
                        AHHHHHH!

           Funke changes lanes like a mad man. 

           INT/EXT. STUDENT DRIVER CAR - LATER 

           Funke pulls the car into the DMV parking lot. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Four pharmacies and a dozen traffic 
                        violations later, Alex and the 
                        Mullen brothers were still making 
                        the rounds.

           Funke turns off the ignition. 
                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 FUNKE
                        So I guess I’ll see you next week?

                                 DMV LADY
                        Get out.

           Funke gets out of the car, walks away from the DMV. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Somehow I doubted they had penny 
                        candy in those bags. 

           Funke slides in a new stick of gum and smiles. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY 

           Funke walks down the hall. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        It didn’t take much research to 
                        figure out that Ritalin didn’t come 
                        cheap. If that’s what those guys 
                        were buying, they needed a way to 
                        come up with the cash. I figured it 
                        might help to be the school 
                        treasurer.   

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICE - DAY 

           Funke and Francesca meet up outside the Student Council 
           office in between classes. Funke kisses her on the cheek.

                                 FUNKE
                        Did you get it? 

           Francesca holds up a key. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I’m a Junior class rep, it wasn’t 
                        hard. I’m gonna be late for class 
                        though, what’s this all about? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Something big. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        This better not have anything to do 
                        with Paul, I told you--

                                 FUNKE
                        It’s Schneider. I think he’s been 
                        embezzling council funds.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Alex? 
                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           Funke unlocks the door, opens it. He flicks on a light. 

           Tad Goltz faces a filing cabinet. He spins around, surprised. 
           He holds an accounting ledger in his hands.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Tad? What are you doing in here? 

                                 TAD
                        I might ask you the same question. 

                                 FUNKE
                        She’s on Student Council. 

                                 TAD
                        But you’re not. You get her in here 
                        for a little afternoon delight. Or 
                        is it something else?  

                                 FUNKE
                        What are you talking about?

           Tad smiles, slyly. 

                                 TAD
                        Nothin’. 

           Tad finishes writing something in a small notebook. He shuts 
           the accounting ledger closed. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Look Goltz, this is my story, if 
                        you think you’ve got something on 
                        it you better run it by me first.  

                                 TAD
                        You know, a few weeks ago nobody 
                        even knew you existed. Funny how 
                        things change. 

           Tad shuts off the light. 

                                 TAD
                        See you in class Francesca. 

           Tad walks out, the bell rings. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I have to go, Funke. Now.

                        Okay, I’ll lock up.

                        It only locks with the key and I 
                        have to return it right now to Mr. 
                        Rudnick. I can’t be late, I have a 
                        test.  

           Funke contemplates quickly. He grabs the book Tad was looking 
           at out of the filing cabinet and stuffs it in his bag. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Funke...

                                 FUNKE
                        Sorry. 

           The two exit. Francesca locks the door. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’ll explain everything later, I  
                        promise.  

           Francesca bounds off down the hall, upset. Funke watches her 
           for a moment then takes off in the other direction. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - DAY 

           Coach D stands in front of his class. Students in black and 
           white gym uniforms sit in rows on the gym floor.

           Funke eyes Schneider, who sits in the row in front of him.

                                 COACH D
                        ...so let me end the class on this 
                        note. Once upon a time, there was a 
                        little Indian boy and this little 
                        Indian boy decided to climb up the 
                        mountain. On his way he met a snake 
                        and the snake says, he says, 
                        “Little Indian boy, please carry me 
                        up the mountain. If you do I 
                        promise I will not bite you.” So 
                        the little Indian boy carried the 
                        snake up the mountain and when they 
                        got to the top, do you know what 
                        that snake did?

           Nobody cares.

                                 COACH D
                        That snake bit the little Indian 
                        boy.  
                      (beat)
                        Boys and girls...that snake...was 
                        drugs and alcohol.

           The bell rings. Everybody bolts for the gym doors.

                        Point being, if you’re gonna drink, 
                        eat something!

           Funke makes his way towards the exit. He’s in a hurry. 

                                 COACH D
                        Funke. C’mere a second, son.

           Funke hesitantly makes his way to Coach D. He watches as Tad 
           stops Schneider right outside of the gym doors. 

                                 COACH D
                        You’re a writer. What’d ya think of 
                        my Indian boy story? The snake, 
                        that’s symbolism. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I thought it was great, Coach. 
                        You’ve inspired me to, y’know, not 
                        abuse my body.

                                 COACH D
                        Good. See, I’m gonna write my 
                        autobiography and I thought you 
                        could give me a few tips.  

           Funke watches Tad and Alex as they walk into the hallway.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Stampede. Students bolt for the exits. 

           Funke pans the crowd in search of Pei-Min. He sees her at the 
           far end of the hall walking into the newspaper office. 

           Funke makes his way toward the office through the crowd. He 
           runs right into Francesca. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I’ve got a bone to pick with you. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey Francesca.

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I was late to class and Rudnick 
                        took a grade off my test. I’ll 
                        probably get a B now. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m sorry, seriously. But right now 
                        I have to--

                                 FRANCESCA

                        I will. We can work on it the whole 
                        weekend. I just--

                                 FRANCESCA
                        I have to email it to Egan by ten 
                        tonight. I already had an extension 
                        from yesterday. You owe me one. 

           Funke commiserates. Francesca moves in.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Please. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        I’m all sweaty from gym.  

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You can shower at my house. My 
                        stepmom’s away with my dad.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Do your parents actually live at 
                        your house? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Come on, it’ll be fun. 

           Resistance is futile. Funke gives in. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - FOYER - DAY

           Thursday morning. A grinning Funke walks into school. 

           Everyone’s cracking a copy of the St. Dominick’s Daily. 
           People stare at Funke. Something is up. He stops smiling. 

                                 EYE PATCH GIRL 
                        You shouldn’t have done that. 

           Funke grabs a copy from the Eye Patch Girl. He stares at it.

                                 FUNKE 
                        Son of a bitch. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NEWSPAPER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           WHACK! Funke slams the newspaper down on Pei-Min’s desk. 
           There’s a picture of Funke holding hands with Francesca while 
           blowing a bubble. The headline reads FUNKE FRAMED HIM! 

                                 FUNKE
                        What the hell is this! 

           Pei-Min sits calmly behind her desk.

                        You tell me. It all checks out. I 
                        can’t believe I hadn’t seen it 
                        earlier. You framed Paul Moore. You 
                        couldn’t get the story you wanted 
                        so you made one up. You got him 
                        kicked out, made yourself a hero 
                        and then stole his girlfriend. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Tad’s full of shit! I was up all 
                        night working on the best way to 
                        present a story to you. Schneider 
                        is cooking the books!

                                 PEI-MIN
                        The books you stole from the 
                        student council office? 

                                 FUNKE
                        He’s using funds to buy Ritalin and 
                        then selling it to half the school!  

                                 PEI-MIN
                        What does that have to do with Paul 
                        Moore, Funke? Making up some other 
                        story now won’t work with me. You 
                        stole the SAT’s. You stole the 
                        Student Council’s money. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What money? 

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I always believed in you, Bobby. 
                        You were such a promising writer. 
                        Such a promising person. I really 
                        thought you were one of the few 
                        kids in school who didn’t need to 
                        be popular. I guess I was wrong. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I swear to God, I don’t have the 
                        faintest idea what you’re talking 
                        about.  

                                 PEI-MIN
                        I’m recommending that Tad gets your 
                        summer scholarship. Listen Funke, I 
                        got AP English right now.

           Funke watches Pei-min leave, dumbfounded. 

                                 FUNKE
                      (sighs)
                        Awesome.

ST. DOMINICK’S - BOYS’ BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           White Kid With Dreads stands at the john next to Funke. 

                                 WHITE KID
                        I don’t even wanna piss next to 
                        you. You Nazi.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Homeroom. Funke sits in his desk. Students around him read 
           copies of today’s paper. They whisper and point at Funke. 

           Cipriano reads a copy behind Funke.  

                                 CIPRIANO
                        That’s some cold shit, Funke. 
                        What’d you do with the thousand 
                        dollars? Give it to Francesca so 
                        she’d screw you? 

           Cipriano gives Funke a quick “hurry up” slap. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Gimme all your pens before you get 
                        suspended. 

           Funke turns around and faces Cipriano. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Cipriano, first of all there is no 
                        money. Secondly, you don’t think I 
                        went to all the trouble of stealing 
                        the SAT’s just so I could go out 
                        with Francesca do you?

                                 CIPRIANO
                        I would. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Francesca and I happen to be in 
                        love, Cipriano. Maybe that’s just 
                        something you can’t mentally 
                        comprehend yet. 

           Funke turns around. 

           SLAP. Francesca whacks Funke across the face. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You asshole! 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Nope.

           Funke stands up. 
                                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 FUNKE
                        Francesca, it’s not true. Goltz 
                        doesn’t know what he’s talking 
                        about! I’d never hurt you. All I’m 
                        trying to do is uncover the truth. 
                        This is bigger than me and you, 
                        it’s bigger than Paul Moore, it’s--  

           Francesca slaps Funke again. She sits down in her chair 
           fuming, on the verge of tears. 

           Senor Newell enters the room. He sees Funke standing up. 

                                 SENOR NEWELL 
                        Have a seat, Mr. Funke. 

           The bell rings. Funke stammers. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Senor Newell, I need to go to the 
                        bathroom. Please. 

                                 SENOR NEWELL
                        We’re about to have chapter seven 
                        homework review right now. I’ll let 
                        you go after. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Look, okay, I don’t have to go to 
                        the bathroom, I just need a hall 
                        pass so I can go see a few people 
                        right now before--

                                 SENOR NEWELL
                        Go see some people? It’s 8:45 and 
                        this is Spanish class. Sit down. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Senor Newell, please--

                                 SENOR NEWELL
                        Sit down, turn to page fifty eight 
                        and read us the first translation. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I don’t have the homework.  

                                 SENOR NEWELL
                        Why not? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Because I’m the only one in this 
                        whole stinking class that didn’t 
                        copy it from Lopez last night!

                        I don’t like your attitude, Mr. 
                        Funke. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Oh yeah? 

           Mr. Kirkpatrick knocks on the class room door. He is flanked 
           by the Mullen brothers. 

                                 KIRKPATRICK 
                        Senor Newell. I need to speak with 
                        Mr. Funke. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Funke stands in the hall before Kirkpatrick. The Mullens 
           stand to the wayside. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Thank God you got me out of there, 
                        there’s a lot we need to talk 
                        about. You aren’t going to believe 
                        some of the stuff I’ve uncovered. 
                        Where should I start? Point-
                        shaving, theft, embezzling, a 
                        pharmaceutical drug ring.

           Funke chews his gum furiously as he talks.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Are you chewing gum?

                                 FUNKE
                        There’s this pill okay, it’s called 
                        Ritalin, it helps kids concentrate, 
                        the whole school is--

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        I asked you if you were chewing 
                        gum.

                                 FUNKE
                        That’s, that’s irrelevant. I’m 
                        trying to tell you--

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        I think you’re a little foggy on 
                        why I’m here, Mr. Funke. From what 
                        I understand you’ve made a mockery 
                        of this high school. You take this 
                        place for a circus and you take me 
                        for a clown. I am not an f-ing 
                        clown, Mr. Funke. I am not here to 
                        fill your f-ing heart with joy and 
                        laughter and sunshine.

                        I am here to discipline you. 
                        Thoroughly. And today, your name is 
                        Abdul Al-Camelsexer.

           Kirkpatrick adjusts his tie.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        Now. I’m going to ask you again and 
                        this time I want an answer. Is. 
                        That. Gum. In. Your. Mouth? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Is this gum in my mouth? Is this 
                        gum in my mouth? 

           Funke gets a crazy look in his eyes.

                                 FUNKE
                        Yes! This is gum! It’s gum. It’s 
                        gum it’s gum it’s gum it’s gum it’s 
                        GUM! I chew it all the time. Non-
                        stop. Twenty four seven. I’ve got a 
                        fucking jumbo pack right here in my 
                        pocket. I’ve got a locker, it’s 
                        filled to the brim with gum. No 
                        books. Just gum.  

           Funke takes his gum out and shows it to Kirkpatrick.

                                 FUNKE
                        Gum! G to the U-M, buddy!

           Funke slaps the wad of gum onto a locker door.

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m talking to you about matters of 
                        the utmost importance and you’re 
                        talking to me about gum! Doesn’t 
                        anybody care about what matters 
                        here? Has everyone in this school 
                        gone crazy?!

                                         CUT TO:

           INT. IN SCHOOL SUSPENSION ROOM - DAY 

           Funke sits in the very desk that Paul Moore sat in. He looks 
           almost catatonic. Rocky sits across from him. 

                                 ROCKY
                        Bathroom breaks. You get one. Right 
                        after lunch. Work’s brought in at 
                        the start of the day, and that’s 
                        nice ‘cause you can finish it all 
                        before third period if you want. 
                        That leaves you the rest of the day 
                        to do whatever.

Rocky’s cell phone 
           rings, it’s a text that reads “Hand phone to Funke ;0” 

                                 ROCKY
                        “Hand phone to Funke.” 

           Rocky shrugs, hands his phone to Funke.

           The phone rings. Rocky nods for him to answer it. He does. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Hello? 

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        Hello, dickhead. 

                                 FUNKE
                        You’ve got to be kidding me. 

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        I’ve got two stories on my desk and 
                        one contradicts the living shit out 
                        of the other. Did you really think 
                        you could pull one over on Mitch 
                        Striedel? Did you? Because that’s 
                        just wholesale crazy, chief. I have 
                        a 175 IQ. That means I skipped 
                        third grade.      

                                 FUNKE
                        You don’t understand, Striedel. I 
                        was framed.

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                      (laughing)
                        Oh, that’s rich. You’re a funny 
                        guy. Listen, I’m meeting with the 
                        director of summer admissions after 
                        the weekend. We’re gonna have a 
                        long talk about you and your 
                        completely inept journalism skills.

                                 FUNKE 
                        But--

                                 STRIEDEL (O.S.)
                        Tick tock tick tock. Can you hear 
                        that, Funk? That’s the sound of 
                        opportunity waving goodbye to you. 
                        Send it a postcard ‘cause it’s not 
                        coming back. You got ‘til Monday to 
                        give me the truth.

           Funke hands the phone back to Rocky, slumps down.

                        I’m not supposed to be here.

           Rocky leans back, stretches.

                        Tell me about it, kid. Everybody in 
                        ISS is innocent.

                        Let’s just say that’s what they put 
                        me in here for. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ROCKY
                        Forget it. You’ve got enough to 
                        worry about.

                        My advice is masturbate. Four, five 
                        times a day. I’ve got some decent 
                        DVDs, I’ll bring ‘em in for you. 

                                 FUNKE
                        This Goltz story is totally 
                        inaccurate! I just can’t find the 
                        connection between all the 
                        variables. Everyone and their 
                        brother had a reason to set Moore 
                        up. I could have done it just as 
                        easily as the next guy. 

                                 ROCKY
                        So you concede, eh. And just as the 
                        president becomes the assassin, the 
                        hero becomes the pussy.  

                                 FUNKE
                        What do you want me to do, Rocky? 
                        I’m taking the fall for this whole 
                        thing and, and...I don’t even know 
                        where to look anymore!

                                 ROCKY

                        The truth.

                                 ROCKY
                        Well, I’ve always found that when 
                        it comes to high school, the truth 
                        rarely makes its way into the 
                        morning announcements. You need to 
                        open up. Sometimes the writing’s on 
                        the wall and all we do is glance at 
                        it. 

           Rocky motions to the GRAFFITI on his desk. 

                                 ROCKY
                        On desktops and in bathroom stalls
                      (reads from his desk)
                        “Amy Early is a bedwetting whore.” 
                        See, nobody’s gonna come out and 
                        say that. Are they?

                                 FUNKE 
                        But it’s true. 

                                 ROCKY
                        It’s the ordinary places where the 
                        truth hides, Funke. So ask 
                        yourself, what’s hidden? And who’s 
                        hiding it? 

           Funke rights himself, thinks. 

                                 ROCKY
                        Hell, use Goltz’s work if you have 
                        to. Did he uncover anything?

                                 FUNKE 
                        The money. 

                                 ROCKY
                        Okay...

                                 FUNKE
                        The SAT’s were in the safe...the 
                        money, the money must have been...

           Funke pulls the accounting ledger out of his back pack. He 
           flips through some pages. 

                                 FUNKE

           Funke sits shotgun as he studies the accounting ledger. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        It disappears, Faldo. The night the 
                        SAT’s were stolen, it says right 
                        here there was a grand in the very 
                        safe that the tests were being held 
                        in! A holdover from the week’s 
                        raffle ticket sales. And it’s gone! 

           Faldo drives wearing a red construction helmet that holds two 
           Mountain Dew cans on either side of it. A plastic tube runs 
           from the cans to his mouth. 

                                 FALDO
                        Why do you keep failing your 
                        driving test? 

           No response. Funke is deep in thought, studying the books. 

                                 FALDO
                        Is it because you are dumb? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Whoever stole the SAT’s would have 
                        taken the grand too. Even if 
                        Schneider wasn’t in on it, he’d 
                        have to know it was missing. And if 
                        that’s the case then why wouldn’t 
                        he say anything? 

                                 FALDO
                        Driving tests are easy. The man 
                        from the test told me what to do 
                        and I did it. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Where’s the connection, Faldo? Paul 
                        Moore, the SAT’s, a thousand 
                        dollars in student council funds 
                        and all this Ritalin? Schneider’s 
                        got an angle on this. Turn right 
                        here.

           Faldo hesitates. 

                                 FUNKE
                        That’s that way. 

           INT. MULLEN’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Band practice. Matt sits behind a pair of turntables, 
           scratching. Marty plays a drum kit, badly. Alex mans the mic, 
           he reads off a lyric sheet. They sound awful at best.

                        What?

                        What?

                        Wait, what?

                        I say, bitches, bitches, report to 
                        your knees. Take a look at my

                        ‘Cause I’m the dopest MC on the

                        sister that rash goddamnit! That’s 
                        right, that’s right. Now everybody 
                        in the six-one-six, eat a Chinese 
                        girl out with a pair of chopsticks.     

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Matt. Cut it. Cut it!

           Matt stops scratching. Marty stops playing the drums.

                                 ALEX
                        We’re gonna need some beers, man. 
                        I’m not feelin’ it unless I have my 
                        rhyme sauce.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        Marty, go grab a case.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Screw that. I went the last two 
                        times, d-bag.

                                 MATT MULLEN
                        And you’re goin’ this time.

                                 ALEX
                        When did your brother become such a 
                        homo? 

           Marty stands up, walks over to Matt.

                                 MARTY MULLEN

                        Make sure it’s cold.

                        Hey grab me some Tums while you’re 
                        at it. I’ve got mad indigestion.

           Alex begins to freestyle about indigestion as Marty exits.  

                                 ALEX 
                        Wicka one two. Yo I got a tummy, a

                        quake...

           EXT. MULLEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The side door of the garage opens. Marty walks to the Dodge 
           Caravan parked in the driveway.

           INT. DODGE CARAVAN - CONTINUOUS

           Marty gets into the car. He turns on the ignition.

                                 FUNKE (O.S.)
                        You guys sounded pretty good in 
                        there.

           Startled, Marty turns his head to find Funke in the backseat.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Jesus, Funke. What the hell are you 
                        doing?

           Funke holds up the accounting ledger.

                                 FUNKE
                        Just a little light reading. You 
                        know this book? It’s a real page 
                        turner. The student council 
                        treasury ledger. Money disappears,

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        What are you telling me for?

                                 FUNKE
                        Don’t play coy with me, Marty. I 
                        know all about your Ritalin scheme. 

                                 MARTY MULLEN

                        about.

                        Sure you do. But maybe it wasn’t 
                        your idea. Maybe you didn’t want 
                        any part of it, but your older 
                        brother says you gotta play ball so 
                        you play ball. Sound familiar? 
                        Maybe it’s time to start becoming 
                        your own man and come clean. I’ll 
                        level with you. I don’t have the 
                        whole enchilada, but I’m only one 
                        ingredient short. Now what’s the 
                        link between your operation and 
                        Paul Moore?

           No response.

                        If you tell me now, things’ll go 
                        easier on you. I’ll make sure of 
                        it.  

           Nothing.

                                 FUNKE
                        You don’t know what you’re getting 
                        yourself into, Mullen. 

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Oh yeah?  

           Marty locks all the doors. Funke reaches for the handle, 
           pulls on it, gets nothing courtesy of the child safety locks.

                                 FUNKE
                        Shit. 

           Marty hits the garage door opener and backs into the garage.

                                 MARTY MULLEN
                        Try not to bleed on the carpet. My 
                        mom will get pissed. 

           As the garage door closes we see the reactions of Alex and 
           Matt. Funke’s about to get his ass kicked. 

           EXT. MULLEN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 

           The side garage door opens. Alex and the Mullens drag Funke 
           out onto the sidewalk and drop him there. Funke’s badly 
           beaten. Swollen eye, fat lip, bloody nose. The works.

                        If you pull something like this 
                        again Funke, you better go ahead 
                        and call your parents first, tell 
                        them you love them. Cause you're 
                        dead.

           The Mullens and Alex go inside. Alex totes the Student 
           Council ledger.  

           Funke opens his hand to reveal Alex’s lyric sheet, it’s 
           stationary from MENDAKOTA COUNTRY CLUB. Funke has stolen it 
           from the garage. He notices a phone number on the bottom 
           corner of it. He wipes some blood from his nose and smiles. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER - PHONE BOOTH - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Funke holds his tie to his bloody nose. He drops a quarter 
           into the pay phone and dials the number on the lyric sheet.

           Funke hangs up the phone.  

           EXT. THOMPSON MEDICAL CENTER - PARKING LOT - DAY 

           A tall, modern building filled with doctors’ offices. 

           Funke and Faldo get out of Faldo’s Suburban. Faldo plays with 
           one of those annoying paddles connected to a ball by an 
           elastic string. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Coming up with the cash to buy 
                        Ritalin may not have been the 
                        problem. But for Schneider to get 
                        access to it he needed 
                        prescriptions. I needed to find out 
                        where he got them. 

           Funke puts a hand on Faldo’s shoulder as they walk. 

                                 FUNKE 
                        Do you like your thing, Faldo? 

                                 FALDO
                        I wish it was bigger. 

           Faldo tries to paddle the ball, it’s pathetic.

                        Okay, now when the doctor asks what 
                        the problem is you say... 

                                 FALDO
                        I can’t concentrate in school. 

           Funke is almost shocked. 

                                 FUNKE
                        That’s right. Very good, Faldo. 
                        Perfect in fact. 

                                 FALDO
                        And I have rashes. 

                                 FUNKE
                        No. 

                                 FALDO
                        I need a cream. 

                                 FUNKE
                        No, Faldo. 

                                 FALDO
                        I pick my scabs. They taste like 
                        nothing. 

                                 FUNKE
                        No. Just tell the doctor that you 
                        can’t pay attention in school and 
                        let me do the rest of the talking, 
                        okay? Come on now, Faldo. 
                        Concentrate. 

                                 FALDO
                        I can’t concentrate. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Exactly. Good man. 

           INT. THOMPSON MEDICAL CENTER - FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER 

           Funke stands with Faldo in front of the reception desk. A 
           RECEPTIONIST sits behind the counter. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        May I help you?

                                 FUNKE
                        Yes you may. My name is Charles 
                        Bukowski and this here is my 
                        adopted Guatemalan brother Faldo.

                        Hellooooo. 

                                 FUNKE
                        We have an appointment at eight 
                        with, oh I can’t quite remember the 
                        name of the doctor. He was highly 
                        recommended to our parents.

           Funke takes note as Faldo picks up a pretty metal rack on the 
           desk that holds a bunch of brochures. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Well we have a lot of doctors here. 
                        Can I ask what it pertained to? 

           Funke slaps Faldo’s hand away from the brochures. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Well it’s kind of personal, 
                        but...well...it’s attention deficit 
                        disorder. My brother here, he’s got 
                        a bad case of it.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I see. Just a minute. 

           The Receptionist turns to make a few phone calls. Faldo goes 
           for the rack of brochures again. 

                                 FALDO
                        Theeeeengs.

           Funke grabs one of the brochures. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Stop it. One. We can take one. 

           The receptionist turns around.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry Mr. Bukowski, but we 
                        don’t have any doctors here that 
                        deal with those kinds of 
                        conditions. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        The doctors in this building are 
                        mainly specialists in dermatology 
                        or laser eye surgery. There’s also 
                        a family planning facility and...

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION ROOM - DAY

           Funke sits at his desk. All of the EVIDENCE he has compiled 
           so far is spread before him: notes, Paul Moore’s statistics, 
           everything. He stares at it, deep in thought.

           Rocky is playing Middleton and Delacruz in the game 
           Battleship.

                        I told you putting it there was a 
                        bad idea. 

                                 MIDDLETON
                        Just like filling the soda machine

                        There’s a simple answer here 
                        somewhere and it’s staring me in 
                        the face. 

                                 ROCKY
                        I’ve been trying to tell you, 
                        conspiracies are complex. The JFK 
                        conspirators ranged from organized 
                        crime bosses to members of the FBI 
                        to the White house itself. B-5.

                        And Booth. I’ve read theories that 
                        he had dozens of people working 
                        with him, maybe hundreds.

                        Miss. Everybody from the guy who 
                        sold him his gun to the doctor who 
                        fixed his leg when he broke it 
                        jumping from that balcony. It went 
                        way deeper than one dude just 
                        pulling the-- 

           Funke snaps up in thought. 

                                 FUNKE
                        What did you just say? 

                                 ROCKY
                        I said Booth had tons of people 
                        conspiring with him.

                                 FUNKE
                        Not that. You said something about 
                        Booth’s doctor. 

                                 ROCKY
                        Yeah, so. 

           Funke’s eyes dart from one piece of evidence to another 
           until... He stares at the BROCHURE from The Thompson Medical 
           Center. 

                                 FUNKE
                        “Never saw Booth”.

           Suspects’, Funke suddenly starts to make sense of the 
           evidence before him. 

                                 MIDDLETON
                        You can’t let Goltz get one up on 
                        you, Funke. That guy’s an enormous 
                        vagina.

           Funke’s eyes dart to his notebook. He flips a page to the 
           note he took at the game. TAD=VAGINA. He notices PENCIL 
           SMUDGES on it. It’s coming to him... 

           The big realization. Funke’s eyes widen as it all comes 
           flooding to him. 

                                         CUT TO:

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM FOYER - FLASHBACK

           Basketball game. The night of the SAT theft.

           Marty Mullen pushes Funke into a locker as he walks by and 
           grabs Funke’s Coke. Matt Mullen grabs Funke’s small notebook 
           and throws it in his face. 

           Funke notices that there are PENCIL SMUDGES all over Matt’s 
           hands. He looks at Marty’s hands. The same graphite smudges.

                                         BACK TO:

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION ROOM - DAY

           Funke looks at the clock. One-thirty. He stands up, walks to 
           the window.

                                 ROCKY
                        What are you doing?

                                 FUNKE
                        I’ve gotta get outta here. Now.

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Now? You get caught sneaking out of 
                        here, they’ll expel you for sure.

                                 FUNKE
                        So how do I do it without getting 
                        caught? 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Middleton raps on the ISS window. The Hall Monitor sits

                        Middleton, your bladder’s the size 
                        of your brain. No more bathroom 
                        breaks. 

           Middleton raps on the window again. 

                                 MIDDLETON
                        Hey. 

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        Goddamn it, Middleton.

           Middleton knocks again. The Hall Monitor cracks the door 
           open. Still seated. 

                                 HALL MONITOR
                        You’d better be bleeding or dead.

                                 MIDDLETON
                        Just thought you’d like to see 
                        Laura Hoffner changing in her car. 

           The Hall Monitor jolts up off his chair into the room. He 
           rushes to the window. 

           Delacruz sneaks out into the hall. He removes his shoe and 
           sock. He pulls his sock over his hand. 

                                 HALL MONITOR (O.S.)
                        Where? I don’t see her. Which car? 

           Delacruz places his sock-covered hand over the fire alarm. A 
           locker door closes behind him. He turns to see the Eye Patch 
           Girl standing there. 

                                 EYE PATCH GIRL 
                        You can’t do that unless there’s a 
                        fire. 

           Delacruz looks around. He places his socked hand on her 
           cheek.

                                 DELACRUZ 
                        Can’t you see the fire, honey? It’s 
                        in my heart. 

           Delacruz lifts her eye patch. 

                                 DELACRUZ
                        And it’s burning for you.

           Delacruz moves in for a big kiss. As he pulls back, he pulls 
           the alarm. Ink shoots out onto his handsock. The alarm rings.

ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Students pile out of classrooms. In the commotion Funke walks 
           inconspicuously past Delacruz and the Eyepatch Girl. Delacruz 
           discreetly drops his inky sock into a wastebasket.

           Funke jogs into the building.

           INT. THOMPSON MEDICAL CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           The Receptionist sits behind the reception desk. Funke walks 
           up to her, somewhat out of breath.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Bukowski, how are you? 

                                 FUNKE
                        Fine, thank you.

                        Your brother isn’t with you?

                                 FUNKE
                        No, he was hit by a car. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh my God, what happened?

                                 FUNKE
                        Wasn’t paying attention. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m so sorry to hear that.

           Funke runs to the school just as the students are being 
           ushered back in. A fire truck is parked in front. 

           Delacruz, Middleton and Rocky all notice Funke. They walk 
           together.

           Saturday morning. Students file into the school to take the 
           SAT tests. A sign reads “SAT Testing Today”.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S CLASSROOM - LATER

           Students sit in their seats filling out Scantron sheets. 
           Writing, erasing, tapping pencils on their teeth. Some sweat 
           it, others could give a shit less.

                        And when they go by they exist only 
                        in their simplicity. Watch enough 
                        teen movies and you’ll get the gist 
                        of it. High school is Prom. 
                        Football games. Boyfriends. 
                        Girlfriends. Party at the rich 
                        kid’s house. A family forgetting a 
                        birthday. A kid cutting class and 
                        getting away with it. Fun. Simple. 
                        Wholesome.

           We pass a student who uses a crib sheet to cheat.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        But it’s really anything but. High 
                        school might be the least wholesome 
                        four years of your life. And 
                        there’s nothing simple about it.

           EXT. ST. DOMINICK’S - NIGHT

           From outside, the sound of cheering is audible. There are 
           cars packed into the school parking lot.

           Funke walks into the school.

           The crowd cheers as one of the Friars nails a three-pointer.

He catches dirty looks from 
           students and teachers alike.

                                 FUNKE -(V.O.)
                        High School is ugly and hard and 
                        complicated.

           Funke passes a CHEERLEADER who looks as if she’s been crying. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        As complicated as a conspiracy to 
                        assassinate the President.

           Funke sits down beside Pei-Min. 

           On the floor, Ongutumamwe stuffs a block into the opposing 
           team’s CHEERLEADING SECTION. The crowd goes nuts. 

           As everyone around them gets to their feet, cheering and 
           hollering, Funke and Pei-Min stay seated. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        A conspiracy about to be uncovered. 

           Funke hands Pei-Min several rolled up pieces of paper. A 
           story. He yells to her over the roar of the crowd. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I want front page on Monday. And a 
                        phone call to Columbia. 

           Funke gets up, walks out of the stands.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Funke walks out of the gym, down the dark hallway. His face 
           is hidden and revealed by shadows and moonlight.

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

           Pei-Min looks down at the story Funke handed her. She reads 
           the opening sentence. This segues with Funke’s voice over. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Alex Schneider and the Mullen 
                        brothers had been selling Ritalin 
                        since their freshman year.

           A slightly younger Matt Mullen and Marty Mullen sit in their 
           dad’s office, each playing PSP. 

           DR. MULLEN talks on his cell phone and exits the room.

Marty walks over to his dad’s 
           now vacant desk and steals a few prescription pads. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        The Mullens pocketed their father’s 
                        prescription pads every chance they 
                        got.  

           Marty sits back down and continues his PSP game. 

           INT. THE MULLENS’ GARAGE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Band practice. MC Schneider’s on the mic.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        But Alex and the Mullens weren’t 
                        competent enough to run things on 
                        their own.

           Matt and Marty argue with each other beside the drumset.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        They needed a leader.

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        Yo. Shit Bizkit.

           A younger Marlon sits at a table off to the side of the 
           garage filling pill bottles.   

                                 MARLON
                        These bottles aren’t going to fill 
                        themselves.

           Marlon approaches a JOCK getting books out of his locker.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Initially the market for academic 
                        performance enhancers wasn’t as 
                        ripe as Marlon had hoped.

           The Jock shakes his head, closes his locker door.

                        So like good businessmen, they 
                        created a demand.

           Marlon rifles through the desk until he finds what he’s 
           looking for: the day’s HISTORY TESTS.

           Marlon, Alex and the Mullens erase answers from Scantron 
           sheets and fill in new ones.

                        They sabotaged tests, homework,

           The night of the theft. Sitting on the floor in the dark, 
           Marlon, Alex and the Mullens rapidly change answers on the 
           SAT’s.

                        Even the SAT’s.

           We notice PENCIL SMUDGES on their fingertips and hands. 

           Alex has a look at Seamus Fenelon’s test. He laughs to 
           himself. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Seamus Fenelon walks into the office where Alex, Marlon and

                        Business boomed.

           Fenelon trades some cash for a bottle of Ritalin.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        So much so that they started 
                        dipping into Student Council funds  
                        to use as venture capitol.

           Alex lifts a few twenties from the council lockbox.

                        the president was in the way. He 
                        needed Moore out of the picture.

                        individual. A real grifter.

                        So when Francesca said she wanted 
                        an abortion, Paul made an 
                        appointment with the best physician 
                        of his kind. Dr. Henry Booth.  

           Paul writes a phone number and a figure down on a piece of 
           stationary from MENDAKOTA COUNTRY CLUB. He circles the number 
           a few times. It reads $900. 

           Paul hangs up. Hands her the paper. This paper becomes Alex’s 
           LYRIC SHEET later. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        He couldn’t ask his father for that 
                        kind of money without an 
                        explanation. And he’d severed his 
                        ties with Freddy Bismark. 
                        Fortunately, Francesca had a

                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           Sure enough, Marlon, Alex and the Mullens are inside. They 
           sit on the floor. Sweat runs down their faces. They’ve been 
           hard at work. The SAT’s are spread out all over the floor.  

                                 FUNKE
                        Hey guys. Whatcha doin’?

                                 ALEX
                        Funke.

           Marlon stands up, walks toward Funke.

                                 MARLON
                        You really don’t know when to quit, 
                        do you?

           Funke slides a stick of gum into his mouth. He offers the 
           pack to Marlon.

                                 FUNKE
                        Gum?

           Marlon declines. Funke puts the gum away, his hands lean back 
           on Kirkpatrick’s desk. 

                                 FUNKE
                        Screwing with the SAT’s so you can 
                        sell more drugs. It’s clever, 
                        Marlon. Twisted, but clever 
                        nonetheless. Should make a good 
                        story.

                                 MARLON
                        You can write what you want, Funke. 
                        They won’t believe you.

                                 FUNKE
                        Sure they will. They’ll believe me 
                        because it’s true. I’ll tell ya, I 
                        almost didn’t put it together. I 
                        couldn’t figure out why Francesca 
                        would do what she did for you. Then 
                        it came to me. Again, twisted.  

                                 MARLON 
                        Bad move Funke. 

           Marlon nods to The Mullens. They take hold of Funke. 

                                 MARLON
                        Open up that window.

           Alex goes to the window, opens it.

                                 MARLON
                        Bring him over.
                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)           The Mullens drag Funke to the open window.

                                 MARLON
                        Here’s the real story. Bobby Funke, 
                        he made a few bad choices, lost his 
                        girlfriend, so he up and jumped out 
                        a window. Just another tormented 
                        Freshman. 

                                 FUNKE
                        I’m a Sophomore, dick.

           Marlon punches Funke in the stomach. 

                                 FUNKE
                        You won’t do it. 

                                 MARLON
                        Oh I won’t? These sorts of things 
                        happen all the time. Lot a pressure 
                        here at St. Dominick’s I’m told. 
                      (to the Mullens)
                        Throw his ass out.

           Matt looks to Marty. He shakes his head.

                                 FUNKE
                        Duly noted, Marty. 

                                 MARLON
                        I’ll do it myself.

           Marlon takes hold of Funke.

                                 DELACRUZ (O.S.)
                        No you won’t. 

           Everyone turns toward the door. Delacruz, Middleton and Rocky 
           stand in the jamb.

                                 DELACRUZ
                        Not unless you wanna spend the rest 
                        of your life in prison.

                                 MIDDLETON
                        Getting butt-raped.

                                 ALEX
                        Don’t do it, Marlon. 

                                 ROCKY
                        By a big Aaryan dude with a bunch 
                        of tats.

                        How the hell did they know you were 
                        here?

                                 FUNKE
                        I might have made an announcement. 

           The microphone from the PA system has been turned on. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Dead silence. Everyone, including the players on the court, 
           stare up at the P.A. They’ve been listening the whole time. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - KIRKPATRICK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon loosens his hold on Funke. Funke hauls off and PUNCHES 
           Marlon square in the jaw. 

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - GYMNASIUM 

           We hear Marlon hit the floor. 

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        He’s right, it’s on. Shit.

           Cipriano sits in the stands eating a hot dog. 

                                 CIPRIANO
                        Oof.

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        Well turn it off!

           INT. ST. DOMINICK’S - KIRKPATRICK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Funke now stands beside Delacruz and Middleton.

           The sound of a the crowd flooding down the hallway. Middleton 
           leans his head out the doorway. A rush of students, teachers 
           and parents comes down the hall. 

                                 MIDDLETON
                        Here they come.

           A few people trickles into the office. Most of them crowd 
           around the office door.

           Francesca pushes through the crowd, walks into the office.

                                 FRANCESCA

           Pei-Min sits in the now empty gym reading Funke’s story.

                        Bob Woodward once said that “the  
                        first rule of good journalism is 
                        never to reveal the story before it 
                        goes to print.”

           EXT. FACHINI HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Funke jogs up to the house in the POURING RAIN. 

           Funke sees that most of the house is dark. Francesca’s 
           bedroom light is on. He makes his way through some trees and 
           bushes to the side of the house. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        But Bob Woodward wasn’t in love 
                        with Francesca Fachini. I had to 
                        tell her the truth. 

           Funke looks up to Francesca’s window. He stops dead in his 
           tracks. His face turns white. 

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        Problem was, up until that moment, 
                        I hadn’t seen it yet. 

           Francesca stares out of her window wearing a bra. Shirtless, 
           Marlon comes up behind her. They KISS.

                        the fall for Marlon’s iniquities.

           Francesca opens Paul’s locker and puts the stack of SAT’s 
           inside. She walks down the hall.

                                 FUNKE (V.O.)
                        You played me, Francesca.

           Funke faces Francesca. 

                                 FUNKE
                        You played the whole damn school.

           Kirkpatrick pushes his way into the office. His battle face 
           is most definitely on. Marlon backs up against the wall.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        The police are on their way. So, 
                        I’d like everyone to file back to 
                        the gymnasium in an ORDERLY 
                        FASHION. Everyone except you five.

           Kirkpatrick glares at Marlon, Francesca, Alex and the 
           Mullens.

                                 KIRKPATRICK
                        You five are in big fucking 
                        trouble.

           Francesca wipes a tear, leans in, whispers to Funke. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You’ll never understand why I did 
                        it.

                                 FUNKE
                        Nobody’s misunderstood, Francesca. 
                        That’s just what people say when 
                        they don’t like who they are.

           Funke files out with the tail end of the crowd into the hall. 
           Francesca rushes after him. She’s held back by Kirkpatrick. 

                                 FRANCESCA

           A hand grasps Funke’s shoulder. It’s Pei-Min.

                                 PEI-MIN
                        Forget it, Funke. It’s high school. 

           SLOW MOTION: Funke spits his gum out onto the floor. He turns 
           back toward Pei-Min, gives her a small familiar smile.  

           They file out down the hall with the masses. 

                                         FADE TO BLACK.
