           EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DAY

           Rush hour in this small but bustling city. A groovy Harry 
           Nilsson-esque tune plays.

           A sea of people bob up and down, commuters in a crowded city. 
           We track DAVE (30's), a boyish blond, lost in thought, as he 
           wades through the crowd. 

           A few steps behind him, is a SHORT CURLY HAIRED WOMAN (30's), 
           just minding her own business.

           EXT. COFFEE CART - CONTINUOUS

           Dave stops at a coffee cart. While he waits, he makes funny 
           faces with a 4 YEAR OLD who is on her's FATHER's shoulders. 

           That same curly haired woman WALKS PAST AGAIN, going the 
           other direction now.

           EXT. BOARDED UP BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Dave strolls with a coffee and a danish. Something catches 
           his eye: painted-over graffiti, a tan square on tan brick.

           He doesn't notice the curly haired woman, who is now 
           loitering across the street.

           EXT. CITY PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Dave crosses the plaza to a small park with a pond. He drops 
           his change in a old hunched HOMELESS WOMAN's cup and then 
           tears off some of his danish for the ducks. They love it!

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Dave heads into work, but first he graciously holds the door 
           open for a lady with packages. Then gets stuck holding it for 
           a half-dozen more people, before finally disappearing inside.

           A beat. Then:

           All the people on the street suddenly STOP what they're 
           doing. The other commuters, the father with his daughter, the 
           homeless woman, they all drop their actions and affectations. 

           Faces blank, they slowly shuffle out of the area. 

           The whole block is completely empty. Life has come to a halt.
           EXT. CITY PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Across the street, the curly haired woman is now alone.

           She bends to get a better look at one of the ducks, which is 
           LYING DORMANT ON ITS SIDE with its feet sprawled out. She 
           looks at it intently. This is RUTH. 

           Ruth walks to a decorative planter, reaches down and lifts up  
           A CHUNK OF IT ALONG WITH A PATCH OF GROUND. It's a trapdoor. 

           She crawls inside, into darkness, shutting it behind her.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth crawls down the dark tunnel. As she progresses, it 
           becomes brighter and bigger until she can stand. The walls 
           around her glow purple but have no discernable edge.

           Around her are a few other people from the street. The 
           homeless woman, now with a totally upright posture. The 
           father and daughter, now acting like strangers to each other.

           This is the NO WORLD, and this is Ruth’s non-life: colorful, 
           abstract, dimensionless. An echo of the real world.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Monochromatic shapes float in the background. There are 
           objects - a desk, a filing cabinet - but they lack detail. 
           They are more like shadow-puppets of everyday items.

           Ruth gets in line to stamp her timecard, shuffling along.

           At the end of the line waits the ADMINISTRATOR, a tall 
           androgynous being in a rubbery extra long t-shirt and no 
           pants. She's carrying a large stack of printouts and speaks 
           unshakably at her own pace.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Something's not right.

           Ruth grabs her card and stamps it in the timeclock.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Show me.
                 (looking at the card)
                        There it is again. Your timecard 
                        keeps coming up late.

           She looks down at Ruth, who is oblivious. Then she sighs.
                                 ADMINISTRATOR  (CONT’D)
                        It must be an error with the 
                        stamper. But just to be safe I'm 
                        sending you back to training. You 
                        know where to go?

           Ruth's scrunches her face. The Administrator points to the 
           left and Ruth floats up and away. Gravity works differently 
           here. Some people float, most just walk.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA

           Ruth float-walks through an endless arena with many colorful 
           halls going in all directions, left, right, and upside down. 
           It's like a coral reef in human scale, teeming with activity. 

           All around her, NON-PEOPLE (who look like just regular 
           people) float or walk to their specific training sessions. 
           The TRAINERS are easy to spot in their long shirt/no pants 
           uniforms. They're all rehearsing the minutia of real life: 

           Ruth walks past A LITTLE KID REHEARSING A TEMPER TANTRUM and 
           then arrives at her training.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA, CITY SIDEWALK

           In the middle of an all pale blue infinity space is a 
           REALISTIC CITY SIDEWALK. The WALKING TRAINER, a soft-spoken, 
           genderless little bald man is instructing the class.

                                 WALKING TRAINER
                        Very simple, you're minding your 
                        own business, head down. You've got 
                        places to go, and also you've got 
                        people to see. But most 
                        importantly, you just keep moving.

           He demonstrates, taking a few steps across the "sidewalk", 
           checking his watch.

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        Now give it a try.

           The first three non-people attempt to imitate. They're pretty 
           bad at walking, like they just got their legs.

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        Adequate, adequate, very 
                        satisfactory.

           Ruth follows along, this is too easy for her. She SIGHS.
                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                 (re: Ruth's sigh)
                        No need for loud breathing. It's 
                        too subtle.
                 (to everyone)
                        Remember, you're a blower: you just 
                        blow by. You are peripheral. If we 
                        do our jobs right, Dave won't even 
                        notice you.

           The trainer pulls Ruth aside.

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        You've got the mechanics down pat, 
                        but there's something about your 
                        face...

           He nudges her chin slightly down towards her neck.

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        That's it. That makes more sense. 
                        Just a regular day, nothing 
                        special.

           Behind her, a non-person struggles to lift her feet correctly 
           and is pumping her arms instead.

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        Let's take it back a smidge, we'll 
                        start with the basics.
                 (shakes his legs)
                        These tubes, these are your legs. 
                        They bend in three places. Try 
                        bending some of the places.

           The non-people all bend their legs in different ways. One of 
           them tips over.

           Ruth takes this opportunity to sneak away. As she leaves, we 
           can see that the sidewalk is a carefully constructed 
           imitation using FORCED PERSPECTIVE. 

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA, IRISH PUB

           Ruth glides into an upside-down pub decorated with beer signs 
           and tchotchkes. There are a few non-people dressed as 
           waiters, patrons, bar backs, etc, all training.

           She creeps up along the wall until our perspective flips and 
           the pub is right-side up. Then she tiptoes close enough to 
           listen in. She passses a NON-PERSON HOST reading into an 
           unplugged microphone. 
                                 NON-PERSON HOST
                        ...Crab Louie with 25, Bonanzataz, 
                        22, and in the lead, Miracle Mile 
                        with 32 points.

           In the center of the pub, A RESTAURANT TRAINER demonstrates.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        Well I can see you hated it!
                 (laughs at her own joke)
                        Another round guys?

           A non-person WAITER tries to copy her.

                                 WAITER 
                        Well I can see you hated it!
                 (GARBLED attempt at 
                  LAUGHING)
                        Anotter Roond Gize?

           Ruth, watching, tries out laughing quietly to herself.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        Better not, thanks. Just the check.

                                 ALL THE PATRONS
                 (repeating)
                        Bet Not, just thachak.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        Now who knows what happens next? 
                        Any guesses?

           One non-person raises her hand.

                                 PATRON
                        Thachek?

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        That's right! Very good talking. 
                        Now we're going to try some 
                        alternatives.

           Ruth casually snags a chicken wing from an unattended plate, 
           and slinks away.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Being a Show-er means showing up 
                        and interacting with Dave, which 
                        means being flexible.
           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA, SUBURBAN HOME

           Ruth meanders past a living room set where a NON-BABY is 
           learning how to behave from a BABY INSTRUCTOR. Babies don't 
           cry in no-world, and they're not cute.

           The instructor tries peekaboo with the baby, no reaction.

                                 BABY INSTRUCTOR
                        Great, but you're excited to see me 
                        now. When I cover my face, pretend 
                        like I've disappeared from 
                        existence and then when I remove my 
                        hands, you're just thrilled that my 
                        face has returned.

           The instructor does peekaboo again. The baby goes apeshit.

                                 BABY INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Great! Let's split the difference.

           NO WORLD - ROLODEX RESTING QUARTERS

           Ruth paws at a large spinning mechanism, which looks like a 
           GIANT ROLODEX. She tugs the handle and a tall, narrow drawer 
           slides out. She crawls in, FOLDS HERSELF UP like a shirt and 
           pulls the drawer lid shut.

           NO WORLD - IN THE ROLODEX DRAWER

           Ruth takes a nibble of her chicken wing, which is inedible 
           rubber. She spits it out, disappointed.

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Back on Earth, Dave is in his shared office, a grey, mid-
           century high-rise with nice light but no view. Not horrible.

           He's reading from a printout. 

                                 DAVE
                        Seashell Breeze. Soft Stucco. 
                        Margarine. Uncle Kenny's Tan 
                        Sweater. Unbleached linen.

           His coworker, ADA, 55, looks over a dozen BEIGE PAINT 
           SWATCHES taped to the white board.
                                 ADA
                        Uncle Kenny's Tan Sweater? I told 
                        you that one doesn't make any 
                        sense.

                                 DAVE
                        It does if you know my Uncle Kenny.

                                 ADA
                        Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        Okay, okay.

           He confidently holds out the printout for her.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I ended up doing four per swatch, 
                        some fun ones and some safe ones.

                                 ADA
                        You're really proud of yourself, 
                        aren't you.

           He blushes.

                                 ADA (CONT’D)
                        The rest of these are fine. Ok, 
                        I'll let you know how it goes. 
                        You'll have the pamphlet copy ready 
                        by four, right?

                                 DAVE
                        Yup. It'll be the very next thing I 
                        do.

           She leaves. He switches on the TV— It's the local weather.

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN (ON TV)
                        That's right, Rachel, we've had a 
                        nice streak of good weather here in 
                        Minneapolis, but looking into the 
                        10-day forecast you can see a low 
                        pressure system moving in slowly. 
                        Sorry folks, it's not gonna be 
                        pretty.

           INT/EXT. DAVE'S CAR - DUSK

           Dave stops at a red light in front of a big two-story gym, 
           where people run on treadmills in the brightly lit windows.
           He idly watches a CHILD throw a temper tantrum on the 
           sidewalk — the same tantrum we just heard in the No-World.

           There's a HONK. The light changed and he's holding up 
           traffic. He speeds off.

           INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Upstairs in the gym, Ruth rides the elliptical, her back to 
           the window. She glances outside to see Dave's car drive off.

           Once he's out of sight, the other non-people GYM-GOERS file 
           out of the room through a tunnel. Ruth watches them go, then 
           walks out the actual door.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DUSK

           Ruth dawdles around town, totally alone. It's her "me time".

           She touches the cement wall of a department store.

           She sits on a fire hydrant.

           She pushes on shop doors to see which will open. Nothing, 
           nothing, But then! A real door!

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth walks through the stacks, drinking it in. In the science 
           section she leafs through "The Miracle of Life". The pages 
           are all blank.

           She tries to grab a book in the arts section, but the giant 
           bookshelf is just ONE BIG FACADE that nearly squishes her.

           Finally, she's found something in the reference section, a 
           real book with real text. It's a RHYMING DICTIONARY. Inside 
           the front cover Dave's name is written in kid handwriting, 
           last checked out in 1988.

           INT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT

           This dive bar is a real life version of the one in the 
           training area, all the details are filled in.

           It's trivia night. The TRIVIA MASTER reads into a mic.
                                 TRIVIA MASTER
                        ... Crab Louie with 25, Bonanzataz, 
                        22, and bringing up the rear 
                        Miracle Mile with 16 points.

           Dave is at a table with two COLLEGE BUDDIES, one of whom 
           seems a little disgruntled.

                                 DISGRUNTLED BUDDY
                        Embarrassing. Dave, I thought you 
                        knew about sports?

                                 AFFABLE BUDDY
                        Dave only knows about sports circa 

                                 DAVE
                        That was a good year.

           The WAITER comes over, FORMERLY THE TRAINEE IN THE NON-WORLD. 
           She takes their empty plates.

                                 WAITER
                        Well I can see you hated it.

           She laughs. Dave gives a chuckle.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Another round guys?

           Dave glances at his disgruntled buddy.

                                 DAVE
                        Sure, why not. It's on me!

                                 WAITER
                        You got it.

                                 AFFABLE BUDDY
                        Thanks old buddy Dave. I'll get you 
                        next time.

           EXT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - NIGHT

           Ruth is alone on a deserted street. She lets herself in.

           INT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The kind of shop that fascinates kids, full of novelties, 
           baseball cards, retro doodads and a FRAMED PORTRAIT OF BABE 
           RUTH. It hasn't been used for years, since Dave was a teen. 
           Ruth has turned it into her clubhouse.

           She's collected all of the real books she could find, plus 
           interesting objects that she found in the world. She plops 
           down onto a baseball-themed beanbag chair.

           EXT. IRISH PUB - NIGHT

                                 DAVE
                 (to his friends)
                        Goodnight guys!

           Dave walks home, whistling.

           From a bird's eye view, we see how the city COMES TO LIFE  in 
           the four block area around where Dave is walking, and GOES 
           DARK when he's gone.

           INT. BASEBALL CARD STORE  - NIGHT

           Ruth reads a book by flashlight. Then a streetlight comes on.

           She hears noises of life; teenagers laughing and cars on the 
           road.  She rushes to the window just as Dave ambles by, 
           scrambling to turn off her light. Did he see her?

           EXT. BASEBALL CARD STORE  - NIGHT

           Yes, Dave saw her — the curly-haired woman in the store 
           window — though he doesn't seem to think much of it. 

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Nicely decorated for a bachelor. Dave talks on the phone 
           while his big furry dog, COOKIE, nips at his feet.

                                 DAVE
                        I guess that's why they call it a 
                        piggy bank, not a birdy bank.
                 (listening)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Because birds have smaller 
                        appetites. Or they're thought to.
                 (listening)
                        Yes, of course I'll call her 
                        tomorrow and I'll send the check. 
                        Ok goodnight Mom, I love you too.

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER

           Dave is asleep in bed with Cookie. Cookie is a blanket-hog.

           NO WORLD - ROLODEX RESTING QUARTERS

           The rolodex SPINS. The door opens on Ruth, folded up.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Limber up. You're in the dream.

                                 RUTH
                        I am?

           NO WORLD - HALLWAY TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS

           Ruth tries to keep up with the long-legged administrator as 
           they speed down the hall.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Take the second dream door from the 
                        left. You'll get the signal when 
                        it's time to wrap it up.

                                 RUTH
                        Don't I need more than that to do 
                        it with more than that?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        What?

           Ruth squints her eyes and thinks hard, she's still learning 
           how to speak sentences.

                                 RUTH
                        Don't I need more... guidance?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        There's no training for a dream. 
                        That's what makes it a dream. 
                        You're free to do whatever.

                                 RUTH
                        Free?
           NO WORLD - THE DREAM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           They arrive at the DREAM DOOR, which is a giant, silver coil. 
           The administrator grabs the center of the coil and it pulls 
           out into a cone shaped VORTEX.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        The dream techs are sniffing out 
                        Dave's subconscious. They'll help 
                        push you along. 

           Ruth cautiously pokes her head through the opening, then her 
           whole body is sucked inside.

           DREAM - DAVE'S YARD - NIGHT/DAY

           A place in between No World and Earth. It looks exactly like 
           the exterior of Dave's suburban house at nighttime, but the 
           sky about it is strangely the bright blue of broad dayight.

           Ruth is gently carried across the darkened lawn by two DREAM 
           TECHNICIANS in black turtlenecks that reach up to their eyes. 

           There are lots of them moving swiftly through the shadows. 
           Their moves are beautifully choreographed and expertly agile, 
           but they have the blasé demeanor of old union stagehands. 

           The Techs slide Ruth into position on a set of bleachers 
           outside of Dave's window. They hand her a flashlight. 

           Inside the house, Dave is about to get into fisticuffs with a 
           coat rack, which is being puppeteered by a Dream Tech.

                                 DAVE
                        I thought you were my friend!

           As Ruth watches him, amused, the Dream Techs are bringing 
           over more and more NON-PEOPLE TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS.

           DREAM - DAVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dave is jumping around like an old-timey boxer.

                                 DAVE
                        You come at me left, you're gonna 
                        regret it. You come at me right, 
                        it's LIGHTS OUT.

           The coat rack is duckin' and weavin'.
           DREAM - DAVE'S YARD - CONTINUOUS

           The crowd is attentively watching Dave's battle, responding 
           with OOHS and AHS. Ruth turns to the person next to her.

                                 RUTH
                        Free? Me, free? Right?

                                 NON PERSON
                 (stage whisper)
                        Peas and carrots peas and carrots.

           Ruth stands up. She tentatively takes a step to the house, 
           pausing to check the group's reaction. Nobody cares.

           DREAM - DAVE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth lets herself in through the front door. This is the 
           closest she's ever been to Dave and she is wowed by how much 
           detail is in the room. 

           She starts opening drawers and feeling every object.

                                 RUTH
                        So much tiny tiny.

           Dave is shouting through the window at the crowd on his lawn. 
           They look like a sitcom audience.

                                 DAVE
                        I'm sorry. I can't help you now.

           They LAUGH like a laugh track. Ruth covers her ears.

                                 RUTH
                        So loud!

           A Dream Technician replaces the fighting coat rack with a BIG 
           CUTE BEAR. Dave turns back, surprised. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hey there little buddy, what can I 
                        do for ya?

                                 RUTH
                 (quietly repeating)
                        Hey there little buddy.

           There's a tap on Dave's shoulder. It's the TV Weatherman, 
           Shelly.

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN
                        Time to die.
                                 DAVE
                        Shelly the weather man, it's so 
                        nice to finally meet you.

           Shelly is EATEN IN ONE CHOMP by the bear's giant head. 

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN
                 (from inside the mouth)
                        Save your family!

           Dave KARATE CHOPS the bear who collapses into a pile of fur. 

           A bit of the fur brushes against Ruth's arm. She shivers - a 
           new sensation!

           For a moment, Dave is triumphant. But then the dream techs 
           literally pull the rug out from under him. He starts to sink.

                                 DAVE
                        Shelly call the doctor!

           Meanwhile Ruth opens the fridge and hits the motherload. 

           She grabs a leftover sandwich and sniffs it. It smells real. 
           She cautiously takes a nibble. Oh yeah, that's the stuff!

           Dave struggles to escape the sinking floor while Ruth raids 
           his fridge. She's having the time of her non-life.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DAY

           A new day dawns on the Mighty Mississippi. It's raining.

           NO WORLD - WARDROBE AREA

           The giant closet for No-World, with clothes on infinitely 
           long racks, like a dry cleaner designed by M.C. Escher.

           Ruth is in a line of non-people. At the front, a WARDROBE 
           TECH hands out rain gear: a yellow raincoat to a GRANDMA, a 
           poncho to a CHILD, a canvas jacket to a BEARDED HIPSTER.

                                 WARDROBE TECHNICIAN
                        You're a tough guy, you don't use 
                        an umbrella.

           Ruth, still beaming from her dream adventure chats up the 
           Homeless Woman.

                                 RUTH
                        Have anything fun last night?
           The lady is confused; non-people never make small talk.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I was in the dream. You ever do 
                        that?

                                 HOMELESS LADY
                        Yes.

                                 RUTH
                        Do you know what you did to get it 
                        the time you got to get it?

           No response.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        All kinds of looks and sounds and 
                        touches happening in there. You rub 
                        one thing - ouch. Who knew?

           Ruth is handed a raincoat, umbrella and a couple of full 
           grocery bags. She walks off, marveling at her new gear. 

           The homeless lady is handed some dirty garbage bags.

           NO WORLD - ASSIGNMENT DESK - CONTINUOUS

           They follow the line to the Assignment Desk, where ASSIGNMENT 
           TECHNICIANS give out the assignments.

           Ruth is still bugging this homeless lady.

                                 RUTH
                        And food, do you know about food? 
                        Not the fake stuff they have out 
                        here, but the real stuff. For your 
                        mouth. You know what I’m saying.

                                 HOMELESS LADY
                        Yes.

                                 RUTH
                        I just figured it out.

           She reaches the head of the line.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        Enter at Tulip Street and wait for 
                        the number ninety-nine bus. And 
                        there's a note on your file—

                                 RUTH
                        Can I go do another dream? 
                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        There's a note on your file to make 
                        sure you clock out at the correct 
                        time. So make sure to do that.

                                 RUTH
                        But can I change to doing a dream? 
                        I want to do more of that.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        Dreams aren't assigned here, that 
                        comes straight from Deep Brain.

                                 RUTH
                        Why.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        You wait for the number ninety-nine 
                        bus.

                                 RUTH
                        Why is that, that way?

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                 (with a disinterested 
                  grimace)
                        That's how we do things because 
                        that's how we do things. 

           She begruginly takes the BLOWER TIMECARD.

           EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

           It's raining. Ruth, in her new raincoat, waits under a bus 
           stop shelter, inconspicuous.

           Across the street, Dave's car pulls up at the DRIVE-THRU 
           COFFEE STAND.

           EXT. DRIVE THRU COFFEE STAND - CONTINUOUS

           The COFFEE BOOTH BOY hands Dave his order. They both smile 
           politely. He drives off.

           With Dave gone, RUTH SPRINGS INTO ACTION.

           She runs to the little window. It's a bit too high for her. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh hi there.

           The Coffee Boy is about to leave through his trapdoor.
                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        Who said that?

           Ruth jumps, her head pops up into view for a second.

                                 RUTH
                        I just wanted to say hi.

                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        Oh. Ok.

           Ruth manages to hoist herself up onto the counter.

                                 RUTH
                        Wow, look at all this, this, this. 
                        Is that real?

           She points to a donut.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Is that food? Is that for Dave? He 
                        eats that?

                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        It's food. Food's pretty much all 
                        he ever eats... I think.

                                 RUTH
                        Do you- are you going to eat that?

           The boy thinks about this.

                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        No.

                                 RUTH
                        Only Dave, right?

           Beat.

                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        Dave's mom got a yogurt muffin.

                                 RUTH
                        What's that? 

           In the background, the ninety-nine bus pulls up.

                                 COFFEE BOOTH BOY
                        Dave's mom. When she comes with him 
                        she gets a something to eat too.

                                 RUTH
                        Mom?
           She sees the bus.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh.

           She runs off to catch it.

           NO WORLD - ROLODEX RESTING QUARTERS

           Ruth spins the rolodex and opens a drawer.

                                 RUTH
                        Mom?

           The non-person inside is an OLD MAN.

                                 OLD MAN
                        No.

           She shuts his drawer, spins to the next one, opens it.

                                 RUTH
                        Mom? Dave's mom?

           This one is a WEIRDO TEENAGER.

                                 WEIRDO TEENAGER
                        What?

           Ruth moves on to the next drawer. It's a CRABBY CABBIE.

                                 RUTH
                        Mo-

                                 CRABBY CABBIE
                        Growers are in the grower zone. No 
                        growers here.

                                 RUTH
                        How's that?

           He slams his drawer shut.

           NO WORLD - SUPPLY ROOM

           This space looks like an infinity factory, storage for 
           everything and anything. Items like mailboxes and cars are 
           stacked in every direction, upside-down and sideways. 

           A STACKER TECHNICIAN is UNFOLDING A CAR. Ruth approaches.
                                 RUTH
                        Grower room?

           The Stacker Technician points vaguely over his shoulder.

           NO WORLD - GROWER ROOM

           Ruth is in a huge warehouse with several gigantic swimming 
           pools. Above them hangs a crisscross of machinery. It 
           resembles an industrial fish hatchery.

           In the center of the room, DAPHNE (30's) wearing workout 
           clothes, sits on a steel table while SHE IS AGED by three 
           Grower Technicians, aka BLUE SMOCKS, wearing blue rubber 
           smocks over their already smock-like T-shirts. 

           One Blue Smock PULLS at the skin on Daphne's arm, making it 
           flab. Another TUGS on the skin around her neck, WADDLING it. 
           The third SMIZES HER EYES. Daphne sits patiently through it 
           all - just part of the job.

           Ruth leans in.

                                 RUTH
                        Dave's mom?

           Daphne ignores her. Ruth steps further into her eyeline.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me? Are you Dave's mother?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh I didn't realize you were 
                        talking to me.

                                 RUTH
                        You're not Dave's mom?

                                 DAPHNE
                        No.
                 (to the Blue Smocks)
                        Ok you guys better hold off, I'm 
                        only supposed to be 33 - not 
                        ninety.

                                 BLUE SMOCK #1
                        Almost done. Just a couple more 
                        laugh lines.

                                 RUTH
                        But you know Dave?
                                 BLUE SMOCK #1
                 (to Ruth)
                        You're in the way.

           Blue Smock #2 steps in and starts SLAPPING Daphne's calves.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I'm his ex. I mean, I was. But I'm 
                        being sent back in. So I guess I'll 
                        be the girlfriend again.

                                 RUTH
                        So you've been around a lot, long 
                        assignments. Doing stuff?

                                 DAPHNE
                        A lot, a lot.

           Ruth is mesmerized by the eye-bag massage that's happening.

                                 RUTH
                        What does the girlfriend do?

                                 DAPHNE
                        At first you have fun and act cool 
                        and eat different types of foods 
                        and have sex. Then later you do a 
                        lot of listening and eat the same 
                        types of foods.

                                 RUTH
                        There are different types? 
                 (beat)
                        How'd you come to get to be the 
                        girlfriend?

           Daphne shrugs, somehow without moving her shoulders.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Is there a place where you and Dave 
                        would eat where other people are?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Honestly, the last couple years 
                        Dave would just eat in front of the 
                        television. Hours and hours of 
                        television. We'll probably get back 
                        into that this time around too.

                                 RUTH
                        Television...

                                 BLUE SMOCK #1
                        You're done.
           The Blue Smocks STACK THEMSELVES NEATLY on the table behind 
           her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Could you move.

           Ruth takes a small step aside. Daphne hops off.

                                 DAPHNE (CONT’D)
                        Back to the slog of life.

           EXT. LAKEWOOD PARK - DAY

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh my god, Dave!

           Daphne is a bubbling ball of enthusiasm.

           Dave is at a picnic birthday party for a baby in a lovely 
           lakeside park. A small group of adults chat, children play in 
           the grass. A golden "1" balloon is tied to the table.

           He stands to greet Daphne as she bounces up to him, wrapped 
           gift in hand. 

                                 DAVE
                        Daphne! 

           They're not sure if they should hug. Then they do.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Wow, you didn't have to get me a 
                        gift.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Ha ha, very funny.

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Daphne! You made it!

           Dave's mom, ELAINE, mid-60's rocks up from behind the potato 
           salad for a hug.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Hiiiii. Elaine, so sorry I'm late. 
                        Where's king baby?

                                 ELAINE
                        You mean the prince, my beautiful 
                        grandchild? Who knows. Oh there he 
                        is.
           Baby Quinn (1), is playing peekaboo with his mom DAVE'S 
           SISTER. He's the SAME BABY FROM THE NO WORLD TRAINING.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Such a cutie patootie.

                                 DAVE'S SISTER 
                 (calling out)
                        Mom??

                                 ELAINE
                 (to Julie)
                        Oops I have his binkie.

           Elaine flounces off.

                                 DAPHNE
                        So are you loving being an uncle? 

                                 DAVE
                 (indignant)
                        I used to be the baby of the 
                        family. But it's fine.

           Daphne laughs. Which makes Dave smile. Which makes Daphne 
           blush. Which makes Dave blush.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL ENTRANCES

           Good morning Viet-non-world!

           All sorts of non-people head into their assigned tunnels.

           Ruth walks alongside her regular group of commuters. As the 
           group turns to enter the tunnel, she casually steps the other 
           direction. She watches them leave without her.

           She quietly follows a new group into a different tunnel.

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ELEVATOR - DAY

           Dave runs for the elevator. A coworker holds the door. 
           They're both carrying paper lunch bags. 

                                 DAVE
                        Thanks. Burrito? Me too. Happy 
                        burrito day.
           NO WORLD - TV TOWN - SHRINKER

           Ruth tries to act like this is all old hat. She waits in line 
           behind some generic non-people and also recognizable TV 
           personalities, like KELLY RIPA and JASON BATEMAN.

           Kelly Ripa steps inside the CYLINDRICAL MECHANISM, not unlike 
           an airport scanner. 

           The panel walls of the cylinder squeeze in with a SPLAT. Then 
           the top and bottom smash together with a SQUISH. 

           The pneumatic plates retract. Kelly, exactly the same as 
           before but now ONLY 4 INCHES TALL, walks out of the machine. 

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dave takes off his coat and sits down at his desk. While his 
           computer is booting up, he turns on the TV.

           He flips through channels: a Friends rerun, a fishing show, a 
           reality show about yard sales...

           TV TOWN - STREET SET - DAY

           A tiny, perfectly realistic Minneapolis street. 

           Shelly the Weatherman waits with his microphone, about to do 
           a man-on-the-street report. He practices the toss to himself.

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN
                        -t's right Alex... -t's right Alex.

           Behind him, Ruth slowly edges into the shot.

                                 PRODUCER (O.S.)
                        We're on in five, four, three...

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dave flips to Shelly's show. Ruth is there, right behind him.

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN (ON TV)
                        —t's right Alex. We're here with 
                        our Tuesday Pickle Challenge..."

           From inside the TV, Ruth can see Dave! She's struck with 
           excitement as he unwraps his burrito.

                                 RUTH
                        Hi!
           At that exact moment, Dave's phone RINGS. He MUTES the TV.

                                 DAVE
                 (into phone)
                        Hello, Dave speaking.

           TV TOWN - STREET SET - CONTINUOUS

           Shelly mouths his words silently. Ruth is surprised to find 
           no sounds are coming out of her mouth either. It's captioned. 

                                 RUTH
                 (silent/captioned)
                        What gives?

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dave isn't even looking at the screen anymore. He puts down 
           his burrito right IN FRONT OF THE TV. 

                                 DAVE
                 (into phone)
                        Oh it's okay. It's a little 
                        nostalgic, just receiving a call 
                        from you. In a good way.
                 (pause)
                        Yeah. I was thinking about calling 
                        you but I wasn't sure if you wanted 
                        me to. 

           On the TV, Ruth is shouting wordlessly. 

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN
                 (silent/captioned)
                        Ma'am we're in the middle of a live 
                        broadcast here.

           Ruth runs up to the glass, staring at the burrito. She bangs 
           with both hands. It makes a little TINK TINK noise.

                                 DAVE
                 (into phone)
                        You are? I'll come down right now.

           Dave hangs up the phone and walks out of the office.

           TV TOWN - STREET SET - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth watches him go, upset. Shelly is stunned at her 
           outburst. He turns to her menacingly.
                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN
                 (silent/captioned)
                        Get her out of here!

           Ruth takes the hint, and scoots out behind the curtain.

           TV TOWN - BACKSTAGE

           Disappointed, Ruth walks out of the street set, through the 
           backstage where the non-people actors are patiently waiting, 
           and onto the set of the FISHING SHOW

           She walks on top of a lake. Two FISHERMEN in a boat watch 
           her, confused. A fish jumps out the water and she kicks it.

           NO WORLD - TV TOWN - UNSHRINKER

           Ruth exits a giant black box, the back of Dave's TV. 

           She unknowingly steps onto a RED PLUS SIGN painted on the 
           ground. A TV TECHNICIAN with a shiny yellow BIKE PUMP 
           CONTRAPTION does a big PUMP. 

           There's a WHOOSH sound as Ruth's body is INFLATED. She 
           quickly EXPANDS TO HER ORIGINAL SIZE, except her left leg 
           which is still tiny.

           It's now clear that she's standing back at:

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Balancing on her big leg, she looks down at the tiny TV Tech.

                                 RUTH
                        What about the rest of me?

                                 TV TECHNICIAN
                        Next!

           She hops out of the TV Town and bumps directly into the 
           Administrator. They're both startled.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Ah!

                                 RUTH
                        Ah!!

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did you just pop out of TV Town?
                                 RUTH
                        Oh hi. Yeah, I got lost?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You got lost.

                                 RUTH
                        I—

           —Her LEG POPS back into full size, knocking her over.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I checked your timecards again and 
                        there's no error with the stamper. 
                        It's obvious what's going on.

           Ruth panics.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Being a blower is too difficult for 
                        you. You'll be downgraded to a 
                        Semi. It's more basic, strictly far 
                        distance background, in crowds and 
                        stadiums. Much further from Dave.

                                 RUTH
                        No! I mean... I just had a tech 
                        send me the wrong way. Good tech 
                        though. Don't blame the tech.
                 (aside)
                        It was a car tech. The short one.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Don't worry. Semi's don't even have 
                        legs. Without legs there's less 
                        room for error all around.

                                 RUTH
                        But. The thing is. Wait. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        It's easy. Just report immediately 
                        to the Semi Zone, they'll chop off 
                        those legs for ya.

           Ruth supresses the urge to hyperventilate.

                                 RUTH
                        Or: my legs work fine. It would be 
                        a shame to waste perfectly good 
                        legs...right? 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We recycle everything here.
                                 RUTH
                        Ha. But also, but, but, it would be 
                        a waste of all the good blower 
                        training I did do already. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I suppose it would take extra time 
                        to retrain another blower.

                                 RUTH
                        Totally up to you. But it seems 
                        like the simplest thing is not to 
                        remove my legs from my body, but 
                        just keep them intact, like so, and 
                        keep everything just the way it is.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Listen. Every misstep creates a lot 
                        of extra work for everyone, but 
                        especially me.

                                 RUTH
                        It won't happen again. 

           The Administrator considers this for exactly one second.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Fine. This conversation has taken 
                        way too long. Just do another round 
                        of blower training and we'll see if 
                        it sorts itself out. This is the 
                        very last time.

                                 RUTH
                 (overwhelmed with terror 
                  and relief)
                        Ok.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA, SIDEWALK

           Ruth is back in the same beginner class. The Trainer sits on 
           a park bench, three other BLOWER TRAINEES watch attentively.

                                 WALKING TRAINER
                        These tubes are our legs. And these 
                        tubes, anybody?

                                 BLOWER TRAINEE
                        Upper legs?

                                 WALKING TRAINER
                        These are our arms.
           The non-people repeat him with "ohhhh" or "aaarms".

                                 WALKING TRAINER (CONT’D)
                        What are arms good for? They're 
                        good for lots of things. Waving 
                        hello. Grabbing a door handle. 
                        Gently nudging a friend....

           Ruth stands behind him, bored out of her mind. She pulls her 
           fingers through her hair and then slowly down across her 
           face, distorting her expression into a SILENT SCREAM.

           NO WORLD - GROWER ROOM

           A JAUNTY CLASSICAL TUNE plays as we witness the miracle of 
           non-life. We're inside a giant tank, empty except for:

           A blob. The beginnings of a face. 

           An unfinished humanoid, propped up on a steel table.

           Blue-gloved hands dig into buckets of blobby body parts.

           The hands fly across the frame, squishing the new parts on 
           the body. A human liver, an arm.

           A pair of hands pump a set of shiny silver bellows - the body 
           is FLUFFED UP, full of air. 

           And the final touches - a nose is hooked on, a mouth, and two 
           eyeballs popped in the sockets. 

           The eyes blink. This is SALLY, a new non-person in her 40's.

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Dave is dressed for the day, frying an egg. Daphne walks in 
           from the bedroom wearing Dave's pajama top and no pants.

                                 DAVE
                        Hope you like 'em scrambled.

           She sits at the table. He serves her a plate of eggs.

                                 DAPHNE
                        This is star treatment. Aren't you 
                        having some?

                                 DAVE
                        I can't be late. New boss starts 
                        today.
                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh right. Yeah, good luck, I bet 
                        she'll love you.

           He slides a key across the table.

                                 DAVE
                        Do you mind locking up on your way 
                        out?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Is this for me to keep?

                                 DAVE
                        Only if you want it.

           She smiles and gives him a big kiss.

           EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Dave drives away. Moments later, Daphne steps outside. She 
           locks the door, then lifts the front step revealing a 
           trapdoor. 

           She's startled to see Ruth's face looking up at her.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Ah!

                                 RUTH
                        Hi! Oh sorry.

           Ruth scoots over a little so Daphne can crawl inside.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth rushes through the tunnel and catches up to Daphne.

                                 RUTH
                        Ok well the TV thing didn't work, 
                        the food was there but I was on the 
                        wrong side of the glass! Also I was 
                        very smaller, even smaller than 
                        usual. So then I was thinking, Mom 
                        gets to eat, how about sister? I 
                        could be Dave's sister?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Dave already has a sister.
                                 RUTH
                        Ok I thought that might not work so 
                        I thought maybe I could be your 
                        sister. And we could have a store 
                        that sells clothes that Dave likes, 
                        and Dave could come over every day 
                        and buy clothes, and then we could 
                        eat lunch.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don't have a sister.

                                 RUTH
                        But you could. It could be me.

                                 DAPHNE
                        In fact, it could not. Could you 
                        step back a bit, you're giving me 
                        tremors.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Listen. You can't just decide 
                        something to be true. That's not 
                        how it works. It has to be true. It 
                        has to happen naturally. There has 
                        to be a connection.

                                 RUTH
                        But-

                                 DAPHNE
                        I'm the girlfriend, you're nobody, 
                        that's the way it is.
                 (then)
                        Please walk slower or faster. I 
                        don't wanna walk with you.

                                 RUTH
                        Ok.

           Ruth slows down. Then she changes her mind and stomps ahead.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I'll walk faster.

           INT. SALLY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dave knocks on the open door. Sally, now all put together and 
           human looking, is at her desk. Her office is bigger and nicer 
           than Dave's. She looks burnt out on life.
                                 DAVE
                        Hello?

           Sally looks up and puts on a smile.

                                 SALLY
                        You look like a Dave.

                                 DAVE
                        I am Dave!

                                 SALLY
                        Great to meet you, call me Sally, 
                        which is my first name.

           They shake hands.

                                 DAVE
                        Welcome to the office, I hope 
                        everyone has been nice and making 
                        you feel at home.

                                 SALLY
                        Yes, and aren't you nice to say 
                        that. Have a seat. Have you lived 
                        here long? In Minneapolis?

                                 DAVE
                        Not really, only thirty-four years.

           Sally almost smiles.

                                 SALLY
                        I don't know what you've already 
                        heard about me, but I'll give you 
                        the condensed version. I just moved 
                        up here from Chicago. I was at 
                        Ogilvy for a decade.

                                 DAVE
                        Wow, yeah. I hear Chicago's great. 
                        Sorry, I interrupted.

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, well. I just woke up one day 
                        and realized - what was I doing? 
                        Was this how I was supposed to 
                        spend my time on Earth? Chained to 
                        my desk, moving semicolons around a 
                        half page glossy spread? I'm not a 
                        word processor, I'm a human being.

                                 DAVE
                        Clearly.
                                 SALLY
                        So long story short, I cashed out, 
                        packed up, and here I am. Ada's 
                        told me you're very creative and 
                        easy to work with, so I'm hoping 
                        it's smooth sailing from now until 
                        early retirement. How does that 
                        sound to you?

                                 DAVE
                        Oh that sounds good.

                                 SALLY
                        Dave. Let me tell you something, 
                        full disclosure. I've done my time 
                        and I'm ready to relax. If you 
                        think I'm staying until 10pm, 
                        you're thinking of you, not me. If 
                        you make it to June I'll make it 
                        worth your while. Payday. It ain't 
                        my money.

                                 DAVE
                        I guess this is the land of 10,000 
                        lakes so hopefully I'll be able to 
                        find my sea legs.

                                 SALLY
                        Well ok.

           There's an awkward pause.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        How about you get me up to speed on 
                        the newsletter?

           EXT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - DAY

           Ruth walks her regular commuter route, but then ducks into 
           the Baseball Card store.

           INT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - DAY

           Her clubhouse of mundane artifacts. Ruth hurriedly grabs her 
           favorite items - books mostly and stuffs them in her pockets. 
           She tucks a book up each sleeve and two down her pants. 

           EXT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - DAY

           Moments later, she's back on the street and walking like 
           nothing happenened.
           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Ruth clocks out. She gives a friendly nod to the 
           Administrator.

           NO WORLD - ROLODEX RESTING QUARTERS

           Tucked away in her private space with her stacks of stolen 
           books and things, Ruth reads an old copy of "Moby Dick".

                                 RUTH
                        Poor Queequeg....

           She tosses the book aside and picks up another, the rhyming 
           dictionary from the library.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Scheme, dream, seam, ream.

           She flips a page.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Delicious, ambitious, nutritious, 
                        suspicious.

                                       CUT TO:

           Ruth reads "The Sopranos Family Cookbook".

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        2 large garlic cloves, finely 
                        chopped. Cook until golden. Stir 
                        in. Two ounces thinly sliced 
                        prossss-ciutto.

                                       CUT TO:

           She's reading "The Übermensch", a superhero comic.

           In the comic: The mustachioed superhero apprehends a criminal 
           on the street. A girl swoons into his arms.

           Ruth thinks hard.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - EVENING

           The after-work commute. Non-people go about their business. 
           Ruth waits on a corner, she's watching Dave's office.

           She sees him exit his building and springs into action. Ruth 
           pushes down an OLD LADY and steals her purse. 
                                 OLD LADY
                        Ah!

           She lunges at a COLLEGE STUDENT walking nearby and shoves the 
           purse into his hands. She takes a step back.

                                 COLLEGE STUDENT
                        Ow!

                                 RUTH
                        Stop thief!!

           Ruth tackles the college student, yelling fiercely.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        POW! BAM!

           From down the block, Dave sees the commotion and nonchalantly 
           crosses the street to avoid it.

           Ruth easily retrieves the purse from the stunned student and 
           hands it back to the old lady. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Here you go ma'am, I told him to 
                        scram. No need to thank me. 

           She looks around for Dave, but he's not where she expected. 
           She realizes he's across the street - he definitely saw her. 

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Ruth floats towards the clock, pleased with herself, when she 
           is intercepted by the Administrator, flanked by the Old Lady 
           and the College Student. They are not pleased.  

                                 OLD LADY
                        That's her. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh hi. That was crazy out there, 
                        wasn't it?

                                 COLLEGE STUDENT
                        You're telling me!

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I'll have to write you up for this. 
                        You almost interfered with Dave's 
                        life. 
                                 RUTH
                        I didn't, I wasn't. I was way 
                        across the street like my 
                        assignment said.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Then why am I hearing complaints 
                        about you?

                                 RUTH
                        Who me?

           Ruth has a big dumb smile on her face.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        What are you doing? What are you 
                        doing with your face?

                                 RUTH
                        Nothing.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I'm sending you down to Semi level.

                                 RUTH
                        But no. If anything, the problem is 
                        I'm too advanced. I want to get 
                        Show-er training. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Since when are you wanting things? 
                        You'll be sent—

           The Administrator sniffs the air.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Wait. I'm getting a message from 
                        Deep Brain.
                 (final sniff)
                        You're back in the dream again.

           Ruth can barely contain her delight.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        I guess you made an impression on 
                        Dave's subconscious. We'll deal 
                        with your retraining later. And 
                        stop doing that with your face.

           Ruth tries her best to stop smiling.
           DREAM - DRIVE IN MOVIE - NIGHT

           Dave and Daphne are cuddling on the bench seat of an old car. 
           All around them are the Dream Technicians, moving and 
           changing things to achieve dream-like object impermanence.

           Ruth, with a concessions tray over her shoulder, walks 
           between the rows of cars. She's looking for Dave.

                                 RUTH
                        Popcorn, candy, snacks. Uh, 
                        burgers, pinwheels, bananas.

                                 DAVE
                        Do you want anything?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe some wax lips.

           They smooch. 

           Ruth spots Dave's car. She rushes over and interrupts them.

                                 RUTH
                        Hi, I'm the hero from the street. 
                        Do you want to be my girlfriend?

                                 DAVE
                        You've gotta be kidding. Can I get 
                        some jujubes?

           Two Dream Technicians seamlessly slide Daphne out of the car 
           window. Simultaneously another two Techs hoist up Ruth and 
           plop her through the moonroof, landing right next to Dave.  

           A tech gently lifts Ruth's arm and places it around Dave.

                                 RUTH
                        This is me very close to you now.

                                 DAVE
                        I like what you've done with your 
                        hair.

           Ruth's hair has been dream-teched into a big cotton candy. 
           She feels it, "how fun!", and they each take a bite.

           Ruth notices something below Dave's belt. She jumps up, 
           terrified. 

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.
                                 RUTH
                        What is that?

           A giant, cartoon-like phallus is jutting out against his 
           khakis, a HUGE PANTS TENT. It swings at her head. She ducks.

           It SMASHES through the roof of the car. The car SPLITS OPEN 
           like a pistachio shell and falls apart around them. 

           The Technicians dart around, moving in walls and furniture 
           until they've changed the setting to: 

           DREAM - DAVE'S OFFICE - CONT

           Dave is swiveling his hips trying and failing to avoid Ruth  
           with his huge inflated pants phallus. She swats it away.

                                 RUTH
                        What are you going to do with that 
                        thing?

                                 DAVE
                        Be my girlfriend.

           He not-quite-accidentally bops it on her head. Ruth is 
           freaking out.

                                 RUTH
                        Ah! I don't want it!

           With a flourish of TRUMPETS, Sally is carted in on a dolly.

                                 SALLY
                        Cocktail weenie?

           She feeds Dave a small pickle. He coughs.

                                 DAVE
                        That was spicier than I was 
                        expecting.

           Dave bats her with his willy. She playfully bops it back. It 
           swings across the room, knocking over a stack of files and a 
           potted plant. 

                                 SALLY
                        I'm going to need you to do all the 
                        work, and I'm going to take all the 
                        credit.

                                 DAVE
                        Whatever you say, Sally. You're the 
                        boss.
           Ruth cowers away from the dong.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah Sally, you're the boss.

                                 SALLY
                        Don't you forget it, baby boy.

                                 DAVE
                        Sally, oooh la la. Sally!

           Sally pulls his pants tent until it is long, like a rope.

           Ruth is relieved to be out of the hot seat, but she can't 
           look away from Dave and Sally. She slowly backs out of the 
           room, confused and grossed out. 

           Sally jumps Double Dutch over Dave's now two long dongs. (A 
           Dream Tech expertly handles the other end of the "jump rope")

           INT. DAVE'S CAR - DAY

           Dave yanks the parking break. He smiles: another great 
           morning. He hops out.

           NO WORLD - ASSIGNMENT DESK

           Ruth is on line to get an assignment. She puts on a cool, 
           calm and collected demeanor as she's called up.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        You're not on this list. The Semi 
                        desk is right over there.

           He points to another desk where there's a long line of SEMI 
           NON-PEOPLE being carted around on a long wagon. They only 
           have bodies from the waist up, their faces are blank, their 
           outfits have no detail. They're basically vegetables.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        And I'll have someone escort you to 
                        get those legs chopped off.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, that's funny. No, I don't 
                        belong there. Look how much detail 
                        I have.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                 (hesitantly)
                        You are a little more lively than 
                        the a regular Semi.
                                 RUTH
                        Can you double check?

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        But that's extra work for me.

                                 RUTH
                        Or you could just let me go in. 
                        That would be the easiest thing.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        Yes, let's always do the easiest 
                        thing.

           The assignment tech hands her a BLOWER TIMECARD. Ruth takes 
           it, no big deal, but then when she's turned away let's out a 
           big sigh of relief.

           She charges toward the tunnel. A lady with a plan.

           EXT. DAVE'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Dave crosses the plaza and into his office building.

           Moments later, Ruth zips around a corner and follows him in. 

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth bursts into the building just as the elevator doors 
           close on Dave. She freezes. This is new territory.

           The lobby clears out as the other non-people exit through 
           trapdoors. Ruth approaches the elevator, confused.

           Ruth gently knocks on the steel door. Nothing happens.

                                 RUTH
                        Sally? Boss Sally?

           She nervously knocks again, a bit louder.

           The doors open. Amazing! She walks in.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth is pleased with herself until the doors close behind 
           her. She's trapped in this thing. She starts knocking on all 
           the walls, touching everything, except, somehow, the buttons.
           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth manages to pry open the elevator and let herself out, 
           finally! The lobby is empty now.

                                       CUT TO:

           THE STAIRWELL

           Ruth shuffles up the stairs. She reaches the second floor and 
           takes a moment to compose herself.

           She opens the door. There's nobody there. Empty floor. Womp.

                                       CUT TO:

           She runs up to the next floor, again composes herself, and 
           opens the door... Nobody. Womp. Womp.

                                       CUT TO:

           Next floor, she bursts right in... This floor is full of 
           office chairs and a CHAIR GUY who is making them "worn in" 
           with his butt.

                                       CUT TO:

           Ruth is exhausted from hiking all the way to the 17th floor, 
           but she's as determined as ever. She takes a deep breath, 
           stands up straight and opens the door to...

           INT. DAVE'S OFFICE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, the real office! There are sounds of light chatter, 
           phones, a copy machine. Ruth wipes the sweat off her forehead 
           and tiptoes in, checking to see if anybody saw her. Clear.

           She passes an OFFICE WORKER in the kitchen, tossing an orange 
           up and down, mumble-speaking gibberish aloud. 

           She passes Dave & Ada's office, where Ada is standing alone, 
           blankly, holding the phone while she touch-types.

                                 RUTH
                        Sally?

           Ada frowns. Ruth goes two more down. A whiteboard outside the 
           office reads "Happy Birthday Sally!" with a doodle of a 
           giraffe with it's tongue out.
           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY, OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dave holds the door open for Sally as they both exit the 
           conference room. They walk and talk.

                                 SALLY
                        Well that was a disaster. Dave, 
                        next time you get an email from 
                        those guys just send it straight up 
                        to Barbara. We are not dealing with 
                        those clowns.

                                 DAVE
                        Uh, ok. For what it's worth, I 
                        didn't really get such-

                                 SALLY
                        What time is? I've got a lunch 
                        meeting with a Skype date in 
                        Waukegan.

           Dave looks at his watch, but Sally has walked into her office 
           and closed the door before he can answer.

                                 DAVE
                        It's twelve twenty-six.

           INT. SALLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Sally, now alone in her office, drops her disgruntled 
           attitude. She waits a beat and then pulls down a trapdoor 
           from a ceiling panel, unfolding a set of stairs. 

           Just then, Ruth hops out from behind her desk.

                                 RUTH
                        Sally, Boss Sally?

                                 SALLY
                 (startled)
                        Ah!

                                 RUTH
                        Did I scare you? Sorry. 

                                 SALLY
                        Yeesh.

                                 RUTH
                        Do you remember me? From the dream?
                                 SALLY
                        Oh yeah. Hey that was fun, I like 
                        getting to ad lib. Well see ya.

           Sally starts to climb out through the ceiling.

                                 RUTH
                        Wait, can I talk to you?

           Sally pops her head back down.

                                 SALLY
                        Why?

           INT. CEILING TRAPDOOR IN SALLY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Minutes later, Sally and Ruth are sitting on the stairwell to 
           No-World, with their feet dangling from the ceiling of the 
           office and the empty tunnel hallway behind them.

                                 RUTH
                        What if you could do stuff like 
                        that all the time? Not just in 
                        dreams?

                                 SALLY
                        But I can't.

                                 RUTH
                        But what if you just did. There's a 
                        lot you can do since you're so 
                        close to Dave.

           Sally is thinking it over.

                                 SALLY
                        I don't think so. Can I?

                                 RUTH
                        I think so. Like if you had Dave in 
                        for a lunch meeting, you would get 
                        to eat lunch.

                                 SALLY
                        What would I eat?

                                 RUTH
                        Anything. I'm not sure. Spaghetti 
                        with meatballs? Veal parmigiana?

                                 SALLY
                        Hot fudge sundae.
                                 RUTH
                        Now we're talkin'. That's a food? 
                        Right. If Dave has some "hot fun 
                        sunny" you can reach over and have 
                        some too.

                                 SALLY
                        No, that'd be too close for the 
                        boss. The boss doesn't do that.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh right. Of course.

           Ruth has no idea.

                                 SALLY
                        You learn these kinds of things in 
                        Show-er training. Things you do and 
                        things you don't really do. And 
                        things you definitely don't do.

                                 RUTH
                        Definitely.

                                 SALLY
                        Anyway, bye.

           Sally starts to get up.

                                 RUTH
                        Wait!

                                 SALLY
                        Ok.

           She sits back down.

                                 RUTH
                        What if you were more than the 
                        boss?

                                 SALLY
                        But I'm the boss and that's what I 
                        am. I'm the boss. I'm Sally.

                                 RUTH
                        But what if you were more? You got 
                        called into his dream because you 
                        have a connection. Didn't you like 
                        it?

           Sally is perplexed. It's blowing her non-mind.
                                 SALLY
                        Did I like it? I did like it.

                                 RUTH
                        He definitely liked it. You can 
                        work with that. You could get close 
                        to him, and when you're close to 
                        Dave there's more to see and smell 
                        and look at. 

                                 SALLY
                        And feel.

                                 RUTH
                        And it has to happen naturally. But 
                        then, you could do lots of things. 
                        Swimming, ping pong, you could look 
                        at a dog. 

           Ruth feels awkward about this part.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You could do the, the touching 
                        things you were doing in the dream.

                                 SALLY
                        I could be his girlfriend.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. I think so.

                                 SALLY
                        I could get a vagina installed.

                                 RUTH
                        If that's what you want to do.

           Sally considers the situation for an excessively long time.

                                 SALLY
                        Is that what you're trying to do? 
                        Be his girlfriend?

                                 RUTH
                        Me? No. Ha Ha. No. I just want to 
                        be not nobody. I could be your 
                        friend.

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah... 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah? Yes? Really?
                                 SALLY
                        Sure. I think we can be friends. 
                        I'm thinkin'...

                                      FADE TO:

           INT. PAINT FACTORY - DAY

           A PUFF OF DRY PIGMENT BURSTS PINK INTO THE AIR. 

           Another puff, this one is BRIGHT YELLOW.

           There are colors cascading on conveyor belts in every 
           direction. A giant vat of green paint gurgles and splashes as 
           it is mixed. It looks like magma erupting in ancient Earth.

           Giant rotating cylinders flatten the yellow paint. A hand in 
           a work glove touches the mixture, it has the texture of clay.

           The hand belongs to Dave. He shows the paint sample to three 
           CORPORATE CLIENTS. Sally is there too.

           The room is loud, we can't hear what they're all saying as 
           they continue on the tour of the factory.

                                 DAVE
                 (Shouting over the din)
                        And here we get the final stage, 
                        the gallons are filled by weight 
                        and the lid is stamped on by 300 
                        PSIs of pneumatic pressure. You see 
                        that piece there, the stamper?
                 (pause for effect)
                        We call that Sasquatch.

           The clients laugh. Sally is lost in thought, looking at 
           Dave's crotch.

           INT. PAINT FACTORY EXIT - DAY

           Dave hands each client paint chip samples. Sally shakes 
           everyone's hands and the clients leave.

                                 DAVE
                        How do you think that went?

                                 SALLY
                        Do you drink, Dave?
           EXT. COCKTAIL BAR - NIGHT

           A classier joint than Dave's usual haunt. Dave parks his car. 

           INT. COCKTAIL BAR - NIGHT

           Dave's a little bit dressed up.

                                 DAVE
                 (to hostess)
                        I'm going to be two, please.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Right this way.

           NO WORLD - ASSIGNMENT DESK

           Sally confidently leads Ruth up to the assignment desk. Ruth 
           looks a little timid.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        You'll enter in the taxi at 8:37pm, 
                        and return anywhere within three 
                        blocks, anytime between eleven and 
                        midnight.

           The Assignment Tech hands Sally her timecard.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Who's this?

                                 SALLY
                        She's with me.

           The Assignment Tech hands Ruth a timecard too. Ruth tries to 
           be cool about it, but she's clearly pumped. 

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                 (with major shade)
                        Is that what you're wearing?

           NO WORLD - WARDROBE ROOM

           Ruth and Sally are alone in front of the endless clothes 
           rack, trying on different outfits and chatting. Sally's in a 
           gown. Ruth is in mechanics coveralls.

                                 SALLY
                        Is this right? I haven't been 
                        dressed for nighttime yet?
                                 RUTH
                        Ooh straps!

                                       CUT TO: 

           Sally's in a cocktail dress. Ruth steps out in a new look.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This is so soft! My regular clothes 
                        are never this soft.

                                 SALLY
                        That's a bathrobe.

                                       CUT TO:

           Sally's in a sexy dress. Ruth's in a mariachi jacket.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I wonder if I'm going to do kissing 
                        with him right away.

                                 RUTH
                        I don't get how any of that stuff 
                        works.

                                 SALLY
                        It's just sucking lips and licking 
                        tongues. I had to do it for photos 
                        with my late husband.
                 (then)
                        How much time do we have?

           The wardrobe tech, who's been there waiting, chimes in.

                                 WARDROBE TECHNICIAN
                        You have about five Dave Seconds 
                        until your assignment starts.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh that's plenty of time. I'm gonna 
                        try these hot rollers.

           EXT. COCKTAIL BAR - NIGHT

           A taxi pulls up.

           INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           The taxi is parked over a trapdoor. Sally and Ruth crawl into 
           the cab and then out onto the street. They're all dolled up.
           EXT. COCKTAIL BAR NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Through the window, Dave is exactly where we left him, about 
           to sit down at the table for two.

           INT. COCKTAIL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dave stands to greet Sally. Ruth trails shyly.

                                 DAVE
                        Hi there. Wow, you look really-

                                 SALLY
                        Don't you clean up nice. Oh there's 
                        the gang.

           Behind him, there's a table of SALLY'S FRIENDS waiting.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Hi gang. Dave, you sit next to me. 

           She and Dave take the two empty seats. Ruth drags over a 
           stool.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        That's Tom, we went to school 
                        together, his wife Cheryl, Linda 
                        and Roy, from my tennis club. 
                        Everyone this is Dave.

           Dave shakes hands around the table. He ends on Ruth, who is 
           extremely nervous - she's never seen Dave up close before!

                                 RUTH
                 (too loud)
                        Hi!

                                 DAVE
                        Hey there. Let me guess, you two 
                        play on the same water polo team?

           Ruth looks to Sally for help.

                                 SALLY
                        Who, us? I can't believe I haven't 
                        mentioned her before. We're old 
                        besties from way, way back in the 
                        day. Basically she's the reason I 
                        moved up here. My rock. 

                                 RUTH
                        Best rocks forever.
                                 DAVE
                        Great to meet you, what was your 
                        name?

           Sally looks at Ruth, panicked. Nobody has ever asked Ruth's 
           name before.

                                 RUTH
                        Call me Ruth.

                                 DAVE
                        Ruth. Dave.

           They shake hands. Ruth doesn't know how to do it, she grabs 
           his whole hand.

           The WAITRESS comes over. Ruth digs into the menu.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hi guys, can I get you started with 
                        any drinks?

                                 SALLY
                        I'll take a vodka martini, bring it 
                        in a regular lowball glass please. 
                        Or else I'll knock it all over the 
                        table and you'll have to get me a 
                        second one.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Of course. Sir?

                                 DAVE
                        I'm not quite as hardcore as you. 
                        I'll have an aperol spritz.

           The waitress comes around to Ruth's side. 

                                 SALLY
                        Dave tell me honestly, did you pick 
                        that because it's a pink drink?

                                 DAVE
                        You got me.

                                 WAITRESS
                 (to Ruth)
                        And for you miss?

                                 RUTH
                        Wow there are so many choices. I 
                        don't know what to pick. Everything 
                        sounds so good. I guess I'll take 
                        the Courcage Fey.
                                 WAITRESS
                        Which one? Oh that's the corkage 
                        fee. It's actually not a drink.

                                 RUTH
                        That sounds great!

           The waitress looks around the table for help. Nada. They're 
           all busy talking.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I start you off with drink? 
                        Drink for you? What can I get 
                        started for ya?

                                 RUTH
                        Uh, how about the... that one.

           She points to someone else's cocktail.

                                 WAITRESS
                 (dryly)
                        Great choice.

           The waitress leaves. Ruth breathes a sigh of relief. She 
           takes a look around, amazed at every detail.

           She touches her water glass - cold! She tries to grab the 
           table candle. Yikes, it's hot!

           Meanwhile Sally and Dave are giggling and having a nice time.

           The waitress returns with the drinks. Ruth sniffs it, takes a 
           sip. It's gross.

           INT. COCKTAIL BAR - NIGHT

           Dave gets up to get another round. Ruth and Sally sidebar.

                                 RUTH
                        It's been 49 minutes! I've never 
                        been around for this long in one 
                        stretch before. How long do you 
                        think we can make this last?

                                 SALLY
                        I wonder what he looks like under 
                        that tie. He's really got a body, 
                        you know?

                                 RUTH
                        I like the smell of the hot meat.
                                 SALLY
                        I feel funny. This is fun.

                                 RUTH
                        We're having fun!

           Dave catches Sally's eye from the bar. He's seeing her in a 
           new light.

           EXT. COCKTAIL BAR - NIGHT

           Dave, Sally and Ruth step out into the fresh night air. 
           Sally's friends wave goodbye and grab a cab.

                                 DAVE
                 (a bad smell)
                        Ooph! Is that a skunk?

           Sally steps plants a big kiss on Dave. He's way into it.

                                 SALLY
                        We should keep this on the hush 
                        hush at the office. I can't give 
                        you any special treatment.

                                 DAVE
                        No, of course not.

           He kisses her. They lose their balance and it turns into a 
           full on make out session.

           Ruth stands a few feet away, relishing the evening breeze. 
           She gazes at all the lights in the city. Is this heaven?

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Sally is getting a talking to from the Administrator, who 
           hovers a foot in the air. Literally talking down to her.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Your assignment was to come into 
                        work with a hangover. Nowhere were 
                        you instructed to invite Dave to 
                        the source of the hangover.

                                 SALLY
                        That was specifically approved by 
                        my trainer.
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        And that kiss? Yes, we know about 
                        it. Deep Brain has been replaying 
                        it all night.

                                 SALLY
                        I followed the logic of the 
                        evening.

           Behind them, Ruth punches her timecard. She's eavesdropping.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        It means we'll all be scrambling, 
                        as I'm sure you know. And I'm sure 
                        you know we don't prefer 
                        scrambling.

                                 SALLY
                        Everything I did out there was well 
                        within parameters.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                 (re: Ruth)
                        And how did she end up in the mix?

           Ruth looks up like "who me?".

                                 SALLY
                        Do I need to justify every choice I 
                        make out there? Are you trying to 
                        make this extra difficult?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        That's just categorically 
                        incorrect. I am here explicitly to 
                        keep difficulties at zero.
                 (then)
                        She has not had Show-er training. 
                        She needs the appropriate training 
                        before that kind of proximity.

                                 SALLY
                        Well that sounds easy enough.

           Ruth is VERY excited at the prospect of new training.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I guess she's your friend now.

           UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in and carries us into...
           EXT. RIVERWALK STREET FAIR - DAY

           Dave and Sally lick ice cream cones as they stroll through 
           the fair. They're with a group of friends, including Ruth, 
           who is eating an ENORMOUS SUNDAE while she walks.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           On a double date with Dave, Sally, and Dave's college buddy, 
           RUTH TRIES SPAGHETTI.

           INT. BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ruth, Dave and Sally at Tom and Cheryl's anniversary dinner. 
           A waiter cuts another piece of BRAZILIAN STEAK for Ruth. 
           She's obviously very full, but takes a bite.

                                 RUTH
                        Ah. I'm full of salt.

           EXT. NATURE TRAIL - DAY

           Sally and Dave are on a group hike with a NATURE GUIDE. 
           They're sweating and feeling alive. 

                                 DAVE
                        Look at that hawk!

                                 SALLY
                        Where? Wow!

           Ruth is thirty feet behind them on her hands and knees 
           intently watching some ants.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Sally sits between Ruth and Dave. The lights dim. Ruth is a 
           little scared.

                                 RUTH
                 (whispering)
                        I didn't realize it'd be so dark.

                                 SALLY
                 (whispering)
                        These are just previews. It won't 
                        be scary.

           Sally holds her hand. Ruth blushes.
           Dave grabs a big bite of popcorn. Movie time!

           NO WORLD - PARK CAFE TRAINING AREA

           In the middle of a void are a park bench, a tree, a little 
           path - just enough details to make it resemble a city park. 

           Ruth is at a cafe table practicing basic human behavior with 
           the Restaurant Trainer.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        I want you to feel safe, there's no 
                        wrong answers here. If you say 
                        something strange, that's ok. 
                        Humans are strange. The message 
                        from Deep Brain is that Dave finds 
                        you peculiar, which gives you even 
                        more wiggle room.

           Ruth is very excited to be here.

                                 RUTH
                        OK.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        The easiest way to do it, when 
                        you're first learning to converse 
                        with Dave, is to make up something 
                        that 
                 (air quotes)
                        "you want".

                                 RUTH
                        Uh huh.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        That's a stumbling block for a lot 
                        of new Show-er's. What does wanting 
                        feel like? See, the way I usually 
                        try to understand-

                                 RUTH
                        —I want to touch a squirrel.

           The trainer cocks his head.

           EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Moving Day. Ruth helps Sally carry a dresser into Dave's 
           house. Dave is on the floor, plugging in their new TV.
           He crawls out from under the Entertainment Center and flips 
           on the TV. Shelly the Weatherman is on.

                                 DAVE
                        Nice.

                                 SALLY
                        No. I want it over there.

                                 DAVE
                        You're the boss.

           The phone RINGS.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        I'll get it. 
                 (picks up)
                        Hello?

           Dave not-so-casually moves into the bathroom to talk.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Oh hi. How's it goin?

           Ruth puts down a heavy box near the TV. Shelly the weatherman 
           looks up at her from inside the screen.

                                 SHELLY THE WEATHERMAN (ON TV)
                        Get away from me, ya huge bitch.

           Ruth FLICKS the glass right in Shelly's face. He jumps back.

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dave is awkwardly tucked in the bathroom, talking quietly. 

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, it's been a while yet. I've 
                        been meaning to call. So, thing is 
                        actually, that, I've been seeing 
                        somebody and I—
                 (listening)
                        Yeah, and I realized that while, 
                        you and I had reconnected as 
                        friends, I also didn't want to add 
                        complications for—
                 (listening)
                        Yes, well I guess I always thought 
                        of us as friends first. Which I 
                        still hope—
           NO WORLD - YELLOW PHONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Close up on Daphne, on the phone to Dave, holding back tears. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        —I just thought we had a good thing 
                        going again, you know. I thought 
                        maybe this time, we were being good 
                        to each other. I'm just... I mean 
                        we sleep together for 7 months and 
                        then just nothing. You're making me 
                        sound crazy! I mean when did this 
                        change for you?

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Oh yeah sure. Sure. Oh Daphne, I am 
                        sorry.
                 (he quiets himself)
                        I'm so sorry. Really I'm sorry. I 
                        should have gotten in touch sooner.

           Daphne's on a big, red Dr. Seuss looking phone, connected to 
           a long, red pole sprouting from the nebulous floor.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Are you with her right now?
                 (beat)
                        Oh! Oh! Ok. Really, I'm sorry to 
                        bother you.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Please don't be mad.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Don't tell me how to feel.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        No no. That's not what I meant. 
                        It's just that it was all 
                        unexpected and I didn't quite know 
                        how to handle it, to be honest. I'm 
                        excited that we reconnected and I 
                        consider you to be a true friend.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Oh course, Dave. Glad to be your 
                        FRIEND. Hey, I'll see ya around I 
                        guess... Sorry—

           Daphne is about to burst into tears. She hangs up.

           As soon as she slams down the phone, her emotions do an 
           immediate 180. She's as happy as a clam. She springs into the 
           air and clicks her heels together. 
           As she leaves the phone area, she passes ELAINE, Dave's mom.

                                 ELAINE
                        How'd you take it?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Like a champ.

           The phone rings.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA, STREET SET

           Ruth is working with the Show-er Restaurant Trainer.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        OK. Conflict. How do you react. How 
                        have you reacted in previous 
                        conflicts. There are lots of ways. 
                        Let's try rapid fire—
                 (pointing to nothing)
                        There's a dad being mean to his kid 
                        over there!

           Ruth "rapid fire" responds.

                                 RUTH
                        Hello.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        You don't have to limit yourself. 
                        You can respond to the conflict 
                        directly. You can hide, which is 
                        Dave's preference. But no matter 
                        what, you should have some 
                        emotional precedence, something 
                        from your "past" that informs your 
                        behavior.

                                 RUTH
                 (shouting)
                        Stop that reckitizin'!

           The trainer looks at his notebook.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        That's not on any of our lists.

                                 RUTH
                        I made it up.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        Well obviously you can't just make 
                        up a word.

                 (then)
                        Let's pivot to non-verbal 
                        communication.

           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ruth is hanging out on the carpet with Cookie the dog, all 
           smiles. Sally and Dave come out of their room with suitcases.

                                 DAVE
                 (to Cookie)
                        Are you gonna miss me, Cookie? Are 
                        you gonna? Are you gonna?

           Dave kneels down and aggressively plays with Cookie. Cookie 
           is very excited.

                                 SALLY
                        Don't get her all riled up. She'll 
                        pee. 

           Instead Dave amps up his dog antics, scratching her belly.

                                 DAVE
                 (doggie talk)
                        A buhbuhbuhduhduh. A bububududu.

                                 SALLY
                 (to Ruth)
                        Thanks again for dog sitting.
                 (to Dave)
                        Dave! We're going to be late.

                                 DAVE
                 (wrestling with Cookie)
                        Cookie! Cookie! Cookie! Uh oh, 
                        she's peeing.

                                 SALLY
                        Dave! It's the same every time.

                                 RUTH
                        It's fine! It's fine! I got it. You 
                        guys go.

                                 DAVE
                        Ok, sorry Ruth, there's paper 
                        towels under the sink.

                                 SALLY
                        See you in a week!

           Dave and Sally get out the door.
           Moments later Cookie stops being cute. She stands on her hind 
           legs, gives Ruth a salute with her little paw, and walks 
           through a small trapdoor in the radiator.

                                 RUTH
                        See you in a week, Cookie.

           Still, Ruth is happy she got to pet a dog at all.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA

           The ORCHESTRAL SCORE SWELLS as Ruth DANCES around the 
           training area with unadulterated joy. 

           She STAMPS past a group learning to push a stroller while 
           talking on the phone. Nobody pays her any mind.

           She LEAPS from one boulder to another, while a BOULDER 
           TECHNICIAN sticks on the granite-pattern wallpaper.

           She GLIDES through a cascade of colorful autumn leaves that 
           are being blown toward a tunnel.

           She SCAMPERS under the legs of non-people learning to sneeze. 
           The SCORE HITS A FINAL CHORD. Ruth strikes a pose and then 
           there's a big AH-CHOO!

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Sally is a sloppy drunk.

                                 SALLY
                        Woo!

           Ruth is laughing along. It's freezing out. Dave trails behind 
           them. He's ready to call it a night.

           Sally stops at a brick wall.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Ok here's good, yeah, yeah.

                                 RUTH
                        Here?

                                 DAVE
                        We could go back to the lounge, 
                        they'll let you in.

                                 SALLY
                 (ignoring Dave)
                        Yeah, yeah cover me.
           Ruth spreads out her arms, using her coat to hide Sally while 
           she crouches and pees on the wall.

                                 DAVE
                        Oh come on, you're going to get 
                        arrested. 

                                 RUTH
                        It's getting on your feet.

                                 DAVE
                        We're too old for this.

                                 SALLY
                        Speak for yourself!

                                 RUTH
                        It's coming toward my feet.

           Sally zips up.

                                 DAVE
                        Can we go home now?

                                 SALLY
                        I think Dave needs a drink.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah. A glass of warm milk.

           The women drag him down the block.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           It's very late. All of the sane people have gone home for the 
           night. Dave is drunk and barely awake, sprawled in a booth.

           Sally and Ruth are on the dance floor, drunkenly professing 
           their best friendship over the loud music.

                                 RUTH
                        No, you're the best. I was always 
                        so intimidated by you --

                                 SALLY
                        Shut up, you're the coolest. I was 
                        so nervous about being your friend!

                                 RUTH
                        You, it's you who are so 
                        impressive! You have such a fancy 
                        job and...
           Dave rests his head on his shoulder and FALLS ASLEEP.

           The MUSIC DIPS, the LIGHTS GO SOFT AND GREY. A WEIRDO in the 
           corner stops swaying her hips. The BARTENDER opens his NO-
           WORLD HATCH behind the bar, ready to peace out.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

                                 SALLY
                        He's not asleep. Dave, wake up!

           She shakes him awake.

           The MUSIC SPEEDS BACK UP. The weirdo gets back into swaying 
           like a sad creep. The bartender closes the hatch.

           Dave sits up totally dazed, but maintains his sense of humor.

                                 DAVE
                        What happened. I'm awake.

                                 SALLY
                        Party's still going babe.

                                 RUTH
                        Party babe.

                                 DAVE
                 (being cute)
                        I'm so tirrred.

           Ruth thinks it's hilarious. Sally joins her on the "dance 
           floor" and starts flinging her hair like a wild man. Ruth is 
           just hopping up and down, almost to the beat. Party time!

           Dave nods off again. The MUSIC DIPS, LIGHTS SHIFT. Weirdo is 
           paused. Bartender is halfway into his hatch.

                                 SALLY
                        No nononono.

           This time she picks him up under the armpits. His eyes open 
           and EVERYTHING COMES BACK IN FULL SWING. The bartender, 
           slightly perturbed, shuts the hatch again.

           Sally gets Dave on his feet and starts dancing with him. 
           She's basically puppeteering him. He's loopy, but smiling.

                                 DAVE
                        Salsaaaaaaaaaaa.
           INT. DAVE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dave is fast asleep, BREATHING LOUDLY. Sally lies next to 
           him, wide awake, frazzled in that 4AM kind of way.

           She tiptoes out of bed.

           NO WORLD - ROLODEX RESTING QUARTERS

           Ruth is writing in a blank "The Miracle of Life" book that 
           she's repurposed as a journal. There's a KNOCK KNOCK.

           Ruth opens her drawer to find a red eyed Sally.

                                 SALLY
                        Can I come in?

           Ruth makes room. Sally squeezes in.

                                 RUTH
                        Rough night?

                                 SALLY
                        He just keeps breathing.

           Sally closes her eyes. Ruth gets back to journaling, happy.

           INT. DAVE'S MOM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                 (whisper shouting)
                        Now, Sally, now!

           Sally flips off the lights while throwing back a cocktail.

           Grandma enters with a giant cake, with birthday candles. The 
           room is packed with toddlers and parents.

                                 EVERYONE
                 (singing)
                        Happy Birthday...

           The cake is set in front of the oblivious two year old. The 
           candle illuminates his face. All eyes on him.

           Ruth, standing by Sally, is enchanted by the scene. She 
           watches him intently, yearning.

           Sally pours herself another drink.
           INT/EXT. DAVE'S CAR - NIGHT

           Dave drives. Sally's in the passenger seat, completely zoned 
           out. Ruth is in the back.

                                 RUTH
                        What if the thing you're trying to 
                        name isn't just one color. There's 
                        shapes and tones and the way the 
                        light bends around it.

                                 DAVE
                        I guess I kind of like take all 
                        that stuff, texture, mood, and all 
                        that, of a pigment and then 
                        simplify it into one simple thing, 
                        a name. So people can refer to it 
                        as easily as possible. And buy it 
                        and paint their house with it. But 
                        that's really a small part of my 
                        job, I mostly write copy for the 
                        catalogue. 

                                 RUTH
                        Simpler? But why? Why reduce when 
                        you could expand?

                                 SALLY
                        He's a simple man, Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Like, I was thinking about the 
                        candles on Quinn's birthday cake. 
                        They had this glow, it wasn't 
                        exactly orange. It was warm. Not 
                        just because it was on fire. It was 
                        this glow radiating from all of the 
                        family singing and loving and 
                        focusing their attention on him 
                        because it was his special moment. 

                                 DAVE
                        Maybe it seems like that when 
                        you're a little kid. But then you 
                        get older and you learn you're not 
                        special, and nobody is thinking 
                        about you. 

           Sally sighs heavily.

                                 RUTH
                        Sally?
           She reaches out and touches Sally's shoulder. Sally flashes 
           Ruth a smile, then returns to her dead eyed stare.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I'd call that color 
                        fantoosha.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Sally clocks out. The administrator floats up behind her.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                 (to Sally)
                        You, report to the Grower Zone for 
                        aging. 

                                 SALLY
                        Really? Are you sure?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Really. The order from Deep Brain 
                        is to prep you for the next 15-25 
                        years on this thread. 

                                 SALLY
                        But we've only been dating a few 
                        months. That's a helluva 
                        commitment.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Dave's not likely to change course. 
                        You may have noticed, he likes his 
                        routines.

           Sally is visibly shaken, like a criminal defendant hearing 
           her sentence.

                                 SALLY
                        15 to 25 years.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Before you go: there have been 
                        reports that you're acting a bit 
                        erratically in there. It would be 
                        nice if you could adhere to your 
                        training from here on out.
                 (unshakable eye contact)
                        No more fartin' around.
           NO WORLD - MAIN AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Sally slinks out of the timeclock room. Behind her Ruth is 
           sitting crosslegged, waiting.

                                 RUTH
                        Hey. I'm here. Because I waited. So 
                        we could walk together.

           She catches up to Sally and puts her arm around her. Sally 
           does the same.

           They walk together, passing through multicolored light beams 
           and crossing shadows. They are silhouettes, climbing the arc 
           of a jumbled-up rainbow.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PALISADE PARK - DAY

           A perfect spring day, the late afternoon sun sparkles on the 
           river. Across a grassy lawn, Dave is walking Cookie the dog.

           Ruth and Sally, both in nice dresses, are sitting on a bench. 
           Sally looks completely detached.

                                 RUTH
                        Gorgeous. Don't you love sunsets? 
                        It's got every color.

                                 SALLY
                        There's no green.

                                 RUTH
                        ...if you squint.
                 (then)
                        I just feel like things are finally 
                        going the way I want. I get to have 
                        it all: emotional depth, distinct 
                        flavor profiles, all the smells, 
                        things at different focal distances 
                        for my eyes, a dog I get to pet at 
                        least three times a month-

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, I think I'm done.

                                 RUTH
                        Sorry I didn't mean to rattle on.

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, I'm gonna go back to not 
                        doing this.
                                 RUTH
                        What?

                                 SALLY
                        See ya.

           She starts to walk away. Ruth runs after her.

                                 RUTH
                        Wait, I thought you liked it here.

                                 SALLY
                        This was an ok experiment but nah 
                        I'm done.

                                 RUTH
                        You can't just leave though. You're 
                        in Dave's life. It doesn't make any 
                        sense.

                                 SALLY
                        So I'll break up with him. I can go 
                        back to being his boss and only 
                        alive 40 hours a week.

           Ruth starts getting short of breath.

                                 RUTH
                        But he'll be devastated. He really 
                        cares about you. You're the love of 
                        his life.

                                 SALLY
                        I don't know what I was thinking. 
                        Dave... is... maddening. He has 
                        nothing to say. He has no 
                        personality. He's an empty 
                        cavernous void that is sucking me 
                        into oblivion.   

                                 RUTH
                        But but but on the other hand, you 
                        get to do all the good stuff. 
                        Talking and dancing and that sex, 
                        uh, sex stuff. Then you could have 
                        a kid and watch him grow up.

                                 SALLY
                        Sex, hmm, yeah. I tried it, I liked 
                        it... I think I'm going to pass.

           Dave peers at them from a distance. He waves. Sally smiles 
           genuinely and waves back.
                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I'll just do it right now, you can 
                        watch.

           She walks towards him. Ruth follows, hustling and 
           hyperventilating.

                                 RUTH
                        Wait!

                                 SALLY
                        What?

                                 RUTH
                        If you leave him, what happens to 
                        us? We'll never see each other 
                        again.

           This gives Sally pause. Ruth gets quiet, she's discovering 
           what she's feeling as she articulates it.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        There will never be a reason for us 
                        to spend time together. We'll just 
                        be nobody again. I mean, I'm not in 
                        love with Dave either but I'm doing 
                        it because I want to be here with 
                        you. We're in this together. 

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah...

                                 RUTH
                        Don't break up with Dave, or it  
                        all goes away.

           Sally cracks. She softens. 

                                 SALLY
                        Oh Ruth, of course.

           They hug.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PALISADE PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Sally and Ruth walk over to Dave. As we get closer we see 
           he's in a very nice suit. The dog is wearing a bowtie.

                                 DAVE
                        Ready?

                                 SALLY
                        One last thing.
           She grabs him and passionately kisses him.

                                 DAVE
                        That's bad luck.

           They are so in love. Dave steps away. Sally wipes his spit 
           off her face.

           A piano starts playing a BEATLES LOVE SONG. Sally picks up a 
           bouquet that's resting on a bench. She turns around a hedge. 

           It's their wedding.

           EXT. OUTDOOR WEDDING - CONTINUOUS

           There are about 20 guests in folding chairs. At the end of 
           the aisle, Dave is waiting with his mom and a LADY OFFICIANT. 
           Cookie the dog is the ring bearer. They all stand for Sally.

           Ruth, still freaked out from their talk, joins the other 
           bridesmaids. She looks at Dave's kind, smiling face.

           Sally heads down the aisle.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PALISADE PARK - DAY

           The party is bumpin. Everyone's eating shrimp.

           Sally and Dave pose for wedding photos. Sally is ecstatically 
           happy. A little too happy?

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        How about a cute one.

           Dave wraps his arms around Sally, almost a chokehold.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        As long as you both shall live.

           Ruth catches a glimpse of Sally's deranged smile. Oh no.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Let's get mom in there, groom and 
                        his mommy.

           Sally, grinning like a banshee, steps aside next to Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Next we'll have champagne. Your 
                        favorite.
                                 SALLY
                        Gotta kill him.

                                 RUTH
                        What?

           Sally smiles warmly at a wedding guest.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Sally.

                                 SALLY
                        I've gotta put everyone out of 
                        their misery. I mean look at him. 
                        Even his mom hates him.

           Dave and his mom are being lovely and endearing as they pose 
           for their picture.

                                 RUTH
                        You can't do that!
                 (hushing herself)
                        You can't do that.

                                 SALLY
                        I'm the only one who can do it. 
                        Nobody else.

           Dave comes over, happy as can be.

                                 DAVE
                        I think that's enough photos. I'm 
                        pretty sure we'll remember the 
                        occasion!

           Sally laughs, oh so genuine.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        What I would like now is to take my 
                        beautiful bride up on that hill and 
                        watch the sunset.

           Sally takes his arm.

                                 RUTH
                        No! It's getting dark soon, might 
                        be a bad idea.

                                 SALLY
                        Bride and groom only, Ruth.

           Sally and Dave walk off up the wooded path, giggling. 
           Ruth is left standing there. The rest of the guests stop 
           dancing and instead stand motionless staring into space 
           making abstract mouth sounds. 

           Ruth takes a look around at all the zombie-like non-people, 
           then breaks out into a full sprint into the woods.

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE HIKING TRAIL - SUNSET

           Dave and Sally hike easily up the hill.

                                 DAVE
                        These are pine. This one here, is a 
                        fir. You know how I can tell? It's-

                                 SALLY
                        Ooh this is a nice rock.

           She picks up a big rock to see how heavy it is.

                                 DAVE
                        You're really into rocks today.

                                 SALLY
                        Nah.

           She tosses it down.

                                 DAVE
                        Anyway, if a twig bears needles in 
                        groups of two, three, or five, you 
                        can safely call it a pine. But if -

           He stops because Sally has wandered off the path. She is 
           pulling at a huge stick.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Sweetheart? Whatcha doing there?

           She swings the stick a few times in practice. Then decides to 
           drop it when she finds an even bigger rock.

                                 SALLY
                        Right behind you, kitten.

           Sally steps out of the brush with the rock hidden behind her 
           back. She grips it tightly.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        You're right Dave, taking this hike 
                        was a good idea.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I really appreciate how you always 
                        give me beautiful gifts. Hey, Dave. 
                        I'd like to give you a gift.

                                 DAVE
                        Ooh la la.

                                 SALLY
                        Close your eyes.

                                 DAVE
                        I guess we have to consummate this 
                        thing sometime.

           He closes his eyes with a grin. Sally raises the giant rock, 
           ready to bash him in the skull...

           ...but just then, Ruth comes running up the trail.

                                 RUTH
                 (Shouting)
                        Stop that reckatizin'!

           She pushes Dave out of the way. He trips and falls to the 
           ground, narrowly dodging Sally's rock.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh come on.

                                 RUTH
                        Buddy why don't we wait and think 
                        about it!

           Dave dusts off his suit.

                                 DAVE
                 (smiling)
                        Ouch?

           Sally goes for the rock again, rambling madly. Ruth doesn't 
           know what to do.

                                 SALLY
                        I'm sick of thinking. I hate all 
                        this thinking. And talking. And 
                        doing. I'm around way too much. At 
                        work. At home. At night in the bed. 
                        It's torture.

           She gets the rock and steps toward Dave. Ruth jumps in front 
           of her, holding her back.
                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        And then I'm called into the dreams 
                        and even the dreams are boring! I 
                        hate it! I've never hated anything 
                        before and I don't like it!

                                 DAVE
                        Sweetheart, are you ok?

           Dave walks towards them. Ruth goes on one foot, pushing Sally 
           with her arms and kicking Dave back with her other foot.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Ruth, I think this is borderline 
                        inappropriate.

                                 SALLY
                        Get outta the way, Ruth. I wanna 
                        have a special moment with my 
                        husband.

                                 RUTH
                        Nnnnnn-no!

                                 DAVE
                        Ladies, are you fighting over me?

           Sally is taller than Ruth, she overpowers her. But Ruth wraps 
           her arms around Sally, bear-hugging her torso and arms. Sally 
           drags her around like dead weight.

                                 SALLY
                        Let go of me, Ruth!

                                 DAVE
                        Hey Ruth, let go of her.

                                 RUTH
                 (face smooshed into Sally)
                        Run, Dave! Flee!

           Sally tries to throw the rock again but with Ruth's tight 
           grip on her arms, it's a really weak throw. Dave catches it.

                                 DAVE
                        What is going on?

           Sally spins around until Ruth loses her grip and falls.

                                 SALLY
                 (to Ruth)
                        You! You're the one who got me into 
                        this in the first place.
                                 RUTH
                        Who me?

           She starts advancing on Ruth terrifyingly.

                                 SALLY
                        I never would have done any of 
                        this. I was fine the way things 
                        were, I had my part.

           Ruth scrambles to her feet, retreating.

                                 RUTH
                        You wanted to do it! You were 
                        lusty!

                                 SALLY
                        You tricked me into it, because you 
                        were afraid of his ding dong!

                                 DAVE
                        Sweetheart, Ruth, let's just calm—

           Dave puts his arm on Ruth's shoulder. It catches her off-
           guard, creeps her out. She reacts with a violent shrug, 
           PUSHING him off her. 

           Dave stumbles backward, losing his balance, and falls into 
           the brush...

           ...And then he keeps falling, tumbling right off THE EDGE OF 
           THE CLIFF.

           Ruth rushes to the edge to look.

                                 RUTH
                        Uh oh.

                                 SALLY
                        Where did he go?

           It's a beautiful sunset on a cliff overlooking the river, and 
           Dave is rapidly falling to the bottom of the palisade.

           EXT. BOTTOM OF CLIFF - CONTINUOUS

           Dave is badly hurt, he lies bleeding with his limbs mangled.

                                 DAVE
                        I didn't realize we were so close 
                        to the edge.

           His eyes go blank AND HE DIES. 
           The world becomes silent. First birds and crickets stop 
           chirping. Then the wind stops.

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE HIKING TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Up on the hill, Sally closes her eyes, accepting the end.

                                 SALLY
                        Oh thank God.

           Ruth is lost.

                                 RUTH
                        I thought we were besties.

                                 SALLY
                        Ruth, you don't understand 
                        anything. We were never besties. 
                        You can't be besties with nobody. 

           A cataclysmic HUM washes through the fabric of the universe. 
           It becomes deafening, like when you hear your own eardrums.

           Gravity fails. Grass and rocks are lifted.

           THE WORLD IS EXPLODING IN SLOW MOTION

           "I've Got Time on my Hands" by The Stylistics plays as 
           everything comes apart.

           Ruth and Sally drift apart from each other, then their bodies 
           begin to drift apart from themselves.

           In the chaos, a squirrel floats past Ruth. She reaches but 
           it's just out of her grasp. Her outstretched arm COMES OFF, 
           then her hand comes off her arm. 

           Her parts all break apart into a beautiful abstraction as we 
           stop being able to identify what used to be here.

           This anti-gravity ballet ends when a FUTURISTIC VACUUM 
           CLEANER glides into frame, operated by a CLEANUP TECHNICIAN. 

           The hose sucks up all the things: body parts, clumps of 
           trees, wedding decorations etc.

           We follow Ruth's eyeball as it is SUCKED DOWN A LONG HOSE.
           NO WORLD - SORTING ROOM

           A place for sorting out all the molecules of the universe, it 
           resembles an automated seafood processing factory.

           The other end of the vacuum hose spits out its contents onto 
           a conveyor belt. Everything from Dave's Earth is sorted into 
           tubs. The mechanism is slow and rhythmic. 

           Ruth's eyeball and other body parts are collected in one tub. 

           A gigantic mechanical sensor hangs above the conveyor belt, 
           scanning each tub with a DING and a WHITE LIGHTBULB. 

           Ruth's tub goes through and instead gets a HONK and RED 
           LIGHTBULB.

           The Administrator walks in, out of nowhere. She grabs the 
           Ruth bin and looks inside.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Found you. Well that was quite an 
                        inconvenience.

           NO WORLD - THE STORAGE OF DEFECTIVE THINGS AREA

           The Administrator dumps out Ruth's collection of parts into a 
           glass box. She SQUEEZES the glass flat, locking Ruth into the 
           glowing, silver two-dimensional rectangle.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We've never had to deal with 
                        something this defective before. 
                        We're not set up for this. You'll 
                        stay here until further notice.

           She slides compressed Ruth onto a storage shelf. Ruth's 
           picasso'ed face looks out forlornly from her glass prison.

           The Administrator walks away, her footsteps getting softer 
           and softer in the distance.

           NO WORLD - TRAINING ROOM

           The place is silent and empty.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           The clock has stopped ticking.
           NO WORLD - SUPPLY ROOM

           All the world's fire hydrants are flattened and stacked.

           NO WORLD - PLANT ROOM

           All the plants are drooped. A tree falls into the middle of 
           the room, dead.

           There is a quiet TAPPING sound coming from far away.

                                       CUT TO:

           Much later. All of the plants are dead now. There's a spark 
           that CATCHES FIRE. The room blazes. The smoke billows, 
           filling everything.

           The far away tapping is more sparse.

                                       CUT TO:

           Much, much later. The plants are quietly growing. A tree has 
           sprouted.

           The tapping is even more sparse.

                                       CUT TO:

           Even later still. Many trees are grown back to full size. 
           Slowly, some noise seeps in. A colored shadow crosses the 
           frame, then another. The non-people must be back at work. 

           Just one tap... and then another.

           NO WORLD - THE STORAGE OF DEFECTIVE THINGS AREA

           Ruth's little dismembered finger taps on the glass of her 2-
           dimensional prison. TAP... She's been at it a long time. 

           ...TAP, and there's a CRACK. Then a BREAK. 

           Her little finger reaches out, then a second finger. Her two 
           fingers move in a "walking" sort of way, slowly dragging her  
           little prison to the edge of the shelf. 

           It topples over the edge and SHATTERS on the ground.

           She's free! But her body is pancaked flat. It starts to RE-
           INFLATE like when you open a vacuum seal bag. 

           Pumped back to full size, she's achy and discombobulated, 
           with contorted features. She stands up.
           NO WORLD - MAIN AREA

           Ruth's feet are on backwards but she manages to do a floppy 
           thrust to move herself forward through the nothingness.

           She passes two UNSTACKER TECHS unfolding a BANK OF PHONE 
           BOOTHS. The main training sets are up and running. Non-people 
           practice opening doors and grocery shopping. Non-kids learn 
           to play tag.

           NO WORLD - GROWER ROOM 

           Ruth flops into the Grower Room, where there is a line of 
           non-people waiting to be helped. She gets on the end of the 
           line, behind a LITTLE GIRL about 6 years old.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Hi.

                                 RUTH
                        Smgalkhdf.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I already know how to talk. I used 
                        to be the scooter girl, I was 
                        always scooting, scooting. But now 
                        I get to be Dave's neighbor girl 
                        and they gave me hair plugs.

                                 RUTH
                        Marrr.

           Two Grower Techs in PURPLE SMOCKS lift the little girl up and 
           bring her to a table. 

                                 PURPLE SMOCK #1
                        Quiet.

           The little girl puts her finger to her lips. Shh.

           The Purple Smock SLAPS her on the back of the head and she 
           gets freckles.

                                 PURPLE SMOCK #2
                        Next!

           Ruth hops up. The Purple Smock looks at her impassively.

                                 RUTH
                        Mrrgh mrrg?

           He flips Ruth's mouth over so it's back in the correct place.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Dave is alive?

           He's not listening, already busy at work fixing her body.

                                 PURPLE SMOCK #2
                        We're gonna need the big saw.

           Ruth's eyes light up with terror at the truly giant saw. 

           NO WORLD - HALLWAYS

           Ruth is back bay-bee! Her body is as good as new and she's 
           got a cute new haircut. She struts down the colorful hallway. 

           NO WORLD - ASSIGNMENT DESK

           All the non-people are heading to their tunnels. Ruth looks 
           to see if anyone's watching her. Nobody is.

           She steps up to the assignment desk, nervous. But the 
           Assignment Tech doesn't even look up.

                                 ASSIGNMENT TECHNICIAN
                        Two laps around Third Street, exit 
                        at the barbershop.

           He hands her a timecard, which she takes, relieved.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DAY

           Ruth emerges onto the city street full of people minding 
           their regular city business. She looks around for Dave, but 
           doesn't spot him.

           Trying to stay inconspicuous, Ruth casually speedwalks down 
           the street, searching for Dave. 

           She gets to his office building and pushes the revolving 
           door, but it DOESN'T MOVE. This building is not in use, IT'S 
           JUST A FACADE NOW. 

           Confused, Ruth walks back the way she came. To her left, non-
           people are returning through the trapdoor at the barbershop.

           She pauses, deciding. Then she heads to the right.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth walks through town looking for Dave. 
           The streets look a little different from before. Cars are an 
           older style. There are more phone booths. She passes a movie 
           theater with "Rhinestone" on the marquee.

           EXT. BASEBALL CARD STORE - DAY

           Ruth is surprised to see an "Open" sign at her old clubhouse. 

           She looks through the window - all her stuff has been cleared 
           out. The place is reset as a comic book store now. The window 
           has a big poster for the TV show "Dinosaurs". 

           A bird flies by - Dave must be nearby! She follows the bird.

           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Ruth jogs into the park, out of breath. She doesn't see Dave 
           anywhere. She's about to give up.

                                 A MOM (O.S.)
                        Dave! Careful up there!

           Ruth follows the voice to the playground where some toddlers 
           are running around. A little boy of about 4 has climbed 
           precariously high on top of the jungle gym.

                                 A MOM (CONT’D)
                        Dave. Pull your knee outta there. 
                        You're gonna get stuck.

           The 4 year-old DAVE 2 is ignoring her. 

           His mom is standing below, vaguely concerned. She is the 
           homeless woman from the previous world, but cleaned up and 
           very mom-like, with an 80's haircut and outfit.

                                 RUTH
                 (to herself)
                        Dave?

           The mom catches Ruth staring from outside the playground. She 
           gives her a funny look. Does she recognize her? Or is she 
           just scornful of childless adults hanging around the jungle 
           gym.

           Ruth bee-lines outta there.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Ruth walks up to the clock, but instead of stamping it she 
           shoves the timecard in her pocket.
           NO WORLD - TRAINING AREA

           Ruth walks around as non-people are training. Nobody seems to 
           notice her or care. She loosens up a bit.

           She goes up to a FINGER PAINTER TECH who is hard at work and 
           taps them on the shoulder.

                                 RUTH
                        So, uh, Dave is looking a little 
                        small lately.

                                 FINGER PAINTER
                        He's average for a four year old. 
                        The Daves usually get their growth 
                        spurt during adolescence, which 
                        won't be until the mid to late 
                        90's.

                                 RUTH
                        When's that?

                                 FINGER PAINTER
                        10 to 12 years. Dave years.

                                 RUTH
                        What am I gonna do with some boring 
                        kid until then?

                                 FINGER PAINTER
                        Who are you supposed to be?

                                 RUTH
                        Never mind, I'll find something. 
                        Nice art by the way.

                                 FINGER PAINTER
                        It's a doggie.

           NO WORLD - GROWER ROOM 

           Close up on Ruth, mid story.

                                 RUTH
                        So at the beginning of the book, 
                        Ishmael says he and Queequeg share 
                        a bed like that every night until 
                        the end of his life. Which is like, 
                        wow, best friends! They really made 
                        it work, ya know?

                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        But then actually what happens is, 
                        eighteen months later the entire 
                        ship is destroyed and everyone 
                        dies, including Queequeg! But not 
                        Ishmael, he writes the book. 

                        I guess the point is, you can think 
                        somebody is your friend, but the 
                        only one who matters is the white 
                        whale himself. And if I want to 
                        harpoon the whale, I have to be 
                        prepared to do whatever it takes. 
                        Even if, in my case, that might 
                        mean getting face to face with 
                        Dave's... the thing that changes 
                        size unexpectedly. I hope it 
                        doesn't come to that, but I need to 
                        be prepared.
                 (grimaces)
                        So anyway, I'm here for a vagina?

           Reveal Ruth is chatting away to a very confused TAN SMOCK, 
           who is just trying to clean a giant tube.

                                 TAN SMOCK
                        What?

                                 RUTH
                        I'm here to get a vagina put in.

                                 TAN SMOCK
                        We don't have any of those 
                        scheduled quite yet.

                                 RUTH
                        I know it's early but just in case, 
                        I'll need some time to learn how to 
                        use it. 

                                 TAN SMOCK
                        Uh, I'll have to check.

                                 RUTH
                        What do I have to do, to get you to 
                        put me in a vagina today?

           NO WORLD - GROWER ROOM - LATER

           Ruth hops off the Grower table victorious. Though we don't 
           see it, she definitely has a new vagina.
           NO WORLD - O'KEEFFIAN COLORSCAPE

           She floats, up up up, feeling new feelings and rejoicing in 
           previously unknown sensations coming from her crotch area.

           It's an abstract mini-musical sequence, a symphony of 
           pleasing colors and yonic shapes. 

           NO WORLD - CLOUD ROOM

           The place where they store all the clouds. Ruth wakes up 
           serene on a fluffy cumulus. She yawns and stretches.

           EXT. DAVE 2'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Ruth walks up and rings the DOORBELL.

           A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN in a blazer answers the door. She's 
           talking as if on the phone, but there is no phone.

                                 MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                 (on the "phone")
                        Hold a second, would you.
                 (to Ruth)
                        Yes?

                                 RUTH
                        Is Dave home?

                                 MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                        Who are you?

                                 RUTH
                        Uh, babysitter.

           The woman is confused, but busy, she lets her in and goes 
           into another room, talking business.

           INT. DAVE 2'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           As she enters, Ruth passes some FRAMED PHOTOS of a AFFABLE 
           BLOND MAN spanning the decades. She notices one old wedding 
           photo of him and his bride, with the inscription "Dave and 
           Alice, Lake Superior, 2011".

           In the living room, an OLD MAN lies on a hospice bed. His 
           GRANDSON, 20's, gawky, sits beside him. Ruth waltzes in.

                                 RUTH
                        Dave?
           The old man in the bed looks at Ruth. He can't speak.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                 (re: the old man)
                        That's Dave?

           The grandson nods dumbly.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Oh cripes, I overshot it. What year 
                        is this?

           Before she can get an answer, a 3D hologram floats across the 
           room with DAVE 2'S DAUGHTER, 60s, on it — she's a female 
           version of Dave 1's buddy from trivia.

                                 DAVE 2'S DAUGHTER (ON HOLOGRAM)
                        Who are you? How do we know you?

                                 RUTH
                        Whoops, I'll get out of your hair.

           A second hologram comes into the room with DAVE 2'S SON, 60s.

                                 DAVE 2'S SON (ON HOLOGRAM)
                        Sorry I'm late, I came as soon as I 
                        could.

           Ruth backs out of the room.

                                 DAVE 2'S SON (CONT’D)
                        Dad, I wanted to sing a song for 
                        you that I learned from a spirit 
                        guide in Toronto.
                 (to the granddaughter)
                        Can he hear me?

           He starts thumping a beat with his fist on his chest.

                                 DAVE 2'S SON (CONT’D)
                 (singing)
                        Ooombah—

           His hologram flickers off, replaced by text that says, 
           "SIGNAL ERROR NO SIGNAL".

           EXT. DAVE 2'S HOUSE - DAY

           Ruth walks out the front door, but before it shuts behind 
           her, the Grandson grabs it. 

                                 GRANDSON
                        You.
           Ruth, startled, looks up at him. He has a wholly different 
           demeanor now, standing extremely erect and eerily calm. 

                                 GRANDSON (CONT’D)
                        You. Are not. To be here now. 

           He slouches back into Grandson mode and heads back inside. 
           Ruth is creeped out.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL ENTRANCES

           Ruth emerges from a tunnel, behind two NON-PEOPLE. 

                                 NON PERSON 1
                        Watch yourself, I heard the Ruth 
                        was spotted again.

                                 NON PERSON 2
                        Who was?

                                 NON PERSON 1
                        The Ruth, the Dave killer. We all 
                        need to watch yourself.

           Ruth skirts behind them, making herself small.

                                 NON PERSON 2 (FROM A DISTANCE)
                        She'll need to be fertilized. I'm 
                        sure she'll be found and fertilized 
                        upon finding.

           Ruth slinks her head down into her shoulders and pivots away.

           She maneuvers across the non-world landscape, ducking and 
           hiding behind things. She overhears other snippets.

                                 HUSKY NON VOICE (O.S.)
                        ... the Ruth, vicious, thirsty, 
                        bloody...

                                 NASAL NON VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...torturing Daves for 
                        generations...

                                 THICKLY NON VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...she doesn't know her place...

           Ruth is shaking. She turns away from them, only to spot the 
           Administrator. They make eye contact. The Administrator 
           speaks, her voice booming in Ruth's head...

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You.
           Ruth somersaults out of her line of sight and scurries away.

           NO WORLD - DARKNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth rushes away from the light of the training sets, back 
           into the shadowy distance.

           The sound of her name, "Ruth" has transformed into a blur of 
           sounds - UUUUU-RRRRR-THTHTHTH — and it's haunting her.

           Her SHADOWS MULTIPLY, like an infinity mirror and then 
           collapse on themselves.

           She waves her arms to GATHER UP THE DARKNESS AROUND HER, 
           until she's buried in it. Just her eyes peek out.

           NO WORLD - DARKNESS - TIME MELTS ON

           She does not blink. She overhears echoes of conversation.

                                 TRAINER (O.S.)
                        Attention, Attention: Dave has 
                        died. I repeat, Dave has left the 
                        building. 

           A FLAT HUM sound fades in. Dave 2's Death washes across the 
           universe, then peters out.

                                 ANOTHER TRAINER (O.S.)
                        Attention, Attention: Spermy Dave 
                        is on its way to the egg.

           THUNDER! Then some DISSONANT CHIMES.

                                 THIRD TRAINER (O.S.)
                        Dave is born. Eyes up on infant 
                        Dave.

           A TIMELAPSE OVER RUTH'S UNBLINKING FACE AS YEARS FLY BY.

           We can hear all the preparations for the new Dave's life, 
           echoing and melding into each other. A soundscape of:

           BABIES CRYING. Then, 
           CHILDREN PLAYING. Then, 
           A HOUSE PARTY. Then, 
           ADULTS LEARNING FRENCH. Then,
           THE CRACK OF A BASEBALL BAT.

           And with that, Ruth's timelapse is over, she's catatonic.
           And then a huge SAND STORM sweeps in. Sand in all directions.

           NO W0RLD - SAND LAND

           The darkness is BLOWN AWAY and Ruth is covered in sand so 
           that the outline of her body becomes visible. 

           She coughs and blinks, shaking the sand out of her curls.

           Out of nowhere A GIANT BLACK BULLDOZER rolls through, pushing 
           the great pile of sand and Ruth along with it.

           The bulldozer shoves the sand and Ruth through a giant SILVER 
           GARAGE DOOR...

           DREAM - SANDY DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           ...and deposits her and the sand in an endless desert. 

           Ruth has been tumbled upside down, her feet in the air. She 
           kicks around until she's right side up.

           Dusting herself off, she looks around. Nothing but sand in 
           all directions... except for the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 
           PLOPPED inexplicably in the middle of this vast desert.

           There's a window-washer cart hanging off of a high floor.

                                 RUTH
                        Alright, here we go again.

           DREAM - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WINDOW WASHER CART - DAY

           In it, are a MAN, mid 40's, bearded and handsome, and a 
           WOMAN, broad shouldered and athletic, in her late 20's. She's 
           holding a swaddled baby.

                                 MAN
                        I'll take her.

           The woman hands the bundle, which we now see is a glass of 
           water in a baby blanket. They handle it very slowly and 
           protectively, like a baby.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        Careful now. I got her.
                 (to the water)
                        Hey there little buddy.

           HARD BREATHING, not from either of them. And some SHUFFLING. 
           Ruth has scaled the building, like a tiny King Kong.
                                 RUTH
                        Um. Hi. 

           She heaves herself up into the window-washer cart. The man 
           clutches the water close to his chest.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Do you... know me?

           Blank stares.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Not important. Okay, what's the 
                        scenario? Are we washing windows or 
                        just flopping around. You guys 
                        growers, show-ers, semis?

                                 MAN
                 (to his glass of water)
                        There there.

                                 RUTH
                        Wow. My thighs are burning. Have 
                        you ever been alone for so long you 
                        forget about entire body parts? I 
                        think that's why sad puppies lick 
                        their paws. So where's Dave at? Is 
                        he at work behind this window? 

                                 MAN
                 (to woman)
                        What's she getting at?

           The man turns around to look in the window. While his back is 
           turned, two Dream Techs lift Ruth up and out of the cart. A 
           third jumps on, slowly shoving her back to the ground. In her 
           place they put a small FLUFFY DOG. The man turns back.

                                 FLUFFY DOG
                        That was rough.

                                 RUTH
                 (while falling slowly)
                        If you see Dave, tell him I'm 
                        looking for him. Nothing's worse 
                        than nowhere and I'm not going 
                        back.

                                 MAN
                 (to the woman)
                        I think they're looking for me.

                                 WOMAN
                        You can run, but you can't fly.
           She gestures grandly, outward toward the sky. The Man takes a 
           step off the window-washer cart. Four Dream Techs swoop in to 
           grab his arms and leg. They help him "fly".

           Ruth softly lands in the sand far below and watches the man 
           fly. She realizes her mistake.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, hi Dave.

           INT. FABULOUS OCEAN VIEW APARTMENT - DAY

           The man, DAVE 3, wakes up in bed. He's a different person 
           than the previous Daves, but still has a strong Dave vibe. 
           The woman from the dream, MALLORY, is already awake and 
           sipping coffee. She is French, but not the cool kind.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I had a crazy dream.

                                 MALLORY
                        Mmm?

                                 DAVE 3
                        I was protecting Lulu from an urban 
                        spelunker who had a huge birds nest 
                        of hair. But Lulu was a glass of 
                        water.

                                 MALLORY
                 (French accent now, and 
                  from now on)
                        Zat is crazy. I dreamed that my 
                        teeth crumbled in my mouth. It was 
                        horrible!

           They hear A BABY GURGLE.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Does she need a bottle?

                                 MALLORY
                        Quite ze opposite.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Ok, I'm all over it.

           He stretches and climbs out of bed. The apartment is 
           beautiful but there are moving boxes all over.
           INT. BABY'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Dave 3 finishes changing the baby, LULU, who is about eight 
           months old. Mallory comes up behind him affectionately.

                                 DAVE 3
                        She didn't cry. When was the last 
                        time she cried?

           They both look at the baby nervously.

                                 MALLORY
                        She looks fine, right? She's fine.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Heck if I know. Lulu, are you fine?

           The baby does not answer.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Lulu, do you want something? Do you 
                        want a bottle? Do you want a pony, 
                        Lulu?

                                 MALLORY
                        She made your face, Dave. You make 
                        zat exact face when you are trying 
                        to remember someone's name.

                                 DAVE 3
                        She did?

           INT/EXT. DAVE 3'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Mallory is leaving for the day. Dave, holding Lulu, kisses 
           her goodbye.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I think I'll bring Lulu to the game 
                        later.

                                 MALLORY
                        Don't. The babysitter's already 
                        booked.

                                 DAVE 3
                        She loves to watch you play.

                                 MALLORY
                        She has no idea what's going on.
                                 DAVE 3
                        Good thing we got that sitter, 
                        because I've got big plans. Big 
                        plans today. 43 years old, 
                        unemployed...

                                 MALLORY
                        Bye, Lulu.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (to Lulu)
                        Say bye bye Mommy. 

                                 MALLORY
                        I love you, mes petites.

           Mallory climbs into her Jaguar.

           EXT. DOWN THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A team of GARDENERS are trimming, weeding and blowing. 

           Standing with them is Ruth. She has a huge pair of hedge 
           trimmers and is trying to get a glimpse of Dave 3.

                                 RUTH
                 (yelling over leaf blower)
                        He's married? Well there goes that 
                        plan.

           The gardners don't care. Dave 3 goes back into his house.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Ruth crouches behind the timeclock. A RACQUETBALL MAN clocks 
           in and heads to the tunnels. 

           She follows him.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL

           The racquetball man notices Ruth.

                                 RACQUETBALL MAN
                        Who are you?

                                 RUTH
                        I'm the new crosser. Yeah, I cross 
                        the street here.
                                 RACQUETBALL MAN
                        You're in the wrong place.

           INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - DAY

           Ruth emerges from the trapdoor and is in the middle of a fast 
           paced racquetball game. FOUR MEN are whipping the ball all 
           over the glass-walled court, shouting and grunting.

                                 RACQUETBALL MAN
                        Watch out lady!

           Ruth ducks a swinging racket and then dodges a speeding ball. 
           She flees back into the trapdoor. 

           Just as she's gone, Dave 3, in gym clothes, walks past.

           NO WORLD - TUNNEL ENTRANCES

           Ruth scurries out of one tunnel. She's drawing the attention 
           of a few non-people and trainers near the Timeclock Room.

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                 (faintly)
                        She was spotted here earlier, the 
                        Ruth. She's not clocking in!

           A non-person sees Ruth across the hall. She GASPS. The crowd 
           looks up. 

           Ruth sneaks into a different tunnel just in time.

           EXT. PARTY BOAT - DAY

           She emerges onto a party boat. It's a daytime booze cruise. A 
           bunch of SEMIS flopping around making odd sporadic loud 
           sounds and hums. It's a very peculiar scene up close.

           Ruth looks around for Dave. She sees him across the water. He 
           is walking with a stroller on the boardwalk.

                                 RUTH
                        How do I get off this thing? 

                                 PARTYGOER 1
                        Woo!

                                 RUTH
                        Woo.

           Ruth ducks back into the trapdoor.
           NO WORLD - TUNNEL ENTRANCES

           She hops out of the tunnel. There's a larger group of Techs & 
           Trainers waiting for her now, more confused than angry.

                                 UNFOLDING TECH 1
                        Is it her?

                                 TRAINER
                        The Ruth!

                                 RESTAURANT TRAINER
                        She's out of control.

           There's an awkward pause. They're not sure what to do next.

                                 TRAINER
                        Should we... stop her?

                                 RUTH
                        Ok one minute I'll be right with 
                        you.

           She dives to the side and frantically runs into a tunnel.

                                 UNFOLDING TECH 1
                        That's not good.

           INT. GOURMET CANDY STORE - DAY

           Ruth pops up behind the jellybean display. WOW! She looks 
           around - truffles! Caramel! But Ruth doesn't have time.

                                 RUTH
                        Not now, candy!

           Outside the window, Dave walks by. Ruth runs to the glass, 
           but he's gone. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                 (like "dang it")
                        Crabs.

            She turns to a SALESMAN.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Do you know where he goes next?

           The Salesman just flaps his lips like a puppet.

           Ruth hurries out of the store.
           EXT. BEACH MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We're in a charming, upscale beach town, very different from 
           the dark cement streets of Minneapolis. Ruth runs, searching 
           for signs of Dave. Confused people watch her go by.

           A WOMAN HANDING OUT FLIERS tries to stop her by handing her a 
           flier. Ruth dodges her and runs into the street, barely 
           avoiding a TEEN on a mini-bike.

                                 MINI-BIKE TEEN
                        Whoa man!

           Down the street Ruth sees Dave 3 walking briskly. 

           Ruth flags down an OLDER LADY in a convertible.

                                 RUTH
                        I need a ride, it's an emergency?

                                 OLDER LADY
                        <sound of a car honking>

           Ruth hops in the passenger seat, almost crushing a small dog.

                                 RUTH
                        Driver, follow that pedestrian!

           The lady drives just as she was, slowly. Up ahead Dave is 
           disappearing around the corner.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Left, take a left.

           Instead, the lady stops at the stoplight.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, I gotta go left!

           She shoves the lady and, with some struggle, manages to get 
           the door open and push her out onto the pavement.

           The car is still in drive and begins DRIFTING FORWARD into 
           the intersection. Other cars have to break hard and swerve.

           Ruth gets in the driver's seat. She has no idea how to use 
           this thing. She starts pushing buttons and pulling levers but 
           doesn't know about the pedals. 

           At 5 mph she CRASHES the car into an ATM.

           She's created quite a big scene. People on the street are 
           staring at her, some shouting to the best of their ability.
                                 TEEN
                 (at Ruth, angry)
                        I got a B!

                                 FLOWER SELLER
                 (at Ruth, angry)
                        Love tulips!

           They start coming towards her, forming a crowd.

           Ruth can't figure out how to open the car door so she just 
           jumps over it (it's a convertible) and runs down the street.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth rounds the corner and SMACKS RIGHT INTO DAVE 3'S BACK. 
           She flops to the ground.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh now! Are you ok?

           He helps her up, she tries to compose herself.

                                 RUTH
                        I don't know.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Are you, are you following me?

                                 RUTH
                        Buddy you're following me.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Was I? I don't think so.

                                 RUTH
                        Hard to say, isn't it?

                                 DAVE 3
                        But really, are you ok? Do you need 
                        something.

                                 RUTH
                        I think I am. 

                                 DAVE 3
                        Sorry, I haven't had my coffee 
                        today.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah me neither.

           Dave considers saying a polite goodbye, but then...
                                 DAVE 3
                        Can I buy you a coffee? As an 
                        apology for breaking your solar 
                        plexus just there.

                                 RUTH
                        No, no, that's ok.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Please? It would really make me 
                        feel better.

                                 RUTH
                        Well sure alright, if you insist.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh here's a place, right here.

           They head for the corner coffee shop. While Dave is holding 
           the door for Ruth he takes a hard look at Ruth's face.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to say this and I don't 
                        want you to think I'm running some 
                        kind of scam on you or anything, 
                        but I think you were in my dream 
                        last night.

                                 RUTH
                        Get in line, buddy.

           He laughs.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The BARISTA is surreptitiously replacing fake scones with 
           real scones.

           Dave 3 and Ruth sit on a sofa drinking coffees, their backs 
           to a large window. Dave 3 is mid-story.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I knew it had salt in it of course 
                        but I wasn't expecting it to have 
                        such a distinct aroma. 

                                 RUTH
                        That's that sea air I've been 
                        reading about.

           Outside, a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER walk by, staring at Ruth. 
                                 DAVE 3
                        It's really nice. In the midwest 
                        all we have is lakes, and those 
                        suckers can sneak up on you. You 
                        turn a corner and out of the blue, 
                        BAM, there's a lake you weren't 
                        expecting. I like that the ocean 
                        warns you in advance, gives you a 
                        little notice. 

                                 RUTH
                        Like hey I'm a significant body of 
                        water over here.

           They laugh. Dave gets an idea.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Were you maybe on the Daddy and Me 
                        group trip to the zoo last Tuesday?

                                 RUTH
                        No. Not a daddy.

                                 DAVE 3
                        And you didn't go to U of M, right?

                                 RUTH
                        I don't think so. Because I don't 
                        know what that is.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Dang, well we must've met somewhere 
                        before. I don't look familiar to 
                        you?

                                 RUTH
                        You do, actually. But I think you 
                        might just have that kind of face. 
                        No offense.

                                 DAVE 3
                        None taken. You ever have this 
                        problem, like a dream so vivid you 
                        think it really happened? And then 
                        I spend all week upset about an 
                        argument I never had.

                                 RUTH
                        I don't have dreams. I mean I never 
                        remember them.

                                 DAVE 3
                        That's kind of sad, isn't it.
           A server walks over with a scone.

                                 SERVER
                        Sorry this took so long.

           Outside the window, a MAN collides into ANOTHER MAN and they 
           fall to the ground.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Are you from around here?

                                 RUTH
                        No, I'm just visiting. From 
                        Chicago.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh Chicago, I love Chicago. So you 
                        know about the sneaky lakes.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. I'm an expert on sneaky. I'm 
                        in town here visiting family.

                                 DAVE 3
                        How's that going for you?

                                 RUTH
                        It's good to see them, it's so good 
                        to see them in person and talk to 
                        them. Which I never get to do. But 
                        also it's difficult.

                                 DAVE 3
                        You look like you wanna talk about 
                        it.

                                 RUTH
                        They maybe don't approve of some of 
                        the things I've chosen to do, my 
                        family. I just want to live my 
                        life, you know. I just want things 
                        the way I want them.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I understand exactly what you're 
                        saying.

                                 RUTH
                        You do?
                                 DAVE 3
                        Yeah. I don't know about your exact 
                        situation, but I feel like I have 
                        to pretend to be the person my 
                        family expects me to be, instead of 
                        the person that I think I am?

                                 RUTH
                        Right. And it's not fair.

                                 DAVE 3
                        In their defense, they believe I'm
                        a better person than I do. So I'm
                        forced to act like less of a
                        schmuck.

                                 RUTH
                        Well I have no expectations for 
                        you, so feel free to be full 
                        schmuck for at least the rest of 
                        this coffee.

           He chuckles.

                                 DAVE 3
                        And most of the time I'm not even 
                        conscious of what I'm doing. Like 
                        Mallory, my wife, gets this great 
                        opportunity, I'm so happy for her, 
                        but then, I'm like where am I? We 
                        moved to California? I guess I 
                        chose this? It's so easy to be 
                        swept into the flow.

                                 RUTH
                        Stupid flow always pushing me 
                        around.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I gotta remind myself: Dave, it's 
                        all good. We're here together. 
                        You've got someone to live through 
                        it all with. That's what matters. 

           Ruth's eyes are welling up. Dave sips his coffee.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Is it... Are you okay?

           Ruth blinks and is surprised to notice a tear on her cheek.

                                 RUTH
                        What the. That's embarrassing.
                                 DAVE 3
                        It's alright.

                                 RUTH
                        I didn't even realize I had 
                        functioning tear ducts. This has 
                        never happened.

           Dave laughs.

                                 DAVE 3
                        It's none of my business. But since 
                        I happen to be a complete stranger, 
                        you can feel free to... spill the 
                        beans.

           Ruth smiles, trying to blink away her tears.

                                 RUTH
                        I was just thinking of an old 
                        friend. She's been gone for a long 
                        time. I think I forgot the feeling 
                        of her until right now. You're the 
                        first person I've been able to talk 
                        to.

           He offers a napkin. She sniffs and wipes the tear away.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I'm just as surprised as you!

           He checks his watch.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You have to go? You probably have 
                        places to be.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Well, I'm unemployed, I've got no 
                        friends in this town, and, the 
                        babysitter doesn't like me around.
                 (then)
                        But you're on the way to see your 
                        family.

           Ruth looks at her watch-less wrist.

                                 RUTH
                        I've got some time...
                        I've never seen a beach.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Let's do it.
                                 RUTH
                        Really? You don't mind? Ok, how do 
                        we get there?

           He stands up.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Follow your nose.

           They have a laugh as they head for the door.

           Behind them, a non-person DUDE pokes his head out from under 
           the couch cushion they were just on. A bunch of other non-
           people peer out from behind him.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Ruth and Dave 3 walk along the rocky beach. They watch a sail 
           boat whiz across the expanse.

                                 RUTH
                        Look at that one go! That looks 
                        like a fun one.

                                 DAVE 3
                        My wife is a big sailor. When she 
                        was a teenager she was captain of 
                        the sailing team. She took me out 
                        once when we visited her parents in 
                        Nice. I threw up the whole time.

                                 RUTH
                        I've been on a boat before too. We 
                        have a lot in common.

           He laughs.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (re: the beach)
                        So what do you think... 

                                 RUTH
                        I think I keep chasing the things 
                        that I think I want, the things 
                        that are going to make me feel like 
                        a real person. Only as soon as I 
                        get something I realize I'm not 
                        even close, it's not enough.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I meant the beach.
                                 RUTH
                        Oh. It's nice and loud, like a 
                        highway.

                                 DAVE 3
                        But I get what you're saying. And 
                        the more stuff you absorb into your 
                        little world, the more complicated 
                        it gets.

           Dave considers going deep on this thread, then he does.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        I have this memory from when I was 
                        a kid, a few weeks after my parents 
                        told me they were getting divorced. 
                        I was sitting in the car, with my 
                        Dad and we were just about to drive 
                        somewhere. And before he turned on 
                        the car, he paused for second and 
                        he said, “Life’s a bitch and then 
                        you die”. And I remember thinking 
                        like, “what? what does he mean?” I 
                        had no clue, because even though I 
                        was a sad kid at the time and knew 
                        life wasn't perfect, I had never 
                        had to confront any of the really 
                        hard stuff in life. Not yet.

           Ruth is having a revelation as Dave carries on.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        So now, when I’m totally in over my 
                        head and depleted or just lost... I 
                        try to remember that moment of 
                        hearing him say that, and how nice 
                        it was just being completely 
                        oblivious.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah, that's definitely wrong.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Haha. What?

                                 RUTH
                        Well what you're saying is that you 
                        want to go back to the nothing, but 
                        that's gotta be wrong. If you don't 
                        do the pain, you don't get the 
                        opposite, right? The good stuff? 
                        You know how empty you'd be if you 
                        stayed oblivious?
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I can tell you it's not pretty. Am 
                        I making sense here?

                                 DAVE 3
                 (unsure)
                        Huh.

                                 RUTH
                        That dad bitch moment was you 
                        waking up. That's the good stuff, 
                        buddy. The meat of life.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (into it)
                        Huh.

           A frisbee lands next to them.

                                 FRISBEE THROWER (O.S.)
                        Little help?

                                 DAVE 3
                        I got you!

           He bends down to pick up the frisbee and in that moment a 
           half dozen other frisbees fly at Ruth. She dodges each of 
           them silently, unbeknownst to Dave 3.

           Dave throws the frisbee back, but it catches some wind and 
           blows way left.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Whoops!

           He runs to try again. A BEACH CHICK appears next to Ruth.

                                 BEACH CHICK
                 (whispering)
                        You need to leave now. You're 
                        disturbing Dave's life. 

                                 RUTH
                        Oh hi there.

                                 BEACH CHICK
                 (whispering)
                        We know who you are.

                                 RUTH
                        Well, nice to meet you.

           Dave turns back to Ruth. The Beach Chick doesn't know what to 
           do, so she flashes the peace sign and dives into the water.
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        This is a very friendly area.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh geez, what time is it? I 
                        actually do have somewhere to be 
                        now.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh yeah, I'm very late too.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Mallory, my wife, she's got a game. 
                        I said I'd be there. Wait, do you 
                        like baseball?

                                 RUTH
                        I love baseball.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh then maybe this will impress 
                        you. Mallory's on the Missiles.

           He waits for a reaction. 

                                 RUTH
                        She's on a missiles?

                                 DAVE 3
                        The Santa Cruz Missiles. She's the 
                        shortstop. Major league baseball?

                                 RUTH
                        Oh right, that's very... 
                        impressive. I love baseball.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Are you just being polite?

                                 RUTH
                        I don't even know how to be polite, 
                        ya dirtbag.

           He laughs.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Alright, alright. Would you want to 
                        come to the game? Unless you have 
                        to go meet your family.

                                 RUTH
                        No, I mean, not for a while.
                                 DAVE 3
                        So you want to? I have good seats 
                        because I'm a player's wife.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah!

           INT. BASEBALL STADIUM, VIP ENTRANCE - DAY

           Dave 3, with Ruth behind him, shows his tickets at the 
           security entrance and walks through the turnstile. The 
           SECURITY GUARD stops Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Um Dave, Dave!

           Dave turns back to her.

                                 DAVE
                        She's my plus one.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Need ID.

           Dave waves his VIP pass at the guard. He ushers Ruth inside.

                                 DAVE
                        Here ya go. She's my guest.

           INT. BASEBALL STADIUM, HALLWAY - DAY

           Dave leads Ruth through a windy hallway in the back of the 
           stadium. A nicely dressed OLDER COUPLE bump into them at one 
           of the turns.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Oh hi!

                                 DAVE 3
                        Miranda, Jake. How's it going?

           Dave 3 walks around the corner, chatting with the couple, 
           leaving Ruth alone for a moment. 

           Suddenly two PAINTED SPORTS FANS appear in front of her. They 
           LUNGE at her. She scampers to catch up with Dave 3.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        We'll see you in the stands.

           The couple walks off. Dave 3 turns back to Ruth.
                                 DAVE 3
                        Sorry about that.

                                 RUTH
                        You seem like a decent Dave. What's 
                        your secret?

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh it's easy. You, uh, you just 
                        accept that your life is completely 
                        meaningless and nothing you do will 
                        ever matter and then... here's the 
                        trick, you just smile at everyone 
                        for exactly one second.

                                 RUTH
                        One second of smiling. No more, or 
                        you're a creep. No less, or you're 
                        a jerk.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Exactly. Wow, how'd you learn all 
                        the Dave trade secrets?

                                 RUTH
                        I'm well studied.

           INT. BASEBALL STADIUM, CONCESSIONS AREA - DAY

           Ruth and Dave 3 enter the main food hall.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Our seats are through there, I'm 
                        gonna make a quick pit stop at the
                        restroom. I'll meet you right back
                        here.

                                 RUTH 
                        Okay.

           He leaves for the men's room. As soon as he's out of view, 
           FOUR NON-PEOPLE in the crowd turn to Ruth menacingly. 

           Ruth sees she's about to get pummeled and runs after Dave 3.

           INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS  

           Ruth dashes into the men's room and is immediately sorry she 
           did. There are weiners everywhere!
           Luckily Dave 3's back is to her. She crouches behind a urinal 
           stall trying to will herself to be invisible until he zips up 
           and exits. 

           She follows him out.

           INT. BASEBALL STADIUM, CONCESSIONS AREA - CONTINUOUS 

           Dave 3 turns around to catch Ruth coming out of the bathroom.    

                                 DAVE 3
                        Were you just in the men's room?   

                                 RUTH
                        Ha ha. That'd be weird.

           INT/EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM, STANDS - DAY

           Ruth and Dave 3 walk through the crowded stands to their 
           seats. The game is about to start in the packed stadium as 
           the Star Spangled Banner plays. 

                                 RUTH
                        Wow, everyone must be in here.

           Dave 3 finds their seats in the VIP section right behind 
           third base.

                                 DAVE 3
                        We're over here.

           Dave 3 shakes hands with a MAN and WOMAN wearing Missiles 
           team gear sitting behind them in VIP. 

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Hey, how's it going? Nice to see 
                        you.

           He turns back to Ruth.

                                 DAVE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that, I'd introduce you 
                        but I don't want to get trapped 
                        talking to them all game.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh yeah, I hate that. Hey Dave, 
                        How'd you get to be you?

                                 DAVE 3
                        Now that's something I actually 
                        think about all the time.

                        Especially since my daughter was 
                        born. Just nothing, and then a 
                        bunch of cells and then more, and 
                        then more, and then boom — she's a 
                        tiny person. I really have no idea 
                        why it all works. And you know what 
                        I think? Nobody deserves it. Life. 
                        Not me, not anybody. This random 
                        assortment of atoms. It just 
                        happens.

                                 RUTH
                        You get born and then here you are.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Like, what a miracle it is that my 
                        body doesn't disintegrate into a 
                        billion little pieces at any 
                        moment, let alone motor function, 
                        let alone walking around eating 
                        chicken fried steak!

           THEME MUSIC plays and the announcer lists the players' names 
           as they run onto the field. The team is co-ed, though 
           otherwise looks just like regular pro baseball.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        And introducing your Santa Cruz 
                        Missiles! Julio Mcevers, Marge 
                        Odegee, Moishe Ray Banananana....

                                 RUTH
                        This is fun. Go Sports!

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Mallory Renault.

                                 DAVE 3
                        That's her. Woo! Go Mallory!

           Ruth looks around at the stadium. She notices that many of 
           the fans are not watching the field but are GLARING AT HER. 

           Dave 3 notices too and looks back behind him to try to figure 
           out what these people are looking at. 

           The organ plays CHARGE and the game begins. The crowd cheers.

           INT/EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM, STANDS - LATER

           The game is heating up, fans are standing and cheering.
                                 HOT DOG VENDOR (O.S.)
                        Red hots! Get your red hots! Iced 
                        cold beer!

                                 DAVE 3
                        Want a dog?

                                 RUTH
                        Yes.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (calling out)
                        I'll take two hot dogs over here.

                                 RUTH
                        But what I really want is 
                        everything.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (calling out)
                        One with everything, one just with 
                        ketchup.

           Mallory catches a ball - third out. Everyone cheers.

                                 WOMAN SITTING BEHIND THEM
                        Way to go, that's your woman!

                                 DAVE 3
                        Yeah! Go Missiles!

                                 RUTH
                        But only one person can have it. 
                        And it's not me.

           A box of food is passed through the stands.

                                 DAVE 3
                 (calling out)
                        This is only one, I asked for two. 
                        Sir? Sir? Where's the one with 
                        everything? Excuse me? Hello?

           On the field, the Missiles are at bat. The crowd around Ruth 
           and Dave 3 start booing and heckling the pitcher. It's loud, 
           Dave can hardly hear Ruth at all.

                                 WOMAN IN CROWD (O.C.)
                        Hey Pitcher, are you pac man? Walka 
                        Walka Walka!

                                 RUTH
                        But why not? Why can't I be the me?
                                 MAN SITTING BEHIND THEM
                        I've seen snakes with better arms!

                                 MAN IN CROWD (O.C.)
                        We want a pitcher not a glass of 
                        water!

           The Missiles fans TURN TO FACE RUTH, now YELLING AT HER 
           instead of the pitcher. It's a menacing display.

                                 HECKLER
                        Try throwing it with your eyes open 
                        this time!

                                 HECKLER 2
                        Hey, how 'bout some sauce on that 
                        meatball!

           Dave 3 is growing concerned at the heckling.

                                 DAVE 3
                        It's a real rowdy crowd today.

                                 WOMAN IN CROWD
                        Boo!

                                 MAN SITTING BEHIND THEM
                        Boo!

           They're all booing Ruth. Dave 3 looks at her, "what the?"

           A heckler just a few rows away turns to Ruth. IT'S SALLY.

                                 SALLY
                        You stink!

                                 RUTH
                        Sally?

                                 SALLY
                        I've seen better arms on a beanbag 
                        chair!

           There's a CRACK of the bat and a ball whizzes into the 
           stands, KNOCKING RUTH RIGHT IN THE HEAD. 

           The crowd cheers!

           Ruth is knocked unconscious. Dave 3, panicked, tries to help 
           her amid the noise. 

                                 DAVE 3
                        Ruth! Ruth! Are you ok?
           Out on the field, Mallory runs the bases - apparently it's a 
           home run! Fireworks! Music!

           EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The noise of the stadium blends with the chaos of SIRENS and 
           FLASHING LIGHTS in the parking lot. A team of EMT's load 
           Ruth's unconscious body into the back of an ambulance. 

           Dave 3 fights through the scrum of rubberneckers to talk to 
           the POLICE.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Can't I can ride with her? I'm her 
                        friend.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You'll have to meet her at the 
                        hospital.

           INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The door slams shut and Ruth is alone with the two EMTs. She 
           slowly comes to. 

           She starts to sit up groggily. The EMT pushes her back down.

                                 EMT
                        Oh no you don't.

           The EMTS flip open a trapdoor below the van. They each grab 
           and arm and a leg and toss Ruth into the tunnel.

           JELLO HOLDING AREA

           Ruth is trapped in lime jello. Outside of her mold, some 
           huge, unseen animal STOMPS by. The jello shakes.

           She takes a bite. It's not bad, actually.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Meanwhile, Ruth's "body" is in a coma in a hospital bed. Dave 
           3 is sitting at her bedside with Mallory, who is growing 
           impatient. Dave is obviously troubled.

                                 MALLORY
                        Davey, the babysitter is only 
                        booked until 6.
                                 DAVE 3
                        Can we just wait a minute? Until 
                        her family gets here?

           The DOCTOR comes in.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hi folks, sorry to interrupt.

                                 DAVE 3
                        That's ok, Doctor. Any positive 
                        news?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Actually I'm not the attending 
                        today. I was just hoping I could 
                        get an autograph? My kid's a huge 
                        Missiles fan.

                                 MALLORY
                        Of course.

           She signs the doctor's RX pad. That doctor leaves, passing a 
           second doctor, who we recognize as Shelly the TV Weatherman.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh hi Shelly.

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                 (big smile)
                        Hey Joanny, great haircut.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Thanks!

           Shelly turns to Dave 3, composing himself soberly.

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        You must be the friend who brought 
                        her in? That was very kind of you.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Hi, yeah.

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        Unfortunately, the patient is all 
                        but gone. Her brain is hemorrhaging 
                        badly. It's very, very unlikely she 
                        would ever be able to recover.

                                 MALLORY
                        She'll never wake up. 
                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        For insurance reasons, doctors 
                        never say never. But you catch my 
                        drift.

                                 DAVE 3
                        I'm really surprised none of her 
                        family has shown up looking for 
                        her. She was in town visiting 
                        family.

                                 MALLORY
                        I guess they did not care about 
                        her.

                                 DAVE 3
                        She seemed like one of the good 
                        ones, you know?

                                 MALLORY
                        Or she made them up? I don't know. 
                        You don't even know this person. 
                        She could have been a serial rapist 
                        for all you know.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Sheesh, Mal. I thought she was a 
                        very nice lady.

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        I'll just need you to sign here.

           The doctor presents a clipboard to Dave 3.

                                 DAVE 3
                        What's this now?

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        Since there's no family to speak 
                        of, you've been designated the next 
                        of kin. So officially, Dave, you're 
                        the one making the decision.

                                 MALLORY
                        The decision to end her life.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh boy, ok, wow, I wasn't expecting 
                        to- well, she did say that she 
                        hates doing nothing. I don't think 
                        she'd be very happy being stuck in 
                        that bed, in limbo. But on the 
                        other hand, well- can I just take 
                        some time to think this through?
               MALLORY
                                SHELLY THE DOCTOR
           The babysitter.
                            No.

                                 DAVE 3
                        Oh, ok. 

           Dave 3 takes a deep breath and a long stare at Ruth. He is 
           torn up. He signs the paper.

                                 SHELLY THE DOCTOR
                        Say nighty night.

           The doctor reaches over and removes Ruth's IV and respirator. 
           He switches off the heart monitor just as it starts to 
           FLATLINE.

                                 DAVE 3
                        It was nice meeting you.

           Mallory takes Dave 3's arm and gently guides him out. 

           Once they're gone, Shelly pulls out one more secret valve 
           which DEFLATES Ruth's fake body.

           WORSE THAN NO WORLD

           Ruth has eaten her way out of the Jello. It has made her skin 
           green. She's very full. Two gigantic JELLO TECHNICIANS escort 
           her, like security guards.

           NO WORLD - TIMECLOCK ROOM

           Ruth waddles through, flanked by the Techs. She passes some 
           of her former Blower colleagues, who stare, aghast.

                                 HOMELESS LADY / DAVE 2'S MOM
                 (whispering)
                        They caught her, the Ruth!

           NO WORLD - ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ruth waddle-charges into the Administrator's office, a 
           surprisingly bland cubicle. The Administrator looks up from 
           some paperwork.

                                 RUTH
                        I'd like to file a complaint.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You!?
                                 RUTH
                        I was deliberately attacked for no 
                        good reason.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Oh I know what you've been doing. 
                        You are the complainee not the 
                        complainer.

                                 RUTH
                        And I was prevented from eating a 
                        hot dog. That Dave was going to buy 
                        for me.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You were not supposed to be 
                        anywhere near Dave. You were not 
                        supposed to be doing any of this. 
                        You've thrown the whole thing way 
                        off course, again. It's been very 
                        inconvenient for me.

                                 RUTH
                        Well it's all about you, is it?!

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        No. This is what you don't seem to 
                        understand. It's all about Dave.

           The Administrator opens the cabinet behind her and pulls out 
           a pair of white cotton gloves.

                                 RUTH
                        What are those for?

           Then the Administrator shoves the cabinet out of the way, 
           opening up another room behind her office.

           NO WORLD - RECYCLING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There's a large SHREDDING MACHINE, like a giant plastic 
           version of a wood chipper. The Administrator flips it on and 
           it makes a loud WHIR.

                                 RUTH
                        What's that for?

           With one hand, the Administrator picks up Ruth by the ankle 
           and guides her into the big slicer machine.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Don't I get a last meal? It doesn't 
                        have to be the hot dog.
           She starts to be CHOPPED INTO BITS from the feet up.     
           Ruth-chips shoot out the other end of the machine.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        I don't know what went wrong when 
                        we built you.

           1/4 chopped...

                                 RUTH
                        Can I ask you something? I've been 
                        thinking about it and I can't 
                        figure it out.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You were never supposed to be 
                        curious.

           The Administrator turns the chipper up to 10.

                                 RUTH
                 (louder)
                        Where do you make the Daves?

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You were never supposed to have 
                        feelings.

           Mostly chopped...

                                 RUTH
                        I can't hear you!

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You were a fluke, the bad kind.

           As she's decimated...

                                 RUTH
                        Where do Daves come from!?
                 (then)
                        Well, nuts.

           Ruth gets in one last epic eye-roll before she is totally 
           chopped up.

           "Superman" by Barbara Streisand plays. 

           The final Ruth-chips are shot into a bin and the 
           Administrator flips off the machine. 

           She picks up the bin, which resembles Dave 1's paint chips, 
           and pours it into a second machine. She hits another switch. 
           This one is a PULVERIZER. Two large pounders PUMMEL the chips 
           into dust.

           The Administrator sweeps it up into a wheelbarrow.

           NO WORLD - PLANT ROOM

           A TECH wheels what's left of Ruth into the plant room. She 
           sprinkles the Ruth-mulch on the plants.

           A PLUME OF DUST floats up into the air. The camera gets 
           closer and closer to the dust, MAGNIFYING 400X until we can 
           see a SINGLE RUTH CELL. 

           CELLULAR WORLD

           This curly, plucky, zygote-type Ruth Cell floats through the 
           magnified cellular No-World, passing by unidentifiable blocks 
           of colors, textures, and squiggles.

           She goes left, pauses, then goes right.

           She goes up to a giant paramecium, and then goes around it. 

           She goes up and up and up and then IN, right at us.

           We spin around following the Ruth Cell at high speeds 
           traversing cellular chaos: bands of color stretch into 
           infinity, spider-blobs whiz by, a vibrating prism refracts 
           light beams.

           It's a long journey for such a small being. It's outside of 
           time and inside of space.

           EXT. WOMB - CONTINUOUS

           The Ruth Cell zips right up next to a gigantic semi-
           translucent pink wall. She SLAMS INTO IT. Nothing.

           She slams again. Still nothing.

           A third time... and she breaks through the barrier!

           INT. WOMB - CONTINUOUS

           A few dozen SPERM are trying their darndest to get into an 
           EGG. One of them, the DAVE SPERM, nuzzles its way in. The 
           rest fizzle out and go limp.

           The Ruth Cell is watching.
           The DAVE EGG swells, getting bigger, and then with mitosis - 
           POP - divides into two cells.

           Another SWELL, another POP, and it's four Dave Cells.

           The Ruth cell starts to divide as well. POP and SPLIT. And 
           then again. The Ruth Cells are splitting and growing more 
           quickly than the Dave Cells, until she dwarfs him in size.

           Then the Ruth Cell cluster starts to grow again, but instead 
           of dividing it turns into a Pac-Man shape and CHOMPS THE DAVE 
           CLUSTER.

           Thus, the Ruth Cells have absorbed the Dave cells.

           The Ruth cell continues to grow. The cells start to form an 
           embryo. A brain forms. It's all very abstract. 

           Then there's a foot.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The hospital room is full of extras we have seen before, now 
           reassigned a DOCTOR, NURSES and a MOTHER giving birth.

           The Mother is breathing and pushing and breathing and 
           pushing. And then... Baby Ruth is born. 

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        It's a beautiful baby... girl?

           Babs's "Superman" hits the orchestral high point.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           A NURSE carries the newborn Ruth into the nursery.

           INT. HOSPITAL NURSERY - CONTINUOUS

           A room full of silent NON-BABIES. Just before the door opens 
           they all spring to life, with a CHORUS OF CRYING. 

           Baby Ruth is carried in. 

           Close on Baby Ruth as she is laid down, screaming with life.

                                      THE END.
