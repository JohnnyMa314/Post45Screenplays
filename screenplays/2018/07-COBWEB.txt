           Once upon a time

           There was a spooky old house

           That sat alone on a hill

           With no neighbors around

           To hear the screams

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP
           INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           PETER (8) opens his eyes

           He heard something

           He’s lying in BED, and it’s dark, and this time 

           He definitely heard something

           So he waits

           But all he hears now is the HOWL of the wind outside

           And the CLOCK by his bed

           Nothing more - silence

           He closes his eyes and lets the clock lull him back to sleep

           TICK

                TOCK

                     TICK

                          TOCK

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           No

           He heard it

           Peter sits up in bed

           He stares unblinking at THE WALL - at the peeling wallpaper

           He then turns to the opposite wall - to the WINDOW

           He crawls out of bed

           He tiptoes to the window, the floor creaking with every step

           He looks out into his backyard

           At the GARDEN

           At the SHED
           At the GNARLED TREE and the SWING that hangs from its branch

           The swing GROANS as it sways in the wind, but it does not tap

           Peter turns his attention to the TOY CHEST in the corner

           To the grinning JACK IN THE BOX

           He creeps to the corner - cautiously reaches his hand out to 
           the smiling CLOWN protruding from the box and 

           Flicks it

           The clown TWANGS back on forth on its spring, but it does not 
           tap

           He looks to his CLOSET - to its closed door

           He inches closer - opens it and jumps

           A RED BALL falls out and rolls across the floor, but it does 
           not tap

           Peter can’t deny it any longer

           He turns back to The Wall - to the peeling wall paper

           He sucks in his breath

           Tiptoes to The Wall

           When he has summoned enough bravery

           He places his ear against the wallpaper, and with his finger 

           TAPS

           And waits - nothing

           He exhales 

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           Peter gasps

           He stumbles backwards and falls

           He scrambles back to his feet and sprints out of his room and 
           into the 
           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Where he runs past the BATHROOM 

           Past the BOOK SHELF 

           Past the STAIRCASE 

           And to the DOOR at the end of the hall

           He stops - his hand hovers above the knob

           Finally - he opens the door into his 

           PARENT’S ROOM

           EYES stare back Peter, illuminated by the hallway light

           THE CAT glares at him from the foot of the bed

           He ignores it and slowly, cautiously walks to the side of the 
           bed where 

           His MOTHER sleeps

           Peter gently tugs on her bedsheet

           But she remains asleep

           So he places his hand on her shoulder and shakes her 

           Finally, she opens her eyes and sees her son silhouetted by 
           the hallway light

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Can I sleep with you?

           Silence

                                 MOTHER
                        What’s wrong?

           Peter hesitates 

           He looks to the hallway, then back to his Mother

                                 PETER
                        I heard something.
                                 MOTHER
                        You what?

           On the other side of the bed, his FATHER stirs

                                 FATHER
                        Peter?

                                 MOTHER
                        He says he heard something.

           Father reaches for the CLOCK by his bedside

           He groans when he sees the time

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What did you hear, Peter?

           But Peter doesn’t answer

           Father turns to face him

                                 FATHER
                        Well?

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter.

           He shuffles his feet - hangs his head

           Father’s had enough - he lays back down

           Mother too

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t hear anything.

           She lays her head on the pillow and closes her eyes

                                 PETER
                        But--

                                 MOTHER
                        Go to bed...

           And with that, she’s already asleep

           Peter’s shoulder’s sink

           INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter goes back into his room
           But this time, he leaves the door open - the light from the 
           hall falling onto his pillow

           He tiptoes back to his bed - crawls under the blankets

           Turns his back to The Wall

           It takes all his strength to close his eyes and keep them 
           shut

           The room is silent once again, save for the steady

           TICK

                TOCK

                     TICK

                          TOCK

           But then

                                                                     TAP

                                 PETER
                        No.

                                                                     TAP

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not real.

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           He pulls the covers over his head.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You’re only my imagination.

           And then nothing - silence

           Until

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...

                                                                 MORNING

           Morning light floods through the window
           And as the clock strikes 7:00am the ALARM rings

           But there’s no one to turn it off

           Footsteps storm down the hallway and

           Mother - in her nightgown - pops her head inside Peter’s room

                                 MOTHER
                        What are you--

           But all she sees is an empty bed stripped of its blankets

           INT. BATHROOM

           Mother stands in the doorway of the bathroom

           She looks down at the BATHTUB

           At Peter curled up inside, wrapped in his sheets

           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           Peter stands outside his closet, his Mother kneeling before 
           him buttoning his shirt

           He can’t help but stare nervously at The Wall - at it’s 
           peeling wallpaper

           Mother catches him

                                 MOTHER
                        The circles under your eyes are 
                        getting worse.

           She ties his BOW TIE

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay to be scared.
                        This is an old house. 
                        There are bound to be bumps in the 
                        night.
                        Even rats in the walls.

           She looks back at The Wall

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        But anything else...
                        Any ghouls or ghosts or goblins...

           Back at Peter
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        They’re all in your head.
                        You understand that, don’t you?

           He hesitates

           Nods

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always had an active 
                        imagination.
                        Such a mind for fantasy.

           She stands

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Put on your shoes.
                        You don’t want to be late.

           She walks out the door into the hallway

           Peter reaches into his closet and retrieves his shoes

           He sits on the floor and wrestles them on

           But he doesn’t take his eyes off The Wall

           Once his shoes are on his feet, he takes a deep breath

           He takes a step towards The Wall

           Then another and another

           He places his ear against the wallpaper and TAPS

           Waits

                                 MOTHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Peter!

           He leaps out of his skin

           Runs out the door into the hallway

           EXT. THE HOUSE - MORNING

           The spooky old HOUSE sits atop a lonely HILL

           Even in the daylight it looks haunted

           Autumn leaves dance in the wind, blown from the branches of 
           the back yard’s gnarled tree
           Mother holds the CAT in her arms as she watches Peter trudge 
           down the hill to the

           SCHOOL BUS waiting at the road

           INT. SCHOOL BUS

           Watching Peter from inside the bus is BRIAN (8)

           His eyes follow Peter as he gets on the bus and makes his way 
           to the back

           Surrounded by the other children, Peter in his antiquated, 
           overly formal clothing is an anachronism

           So it is no wonder he’s a target

           As Peter passes Brian’s seat

           Brian sticks out his leg

           Peter trips and falls

           The whole bus erupts in laughter

           Peter looks up at Brian and Brian looks down at Peter

           Neither says a word 

           Peter climbs to his feet and continues to the back

           He takes the empty seat in the last row

           He ignores the laughter, avoids the stares

           Looks out the window back at his spooky old house

           Wipes his eyes

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           The classroom is dark until

           MISS DEVINE (30s) walks in the door and turns on the lights

           Shopping bags in hand, she surveys the classroom before 
           getting to work

           She mounts a fake SPIDERWEB in the corner

           Places a stuffed BLACK CAT on her desk
           She cuts construction-paper GHOSTS and hangs them on the wall

           And finally - places a piece of CANDY on every desk

           When she reaches the final desk - last row, furthest corner

           She stops - considers for a moment

           Lays down an extra piece

                                                                   LATER

           STUDENTS spill into her classroom

           After the initial horde has gone to their cubbies and run to 
           their desks to claim their candy

           Peter straggles in

           Miss Devine smiles warmly from her desk

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Good morning, Peter.

           He doesn’t acknowledge her

           She watches as he solemnly deposits his bag and coat in his 
           cubby and goes to his desk in the last row, furthest corner

           She watches him take his seat and discover the two candies 

           She watches him scan the classroom, see that everyone else 
           has only one

           And even though his gloomy expression never changes

           Miss Devine grins to herself

                                                                   LATER

           Miss Devine wears a WITCH HAT and stands in the middle of a

           CIRCLE of students

           She mimes stirring a cauldron, and the children do the same

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Double, double, toil and...

                                 THE CLASS
                        Trouble!

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Fire burn and cauldron...
                                 THE CLASS
                        Bubble!

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        By the pricking of my...

                                 THE CLASS
                        Thumb!

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Something wicked this way...

                                 THE CLASS
                        Comes!

           She claps

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Ahhh, you’re so scary!

           The class collectively giggles

           She glances at Peter sitting outside the circle, his face in 
           his hand

           He’s asleep

                                                                   LATER

           Miss Devine walks around the classroom

           The children paint with water colors

           Peter only uses BLACK

                                                                   LATER

           Outside the WINDOW the children take recess

           Meanwhile, Miss Devine is in an empty classroom

           She hangs the children’s WATERCOLOR PICTURES on the wall

           She hangs a VAMPIRE - a MUMMY - a WEREWOLF

           But as she’s hanging the next one - she furrows her brow

           It’s almost entirely BLACK, save for the very bottom

           A BOY in bed, and scrawled above his head:

                                        HELP ME

           Miss Devine studies the picture
           Takes it with her to the window

           She looks outside and scans the PLAYGROUND

           She looks past the children on the slide, jumping hopscotch, 
           playing tag

           And to the far end of the grounds

           Where Peter sits alone, clutching his knees to his chest

                                                                   LATER

           The children swarm their cubbies

           But Peter waits outside the chaos

           When the crowd has left, he retrieves his coat and bookbag

           As he heads to the door

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Peter?

           He turns to Miss Devine sitting at her desk with her hands 
           folded

           She smiles warmly, but he knows its forced

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        May I have a word?

           He looks longingly at the door

           But approaches her desk anyway

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        How is everything? At home, I mean.

           He shrugs

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Are you getting enough sleep?

           He shrugs again

           New tactic

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Have you thought about what you’re 
                        going to be for Halloween?

           He shakes his head “No”
                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay. Me neither.

           She places his PICTURE on the desk between them

           He turns to see the wall where every other picture is hanging

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I really liked your picture. 
                        You’re very talented.

           He shuffles his feet

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I was wondering though - what’s 
                        going on here?

                                 PETER
                        It’s just a picture.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Oh I know, I know - I only mean...

           Her smile falters, but for only a moment

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Who needs help?

           He says nothing

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Does the boy in this picture need 
                        help?

           Miss Devine reaches her hand across the desk, but Peter 
           doesn’t take it

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Why is the boy asking for help?

                                 PETER
                        He’s not.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        But it says--

           He points to the black

                                 PETER
                        She is.

           He looks to the door
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to miss the bus.

           Miss Devine nods

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Okay. 

           Peter turns on his heel and marches out the door

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget to bring a pumpkin!

           EXT. THE BACK YARD - EVENING

           The perfect PUMPKIN sits still attached to its vine

           Peter stands above it, his Father waiting at the edge of the 
           GARDEN

                                 FATHER 
                        Is that the one?

           Peter surveys the rest of the pumpkins

           He nods

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        All right then.

           Father reaches into his pocket and removes a KNIFE

           Father trudges into the garden, crouches down next to Peter

           He starts to saw at the vine

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        You know, when I was your age, I 
                        was convinced a crocodile lived 
                        under my bed.

           He laughs and shakes his head

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe that? What would a 
                        crocodile be doing under there? It 
                        was completely irrational, but that 
                        made no difference to me - I was 
                        certain it was below me when I 
                        slept, biding its time before it 
                        could eat me whole.

           He stops sawing 
                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        But there was no crocodile, Peter. 
                        It was only my imagination.

           His face grows stern

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Being a big boy means learning to 
                        distinguish fantasy from reality.
                        And you’re a big boy, aren’t you?

           Peter shifts his weight

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 FATHER
                        I thought so.

           He’s about to return to sawing the vine, but has a thought

           Instead, he hands the knife to Peter

           Peter looks at it reluctantly

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. It won’t hurt you.

           Peter takes it

           He crouches down and saws the vine

           When he cuts through, Father musses his hair

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        That’s a big boy.

           He stands

           He starts towards the SHED

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Now come on.

           Peter follows

           INT. SHED

           Father stands in the doorway, watching Peter assess the SHELF
           Peter furrows his brow as he scans its contents

           He points, then looks back at Father

           Father nods

           Peter approaches the shelf

           Stands on his tippy-toes

           And after stretching his arms as far as they’ll go

           He retrieves a bag of RAT POISON

           He brings it back to his father

                                 FATHER
                        This oughta take care of it.

           He closes the door

                                 FATHER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        No more bumps in the night.

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           A framed FAMILY PORTRAIT hangs on the wall - Mother, Father, 
           and Peter as a baby

           The family sits under it, eating their dinner in silence, 
           their silverware scraping against the plates

           Eventually, Father clears his throat

                                 FATHER
                        We put out some poison.

                                 MOTHER
                        Mmm?

                                 FATHER
                        Peter and I.

           Mother nods

                                 MOTHER
                        For the rats?

                                 FATHER
                        Uh huh. Up high. Where the cat 
                        won’t get at it.

           They both look to Peter - so that’s settled then
           He pushes the food around on his plate

           INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           TICK

                TOCK

                     TICK

                          TOCK

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           Peter opens his eyes

           He stares unblinking at The Wall - at the peeling wallpaper 

           He waits

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           His whole body tenses, he stops breathing

           But he’s defiant - he turns around to face the window

           The shadow of the tree cast against the glass

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           He buries his head under his pillow

           And for a few moments, that seems to do the trick

           If there is any tapping, he doesn’t hear it

           But then

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...
           He heard that

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           He whimpers

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Help me...

           He’s had enough

           He bolts up and spins around

                                 PETER
                        You’re not real!

           He hurls the CLOCK at The Wall

           It shatters

           But now it’s quiet

           Peter’s shoulders rise and fall with every heaving breath

           He glares at The Wall

           He dares Her to make another sound

                                                                 MORNING

           Morning light floods through the window

           It’s 7:00am, but the room is silent

           Footsteps storm down the hallway and

           Mother peers inside

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter, it’s way past--

           She sees Peter sound asleep in bed

           She sees the broken alarm clock in pieces on the floor

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING

           A pumpkin rests next to Brian on the bus seat as he peers out 
           the window at

           Peter trudging down the hill
           He watches Peter climb onto the bus and make his way to the 
           back

           As Peter passes 

           Brian sticks out his leg

           But this time, Peter steps over it

           He glances at Brian for just a moment before continuing to 
           the last row

           He sits in the empty seat and rests the pumpkin on his lap

           He catches Brian staring back at him

           Peter ignores him and looks out the window as the bus pulls 
           away

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The desks are all moved out of the way and NEWSPAPER is 
           spread across the floor

           The children sit in a circle, each painting a face on their 
           respective PUMPKIN

           Miss Devine navigates the floor admiring their work, paying 
           compliments to various students

           She walks past Brian and notes the crude, lopsided face he’s 
           painting

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Very nice, Brian.

           She moves on 

           Peter sits outside the circle, concentrating hard

           Miss Devine kneels down next to him

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, wow!

           She looks at the big, goofy FACE Peter has painted

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        This is so great, Peter!

           Brian watches them from across the circle
                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        What’s his name?

           Peter shrugs

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        But everyone has a name.

           He considers this

                                 PETER
                        Hector.

           Miss Devine laughs

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Of course.
                        He sure looks like a Hector to me.

           She leans in close - whispers so that only he can hear

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        This one is my favorite.

           She holds a finger to her lips - Our little secret

           She stands and moves onto the next student

           Peter stares at Hector’s face, and something odd happens

           His lips curl upward

           Brian notices

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Hanging from the monkey bars, Brian is still watching Peter 
           from across the playground

           Peter is sitting at his usual spot, away from everyone else

           But he isn’t alone - he has Hector

           Hector with a smile so goofy that Peter can’t help but smile 
           back

           He’s content to simply sit there with the pumpkin between his 
           legs, giggling at his own handiwork

           Until the sound of LAUGHTER catches his attention

           Peter looks to the SLIDE - to the children playing on it
           And he gets an idea he’s never had before

           Brian watches as Peter stands and brings Hector to the SLIDE

           Once the last CHILD has gone down, Peter tucks Hector under 
           his arm

           And climbs the ladder

           When he reaches the summit, he rests Hector on his lap

           And SLIDES DOWN

           He squeals with unbridled joy the whole way down

           And when he reaches the bottom and lands on his rear

           He can’t contain his laughter

           With a new sense of purpose, he leaps to his feet with Hector 
           in his arms

           But as he’s about to reach the ladder

           He’s SHOVED from behind

           Peter flies forward - Hector sails through the air

           Peter hits the ground hard, his chin smacking the macadam

           But worse is what lies ahead of him

           He looks up to see Hector BROKEN in HALF

           Peter twists his head back

           Standing behind him, no emotion on his face, is Brian

           He remains emotionless as he circumvents Peter to Hector’s 
           remains

           And STOMPS them into mush

                                 PETER
                        Stop it!

           Peter scrambles to his feet and rushes towards Brian

           But Brian turns to face him and Peter freezes

           While Peter trembles with fury, Brian is stone faced

           Peter realizes that all the other children on the playground 
           have stopped to watch them, waiting for something to happen
           He clenches his fists

           Uses his forearm to wipe the tears welling in his eyes

           Then turns and RUNS

           The RECESS MONITOR sees Peter running off the school grounds

           She tries to chase after him - blows her WHISTLE

           INT. CLASSROOM

           Grading quizzes, Miss Devine perks up from her desk when she 
           hears the whistle blowing outside

           She bolts to the WINDOW just in time to see

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Peter!

           He disappears from the playground 

           OUTSIDE

           Peter runs

           He runs across roads

           He runs through fields

           He runs through woods

           He runs up the lonely hill

           And finally, he runs to the front door of the spooky old 
           house

           But he stops - his hand hovers above the knob

           Knowing what kind of trouble will be in store for him inside

           He instead trudges into the

           BACKYARD

           His feet crunch dead leaves as he walks past the garden

           And to the GNARLED TREE

           But as he’s about to climb onto the SWING

           He hears something, a loud noise coming from inside the house
           A WHIRRING 

           Curiosity overwhelming him, he approaches the house

           The sound gets louder and louder the closer he gets to the

           KITCHEN WINDOW

           He stands on his tippy-toes to see inside

           He sees his Mother

           She’s standing at the kitchen counter operating a BLENDER 
           full of GRAY GRUEL 

           EXT. THE ROAD

           A CAR screeches to a halt at the bottom of the hill

           Miss Devine hurries out of the vehicle

           She looks up the hill with panic in her eyes

           EXT. BACK YARD

           Peter watches as his Mother turns off the blender

           She pours the sickening concoction into a CUP

           She opens a DRAWER and removes a KNIFE

           With both in hand, she starts to walk out of the kitchen when

           The DOOR BELL chimes

           Both Peter and his Mother freeze

           He watches Mother rest the cup and knife on the counter and 
           disappear down the hall

           He hears the front door open

                                                            MOMENTS LATER

           The BACK DOOR flies open 

           Mother and Miss Devine rush into the backyard but stop when 
           they see

           Peter sitting solemnly on the swing
           Miss Devine breathes a sigh of relief, rests her hand on her 
           heart

           But Mother stares daggers

           Peter doesn’t look either in the eye

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Peter sits at the top of the STAIRCASE clutching the bars of 
           the railing

           He strains to hear the conversation happening in the 

           KITCHEN

           Miss Devine sits at the KITCHEN TABLE dabbing her eyes with a 
           tissue

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I am so sorry.
                        It’s completely my fault.

           Mother is at the counter pouring two cups of COFFEE

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter can be a difficult child. 
                        I’m sorry he put you through this.

           She hands Miss Devine her cup and sits down across from her

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Goodness no, Peter is the sweetest--

                                 MOTHER
                        He will be punished accordingly.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Oh no.
                        No, I wouldn’t want that.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh? What would you want?

           Miss Devine tries to read her big, bright smile

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        All I mean is...

           She struggles to find her words
                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I think, perhaps...
                        There might be something else going 
                        on.

           Mother sips her coffee

                                 MOTHER
                        Please. Do tell.

           Miss Devine hesitates before reaching into her BAG

           She removes Peter’s PICTURE and places it on the table

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I was hoping you might be able to 
                        tell me.

           Mother rests her mug on the table

           She picks up the picture - examines it closely

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter painted this?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        For the holiday. 
                        Most of the children drew monsters 
                        or witches, but Peter...

                                 MOTHER
                        I see.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        It’s probably nothing, but--

           Mother folds the paper in half

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re right. It is nothing. 
                        A spooky picture. For the Holiday.

           But Miss Devine isn’t satisfied with that

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        But you can understand why one 
                        might be concerned, no?

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter has always had a very active 
                        imagination. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        For years he would wake his Father 
                        and I up in the middle of the night 
                        with tales of ghosts and spectres.
                        His flights of fancy are not 
                        something I’m eager to indulge.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Often these things can be a sign of 
                        a deeper issue.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh? What are you implying?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I’m not implying anything.

                                 MOTHER
                        But you are.

           Miss Devine is disarmed by her smile

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Please. If you believe there to be 
                        an issue, I should be aware of it.

           She can’t help but feel she’s in treacherous waters

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Children sometimes have trouble 
                        expressing what’s wrong with them.

                                 MOTHER
                        So there’s something wrong with 
                        Peter?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        ...I just wanted to bring it to 
                        your attention.

                                 MOTHER
                        And now you have.

           Mother stands

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s getting late, Miss Devine. I 
                        still have quite a bit to do before 
                        my husband returns from work.

           She takes Miss Devine’s untouched coffee

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate you coming and...
                        Expressing your concerns.
           She dumps it in the sink then throws Miss Devine a cheerful 
           and utterly insincere smile

           Miss Devine nods

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Have a good evening.

           Miss Devine stands as Mother places the mugs in the sink

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           From behind the railing

           Peter sees Miss Devine opening the front door

           As she exits, she glances up at Peter

           She gives him a small wave

           And after a moment

           Peter waves back

           She smiles wistfully

           As she turns to leave out the door

           She notices for the first time that there a BARS over all the 
           windows

           She furrows her brow, but chooses not to think any more of it

           She closes the door behind her

           And for a moment, it’s quiet

           Until Mother appears at the bottom of the stairs

           And she’s holding the FOLDED PICTURE

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter...

           Peter scurries backwards

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry!

           Mother stomps up each step while

           Peter crawls backwards faster and faster until he reaches his
           BEDROOM

           He runs and darts behind his bed but

           Mother follows him inside

           She looms in the doorway and displays the picture

                                 MOTHER
                        Tell me what this is.

           Peter cowers behind the bed

                                 PETER
                        It’s just a picture...

           Mother trembles with fury

                                 MOTHER
                        A picture of what?

                                 PETER
                        Not anything.

           She steps forward

                                 MOTHER
                        A picture of what?

                                 PETER
                        Nothing!

           She’s about to scream back when they both hear the front door 
           open

           Peter goes white

           But Mother gets her temper under control

                                 FATHER (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           Peter’s eyes plead for mercy from his Mother

                                 MOTHER
                            (Calling)
                        Honey. Come upstairs.

           Peter shrinks down below the bed as they listen to Father 
           come up the stairs

           He appears in the doorway next to Mother
                                 FATHER
                        What’s going on here?

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter ran away from school today.

                                 FATHER
                        He what?

           She hands him the picture

                                 MOTHER
                        And he painted this.

           Father assesses the picture

                                 FATHER
                        Did he now...

           He shakes his head

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        I thought we were finished with 
                        this nonsense.
                        Isn’t that right, Peter?
                        I thought you were a big boy.

                                 PETER
                        I am...

                                 FATHER
                        You’re not. 
                        Not when you insist on subjecting 
                        your Mother and I to make believe.

                                 MOTHER
                        You assured us you had outgrown 
                        these fantasies.

                                 FATHER
                        Do you know what this is?

           He rips the picture into pieces

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        This is a lie. Are you a liar?

                                 PETER
                        No.

                                 FATHER
                        You are. You’re a liar.
                                 PETER
                        But...

           This is a mistake

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        But...

           Don’t do it

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        But I hear her though...

           Oh no

           For a moment, all is still

           It starts slow

           Father’s face turns red

           He convulses with anger

           He lets loose

                                 FATHER
                        SHE
                        ISN’T
                        REAL!

           Peter cowers behind the bed

           Father’s outburst surprised even himself

           He composes himself and rubs his temples

           Sighs

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Do we need to ground you?

           “Ground you”

           Peter jumps to his feet, his eyes wide

                                 PETER
                        No!

                                 FATHER
                        What do you think Mother?

                                 PETER
                        No, no, no, no, no!
           She crosses her arms

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m not sure...

           Peter crawls on his knees towards them

                                 PETER
                        Please, please, please don’t ground 
                        me! I promise I’ll be good!

           His parents look down at him on the floor

                                 MOTHER
                        This...Girl...

                                 PETER
                        I made her up!

           Neither looks convinced

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t ground me.

           It could go either way

           But after a long, pregnant silence

           Mother sighs

                                 MOTHER
                        Fine then.
                        But if we hear any more talk--

                                 PETER
                        You won’t.

                                 FATHER
                        Good.

           Mother reaches into her pocket and removes a

           KEY RING

           She and Father step out into the hall

                                 MOTHER
                        There will be no supper.

           Mother closes the door

           Locks it

           Peter listens as they go downstairs
           When he no longer hears their footsteps, he rises to his feet

           Tries the knob - confirms that yes, it is locked

           His shoulders sink

           He plods back to his bed

           Sits on the edge facing the window

           Tears build in his eyes, snot drips from his nose

           He CRIES

           But in between sniffs and whimpers

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...

           Peter tenses

           He cranes his neck back to look at The Wall

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry...
                        I didn’t meant to get you in 
                        trouble...

           He turns back to the window

                                 PETER
                        Be quiet.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Please don’t cry...

           He wipes his tears

                                 PETER
                        I said be quiet.
                        You aren’t real.
                        I’m making you up.

           He looks down at his dangling feet

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Why did you run away from 
                        school...?

           Peter thinks

           He turns around

           Sits on the edge of the bed facing The Wall
                                 PETER
                        Because of Brian.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Is Brian your friend...?

                                 PETER
                        No.
                        I don’t have any friends.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        What did Brian do...?

                                 PETER
                        He broke my pumpkin.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        That was mean of him...

                                 PETER
                        He is mean. 

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Why...?

           Peter shrugs

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t let people be mean to 
                        you, Peter...

           Peter considers this

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You should do something about 
                        that...

           Yeah, he should

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Peter...?

           He’s lost in thought

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           On the third TAP

           A STRIP of WALLPAPER peels off The Wall, exposing the WOOD 
           behind it
           That snaps Peter out of his trance

           He looks down at his feet

                                 PETER
                        I shouldn’t be talking to you.

           He crawls underneath the covers 

           Lies facing the window

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You’re just make believe.

                                                                 MORNING

           Rain patters against the window

           Peter wakes to the sound of his door being unlocked

           The door opens, but that’s all

           He hears his Mother’s footsteps going down the stairs

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING

           Peter walks onto the bus

           He stares at his feet as he makes his way to the back

           And although he doesn’t want to, he can’t help but glance at 

           Brian’s seat - it’s VACANT

           He pauses for a moment before continuing to the back

           He takes his seat in the last row

           Stares ahead at where Brian should be

           INT. CLASSROOM

           The children file into the classroom

           Miss Devine waits patiently at her desk for

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Peter.

           He stops
                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           She is sorry - incredibly so

           He can see that in her eyes

           But he doesn’t say anything - just drops his things in his 
           cubby and goes to his desk

           He sits down

           Notices Brian’s desk is EMPTY

                                                                   LATER

           The entire class stands with their hands on their chests

           They all face the FLAG in the corner

                                 THE CLASS
                        I pledge allegiance
                        To the flag
                        Of the United States of America
                        And to the Republic
                        For which it stands
                        One Nation
                        Under God--

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

           Peter jumps

           Miss Devine goes to the classroom door and opens it

           A MOM stands on the other side

           Miss Devine looks back at Peter before joining her in the 
           hallway

           Peter can’t hear what they’re saying, but he picks up on

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I think that would be very nice.

           Miss Devine comes back inside, followed by the Mom

           And Brian

           He’s holding a PUMPKIN

           Peter slinks down in his seat

           Brian hesitates a moment but his Mom pushes him forward
           He gradually weaves through the desks until he reaches Peter

           Peter feels everyone’s eyes

           Brian holds out the pumpkin

                                 BRIAN
                        I’m sorry, Peter.

           Peter stares at the pumpkin’s painted face

           It’s stupid and bad and looks nothing like Hector

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        That was very nice of Brian, wasn’t 
                        it Peter?

           Peter glances up at Brian’s blank, soulless expression

           Then to Miss Devine’s hopeful smile

           Peter takes the pumpkin from Brian

           Raises it above his head

           And HURLS it at the ground by Brian’s feet, smashing it to 
           pieces

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Peter!

           Peter’s face turns red, he vibrates with anger

           Brian shows no emotion

           Miss Devine rushes between the two of them

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           She looms over Peter 

           He shrinks in her shadow

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        That was bad, Peter.
                        That was very bad.

           She turns to Brian

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Take your seat, Brian.

           Brian returns to his desk
           She looks back to Peter

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I am so disappointed in you.

           Peter seethes

           He focuses that anger on the back of Brian’s head

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Peter sits at the edge of the playground clutching his knees 
           to his chest

           He watches Brian hanging from the monkey bars

           He waits

           And waits

           And waits

           INT. CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Peter stares at the CLOCK above the door

           TICK

                TOCK

                     TICK

                          TOCK

           The BELL rings

           All the Children stand from their desks and swarm the cubbies

           All except Peter who watches Brian collect his coat and 
           backpack

           When the chaos has dissipated 

           Peter goes to his cubby and puts on his coat

           As he heads out the door 

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Bye Peter.

           But Peter’s already gone
           Miss Devine goes back to the papers she’s working on

           But something isn’t sitting right

           She looks to the hallway

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

           Brian trudges down the corridor 

           Peter follows him, getting closer and closer

           Miss Devine pokes her head out of her door

           Just in time to see Peter catch up to Brian by the STAIRCASE

           And SHOVE him from behind

           Miss Devine sees Brian disappear off the stair’s horizon

           And the world shifts beneath her feet

           Time slows 

           She sprints down the hall

           She hears the dull THUD of meat

           The sharp CRACK of bones

           And when she arrives next to Peter at the edge of the stairs 

           She hears a HOWL like a wounded animal

           She looks down in horror at what lays at the bottom

           While Peter looks down with pride

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE, LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           In a GLASS ROOM, ADULTS shout at each other

           Brian’s Mom yells at Peter’s Mother

           Peter’s Mother yells back

           The Principal yells at both of them

           But Miss Devine - sitting in the corner - remains silent

           Her eyes are glassy - her complexion pale
           She stares off into the middle distance

           Peter sits outside the glass, watching it all from the lobby

           He lets his arms dangle and his feet swing

           He remembers 

                              Miss Devine taking the stairs three at a time

           He remembers

                                                 The revulsion on her face

           He remembers

                                          The bone protruding from the leg

           He remembers

                                                     The screams of agony

           He remembers

           And he smiles

           Without thinking, he places his finger against the wall

                                                                     TAP

           From inside the Glass Room, Miss Devine looks at Peter 

           And he looks back at her

                                                                     TAP

           INT. THE CAR - EVENING

           Peter sits in the back seat

           He looks out the window and counts the raindrops sliding down 
           the glass

           Mother watches him from the REARVIEW
                                 MOTHER
                        Expelled...

           She shakes her head

           Peter says nothing

           INT. THE FOYER

           The front door opens

           Peter stares ahead at what awaits him down the hall, in the 
           KITCHEN 

           Father, sitting at the kitchen table, stroking The Cat on his 
           lap

                                 MOTHER
                        Go on.

           But Peter doesn’t move

           So she shoves him 

           He walks glacially down the

           HALL 

           The floorboards creak with every heavy step

           But he isn’t going fast enough

           So Mother grabs him by the scruff of his neck and drags him 
           into the

           KITCHEN

           Father puts The Cat on the floor, stands, and 

           Pulls out a CHAIR

           Mother forces Peter onto the seat

           His Parents stand looking down on him, their arms crossed

           He stares at his feet

           For a long time, no one says a word

                                 FATHER
                        I don’t know what to do anymore.
                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t you have anything to say for 
                        yourself?

           Silence

                                 FATHER
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Brian was mean to me.

                                 MOTHER
                        So you sent him to the hospital?

                                 FATHER
                        We don’t solve our problems with 
                        violence, Peter.

           Peter clenches his jaw, prepares himself for what’s to come

                                 PETER
                        She said I shouldn’t let people be 
                        mean to me.

           The air leaves the room

                                 MOTHER
                        ...Who said that to you?

           He shrugs

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Peter.
                        Who said that to you?
                        Who have you been speaking to?

           He gives no reply, which is the only answer they need

                                 FATHER
                        Oh Jesus Christ.

           He SLAMS his hand against the wall

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        JESUS CHRIST.

           He grabs the table and hurls it across the room

           But then he takes a breath

           Regains his composure - rubs his temples
                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        This is the last straw, Peter.

           He looks at Mother

           She nods

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        There’s only one thing that’s 
                        worked in the past.

           No

           Peter grips the sides of the chair - his fingers turn white

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        We have to ground you.

           He knew it was coming but it hurts all the same

           Peter remains completely still, every muscle tense

           Mother grasps Peter’s arm

           And Peter SCREAMS

           She tries to pull him but he won’t release the chair

           Meanwhile, Father goes to the REFRIGERATOR, braces himself

           And slides it away from the wall revealing

           A DOOR

           Mother yanks Peter and the chair topples to the floor

           Peter jumps to his feet and RUNS down the HALL into the

           FOYER

           He tries to open the front door

           But it’s LOCKED

           Mother marches from behind

           With nowhere to go, Peter falls to the floor and kicks his 
           legs furiously

           But Mother manages to grab an ankle

           He screams and claws at the floor as he’s dragged back into 
           the
           KITCHEN

           She pulls the thrashing Peter across the floorboards

           With her free hand, Mother reaches into her pocket and 
           retrieves the KEY RING

           She hands the keys to Father who unlocks the door leading to 
           the

                                         COLD

                                         DARK

                                       BASEMENT

           Father descends the stairs and disappears into the shadows 

           Mother hoists the screaming and struggling Peter into her 
           arms and carries him into the dark

           Footsteps echo throughout the cavernous room

           Father turns on a single, exposed LIGHT BULB that reveals

           A METAL DOOR in the damp floor

           When Mother and Peter are close enough

           He lifts the heavy door revealing 

           THE PIT

           Mother brings him to the hole in the ground

                                 MOTHER
                        Make use of your time.

           She lowers Peter into the hole

                                 FATHER
                        Think about why you’re down there.

           She drops him and he hits the moist dirt with a dull thud

           Peter scrambles to his feet - tries to climb out

           But there’s no use

           He weeps

                                 PETER
                        Please don’t!
                        I’ll be good!
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        I swear I’ll be a big boy!
                        Please please please don’t!
                        She’s not real! I know she’s not 
                        real!
                        Please don’t leave me down here!

           Father and Mother look down at him

           His pleas fall on deaf ears

           The door SLAMS CLOSED

           IN TOTAL DARKNESS

           He’s all alone

           Completely, utterly alone

           He jumps as high as he can

           He scratches at the walls

           He screams and bellows and wails 

           But it does him no good - he’s trapped

           His crying subsides

           He sits on the cold, wet ground

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        If you’re not real...
                        If you really are my imagination...
                        Please...
                        Talk to me...
                        I don’t want to be alone...

           He waits

           And waits

           And waits

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Help me...

           But nobody can

           Nobody will

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Miss Devine stands in front of the class with her clipboard
                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Katie D?

           Katie D raises her hand

                                 KATIE D
                        Here.

           Miss Devine checks her name

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Ryan G?

           Ryan G raises his hand

                                 RYAN G
                        Here.

           Check

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Peter--

           She stops herself

           She looks to the empty desk in the last row, furthest corner

           And for a moment, she’s lost in thought

           But she remembers herself 

           Shakes her head

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth J?

                                                                   LATER

           Outside the WINDOW the children take their recess

           Inside, Miss Devine sits at her desk grading math quizzes

           But try as she might to concentrate, she can’t focus

           She puts her pen down and sighs

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           While The Cat eats from its bowl

           Mother opens the refrigerator

           She removes a TUPPERWARE container
           Brings it the BLENDER and opens the lid

           A stew of LEFTOVERS sits congealed inside

           She dumps its contents into the blender

           Behind her - the PHONE RINGS

           She turns - eyes it suspiciously

           It keeps ringing

           So she walks across the kitchen and answers it

                                 MOTHER
                        Hello?

           Miss Devine paces around the CLASSROOM

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Hi. Is this Peter’s Mother?

                                 MOTHER
                        ...It is.

           The flatness in her voice immediatly telegraphs to Miss 
           Devine that this was a mistake

           But too late now

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        This is Miss Devine.

                                 MOTHER
                        What a delight.

           She walks back to the blender

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I’m sorry to call, but I...
                        I wanted to check in.
                        How is Peter doing?

           Mother glances to the refrigerator

                                 MOTHER
                        He’s thinking long and hard about 
                        what a bad boy he’s been.
                        The other one?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Brian? 
                        His Mom says he’ll be back in class 
                        for Halloween.
           She takes a breath

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I want to apologize again--

           Mother turns the blender ON

           Miss Divine grimaces at the sound

           Waits for it to stop

           Mother lets it run until the concoction has turned gray

                                 MOTHER
                        What was that?

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I said I want to apologize.
                        For what happened.
                        I can’t help but feel responsible--

                                 MOTHER
                        No. It was entirely Peter’s doing.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Have you figured out what school 
                        he’ll go to?

           Mother dumps the gruel into a CUP

                                 MOTHER
                        Here. At home.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        ...Oh.

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter is an delicate child. 
                        An isolated environment is more 
                        suited to his needs. 
                        This is for the best.

           She opens the DRAWER and retrieves a KNIFE

           Miss Devine closes her eyes and prepares herself

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        May I speak with him?

           Mother opens her mouth to respond when

                                                                      TAP

           She looks up at the ceiling
                                                                      TAP

           It’s faint

           But there is definitely a noise coming from upstairs

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Mother turns her attention back to the phone

                                 MOTHER
                        I don’t think that would be 
                        appropriate.

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Oh...

                                                                      TAP

                                                                      TAP

                                                                      TAP

                                 MOTHER
                        I must go.
                        Thank you for the call.

           Mother hangs up

           Looks back at the ceiling

           Miss Devine, meanwhile, listens to a dial-tone and is left 
           feeling even worse than she did before she called

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Mother slowly ascends the stairs, cup in one hand, knife in 
           the other

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

                                                                     TAP

           She cautiously walks down the hallway, the floorboards 
           creaking with every step

           She gets closer and closer to the incessant TAPing

           Until she stands facing The Wall
           She pounds her fist against the wood

                                 MOTHER
                        Shut up!

           Then nothing - silence

           THE DARKNESS

           It’s quiet and still

           All that can be heard is Peter’s steady breathing

           Until the heavy door is UNLOCKED

           The door is opened

           And a blinding light illuminates the hole

           Peter squints at the silhouettes of his Parents above him 

           They look down at their filthy child below

           INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

           Peter’s urine-stained underwear soaks in the sink while

           Peter sits naked in the bathtub, the water black from all the 
           grime

           Mother turns off the faucet and sits on the edge

           She soaks a WASHCLOTH in the dirty water

           Takes him by the chin

                                 MOTHER
                        I know your Father and I can be 
                        strict.

           She scrubs above his eyes

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Our punishments harsh.

           His cheeks

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps even cruel.

           She glides the cloth along his arm
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        But one day you’ll realize what we 
                        do is born of love.

           Scrubs the dirt and blood underneath his fingernails

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        That this is all for your own good.

           She places her hand on his shoulder and pushes him forward

           She runs the cloth across his BACK

           Over the SCARS

           The four, jagged LACERATIONS that cross his spine

           She traces her finger along the raised flesh

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        To keep you safe.

           She sits him upright - smiles

           Kisses him on the forehead and stands

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Dry off.
                        It’s time for supper.

           Mother leaves the bathroom

           Peter listens to her descend the stairs

           He grabs the TOWEL

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           Peter walks into the kitchen to see

           Mother and Father sitting at the table under the family 
           portrait, dinner plates before them

           They both smile at him

                                 MOTHER
                        Come.

           She pulls out his chair

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Sit.
           Skeptically, Peter takes his place at the table

           Mother and Father stare at him as he sits on his hands

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you hungry?

           He makes a show of taking a bite, then sets his fork back on 
           the table

                                 FATHER
                        Well Son...
                        Did you have a good think?

           Peter nods

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        What about?

                                 PETER
                        About how I need to grow up
                        About how I need to be a good boy.
                        Stop acting out.
                        Stop telling fibs.

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s very nice to hear.

                                 FATHER
                        We’re both very proud of you.

           Mother and Father reach across the table and take each others 
           hands

                                 MOTHER
                        Things are going to be different 
                        now, Peter. 
                        You won’t be attending school any 
                        longer. I will be your teacher. 
                        Lessons will begin in the morning.

                                 FATHER
                        The three “R”s.
                        Do you know what those are?

           Peter shakes his head

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Reading, writing...and ‘rithmetic.

           Father laughs
                                 MOTHER
                        Not only will you finally receive a 
                        proper education, but I’m confident 
                        you and I will have a lot of--

                                                                   THUMP

           It came from upstairs

           Mother and Father go absolutely still

           They look to the ceiling, then to each other, then to Peter

           But Peter has no reaction at all - simply chews his food

           After he’s swallowed

                                 PETER
                        A lot of what?

           They both relax 

                                 MOTHER
                        A lot of fun.

           Father musses his hair

                                 FATHER
                        You’re a good boy, Peter.

                                 MOTHER
                        A big boy.

                                 FATHER
                        That’s right. A big boy.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Peter’s all tucked in

           Father stands by the doorway, Mother sits on the edge of the 
           bed

           She’s reading from a picture book

                                 MOTHER
                        “Well look at that! This is the end 
                        of the book, and the only one here 
                        is...ME.
                        I am the Monster at the end of this 
                        book.
                        And you were so scared!
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        I told you and told you there was 
                        nothing to be afraid of.”

           She closes the book - Peter smiles

           He may be a big boy, but he still loves that one

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Peter.

           She kisses him on the forehead, then joins Father in the 
           doorway

                                 PETER
                        Good night, Mother.
                        Good night, Father.

           They close the door

           He listens to their footsteps travel to the end of the hall

           Hears their bedroom door close

           His smile vanishes

           He sits up in bed, moves to the edge

           Looks to The Wall

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Are you real?

           He waits

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I said are you real?

           And waits

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.

           And waits

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me!

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I’m real, Peter...

           He nods - he knew it

           He crawls off the bed and drags himself across the 
           floorboards
                                 PETER
                        Where are you?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I don’t know...
                        It’s dark...

                                 PETER
                        How long have you been there?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        As long as I can remember...

           But then 

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        No...

           No?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I remember a room...
                        A bed...
                        Toys...

           Peter looks around his room

           He has those things

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There was a ball...

           Peter looks to his closet

                                 PETER
                        ...Was it red?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        What is...red...?

                                 PETER
                        Red is...a strawberry.
                        A fire truck.
                        Blood--

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Yes.
                        It was red...
                        Oh, how I loved to play...
                        How I wish I had it now...

                                 PETER
                        Wait.
           Peter stands

           Slowly walks to the closet, careful not to make too much 
           noise

           He gently turns the knob and opens the closet door

           The RED BALL falls out and bounces across the floor

           Peter clasps his hand over his mouth

           That was too loud

           He watches it roll to The Wall

           He looks to his bedroom door

           Waits to hear his parent’s door open

           It doesn’t

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Is that it...?
                        Is that my red ball...?

           He nods

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

           And for a moment, the room is quiet - but then

                                                                 SCRATCH

           At first, Peter isn’t sure of the source of the sound

                                                                 SCRATCH

           But then he sees it

                                                                 SCRATCH

           Where the wall meets the floor

                                                                 SCRATCH

           The WALLPAPER - it’s protruding

           As if a finger is poking from the other side

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Stop!
           She does

           Peter starts to tremble

           He listens for his parent’s bedroom door again

           Silence

           After his nerves have calmed, he creeps his way back to 
           The Wall

           Gets down on his knees and with his thumb and forefinger

           He takes hold of the peeling wallpaper

           And pulls - just for a second

           Simply testing its resilience

           But it separates from the wall with a satisfying rip

           So he keeps pulling

           And slowly, inch by inch

           Reveals a HOLE

           As soon as he realizes what he’s done, he lets go

           Scurries backwards

           Allows the wallpaper to fall back into place

           When he catches his breath

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You’re my sister...aren’t you?

           There’s a silence

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Yes...

           He gulps

                                 PETER
                        Why are you in there?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mommy and Daddy...
                        They said I was bad...

           Peter nods
                                 PETER
                        They say that to me sometimes.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...

                                 PETER
                        Yes?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        May I play with it...?

           It takes him a moment to understand what she means

           When he does, he picks up the BALL - looks to The Wall

           And decides “yes”

           So he crawls back to The Wall

           Peels back the paper - curls it so that it stays put

           And looks into the deep, dark, absolute darkness of The Hole

           It isn’t big, but the small red ball will fit

           So he readies himself

           And rolls it inside and it disappears into the darkness

           Then he waits

           And waits

           And waits

           Until the ball rolls back

                                                                 MORNING

           Morning light floods through the window

           Mother gently opens the door to Peter’s room

           Sees him sleeping soundly

           She glides across the floor and sits on the edge of his bed

           Caresses his face

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter. Wake up.

           Peter opens his eyes
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s almost time for school.

           He smiles - nods

                                 PETER
                        Okay.

           Mother stands and moves towards the door

           Then stops

           All of Peter’s TOYS have been propped up and displayed 
           against The Wall

           INT. STORAGE CLOSET - DAY

           Mother pulls the chain that turns on the LIGHT

           She digs through the old board games and cleaning products 
           before she finds 

           A stack of WORK BOOKS

           She blows off the dust and turns off the light

           INT. KITCHEN

           Mother sits at the kitchen table, a work book open before her

           She rubs at its pages with a pink eraser

                                 MOTHER
                            (Calling)
                        Ring, ring, ring.
                        That’s the bell.
                        Heaven knows you don’t want to be 
                        late for your first day of school.

           Peter walks into the kitchen

           Mother closes the book, stands, sweeps the eraser residue 
           into her hand, and throws it away in the sink

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Please everyone take your seats.

           Peter pulls out a chair and sits at the table

           He looks at the old math work book on the table in front of 
           him
           Mother stands in front of the table with her hands clasped 
           before her

           She puts on her best “Teacher Voice”

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        For the first lesson of the day, we 
                        will be learning multiplication.

           She stifles a self-satisfied smile

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Won’t you all open your books to 
                        page 15.

           Peter opens his book

           He can’t help but notice that - despite being erased

           There’s still the faint trace of already answered questions

                                                                   LATER

           Mother paces back and forth while Peter furrows his brow

                                 PETER
                        M...A...

           He pauses

                                 MOTHER
                        ...Go on.

                                 PETER
                        ...I...?

           She nods

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        N...D...E...R
                        Remainder.

                                 MOTHER
                        Very good, Peter.
                        How about...”Hostile.”

           Peter thinks

                                 PETER
                        Hostile.
                        H...O...S...T

           CUCKOO - CUCKOO - CUCKOO
           Peter and Mother both turn to the CUCKOO CLOCK hanging on the 
           wall - to the BIRD popping in and out

           Mother bites her lip and sighs

                                 MOTHER
                        Okay...
                        Time for a break.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Mother sits Peter down on the couch

                                 MOTHER
                        You’ve earned a few minutes of 
                        television.

           She turns on the TELEVISION SET 

           A black & white movie plays - a WOMAN walks down a dark alley

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oooh.
                        This is a spooky one.

           She turns up the volume

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Stay put.

           She goes into the kitchen - Peter watches the movie

           The woman in the film hears footsteps behind her, but every 
           time she turns around - no one is there

           Peter hears the BLENDER running in the kitchen

           Over the sound of the movie, he hears Mother’s footsteps

           He listens as she goes upstairs

           Hears the creak of the floorboards above him

           Then a GROAN

           As if heavy furniture is being shifted above his head

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           Mother works at the stove while Peter does his homework at 
           the table
           Father walks through the kitchen with a grin on his face

           He saunters over to Mother

                                 FATHER
                        Something to add to the stew.

           She turns to see him holding up a DEAD RAT

           She screams and smacks him

                                 MOTHER
                        Get that out of here!

           He laughs as she hits him again

           Peter watches as he takes it out to the backyard

                                 FATHER
                        Poison’s working.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Peter is wearing his pajamas as he brushes his teeth

           After he spits and rinses

           He looks out into the 

           HALLWAY

           He creeps out of the bathroom - Walks to the BOOK SHELF

           And kneels down

           He grazes his thumb along the deep scratch in the floor from 
           all the times the shelf has been moved

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Peter sits facing The Wall

           The wallpaper has been peeled back - The Hole is exposed

           And the red ball comes rolling out

           Peter catches it - rolls it back

                                 PETER
                        What’s your name?
           After a moment

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I don’t know...
                        I...
                        I don’t have one...

           It rolls out again

                                 PETER
                        But everyone has a name. 

           He rolls it in

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I don’t know any girls names...

           Rolls out

                                 PETER
                        There are girls at school.
                        Some are named Katie, or Mary, or 
                        Tabitha, or Sarah.

           In

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Sarah...
                        I like that...

           Out

                                 PETER
                        Sarah, then. That’s your name.

           In

           He waits for the ball’s return

           But it doesn’t come out again

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...
                        Help me...

           He stares at The Hole

           He knew this was coming, and he looks away

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           He doesn’t say anything
           He clutches his knees to his chest

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let me out...

                                 PETER
                        I don’t know how.

           He can sense her disappointment

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m sorry.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I’m so hungry...

           Peter nods - that he can handle

                                 PETER
                        Okay.

           He slowly heads to the door

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get you an apple--

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        No.

           He stops

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Meat.

           Looks back at The Hole

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Bring me meat...

           Silence

                                 PETER
                        Why?

           He stands frozen by the door

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Please...
                        Bring me meat...

           For a while, he does nothing
                                 PETER
                        All right.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The moon shines through the window

           Peter uses its light to navigate the kitchen on his hands and 
           knees

           He moves slowly, deliberately - the dark amplifying every 
           sound

           He reaches the refrigerator - takes hold of the handle

           And pulls open the door

           The light from inside cascades throughout the kitchen

           Revealing Mother behind him

                                 MOTHER
                        What are you doing, Peter?

           Peter yelps - slams the door closed

           He turns to Mother now lit only by moonlight

                                 PETER
                        I...

           He catches his breath

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I wanted a snack.

           She doesn’t move

                                 MOTHER
                        It’s very late.

           Peter touches his stomach

                                 PETER
                        ...I couldn’t sleep.

                                 MOTHER
                        You’re not supposed to be out of 
                        bed.

           He looks at his feet

           She takes a step forward - he takes one back 
           She opens the refrigerator door

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mother closes Peter’s bedroom door

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Go to sleep.

           He hears the key ring - hears the door LOCK

           And when he hears Mother’s footsteps travel down the hall, 
           hears her bedroom door close

           He goes to The Wall

           Peels back the wallpaper

           And places a pink slice of lunch meat outside The Hole

           And then he waits

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        What is this...?

                                 PETER
                        Bologna.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I said to bring meat...

                                 PETER
                        It is meat.

           Silence

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        This is all we have.

           He holds his breath

           Then watches as the bologna is dragged inside

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        It’s okay, Peter...
                        You tried...
                        Thank you...

           But then he hears whimpering
           Followed sobs

                                 PETER
                        Please.
                        Don’t cry.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...
                        I’m sick...
                        I...
                        I think I’m dying...

                                 PETER
                        ...I can try and get medicine, 
                        or...

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I’m scared...

           He stands impotently in the center of the room

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I need to get out...
                        I need your help...

                                 PETER
                        I told you.
                        I don’t know how.

           He listens as she sniffs - takes a breath

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        There’s a door...

           He wipes the tears from his eyes - nods

                                 PETER
                        I know there is.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        You do...?

           He looks to the hall

                                 PETER
                        It’s in the hallway.
                        Behind the book shelf.
                        It’s how she feeds you.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Yes...

           A long quiet - they both think
                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need the key...

                                 PETER
                        She always keeps it on her.
                        I could never sneak it.

           But he has a thought

           He walks to the window

           Looks out into the back yard

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea.

           INT. BUS - MORNING

           All the CHILDREN are dressed in their HALLOWEEN COSTUMES

           Brian is dressed as a FOOTBALL PLAYER - an injured one

           His leg is in a CAST

           As they approach the spooky old house on the hill

           He looks out the window

           And as the bus roars past the house

           He sees Peter standing in the window

           Watching

           INT. BATHROOM

           Peter stares out the window at the bus speeding by

           When its gone, he goes back to brushing his teeth

           He return to the mirror - stares at his reflection

           He stops brushing

           Lets the toothpaste froth from his lips like a rabid beast

           Lets it dribble down his chin

           He spits
           INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Mother paces back and forth as Peter furrows his brow

                                 PETER
                        A...F...R...A...I...D
                        Afraid.

                                 MOTHER
                        Very good.

           CUCKOO - CUCKOO - CUCKOO

           They both turn to the cuckoo clock - to the bird popping in 
           and out

           Mother looks to Peter and smiles

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Mother sits Peter on the couch

           She turns on the television set then goes to the kitchen

           A black & white movie is playing - a girl bangs on a door 
           begging her mother to let her in

           But the begging and banging stop and blood pools under the 
           door

           Peter hears the blender in the kitchen

           Hears Mother go upstairs

           INT. STAIRCASE

           As Mother ascends the staircase

           Peter creeps to the bottom

           He listens to her walking down the hall

           Hears the groan of the bookshelf being moved

           He darts away into the

           KITCHEN

           And to the back door

           He swings it open and runs into the back yard
           Past the garden, past the gnarled tree

           And to the Shed

           INT. STAIRCASE

           Mother descends the stairs

           When she reaches the bottom, she walks down the HALLWAY and 
           into the 

           KITCHEN

           Where she stops

           She looks at the back door - at the screen door blowing in 
           the wind

           She looks into the LIVING ROOM

           Where Peter is still sitting on the couch watching television

           He looks over to her with an innocent smile

           EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

           PARENTS and TEACHERS alike stand as audience, gawking and 
           waving at

           The PARADE of children in their costumes

           Miss Devine forces a smile as she watches the procession of 
           superheroes and princesses 

           She sees Brian limping by on his crutches, and the smile 
           fades

           But only for a moment before she remembers herself

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           The sun is just beginning to set

           The first TRICK-OR-TREATERS have begun to prowl

           Miss Devine’s CAR pulls into the driveway of her HOUSE
           INT. MISS DEVINE’S LIVING ROOM

           Miss Devine sits on the floor of her living room, bathed in 
           the TV’s light as she plunges a KNIFE into a PUMPKIN

           She carves a face, periodically looking up at the television

           A black & white film is playing

           A WOMAN with dark black hair enters her apartment to find a 
           NOOSE hanging from the ceiling

           Miss Devine gets chills

           She pops out the last chunk and admires her handiwork

           She bites her lip

           She can’t help but notice it looks an awful lot like Hector

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

           Father sets the table while mother ladles SOUP into three 
           bowls and 

           Peter finishes pouring three glasses of MILK at the counter

           He looks back at his parents

           Neither of them are paying him any attention

           Father sits as Mother brings the tray of soup bowls to the 
           table

                                 FATHER
                        I was thinking after dinner we 
                        could make a bowl of popcorn and 
                        the three of us watch a scary 
                        movie.
                        What do you say?

           Mother takes her seat

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, I don’t know.

           Peter distributes the glasses

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want Peter having 
                        nightmares.

           He takes his seat between them
                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        He already has so much trouble 
                        sleeping.

                                 FATHER
                        Nah.

           He musses Peter’s hair

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Peter’s a big boy, aren’t you 
                        champ?

           Peter swirls the soup around with his spoon

                                 MOTHER
                        We’ll see...

           Peter glances up as Mother is about to sip her soup, but then

           RING RING

           She stops - puts the spoon down

           Mother and Father exchange glances

           RING RING - the DOORBELL

           Mother sighs

           She stands up from the table and walks up the hallway towards 
           the front door

           Tense, Father stares at Peter

           Peter stares at his soup

           They hear the front door open

                                 CHILDREN (O.S.)
                        Trick or treat!

           Father relaxes

           He brings the spoon to his mouth and sips

                                 FATHER
                        Mmmm.

           He sips another spoonful - and another

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        We don’t have any candy.
           But after a moment - he frowns

           Peter watches as Father looks into his bowl

           But when Mother walks back into the kitchen

           He continues eating as if nothing was the matter

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Trick or treaters.

                                 FATHER
                        Did you turn the porch light out?

                                 MOTHER
                        I did just now.

           She takes her seat

           Father takes another sip and stifles a shiver

                                 FATHER
                        It’s very good, honey.

                                 MOTHER
                        Thank you, dear.

                                 FATHER
                        Don’t you think, Peter?

                                 PETER
                        Uh huh.

                                 FATHER
                        Did you do anything differently?

           Mother shakes her head as she blows the steam off her spoon

                                 MOTHER
                        Same recipe as always.

           Father nods

           He drinks from his milk and grimaces

           Peter holds his breath as Mother finally takes her first sip

           And then her second

           By the third, the taste cannot be ignored - she winces

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh goodness.
           Father puts his spoon down

                                 FATHER
                        Right?

           Mother sniffs her bowl

           Takes a fourth sip just to be sure

           Spits it back 

                                 MOTHER
                        That’s terrible.

           She gulps down her milk

           But that’s just as bad as the soup

           She retches

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        My God, what is...

           It’s at that moment she realizes Peter hasn’t touched his 
           meal

           He’s simply been sitting swirling his spoon

           She looks to Father

           He understands

           He knocks his chair over as he bolts up from the table

           He runs towards the back door and out into

           BACK YARD

           Sprints past the garden

           Past the gnarled tree

           And into

           THE SHED

           Where he finds on the shelf

           An empty spot where the RAT POISON used to be
           INT. KITCHEN

           Mother slowly backs away from the table shaking her head

                                 MOTHER
                        What did you do, Peter?

           He doesn’t look up - simply swirls the spoon

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        WHAT DID YOU DO?

           Father runs back into the kitchen

                                 FATHER
                        Call 911!

           As Mother goes for the PHONE

           Father GRABS Peter by the shirt and YANKS him up from his 
           chair and

           SLAMS him into the wall

           The framed portrait is knocked from the wall and SHATTERS 
           onto the floor

           Mother gets to the phone, holds it to her ear, dials, only to 
           realize 

           Peter cut the cord

           Father’s eyes bulge with rage as he hoists Peter into the air

           He screams like an animal in Peter’s face

           But then he stops - as if the sound is caught in his chest

           Rage gives way to confusion

           He drops Peter and clasps at his throat

           Backs away - stumbles

           Peter scrambles away and watches from the hall as

           Father VOMITS black BILE all over the floor

           Terrified, he looks to Mother for help but she remains 
           paralyzed

           He vomits again - even more this time - and moans in pain 

           He collapses onto the floor
           Spasms in a pool of his own sick

           Suddenly, a moment of clarity washes over Mother

           She looks at Peter in the hall

           Rushes to the drawer

           Grabs the KNIFE and darts after Peter into the

           HALLWAY

           Spitting up over herself, she chases Peter to the

           STAIRCASE

           Peter goes as fast as he can, taking two steps at a time but

           Mother is right behind him, knife in hand

           Just as he reaches the top, Mother GRABS his ankle

           He falls

           She yanks him backwards - he grasps the railing

           Turns to see vomit spewing from her mouth

           He KICKS

           His foot hits her between the eyes

           She lets go of his ankle and falls backwards

           Down

                And 

                    Down

                         Step

                              After

                                    Step

           He hears the dull THUD of meat

           The sharp CRACK of bones

           Until she lands in a heap at the bottom of the stairs
           Peter stares in disbelief at the sight of her lying there, 
           her body contorted in unnatural angles

           He catches his breath as he watches her side pool with blood

           The knife in her hand as gone through her back

           She doesn’t move

           And for a while - a long, long while

           Everything is quiet

           Eventually, Peter looks down the hall at the book shelf

           Then back to his Mother

           When he finds the strength

           He slowly descends the stairs

           The closer he gets to the bottom, the slower he goes

           Until he finally reaches the bottom

           He does his best to avoid his Mother’s eyes staring up the 
           ceiling

           Still holding onto the railing

           He reaches out and puts his hand in her pocket - nothing

           He tries the other - hears the jangling of KEYS

           He carefully extracts the key ring from her pocket

           When Mother GRABS his wrist

           Peter screams

                                 MOTHER
                        Peter...

           He tries to pull away, but he can’t

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t...

           She tries to lift her head

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let her out.

           Vomit drips from her lips
           Her head falls and her grip loosens

           Peter pulls away

           And the life leaves Mother’s eyes

           Silence

           Nothing but the sound of Peter’s labored breathing - until

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...

           He looks upstairs

           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           Peter stands in the doorway and stares at The Wall

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...
                        Are you there...?

           He shifts his weight

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Did you do it...?
                        Are they gone...?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

           The Girl squeals with delight

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Did you get the keys...?

           He takes a few cautious steps forward then stops himself

           Tosses the keys

           They land outside The Hole

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, thank you!
                        But I can’t get out myself.
                        You need to move the shelf.
                        You need to unlock the door.

           He looks down at his feet

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Peter...?
           He shuffles across the floor to The Wall

           Picks up the keys

           Then he notices something

           He takes hold of the peeling wallpaper

           And pulls, separating it from The Wall

           He steps back, pulling it more and more, revealing the wood 
           underneath

           Finally, the strip rips off and falls to the floor

           Peter takes in the sight of the exposed wall

           It’s covered in crisscrossing SCRATCHES

           Just like the ones on his back

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Keys in hand, Peter slowly approaches the BOOK SHELF

           He closes his eyes - takes a deep breath

           Readies his stance - positions his fingers between the shelf 
           and the wall

           And pulls

           It doesn’t budge

                                 PETER
                        It’s too heavy. I can’t move it.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        No, Peter!
                        You can!
                        I believe in you!
                        You’re a big boy!
                        A big, strong boy!

           His shoulders sink

           He tries again - pulls harder

           The shelf moves an inch

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        See!
                        You can do it!
           He pulls and tugs and wrenches

           And with every brief exertion of strength

           The shelf moves further and further from The Wall

           Until it gets caught on an uneven floorboard

           Peter grits his teeth

           Sweat drips from his forehead

           The shelf begins to TIP

           He steps backwards, shuts his eyes, and covers his ears as

           The shelf CRASHES to the ground

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Peter!
                        Peter, are you hurt?

           Peter opens his eyes, takes his hands off his ears

           He stares at the DOOR in The Wall

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Peter...
                        Answer me, Peter...
                        Are you all right...?

                                 PETER
                        I’m okay.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Yes!
                        We’re almost done!
                        Unlock the door!
                        Let me out!
                        Let me out, Peter!

           Peter looks at the keys in his hand

           He looks to the door - looks to the staircase

           He shakes his head

                                 PETER
                        No.

           Silence

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Peter...
                                 PETER
                        I can’t.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Yes you can, Peter...
                        You have the key...

           Tears well in his eyes

                                 PETER
                        I’m scared.

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        There’s no reason to be scared...
                        You’re doing the right thing...
                        Let me out...

           He doesn’t move

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let me out!

                                                                  BANG

                                                                  BANG

                                                                  BANG

           Peter throws the keys

           He covers his ears and sprints to the stairs but stops when 
           he sees Mother’s dead eyes staring back at him

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let me out!

                                                                  BANG

                                                                  BANG

                                                                  BANG

           He runs the other direction

           Leaps over the fallen book shelf

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let me out!
           And runs into his

           PARENT’S ROOM

           He slams the door closed

           He sprints to the bed

           And dives under the covers

           EXT. MISS DEVINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A GHOST, a SPACEMAN, and an ICE SKATER stand on the porch

           The door opens and Miss Devine - in her witches hat - is on 
           the other side with a bowl of candy

                                 CHILDREN
                        Trick or treat!

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Wow! You look great!

           She holds out the bowl

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        You can each take two.

           They reach and grab handfuls before running off

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome.

           She’s about to turn back inside but then stops

           She looks at her pumpkin at the end of the porch

           INT. MISS DEVINE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Miss Devine flips through the directory

           She dials her phone and holds it to her ear

           But all the she hears is a persistent BEEP

           The call cannot be connected

           She hangs up
           EXT. MISS DEVINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Miss Devine peers out the front window and looks for trick-or-
           treaters but there’s no one outside

           She turns out the porch light

           INT. PARENT’S ROOM - MORNING

           Morning light floods through the window

           Peter is asleep under the covers

           The clock strikes 6:30am and the ALARM rings

           Peter slowly emerges from the sheets

           It wasn’t a dream - he gulps

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Peter looks out into the hallway

           He sees the tipped over book shelf and the door in the wall

                                 PETER
                        Hello?

           Nothing - silence

           He creeps across the floor to the staircase and looks 
           downstairs

           His Mother is still dead on the floor

           Flies swarm her corpse

           The Cat nibbles on her face

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           It ignores him

           Peter disappears down the hall and into his room

           He return with the red ball

           He throws it at The Cat - it hisses and skitters away

           Peter takes a deep breath then proceeds down the
           STAIRCASE

           The steps groan under his feet

           He covers his ears to hide from the buzzing of flies and 
           steps over his Mother

           His feet stick to the drying blood on the floor

           INT. KITCHEN

           Peter maneuvers around his Father’s body and the puddles of 
           bile

           He gets CEREAL from the closet and MILK from the refrigerator

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Peter carries his bowl of cereal to the couch

           He takes a seat and turns on the television

           A black & white Christmas movie is playing

           He glances at the KITCHEN - at his Father’s glassy eyes - 
           then looks back at the TV

           INT. KITCHEN

           The Cat stares at its empty food bowl

           It looks to Peter watching TV in the LIVING ROOM

           Then saunters over to the body on the kitchen floor

           As it sniffs the cold, dead flesh - it hears

                                                                   SCRATCH

           It raises its head - flicks its ears

                                                                   SCRATCH

                                                                   SCRATCH

           It wanders out of the kitchen

           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           The Cat stands waiting for
                                                                 SCRATCH

                                                                 SCRATCH

                                                                 SCRATCH

           That

           It sees the wallpaper and smells the bologna outside The Hole

           The Cat stalks towards The Wall and sniffs the meat

           It moves closer and closer

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           The cereal crunches in Peter’s ears as he eats

           He doesn’t hear the cat YOWLING upstairs

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Miss Devine stands in the empty classroom in front of the 
           Halloween pictures

           She stares at the blank space on the wall where Peter’s 
           painting was supposed to go

           She begins taking them down

                                                                   LATER

           Miss Devine finishes hanging the last of the Thanksgiving 
           decorations just as

           STUDENTS spill into the room

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Good morning.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Peter sits at the kitchen table writing in his work book

           A blanket is draped over his Father’s body

           He solves a math problem by counting on his fingers

           CUCKOO - CUCKOO - CUCKOO

           He watches the bird pop in and out of the cuckoo clock
           He looks to the refrigerator

                                                                   LATER

           Peter stands on a chair by the counter 

           He pours leftovers into the blender and starts it

           He watches the food turn to gray mush

           Once it’s finished, he pours the gruel into a cup and starts 
           out the door

           But he stops when something on the floor catches his eye

           He crouches down and picks up the FAMILY PORTRAIT, now free 
           from its frame

           He realizes the photo has been FOLDED - so he unfolds it

           And for the first time he sees the full picture of his family

           Mother, Father, Peter as a baby, and standing next to them

           His SISTER concealed under a SHROUD

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Peter carries a cup of gruel up the staircase

           He reaches the summit and starts down the hall

           Then stops

           He drops the cup

           His face turns white and his blood curdles

           Because the door in the wall is OPEN

           A bloody CAT BONE sticks out from the lock

           She got out                She got out

                         She got out                       She got out

           She got out                       She got out

           All he can do is stare into the darkness

           Eventually he cranes his neck and looks to his bedroom, his 
           parent’s bedroom, the bathroom
           She could be anywhere

           He looks down the stairs, past his Mother, at the FRONT DOOR

           He gulps

           The sprints down the 

           STAIRCASE

           He takes two steps at a time

           But just as he’s almost reached the bottom

                             His Mother’s corpse is DRAGGED out of sight

           He falls backwards and scrambles back up the stairs

           But he stops when he hears it

           Biting and crunching and slurping 

           She’s FEEDING

           He clasps his hands over his mouth to stifle his whimpers

           But one small cry escapes his lips

           She stops eating - goes quiet

           Then

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I hear you Peter...

           He hears Her FEET stomp across the floor

           He spins and bolts up the stairs

           He hears her racing behind him

           Getting closer and closer and closer

           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           Peter darts into his room and slams the door closed

                                                                    BANG

                                                                    BANG

                                                                    BANG
           He presses his back against the door and digs his feet

           He feels in his pockets

                                 PETER
                        No...

           Then hears the jangling of KEYS outside his room

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        It’s okay, Peter...
                        You don’t have to come out...

           He hears the door LOCK

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You can stay in there as long as 
                        you like...

           He listens to her footsteps walk to the stairs

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be waiting for when you want 
                        to come out and play...

           And then she’s gone

           Peter slides down the door and hugs his knees

           He crawls across the floor

           And hides under his bed

           INT. CAR - EVENING

           Miss Devine sits in traffic 

           She fiddles with the radio but all she can find is static

           She stares ahead at the unmoving vehicles and sighs

           The only cars getting anywhere are the ones turning right up 
           ahead

           As she watches car after car pass her, a thought occurs

           She chews her lip

           And makes the right
           EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING

           The sun sets behind the spooky old house atop the lonely hill

           No one could know the terrors within

           Miss Devine’s car comes to a stop on the road below

           INT. CAR

           Miss Devine looks up at the house

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        This is stupid

           She puts the gear back in drive

           But she doesn’t take her foot off the brake

           She sighs - back to park

           She turns off the engine

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        This is so stupid.

           EXT. THE HOUSE

           Miss Devine climbs out of her car

           She rubs her arms in the autumn chill

           She climbs up the hill

           Walks onto the dark PORCH

           And rings the doorbell

           She shivers and waits but there’s no response

           She rings again - knocks

           But maybe they’re not home - the lights are out

           She sighs and turns around

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        So stupid.

           But as she heads down the hill

           She hears the GROAN of hinges
           She looks back

           The front door is OPEN

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Silence

           INT. FOYER

           Miss Devine peers through the doorway and gazes into the 
           darkness

           A RUG covers the blood on the floor and the deep shadows hide 
           the other horrors

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Helloooo?

           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           Peter opens his eyes

           He’s lying under his bed and it’s dark and he defintely heard 
           something

                                 MISS DEVINE (O.S.)
                        Is someone home?

           No

           Peter scrambles from out under the bed and rushes to the door

           He beats his fists against the wood

                                 PETER
                        Miss Devine!

           INT. FOYER

           Miss Devine hears the pounding upstairs

           She hears the terror in his voice

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Peter?

           She rushes up the STAIRS 
           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           She follows the sound of Peter’s screams to the hall

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I’m coming!

           She jumps over the fallen bookshelf and runs to Peter’s door

           She tries the knob but it’s locked

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t open the door!

           She frantically looks around for any clue as to what to do 
           next

           It’s only then that she realizes what he’s been yelling at 
           her

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        You have to get out!

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        What?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        She escaped! She’s in the house! 
                        You have to leave before it’s too 
                        late!

           She tries to comprehend

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I don’t understand. Who is in the 
                        house?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        The Girl! 

           Then she sees the door and the cat bone sticking from out the 
           lock

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        What is...

           As Peter continues to pound at the door

           Miss Devine crouches and looks into the dark

           As she gets closer and closer

                                                                    BANG
           She jumps to her feet - it came from downstairs

           She hears the jangling of KEYS

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Run!

           She doesn’t - she walks up the hall to the STAIRS

           She looks down and sees the front door is SHUT

                                 PETER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        RUN!

           She looks back at Peter’s door finally starting to take him 
           seriously

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        I’m going to go get help. 
                        I’ll be right back.

           INT. FOYER

           Miss Devine hurries down the stairs and grabs the door

           But it’s LOCKED

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        No.

           She twists and pulls but it’s no use

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        No no no no.

           She goes to the WINDOW - grabs the BARS

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           She hears the CREAK of floorboards

           She freezes - the hairs on her neck stand on end

           She turns and looks into the darkness, realizing she’s not 
           alone

           After a moment of quiet that lasts an eternity

           She realizes what she’s staring at is not a shadow

           Because it MOVES
           She sprints through the HALLWAY into the 

           KITCHEN

           But she doesn’t see the LUMP under the blanket

           She TRIPS and flies forward

           Her chin smacks into the linoleum

           She moans in pain and grabs her knee

           She sees the disturbed blanket and Father’s head

           She screams and scrambles to her feet but collapses in agony

           She tries again, dragging herself to the BACK DOOR

           But that’s locked too

           Thinking fast, she lunges for the counter and pulls out 
           drawer after drawer until she finds 

           A KNIFE

           The footsteps get closer and closer and closer

           Her eyes SHUT, she spins and SLASHES

           Knife scrapes against bone, blood splashes across the floor, 
           and an inhuman CRY pierces her ears

           Miss Devine falls backwards, crashing into the counter

           She continues wildly swinging the blade through the air 

           But she’s alone - for now 

           She climbs to her feet

           Holding the knife in front of her, ready to strike at any 
           moment, she moves across the kitchen and steps on something

           She looks down at the KEYS under her foot

           She grabs them just as she hears another CRY from somewhere 
           in the dark

           She turns and darts for the BACK DOOR

           She hears the tearing of sinew and ripping of flesh
           She fumbles with the keys, trying one after another in the 
           lock until finally - it turns

           But she stops herself before opening it 

           She looks at the ceiling

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        God damn it.

           She leaves the door and turns around just as

           Something flies through the air

           Miss Devine dodges it as it SMACKS into the door behind her, 
           shutting it closed

           Mother’s head rolls across the floor and looks back at Miss 
           Devine

           She hears the footsteps approaching

           She rushes into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Guided by the light of the TV, Miss Devine backs away ready 
           to stab

           She backs into the wall and realizes there’s nowhere else to 
           go and the footsteps are slowly getting closer

           She thinks fast - dives behind the couch

           She looks out from underneath, the knife trembling in her 
           grip

           The TV flashes various patterns of light across the floor

           Until it’s UNPLUGGED, plunging the room into darkness

           Miss Devine holds her breath as the floorboards groan under 
           footsteps

           And then silence

           Followed by the sound of someone SNIFFING the air

           After a moment

           She hears a giggle
           INT. PETER’S ROOM

           Peter hears her SCREAM

                                 PETER
                        No!

           He pounds impotently against the door but it’s no use

           He’s forced to listen to the carnage down stairs - the 
           crashing and the breaking and the wailing

           He can’t stand it - he presses his hands against his ears

           And he stays like that for a long while

           Until finally he takes his hands away

           It’s quiet - he knows what that means

           He falls onto his knees and sinks

           Then he hears FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs

           Charging down the hall

           He crawls backwards away from the door

           He hears the jangling of keys 

           He hides behind his bed

           He sees the knob twist and the door open and

           Miss Devine on the other side

                                 MISS DEVINE
                        Peter!

           He can’t believe what he’s seeing

           She’s covered in blood, with deep LACERATIONS cut across her 
           body

           But she’s ALIVE

                                 MISS DEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Quickly!

           He jumps to his feet and runs to the door out into the
           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Miss Devine grabs his hand and pulls him across the hall

           They leap over the shelf and Miss Devine picks Peter into her 
           arms as they run down the STAIRCASE

           FOYER

           Miss Devine carries Peter to the bottom of the stairs

           She sets him down and hobbles to the door

           She fumbles with the keys

                                 PETER
                        Hurry!

           She’s trying

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        That one!

           She shoves the key in the lock but before she turns it

           A DROP of BLOOD lands on her hand

           She looks UP

           And SCREAMS

           INT. THE WALL

           Peter wakes with a GASP

           He’s in the DARK - he can’t see a thing

           All he can hear is the blood pumping in his ears and his 
           panicked breathing

           Whereever he is - it’s small and it’s cramped

           He bangs into the edges with every move

           He whimpers and cries and smacks against the wood
           He shifts around before seeing

           A single beam of LIGHT on the floor

           He rushes to it and crouches down

           He looks through The Hole into 

           HIS ROOM

                                 PETER
                        Hello...?

           He hears the CREAK of floorboards

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Miss Devine...are you there?

           After a moment 

           Miss Devine’s SEVERED HEAD is dropped onto the floor

           He screams and wails and howls until his voice is hoarse

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        It’s okay Peter...
                        You’re safe...
                        No one can hurt you anymore...
                        Not your bullies or your parents or 
                        anyone else...

           He reaches his hand through The Hole

                                 PETER
                        Please...
                        Let me out...

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.)
                        You’ll get used to the dark...
                        You’ll find comfort in the cold...
                        We have plenty of meat...
                        And when we run out...
                        I’ll find us more...

           He retracts his hand

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I brought you a gift...

           She rolls the RED BALL through The Hole

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Your big sister is going to take 
                        care of you...
           He hears her footsteps creeping to the door

                                 THE GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now good night...
                        Sleep tight...
                        Don’t let the bed bugs bite...

           She turns off the light

           Closes the door

           He’s all alone

           In the dark

           In the cold

                                 PETER
                        Help me...

                                                                 THE END
