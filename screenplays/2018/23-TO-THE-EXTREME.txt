                                   TO THE EXTREME

           INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

           VANILLA ICE (23) sits in front of us, mid-interview. 
           Chiseled jaw. Hair in a pompadour with a streak of blonde 
           in front. Lines shaved through his eyebrows and temple. 

           He beams with confidence and virility, at the top of his 
           game. But he also looks pained, like he’s trying to 
           articulate a complex idea. He takes a second, then:

                                 ICE
                        We sampled it from them but it’s not the 
                        same baseline. It goes DING DING DING 
                        DIGA DING DING. DING DING DING DIGA DING 
                        DING. That’s the way theirs goes. Ours 
                        goes DING DING DING TING AHH DING DING. 
                        DING DING DING TING AHH DING DING. That 
                        little bitty TING. It’s not the same!

           His mouth widens into a giant grin, like he got away with 
           something big. Before he can say another word --

           FLASH CUTS OF

           -- Parachute pants, glimmering under stage lights...

           -- an American Music Award, thrust into the air...

           -- screaming fans climbing over each other onto stage...

           -- a motorcycle pedal dropping, the asphalt burning by...

           -- a “#1” pendant dangling from a gold chain...

           -- a light array firing, illuminating Ice standing 
           defiantly, in a star-spangled red and blue suit... 

           The image forms the cover art of his first album. The 
           album. You know the one. A title fades up below his feet:

                                     TO THE EXTREME

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Spoonie Gee’s SPOONIN’ RAP record sits on a dusty shelf. 
           This is, by contrast, simple, unremarkable even. Just a 
           sleeve with a cutout, displaying a clean yellow label. 

           CLOSE ON the face of ROBBIE VAN WINKLE (12) a skinny, 
           innocent looking white boy staring at it in awe. No 
           Vanilla. No Ice. Not yet. 
                                  MIAMI LAKES, FLORIDA
                                       JUNE, 1979

           Robbie glances behind him. Coast is clear. Sneaking 
           toward the shelf, he picks up the record gently.

           CLOSE ON a needle dropping.

           CLOSE ON the vinyl spinning, crackling. 

           CLOSE ON a giant pair of headphones as Robbie slips them 
           on, the opening bars of SPOONIN’ RAP ringing out.

           He falls back on the bed, high on the sound. Behind him, 
           out of focus, SOMEONE enters the room, stopping and 
           standing there, eerily quiet.

           Oblivious, Robbie shuts his eyes as the music rises. A 
           hand enters frame slowly. Robbie still has no idea. 

           SLAP! The headphones fly off his head. He jolts upright, 
           staring in horror at --

           His big brother KIP (16), who grabs Robbie by the neck 
           and lifts him off the bed, pinning him to the wall.

                                 KIP
                        I told you to stay out of my room!

           Squirming out of his grasp, Robbie bounces off the bed, 
           right into -- THE RECORD PLAYER. It CRASHES to the floor, 
           the record skittering out of it. 

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        You little shit!

           Robbie crawls to the record, grabbing it instinctively 
           and hugging it to his chest with everything he’s got as 
           Kip grips the top of it, trying to rip it away from him.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Let go Robbie!

                                 ROBBIE
                        I just want to listen to it!

                                 KIP
                        Yeah well it’s not yours!

                                 ROBBIE
                        I DON’T CARE!!

           Kip balls his fist and punches Robbie square in the face.
           INT. ROBBIE’S KITCHEN  - LATER 

           CLOSE ON a massive black eye. Robbie adjusts a bag of ice 
           over it as Kip shuffles in.

                                 ROBBIE
                                (standing)
                        Let me hang with you and your boys.

           Kip swings around, ready to hit him again.

                                 KIP
                        You don’t get it do you? Fucking retard. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Get what?

                                 KIP
                        It’s not your record. It’s mine. They’re 
                        not your boys. They’re mine. You’re you. 
                        I’m me. So back the fuck off, Robbie. 

           INT./EXT. ROBBIE’S LIVING ROOM  - LATER 

           Robbie sits on the windowsill glumly, holding the bag of 
           ice to his eye, watching something in the driveway.

           Kip and A GROUP OF BLACK AND LATINO TEENAGERS are 
           gathered around a scrap of cardboard, surrounded by dirt 
           bikes, attempting to break dance to SPOONIN’ RAP. 

           CLOSE ON Robbie, full of envy and unrest. Wanting 
           everything his brother has. More.

           EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY 

           The muscular, sinewy body of a white guy break dancing to 
           BDP’s THE BRIDGE IS OVER pouring out of a boom box. 

           As he spins toward us, we recognize him, barely. It’s 
           Robbie, now 20. Hair shaggy, in an undershirt and kakis. 

                                      DALLAS, TEXAS
                                        MAY, 1987

           He’s joined by CHILL (21), black, jovial, with a high-top 
           fade and SHAY (19), black and Mexican, short but crazy 
           athletic as they dance on cardboard next to a dumpster.

           Robbie does a stabbed windmill into a backspin as Chill 
           and Shay holler. He’s gotten GOOD -- way better than Kip. 
                                 CHILL
                        Move out the way. Let a pro get in.

           Chill one-ups him with a toprock. They’re all GOOD. 

                                 SHAY
                        He topped your ass!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Nah. Check it.

           Robbie jumps back in and does a handglide into a freeze. 

                                 CHILL
                        Get the fuck out with that fake shit -- 

           Robbie strains, his body weight completely suspended on 
           one hand. He spins upward into a handstand, then descends 
           into an inverted chair pose, a move known as --

                                 SHAY 
                        Oh shit! The Icey-Ice! 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Robbie?

           They pay no attention, Robbie continuing with his epic 
           combination. Chill shaking his head, unimpressed.

                                 VOICE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Robbie!

           Robbie looks up at Kip (now 24), tucked in red polo, 
           pleated kakis, graduated from rebel to young Republican.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Jump in, Kip!

                                 KIP
                        No fucking way. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why not? 

                                 SHAY
                        ‘Cause he’s too pussy to battle lil’ bro!

           Kip scowls at Shay. 

                                 KIP
                        I’m not a fucking kid, alright? Grow up.
                                (to Robbie)
                        Customer’s looking for you.
           Robbie reaches for the boom box and turns down the music. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Can’t you help him? 

                                 KIP
                        Your lunch ended fifteen minutes ago. 

                                 SHAY
                        Okay, officer. 

           Robbie flips into a standing position.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Alright y’all...

                                 CHILL
                        City Lights tonight. Don’t forget. 

           Robbie nods and puts on his own identical red polo shirt, 
           two sizes too large, leaving it untucked. 

           INT. MINO’S CAR LOT - SHOWROOM FLOOR - DAY

           A reluctant SOCCER MOM (40’s) holding a BABY, listens as 
           Robbie tells her about a flashy white Camaro Iroc-Z. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Now this is what I drive. And you and 
                        your whole family would look good in it. 

                                 SOCCER MOM
                        It’s a two-door.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah but there’s plenty of room in back.

           She shakes her head, her eyes wandering.

                                 SOCCER MOM
                        What about that minivan over there? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Every mom’s driving a minivan though. 
                        Don’t you want to stand out?

           She shoots him a wary look: “Not really.” 

           INT. BRYON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Robbie enters a sterile office. Employee of the month 
           plaques on the wall. A nice one of Kip. None of Robbie. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        Wanted to see me?

           BRYON MINO (49), stocky, goateed, Robbie’s boss and 
           stepdad, sits behind his cheap desk, typing with two 
           index fingers on a giant computer.

                                 BYRON
                        You close that sale? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        She needed more time to think. 

                                 BYRON
                        I’m sure she did. She came in wanting a 
                        family vehicle and you tried to sell her 
                        a gangbangers’ car.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yo, that’s my car --

                                 BYRON
                        Is that supposed to reassure me?

           Robbie shrugs. Bryon pushes his chair toward his office 
           window, pointing toward the showroom.

                                 BRYON
                        You should be able to see who’s in that 
                        showroom and know what they want. That 
                        kid right there, fresh out of college?

           Byron points to a clueless PREPPY WHITE KID.

                                 BYRON
                        He’s looking for a fisher price “My First 
                        Grown-Up car.” So show him a Civic. Don’t 
                        show him a fucking Dodge Viper. How ‘bout 
                        that guy right there? What do you see?

           He points to a well-dressed BLACK MAN. Robbie shrugs.

                                 BYRON (CONT’D)
                        That’s who you should sell a flashy car 
                        to...if he could afford it. 

           Robbie’s brow furrows. Not cool with this.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why you putting people in boxes man?

                                 BYRON
                                (ignoring the question)
                        Look at Kip. He falls in line. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BYRON (CONT'D)
                        That’s why he’s crushing it. I’m doing 
                        your mom a solid letting you work here. 
                        Now you do me a favor. Judge the book by 
                        it’s cover and sell some fucking cars. 

           INT. SHOWROOM FLOOR - RECEPTION AREA

           Shuffling out of Bryon’s office, deflated, Robbie glances 
           up at the black receptionist, SADIE (22), self-possessed,  
           sharp-eyed, sitting behind the front desk. 

           He straightens his posture, musters up some swagger. 
           Heads toward her. She sees right through it.

                                 SADIE
                        Byron ripped into you again, huh? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Nah, I told him what was up. 

                                 SADIE
                        Sure you did. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yo, what are you doing tonight?

                                 SADIE
                        Nothing with you. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        So now it’s like that, huh? 

                                 SADIE
                        When hasn’t it been?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Girl, you need to lighten up and roll 
                        with us to City Lights.

                                 SADIE
                        You have no idea what I need. 
                                (beat)
                        Good luck getting in. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Chill dances there. He got the hook-up. 

                                 SADIE
                        From who?

                                 ROBBIE
                                (no idea)
                        He’s the man. VIP status.
                                 SADIE
                        Uh huh. 

           The phone rings. She picks up. 

                                 SADIE (CONT’D)
                        Mino’s car lot. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Come with us. 

           She waves at Robbie to go away. He doesn’t move. 

                                 SADIE (ON PHONE)
                        No sir, you might want to try a certified 
                        Toyota dealership. You too. 

           She hangs up, glaring at Robbie.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Come on. It’ll be fun. 

                                 SADIE
                        Look, I’m not fucking with you and 
                        scrubby ass little Chill. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Your loss girl. What can I say. 

                                 SADIE
                        You said too much already. 

           He shrugs “whatever” as a MONTAGE BEGINS...

           -- Robbie drives in his Iroc-Z with his speakers up LOUD,  
           rapping along to the track PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1...

           -- Robbie flips through CD’s in a Sam Goody, pulling out 
           “Yo! Bum Rush The Show by Public Enemy,” “Criminal 
           Minded” by BDP and “Born to Mack” by Too Short...

           -- Robbie slides three gray Russell sweatshirts and three 
           pairs of Dickies across the counter at Sears...

           -- Robbie pays for white spray paint at a local art 
           store, throwing down a handful of crumpled bills...

           -- Kneeling in his garage, he “whites out” his dirty 
           rims, even spray-painting the tread on his tires.
                                 ROBBIE (RAPPING)
                                (under his breath)
                        Robbie’s what they call me / rhymes they 
                        come so freely / like I stole ‘em out the 
                        sky or from a writer on a movie...

           EXT. ROBBIE’S DRIVEWAY - DAY

           BETH (46), Robbie’s mom, tough faced, fried blonde hair, 
           pulls up in a minivan, getting out with groceries.

                                 BETH
                        Why you doing that again, Robbie?

           Robbie stops spray painting, glancing up at her.

                                 ROBBIE
                        ‘Cause I like it all whited out, ma.

                                 BETH
                        I don’t understand it. 

                                 ROBBIE
                                (shrugging)
                        Black gets dirty too quick. White stays 
                        clean, even in the mud.

                                 BETH
                        Well you’re gonna get pulled over.

           Robbie side-eyes his mom, not liking the implication.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 BETH
                        You should put on a mask or something. 
                        That stuff stinks. And when you’re done, 
                        come help me with dinner. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Beth chops carrots on a cutting board as a kettle boils 
           behind her. She reaches for it. Burns her hand.

                                 BETH
                        Owe!

           Bryon sits across from Kip at the kitchen table, reading 
           the sports section of the paper. They glance up at her.
                                 BRYON 
                        Need a hand, hun?

                                 BETH
                        No -- Robbie’s suppose to be helping me. 

                                 KIP
                        Good luck with that. 

           Beth turns the burner off and huffs toward... 

           INT. HALLWAY 

           ...Robbie’s room. A sign reads “UNSTABLE AREA, DO NOT 
           ENTER,” on the door. The baseline of I’M BAD by LL Cool J 
           vibrates the family photos in the hall. She enters.

           INT. ROBBIE’S ROOM

           Messy. Hiphop posters cover the walls. A dusty stack of 
           motocross trophies in the corner.

           Robbie looks up at her, midway through putting on a thin 
           gold chain over one of his new gray sweatshirts.

                                 BETH
                        It’s too loud. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What? 

                                 BETH 
                        Can you turn it down, please?

           He nods, lowering the volume on his boom box.

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        I asked you to help me with dinner.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I would but I gotta jet.

                                 BETH
                        Where you going?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Just...out, ma. 

           Beth crosses her arms. 

                                 BETH
                        Why you doing this, Robbie?
                                 ROBBIE
                        Doing what?

                                 BETH
                        Avoiding us. Spending all your time at 
                        clubs in the worst part of town with...
                         (pointing to an NWA poster)
                        ...these people.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Easy, Cube and Dre? I wish. 

                                 BETH
                        You understand what I’m saying. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Not really. 

                                 BETH
                        When you did motocross, I was scared you 
                        were gonna break your neck. But at least 
                        it was constructive. This is just...

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m fine, ma. Trust me. 

           Headlights through Robbie’s window. The sound of a car 
           pulling up. More thick base. A horn honks.

           Robbie smiles and kisses Beth on the forehead, hurrying 
           out before she can get in another word. 

           EXT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           WE DESCEND from a neon Marquee reading “CITY LIGHTS // 
           TALENT SHOW TUESDAYS” down to a LONG LINE OF PEOPLE, 
           mostly black, dressed in the freshest 80’s fashions. 

           The most attractive faces are up front, the quality of 
           the line diminishing the farther back we go, until we 
           land on: Robbie and Shay at the very end. Chumps. 

           Chill joins them, flustered.

                                 CHILL
                        Bum-ass bouncer doesn’t believe I danced 
                        here, man.

                                 ROBBIE
                        This is a bad look.

                                 SHAY
                        Ay! There goes Sadie right there!
           Robbie whips around, following Shay’s gaze toward the 
           front of the line, where Sadie and TWO GIRLFRIENDS exit a 
           cab, the BOUNCER unhooking a velvet rope for them.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Man she said she wasn’t coming tonight! 
                        Don’t let her see us -- 

                                 SHAY
                        Sadie! Sadie!

                                 ROBBIE
                                (eyes widening)
                        What the fuck, Shay!

           Sadie squints at them, recognizing Robbie. 

                                 SHAY
                                (far off)
                        Tell him we’re with you!

                                 SADIE’S GIRLFRIEND
                        Awe hell no!

           Sadie shakes her head, sauntering inside with the girls.

           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - LATER

           Robbie, Chill and Shay are next up in line. They look 
           Embarrassed. Exhausted. Waiting for hours.

                                 BOUNCER
                                (to Chill)
                        Oh there he is. The “dancer.”

           Chill nods politely, on his best behavior. 

                                 BOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Whose the white boy? 

                                 CHILL
                        My homie. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        You trying to start a fight? Get the fuck 
                        out of here. 

                                 CHILL
                        Come on man, we waited in line. Like you 
                        said. Just talk to Tommy --

                                 BOUNCER
                        I ain’t talking to Tommy for you! 
           Chill nods, apologetic. The bouncer mad dogs him.

                                 CHILL
                        Alright. Let’s go, y’all. 

           He turns away. Robbie and Shay follow. A flash of pity in 
           the bouncer’s eyes: these guys are pathetic. He sighs.

                                 BOUNCER
                        You’re lucky we ain’t at capacity. 

           He unhooks the velvet rope. 

           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Robbie, Chill and Shay enter, looking meek. The Tuesday 
           night talent show is under way. A heavy break beat 
           pounding. Robbie’s the only white person there. 

           On stage MC CONCRETE (25), a poor man’s Big Daddy Kane, 
           spits an underwhelming verse.

                                 MC CONCRETE (RAPPING)
                        Call me Concrete / Move your feet / You 
                        know how I creep / Between the sheets!
                                (beat)
                        I’m talking ‘bout sex, y’all!

           The audience roars. Robbie, Chill and Shay cringe.

                                 CHILL
                        That is some wack ass shit.

                                 SHAY
                        Why do they love this fool so much?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Cause he brought his friends. That’s why.

           They look over at 20 SCRUBBY DUDES, his cheering section. 

                                 CHILL
                        More like paid his friends. 

           Robbie spots Sadie at the foot of the stage, eating it 
           up. MC Concrete raps right to her. 

                                 MC CONCRETE (RAPPING)
                        Sex sex sex / I flex flex flex / tap one 
                        bitch / then it’s next next next! 

           Cheers all around. A fire burns in Robbie’s eyes as he 
           stares at Concrete gyrating in front of Sadie. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        Man, this no-talent fool gets the 
                        spotlight while we gotta wait at the back 
                        of the motherfucking line?

           Chill eyes Robbie, then glances at Shay. Whispers 
           something to him. Shay grins, darting off. 

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s he going?

                                 CHILL
                        Just getting some drinks.

           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - LATER

           A female rapper with cornrows, DA RUGRAT, freestyles. 

                                 DA RUGRAT (RAPPING)
                        See me at the club / saying you want to 
                        be more than friends / that all depends / 
                        on how much your crusty ass spends!

           The ladies scream as the beat fades and the silken-voiced 
           manager JOHN BUSH (45) steps in front of the crowd. 

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Da Rugrat, ya’ll! Give it up. Da Rugrat. 

           More drunken cheers. John Bush lifts a notecard up. 

                                 JOHN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Next up...we got...let’s see 
                        here...Robbie Van Winkle? What the fuck 
                        kinda name is that?

           Laughter. At the bar, Robbie sits next to Chill and Shay, 
           his eyes wide as saucers. Terrified. 

                                 JOHN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I see. Robbie Van Winkle AKA MC 
                        Vanilla. MC Vanilla get your ass up here! 

           Chill and Shay crack up, drunk. Robbie spins toward them.

                                 ROBBIE
                        What the fuck did you do?

                                 CHILL
                        You wanted the spotlight? There it is!

                                 ROBBIE
                        That’s not what I meant!
                                 SHAY
                        Can’t back out now, kid!

           INT. STAGE WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Robbie timidly approaches the back of the DJ booth. The 
           DJ, EARTHQUAKE (26), tall, imposing, looks down at him.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        You MC Vanilla?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah, um, my friends were just clowning --

           Earthquake ignores him, pointing to his record crate.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        What beat you want? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Nah, I’m good.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        No you ain’t. Pick a record. Or I’ll pick 
                        one for you.  

           Robbie hesitates, still uncertain. Glancing at the 
           selection. Recognizing something. A clean yellow label.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Is that Spoonie Gee?

           Earthquake nods, grabbing and loading the record.

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, hold up, I was just --

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Come on, white boy, you wasting time.

           Robbie swallows, in a cold sweat.

           INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           He steps into the spotlight, holding a mic. Laughter 
           abounds. The crowd jeering. John Bush squints at him. 

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Oh shit, I see why they call you Vanilla.

                                 AUDIENCE GUY (O.C.)
                        Go home white boy!
           WHIZZ! A can of beer flies an inch past Robbie’s face. 

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Ay! I’m up here too, alright? No throwing 
                        shit or your ass is getting thrown out! 

           The sound of Robbie’s HEARTBEAT and HEAVY BREATHING as he 
           stares, deer in the headlights. His eyes dart from --

           -- Chill and Shay, rolling with laughter at the bar, to

           -- MC Concrete, talking shit to his friends, to 

           -- Sadie, staring up at him. Not laughing at all. 
           Wondering how he’s gonna get out of this alive.

           Robbie’s face hardens. Determination in his eyes. We saw 
           this in ‘79. But it’s fiercer now. Dangerous even. 

                                 JOHN BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s try to keep it together, and 
                        give a warm City Lights welcome to 
                        Dallas’ own...MC Vanilla.

           The opening bars of SPOONIN’ RAP hit. Robbie bobs his 
           head, getting into it. On the first beat of the verse, a 
           switch flips. He jumps in, no fucks given.

                                 ROBBIE (RAPPING)
                        On ‘til the break of dawn / MC Vanilla 
                        does transform / comin’ out of my shell / 
                        I’m making you yell / while I’m looking 
                        in the crowd / wondering if you can tell 
                        / that something is off / why is Concrete 
                        so soft / He tried to pour it on / but 
                        his rhymes got lost / With his sex sex 
                        sex / he can flex flex flex / up his own 
                        asshole / he’s got no real soul / ‘cause 
                        even a whiteboy / puts on a better show --

           The crowd stirs, not expecting this. Robbie leans down, 
           rapping right to MC Concrete:

                                 ROBBIE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        -- You say you’re creeping in the sheets 
                        / but you can’t ride a beat / and you 
                        paid your friends to be here / just so 
                        you could compete --

           A collective gasp. Nailed it. Concrete’s face drops. 
                                 ROBBIE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        -- So make fun of my name / Doesn’t feel 
                        like defeat / ‘cause I’m still from the 
                        street / where I piss on Concrete!

           The crowd explodes, despite themselves.

           In a VIP booth at the far end of the bar, TOMMY QUON 
           (35), Chinese American, dapper, in a tailored gray suit, 
           stares at Robbie, not sure what to make of him.

                                 ROBBIE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        You heard me bust a rhyme / You know I 
                        ride a beat / but none of y’all can fuck 
                        with how I move my feet --

           Robbie drops the mic and flips into a break dancing 
           combination. The one we saw him practicing. His 
           adrenaline pumping, he hits it flawlessly.

                                 AUDIENCE GIRL
                        Oh shit! Go whiteboy, go whiteboy, go!

           The crowd starts chanting those infamous five words...

                                 ENTIRE CROWD
                        Go whiteboy, go whiteboy, go!

           Sadie gazes up at him. A giant grin on her face. Chill 
           and Shay stare, mouths agape, blindsided.

           INT. ROOM - DAY

           Robbie lies asleep, dead to the world, the roar of the 
           crowd still reverberating like a dream. 

           WE ROTATE around him, from horizontal to vertical: he’s 
           sitting against a wall in a break room, passed out. 

                                 KIP (O.C.)
                        Jesus. Wake the fuck up, Robbie. This is 
                        embarrassing. 

           He blinks awake, wincing, hungover. Kip glowers at him. 

           INT. MINO’S CAR LOT - SHOWROOM FLOOR - DAY

           Robbie speaks to a BORING GUY IN KHAKIS (40’s) sizing up 
           a Toyota Corolla. Bryon watches him through his blinds.
                                 ROBBIE
                                (robotic)
                        It’ll get you from point A to B with the 
                        highest savings. It’s best in its class.

                                 GUY IN KHAKIS
                        Let me think about it...

           The guy walks away, uninterested. As he exits the 
           dealership, he bumps past someone entering. 

           A familiar face: it’s Tommy Quon. In his suit, he looks 
           like a high roller, especially here. Bryon takes note as 
           Tommy’s eyes land on Robbie, who approaches dutifully. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Anything catch your eye?

                                 TOMMY
                        You did actually. 

                                 ROBBIE
                                (hesitating)
                        What do you mean?

                                 TOMMY
                        At City Lights. Your performance -- I’ve 
                        never seen anything like it.

                                 ROBBIE
                                (quietly)
                        Um...thanks...

           Byron approaches them, smiling widely at Tommy.

                                 BYRON
                        Robbie answering all of your questions?

                                 TOMMY
                        Yes. He is. 

                                 BRYON
                        Good. Let us know if there’s anything 
                        else we can do.

           Byron gives Robbie a look, “Don’t fuck this up,” then 
           walks away. When he’s gone...

                                 TOMMY
                        Why don’t we meet tomorrow. At ten AM.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but who 
                        are you, exactly?
           Tommy nods, fair question, then gives Robbie a card. It 
           reads simply: “Tommy Quon.” 

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        This doesn’t tell me much.

                                 TOMMY
                        Tomorrow. Ten O’clock. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Look, man, I got work --

                                 TOMMY
                        You’ll figure something out. 

           He pats Robbie on the shoulder and walks away. Robbie 
           glances at the card again, confused. 

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        You know who that was?

           Robbie looks up at Sadie as she approaches him.

                                 ROBBIE
                        He said he saw me at the club. 

                                 SADIE
                        He owns the club. I can’t believe he came 
                        in here...What did he want?

                                 ROBBIE
                        To meet with me. Tomorrow morning.

                                 SADIE
                        He’s gonna sign you! 

                                 ROBBIE
                        If I took off Bryon would lose his mind. 

                                 SADIE
                        Hold up. Can I speak to MC Vanilla, 
                        please? The dude who turned a crowd of 
                        bloodthirsty motherfuckers into his 
                        personal fan club in five minutes? 

           Robbie blushes. Sadie persists. 

                                 SADIE (CONT’D)
                        You better find a way. Trust me, Robbie. 
                        This shit won’t come knocking twice. 
           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Robbie eats dinner with Beth, Bryon and Kip. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hey, so, um, I was wondering if I could 
                        get the morning off tomorrow...

           Byron freezes, mid-bite, staring at Robbie. 

                                 BYRON
                        Why would I give you the morning off?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I got a meeting. 

                                 BYRON
                        A meeting, huh? With who?

                                 ROBBIE
                        That guy in the suit. Asian dude.

                                 BYRON
                        The one you couldn’t close?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah. No. I mean, he’s actually the owner 
                        of a club I performed at --

                                 BYRON
                        You performed at? 

                                 KIP
                        He’s got a little dance routine. I’ve 
                        seen him “practicing” by the dumpsters. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah, well, he wants to talk to me about 
                        that. And, you know...rapping. 

                                 BETH
                                (sickened)
                        Oh, Robbie...

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s just a few hours...Please?

                                 BYRON
                        Absolutely not. It’s President’s Day 
                        weekend, for Christ’s sake! End of 
                        discussion. 

           Robbie nods, despondent, then pushes his chair back, 
           heading to his room, slamming his door.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Robbie breakdances with Chill and Shay at their spot.

                                 CHILL
                        Look, Tommy’s an important man. A 
                        businessman. And time waits for no man. 

                                 SHAY
                        That’s a metaphor.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        For real, what am I supposed to do?

           Chill glances across the lot at a Ross Dress for Less. 

                                 CHILL
                        Give me like thirty bucks.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why do I gotta give you money?

                                 CHILL
                        Trust me! I got you, homie. 

           Robbie shakes his head. Takes out a money clip.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Just keep it low key.

           INT. MINO’S CAR LOT - DAY

           Chill walks in wearing a cheap beige suit and an ascot. 
           Robbie sees him, catching his drift, hurrying over. He 
           glances at a tag on Chill’s lapel, rips it off quickly.

                                 ROBBIE 
                        Can I help you, sir?

                                 CHILL
                                (loudly)
                        I have a great deal of money! And I would 
                        like to test out your finest automobile! 

           Byron watches from his office window. 

                                 CHILL (CONT’D)
                        Show me a Mercedes Benz! Chop chop!

                                 ROBBIE
                                (hiding his frustration)
                        Absolutely, sir. 
           INT. BRYON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Robbie enters, heading to a pegboard and grabbing a 
           labelled set of Benz keys.

                                 BYRON
                        Five hundred series? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yup. 

           Bryon glances out of his window again at Chill, who has 
           his hand on his chin in an exaggerated thinker’s pose.

                                 BYRON
                        He looks familiar. Has he come by before?

           Robbie meets Byron’s eyes, silent for a beat, then --

                                 ROBBIE
                                (matter of fact)
                        They all look the same to me. 

           Bryon nods, “Good point” as Robbie heads for the door.

           INT./EXT. BENZ - DAY 

           Chill drives the Benz, grinning wildly. Robbie sits 
           shotgun. They’re pushing 80 down a residential street.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Man I said low-key!

                                 CHILL
                        Look, if you want to meet Tommy Quon in a 
                        busted ass Jetta that’s your prerogative.

           They hit a bump, sparks flying.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Slow the fuck down! 

                                 CHILL
                        Relax! This shit’s got like, five hundred 
                        horsepower. And check it!

           Chill flips a switch and the convertible top goes down. 
           EXT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - DAY

           They pull up and break hard in front of the club, 
           Robbie’s hair windswept into the pompadour we’ll come to 
           know as his trademark. He glances in the mirror.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Look at my fucking hair man! I gotta meet 
                        Tommy like this? 

                                 CHILL
                        Looks kinda dope, you ask me.

           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - DAY

           Robbie enters, looking around. Barely seems like the same 
           place. The daylight reveals how dusty and beat up it is. 

           John Bush, the talent show host, sits at the bar, reading 
           a paper. He glances up at him, grinning.

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Well look who it is. The funky white boy. 
                        Get a haircut? 

                                 ROBBIE
                                (sheepishly)
                        Tommy wanted to meet --

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Of course he did. Let me take you back...

           INT. TOMMY’S OFFICE 

           Tommy sits at his desk, doing paperwork. John enters, 
           leading Robbie in. He stops short, taking in the decor: a 
           shrine to Elvis, full of an absurd amount of memorabilia. 

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Welcome to Graceland.

                                 TOMMY
                                (to Robbie)
                        He loves giving me shit... 

           John smiles warmly and exits. Robbie continues to scan 
           the walls: Elvis posters, framed album covers, press 
           photos, movie props, a signed guitar...

                                 ROBBIE
                        I guess I don’t need to ask you who your 
                        favorite artist is. 
                                 TOMMY
                        You a fan?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Honestly, Mr. Quon?

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s Tommy. Please. Take a seat. 

           Robbie nods, sitting in a plush blue suede chair. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I never really vibed with his sound. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Why not?

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s just a little too...

           Robbie hesitates.

                                 TOMMY
                        Rockabilly?

                                 ROBBIE
                        White. 
                                (beat)
                        I guess that’s funny coming from me. 

                                 TOMMY
                        No, you’re right...in retrospect. He 
                        influenced generations of white 
                        musicians, really the entirety of 
                        contemporary rock today. But if you were 
                        in the audience the first time he 
                        performed at the Overton Park Orchestra 
                        Shell in Memphis on July 30th, 1954...

           Tommy points to something on his wall...a framed B&W 
           photo of Elvis on a shabby stage, sweating, hips swaying. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        ...you know what you would have seen?

           Robbie shakes his head, not sure where this is going.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        An unknown nineteen year-old white boy 
                        strutting and singing like Ivory Joe 
                        Hunter, Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Who were they?
                                 TOMMY
                        They were black. 

           A silent beat. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You saying he stole their sound?

                                 TOMMY
                        Some thought so. But Elvis wasn’t doing 
                        black culture. He wasn’t doing white 
                        culture. He was doing American culture. 
                        It wasn’t a race thing. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 TOMMY
                        He was a poor southern kid. He listened 
                        to the music of his class. It didn’t 
                        matter that it was black. It was what he 
                        knew. Even if no one in white America 
                        could understand it. Actually, their lack 
                        of understanding, their discomfort, made 
                        him a novelty. Then a staple. Then the 
                        most famous musician in the world. 

           Robbie adjusts in his chair uncomfortably. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        So what...you want me to wear a jumpsuit?

           Tommy laughs. 

                                 TOMMY
                        I want you to be true to yourself. Even 
                        when everyone tells you you’re acting 
                        like someone else. 

           Robbie’s moved by this. He’s never heard someone put it 
           in these terms before. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You keep doing what you did Tuesday 
                        night. On stage. On a record. And I sort 
                        out the rest. How’s that sound? 

           Robbie looks at him for a moment, then grins.

           EXT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - DAY

           Tommy opens the door and sees Robbie out. 
                                 TOMMY
                        Oh, Robbie, your name. MC Vanilla? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        What about it?

                                 TOMMY
                        Too many “MC’s” out there. We need 
                        something original.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        Like what? 

           INT./EXT. BENZ - DAY

           Chill sits with Robbie in the parked Benz.

                                 CHILL 
                        Vanilla Ice? 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yeah.

                                 CHILL
                        Sounds like a motherfucking popsicle!

                                 ROBBIE
                        He said it was ‘cause I’m smooth as 
                        Vanilla. Cool as Ice. 

                                 CHILL
                        And you bought that shit?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Fuck you, man. I just got signed. Show 
                        some love! Come on. 

                                 CHILL
                        Look, Tommy Quon can call you MC Purple 
                        Freeze Pop as long as we can call you 
                        rich! Let’s celebrate. Cruise the strip. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Alright, but we gotta make it quick. 

           INT. MINO’S CAR LOT - DAY

           Sadie sits at reception, looking worried, watching Byron 
           tear into Robbie through his office window. 
           INT. BRYON’S OFFICE 

                                 BYRON
                        What test drive takes three hours?!

                                 ROBBIE
                        He couldn’t make up his mind --

                                 BYRON
                        Bullshit! You went to your lil’ meeting, 
                        didn’t you? After I told you not to!

           Robbie considers covering but then shrugs, “Fuck it.”

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m sorry, Byron. I couldn’t pass it up. 

                                 BYRON
                        Well, I’m docking your paycheck.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Fine.

                                 BYRON
                        Plus a fee for the sales you lost us!

                                 ROBBIE
                        Yo man, that’s not fair --

                                 BYRON
                        You have to learn there are consequences 
                        to your actions. You can’t just do what 
                        you want all the time. This is real life. 

           Robbie glances out the window at the showroom floor. Sees 
           Sadie eyeing them. Turns back to Byron. Can’t stay quiet. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Nah, it ain’t.

                                 BYRON
                        Excuse me?

                                 ROBBIE
                        This is your life. It ain’t mine. 

                                 BYRON
                        What’s that suppose to mean?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Means don’t worry about taking anything 
                        out of my paycheck. You can keep it. 
                                 BYRON
                        Oh, so, what, you’re quitting now? 

           Robbie stands, heading for the door.

                                 BRYON
                        You think your mom’s gonna support you? 
                        You think I am? You’re a high school 
                        dropout. What are you gonna do, Robbie? 

           Bryon follows Robbie as he walks out, shouting after him.

                                 BYRON
                        Seriously? What are you gonna do?!

           Robbie doesn’t turn back, walking toward Sadie, with the 
           hint of a smile as we hear the opening bars of one of his 
           earliest songs, called “Ice is Workin’ It”.

           EXT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           WE DECEND ON the marquee again, which now reads: “TONIGHT 
           MC HAMMER” and below that: “w/ VANILLA ICE.”

                                     SEPTEMBER, 1988

           There’s a line double the length of the one we saw 
           before, THREE BOUNCERS vetting people at the door. 

           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB 

           Robbie’s onstage, wearing a Russell sweatshirt and three 
           gold chains, his hair gelled up into a pompadour, 
           performing the song, totally in his element. 

           Chill and Shay dance with him, DJ Earthquake on the 
           turntables, the CROWD packed wall-to-wall.

           From here on out, we’ll refer to Robbie as “Ice.”

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        The Ice rhymer is back and living large / 
                        and when I’m at a show, you better wear 
                        camouflage / ‘Cause there were plenty who 
                        thought I couldn’t swing this / But now 
                        what I get from the crowd is just a 
                        pumped fist --

           The crowd hollers, pumping their fists in unison as Ice 
           goes into a heavy part of his dance routine, giving it 
           everything he’s got, Chill and Shay in time with him. 
           Tommy watches from his private booth, smiling proudly. 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Ice enters, pulling off his sweatshirt. Sadie stands from 
           a makeup chair, wrapping her arms around him. 

                                 SADIE
                        That was amazing baby. 

           He smiles and kisses her, picking her up and sitting her 
           on the counter against the mirror. They make out. 

           KNOCK KNOCK! Sadie glances at the door. 

                                 SADIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re busy!

           KNOCK KNOCK! Ice backs away from Sadie, who looks at him 
           longingly. He turns, throwing open the door.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, she said --

           Ice stops cold. MC HAMMER (26), stands there in full 
           concert gear, Cazal safety goggle sunglasses, yellow 
           blazer and parachute pants. Iconic. 

                                 HAMMER
                        Just wanted say your set was slammin’. 

                                 ICE
                                (stammering)
                        Oh, shit. Well...thank you, Hammer. 

                                 HAMMER
                        Usually when I come to town, I don’t 
                        watch the opener, but I heard about you 
                        around the way. And the rumors are true. 

                                 ICE
                        Yo...that means the world to me -- 

                                 HAMMER
                        Gotta get on stage. Hit up my table after 
                        the show. 

           Ice nods, beside himself.
           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB - ON STAGE - NIGHT

           Hammer performs on stage, crowded with EIGHT BACKUP 
           DANCERS, singing an early hit, LET’S GET IT STARTED. 

                                 HAMMER (RAPPING)
                        They say “Hammer how you doing” / I got 
                        it like that / My posse’s ever rolling / 
                        We keep it intact...

           Ice and Sadie watch from the front row, mesmerized.

           INT. VIP BOOTH - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Cristal pouring into a wine glass. Hammer hands 
           it to Ice, who sits across from him. 

                                 HAMMER
                        There you go man. Cheers. 

           Hammer’s ENTOURAGE swarms around him, TWENTY GUYS deep, 
           but they’re respecting his space. Letting them converse. 

                                 ICE
                        Show was insane man. I hope I can reach 
                        that level...

                                 HAMMER
                        When’s the album coming out?

                                 ICE
                        We’re writing. Trying to get it right.

                                 HAMMER
                        Can I be real with you? Don’t worry about 
                        getting it right. Worry about getting it 
                        out. Everything’s available. Take what 
                        you need. Rap over a track, it’s yours. 

                                 ICE
                        Word?

                                 HAMMER
                        Word to the mother. 

                                 ICE
                                (curious)
                        What’s that mean?

                                 HAMMER
                        Word to the motherland. Africa. 

           Ice nods, liking the sound of this, taking note. 
           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Standing in a vocal booth, Ice listens to the chorus of 
           PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC by Wild Cherry on headphones.

           Behind a glass partition, Tommy sits next to DJ 
           Earthquake, who is producing. A timid, skinny black kid, 
           MARIO (19), his intern, sits next to them.  

                                 WILD CHERRY (SINGING)
                        Play that funky music white boy / Play 
                        that funky music right / Play that funky 
                        music white boy / lay down and boogie...

           Ice shakes his head, pulling off his headphones.

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        What’s the problem?

                                 ICE
                        Why’s it gotta be about me being white?

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        ‘Cause it’s catchy as hell. 

                                 TOMMY
                        You can do what you want on the B-Side.

                                 ICE
                        It’s just hard to rhyme to...

           Earthquake lets go of the talk button and says something 
           to Tommy off mic. Tommy gets back on the intercom.

                                 TOMMY (INTERCOM)
                        Mario can come up with some lyrics for 
                        you if that’ll help --

                                 ICE
                        Nah. I write my own shit. 

           Ice turns and heads for the door. 

                                 TOMMY (INTERCOM)
                        Where you going?

                                 ICE
                        My office.

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

           Sitting on the toilet, Ice writes lyrics furiously on a 
           scrap of toilet paper. 
           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           In the booth again, he holds the toilet paper, headphones 
           on. Earthquake starts the beat up. Ice gets into it.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell / A 
                        rockin' on the mic while the fly girls 
                        yell / In ecstasy in the back of me / 
                        Well that's my DJ cuttin' all them Z's --

           Earthquake bobs his head. Tommy gives him a thumbs up.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER 

           Ice sits in the studio with Earthquake, Tommy and Mario, 
           eating Chinese takeout for lunch. 

           Earthquake plays a rare 70’s disco song, STRUT YOUR STUFF 
           by The Live Band, on the hunt for samples. 

                                 ICE
                        ...Nah.

           Earthquake changes it to SPACE LADY by Fruit.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think so.

           Earthquake changes it to ROCK ME AMADEUS by Falco. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Hell no!

           Earthquake gives up, flips it over to the radio.

                                 ANNOUNCER (ON THE RADIO)
                        ...You’re listening to Rock 100.5! Here’s 
                        another rock block, coming at ya!

                                 TOMMY
                        We’ve heard so many good tracks. Just 
                        pick one and run with it. 

                                 ICE
                        When I hear it, I’ll know, alright? 

           On the radio, the opening bars to “UNDER PRESSURE” by 
           Queen and David Bowie ring out. Ice doesn’t notice.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                                (listening intently)
                        Yo, guys...
                                 TOMMY
                        I respect your process, but it’s costing 
                        us studio time. And we can’t luxuriate -- 

                                 ICE
                        Yo, I’m just trying to make dope shit --

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Guys!

           They look at Earthquake, who points to his speaker. Ice 
           listens. So does Tommy. They glance at each other. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER

           Silence in the vocal booth. Headphones on. 

                                 ICE
                        Play it. 

           He holds up a napkin with new, handwritten lyrics.

                                 ICE (A CAPELLA)(CONT’D)
                        Alright stop / Collaborate and listen / 
                        Ice is back with a brand new invention / 
                        Something, grabs ahold of me tightly / 
                        flows like a harpoon daily and nightly / 
                        Will it ever stop, yo, I don’t know / 
                        Turn off the lights, and I’ll glow / To 
                        the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal / 
                        light up a stage / cut a chump like a 
                        mango --

           Ice stops, pulls off his headphones. Looks at Earthquake.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you stop it?

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        You really want to rap about mangos? 

                                 ICE
                                (considering)
                        Nah. I’m more of a grapefruit guy. 

           Mario, the assistant, says something. Earthquake goes off 
           the intercom, listening, then hits the talk button again. 

                                 MARIO (ON INTERCOM) 
                        How ‘bout, “Wax a chump like a candle.”
                                 ICE
                                (shrugging)
                        Let’s try it. 

           Earthquake backs the track up. Runs it. Ice jumps in.

                                 ICE (A CAPELLA) (CONT’D)
                        To the extreme, I rock a mic like a 
                        vandal / Light up a stage / wax a chump 
                        like a candle!

           And there it is. Just like that. The song that’ll change 
           everything. But first...

           INT. CITY LIGHTS CLUB - NIGHT

           Ice dances with Chill and Shay on stage to his song 
           HOOKED. THE CROWD goes wild. A little too wild. A SHORT 
           GUY (20’s) gets pushed to the floor. 

                                 SHORT GUY
                        Get the fuck off me!

           The SHORT GUY’S FRIEND tries to help him up, yelling at 
           the offender, a tatted up dude named CHAUNCEY (20’s).

                                 SHORT GUY’S FRIEND
                        Yo, fuck you, Chauncey!

           Ice glances at Earthquake, who cuts the music.

                                 ICE (ON MIC)
                        Everybody in the back, take it from 
                        Iceman and chill the fuck out. We’re here 
                        to have a good time. 

           The ruckus continues, escalating quickly. 

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Shut the fuck up, white boy!

           The crowd boos Chauncey. 

                                 GUY IN CROWD
                        He can rap better than your wack-ass!

           Ice looks down at Sadie. She glances at him, worried.

                                 ICE (ON MIC)
                        You know what? I was gonna do this last, 
                        but here’s a new one for y’all. B-side on 
                        my first single. It’s called Ice, Ice --
           TWO SHOTS ring out! Chauncey falls to the ground! 
           Screams! Everyone flees. SHORT GUY holds a smoking gun. 

           Ice jumps down into the audience, grabbing Sadie and 
           sprinting off as Chauncey pulls out a 9MM and FIRES BACK.

           INT. ICE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Ice lies with Sadie on his couch in his new studio 
           apartment, both staring into space, traumatized. 

                                 ICE
                        Shit just escalated so fast...

                                 SADIE
                        Yeah...I know it’s the hood, but I never 
                        get use to it. 

                                 ICE
                        And I was just about to...

           He trails off. Sadie looks him in the eye, compassionate. 

                                 SADIE
                        What is it? You can tell me.

                                 ICE
                        ...It’s nothing. I was just about to do 
                        that new B-side is all. That shit’s fire.

           Her face drops. She pulls away from him, sitting up.

                                 SADIE
                        You’re worried about your B-side? 

                                 ICE
                                (obviously)
                        Well, yeah. 

                                 SADIE
                        Three people got shot tonight. Three 
                        black people.

                                 ICE
                        I know. I wish they could have heard my 
                        track, at least -- 

                                 SADIE
                        What the fuck?

           Sadie stands abruptly, like something bit her. 
                                 ICE
                        Yo, what’s your problem?

                                 SADIE
                        You come to our neighborhood, go to our 
                        club, only because we let you, then when 
                        we get shot in front of you, you worry 
                        about gracing us with your new single? 

                                 ICE
                        Whoa, what is this “we” shit? The only 
                        “we” should be “us.” It’s not your club. 
                        It’s Tommy’s. And you didn’t let me do 
                        anything. I earned it. Straight up fact.

           Sadie puts on her jacket, her skin crawling. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Sadie, come on --

           Ice reaches for her wrist and she shakes him off her. 

                                 SADIE
                        Do you even know why you want to rap?

                                 ICE
                        ‘Cause I’m good at it.

                                 SADIE
                        You think it’s a competition. A way to 
                        prove to everybody that you’re more than 
                        some regular white dude from a regular 
                        white family. But it’s not about that.

                                 ICE
                        What’s it about then, Ms. Hip-hop? 

           She stares through him, shaking her head.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Come on! What’s it about?

                                 SADIE
                        If I have to tell you, you’ll never 
                        really know.  

           Sadie marches out, slamming the door behind her. He jumps 
           up, throwing the door back open, calling down the stairs. 

                                 ICE
                        Sadie! What the fuck?! Sadie!

           No response. Just her footsteps. She’s already gone. 
           INT. CITY LIGHTS NIGHT CLUB -  DAY

           Ice enters, looking sleepless, Shay and Chill behind him, 
           all of them staring, baffled, at... 

           THREE LARGE WORKERS carrying out parts of Tommy’s office: 
           Elvis posters, records, his signed guitar...

                                 ICE
                        What the hell’s going on Tommy?

                                 TOMMY
                        Well, I got some good news and bad 
                        news...Good news is, your tracks are 
                        amazing and we have enough for an album.

                                 ICE
                        What’s the bad news?  

                                 TOMMY
                        I had to sell the club.

           Their eyes widen collectively. 

                                 CHILL
                        You telling us we’re out of a job!?

                                 SHAY
                        Oh, come on T, I just bought a Five-O! 

                                 ICE
                        The club, is like, your life --

                                 TOMMY
                        That shooting brought some heat. We’re 
                        not exactly up on all our codes. And 
                        people are asking questions now. So it’s 
                        time to cut our losses.

           Ice looks despondent, the reality setting in. 

                                 ICE
                        I guess we ain’t performing no more. 

                                 TOMMY
                                (smiling confidently)
                        I didn’t say that. 

           INT/EXT. TOUR VAN - NIGHT

           Chill, Shay and Earthquake sit wedged into the back of a 
           packed Ecoline van, Tommy at the wheel and Ice sitting 
           shotgun. They look roadworn and miserable.  
                                 LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS 
                                     FEBRUARY, 1989 
                                VANILLA ICE’S FIRST TOUR

           EXT. MAJIC TIMES STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           The van pulls into a desolate parking lot in front of a 
           strip club. The marquee reads: “Tonight! Ventriloquist 
           Comedy by Boy Wonder! Also: Vanilla Ice Rap Music”.

           INT. MAJIC TIMES STRIP CLUB - STAGE - NIGHT

           Ice performs PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC. For a song that 
           didn’t suit him, he’s killing it live. It comes to an end 
           and he catches his breath, then: 

                                 ICE (ON MIC)
                        Yo, I just want to say a shout out to my 
                        crew. These are my boys, Chill, Shay, and 
                        DJ Earthquake on the decks. We’re the 
                        Vanilla Ice Posse. VIP!

           SIX PEOPLE look on, all over 50. Crickets. 

           INT. MAJIC TIMES STRIP CLUB - BAR - NIGHT

           Ice and the VIP sip drinks at the bar, watching... 

           ...BOY WONDER (48), a chubby, bald ventriloquist on stage 
           with his dummy, dressed like Batman’s sidekick Robin. The 
           crowd has grown to a whopping TWENTY ELDERLY PEOPLE. 

                                 BOY WONDER
                        How about that opening act, huh? What’s 
                        next, a black golfer? 

           Chill and Shay laugh drunkenly. Ice skulks behind them, 
           despondent. Tommy puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                 TOMMY
                        It’ll get better. Trust me. 

                                 ICE
                        Sure doesn’t look like it.

                                 TOMMY
                        Just give it time.
           INT. WAGH RADIO STATION - DAY

           Promo posters for De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, etc. 
           around a sign that reads “92.3 - Home of the Real”.

           DJ DARRYL JAYE (45) lounges in his booth behind a studio 
           mic. Tommy sits across from him, both of them listening 
           to PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC on vinyl.

                                    COLUMBUS, GEORGIA
                                       MARCH, 1990

           Before the song finishes, Darryl stops the record. 

                                 DARRYL
                        The white boy thing is funny but it’s 
                        nothing new. I mean, Beastie Boys? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Yeah, but they’re all about New York 
                        City. Ice is from your backyard.

                                 DARRYL
                        He’s from Georgia?

                                 TOMMY
                        No. Miami. And Dallas.

                                 DARRYL
                        Which is it? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Both.

                                 DARRYL
                        Rappers are like sports teams. They only 
                        rep one city. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Bottom line -- no one sounds like Ice. 

                                 DARRYL
                        You know I always love seeing you, Tommy. 
                        But I’m gonna have to pass. I’m sorry.

           Tommy stares at him. A hint of desperation behind his 
           cool veneer. But he holds it down, smiling respectfully.  

                                 TOMMY
                        Well, I appreciate you taking the time.

                                 DARRYL
                        Don’t even worry about it.  
           Daryl pulls the record off the player and hands it to 
           Tommy as he stands to leave.

                                 TOMMY
                        Keep it. 

           Daryl nods and watches him go, wishing he could help. 

           EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

           Ice reclines in a lounge chair. Shay and Chill ride 
           alligator floats in the pool, sipping Bud Lights. 

                                 SHAY
                        Yo, what was dude’s name? 

                                 CHILL
                        Patrice! Motherfucker said it was Haitian 
                        or some shit! I thought it was Irish!

           As both of them laugh, we hear the unexpected SQUALK of a 
           police siren. Everyone freezes, glancing toward the gate 
           as TWO WHITE COPS (30’s) enter, staring down at them.

                                 COP 1
                        Get out of the pool.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, what’s this about, officer?

           The cops glance at Ice, sitting up in his chair.

                                 COP 2
                        Sorry for the disturbance, sir. We’ll 
                        handle it from here.

           Ice stares at him, pure “WTF” on his face.

                                 COP 1
                                (to Chill and Shay)
                        Get out. Now.

                                 SHAY
                        Alright, no problem. 

           Chill and Shay climb out, grabbing their towels. 

                                 COP 1
                        Against the wall.

                                 CHILL
                        Wait? For real? 
                                 COP 1
                        Do I look like I’m joking? 

           They line up against the wall. The officers kick their 
           legs into a spread, searching their swim trunks. 

                                 CHILL
                        Yo, we ain’t got nothing on us --

                                 SHAY
                        We’re in swim trunks, dude --

                                 COP 1
                        I’m not your dude. Keep your mouth shut. 

                                 ICE
                        Whoa, whoa. Excuse me, officers?

           The cops glance at Ice again, standing now.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Those are my friends. 

                                 CHILL
                        Yo, Ice, just let ‘em do their thing --

                                 COP 1
                                (to Chill)
                        What did I just say? Huh?

           Chill goes silent. 

                                 ICE
                        They didn’t do nothing wrong. We’re all 
                        guests here. The only disturbance is you!

                                 CHILL
                        Robbie! You’re not helping --

           The first cop grabs Chill and slams him against the wall. 

                                 COP 1
                        You better listen to me, boy!

                                 CHILL
                        Okay, okay! Sorry!

           Chill goes silent. The cops finish their search, ears 
           perking at the odd sound of water trickling. The cops 
           glance behind them, then freeze, watching as...

           ...ICE faces them, peeing into the pool.
                                 COP 1
                        Whoa! What do you think you’re doing?!

                                 COP 2
                        Sir, stop that right now! 

                                 ICE
                        Fuck you, pig motherfuckers! 

           Chill and Shay hang their heads. They’re fucked. 

           INT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

           Silence. The three of them sit behind bars in a holding 
           tank. They’ve been there for hours.

           CHA-CHINK! The cell door opens. They look up. Tommy 
           stands next to a BALIFF, a grim look on his face. 

           EXT/INT. TOUR VAN - DAY

           Ice rides shotgun, Chill and Shay in back. Tommy drives, 
           gripping the wheel, in full angry dad mode. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Do you know how much you cost us? Out of 
                        our tour budget? 

                                 ICE
                        Yo, I was just trying to make things 
                        even. Those pigs didn’t even look at me, 
                        Tommy. Like I wasn’t there.

                                 CHILL
                                (leaning forward)
                        You should have kept it that way!

           Ice glares at Chill. They’ve already argued about this.

                                 ICE
                        And let ‘em take my boys down? Hell nah!

                                 CHILL
                        Motherfucker, you took us down!

           They all start shouting over each other. Tommy jumps in.

                                 TOMMY
                        Enough! Jesus Christ. We’re not doing 
                        this. That’s not why we’re out here.
                                 ICE
                        Why are we out here, Tommy?

                                 TOMMY
                        To make fans. To build your career.

                                 ICE
                        Let’s keep it real for once, man. Nobody 
                        knows who the fuck we are. 

                                 TOMMY
                        It doesn’t happen overnight --

                                 ICE
                        It’s been a fucking year! You said the 
                        venues would get better. They haven’t. 
                        You said we’d be on the radio. We ain’t! 

                                 TOMMY
                                (simmering)
                        I have been to every rap station this 
                        side of the Mississippi. I’ve put every 
                        dime I have into this album. I’m busting 
                        my ass. For you. 

                                 ICE
                        Well maybe it ain’t enough. 

           Tommy goes beet red. He veers off the highway, pulling 
           over. The engine humming in thick silence. 

                                 TOMMY
                        I think you’re wrong. But if you want to 
                        end it right here, then you say it. 
                        Because I’m not going to. 

           Ice inhales, then stops himself. Not ready to let go. 
           Tommy waits another moment, looking in the rearview. 
           Chill and Shay stare at their laps. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                                (quietly)
                        Alright then.

           He pulls back onto the road. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Ice lies in bed in a towel, fresh out of the shower, on 
           the phone, listening as an answering machine picks up.

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        It’s Sadie. Here it comes. Wait for it...
           BEEP. Ice takes a breath. Goes for it.

                                 ICE 
                        Yo, I’ve been thinking about what you 
                        said. I don’t remember much of it, but 
                        the stuff I do remember is pretty deep to 
                        me. So just, yeah...give me a call and we 
                        can talk about that stuff...Peace.

           He hangs up, turns on the TV, channel surfing. The 
           nostalgic sound of the MTV News lead in. On screen is 
           KURT LODER (30’s), head MTV News Anchor.

                                 KURT LODER (ON TV)
                        Hip-hop artist MC Hammer continues to 
                        climb the billboard charts with his hit 
                        “U Can’t Touch This.” Fans can’t seem to 
                        touch it enough; the single cracked the 
                        top ten earlier this week, becoming one 
                        of the highest ranking songs in the 
                        genre. Hammer promises a followup that he 
                        says will hit number one, which would be 
                        a first in rap history...

           Ice rubs his forehead, frustrated.  

           EXT. SANDY’S YAUGHT CLUB - DAY

           Tommy pulls the van into the empty parking lot of a dingy 
           Tiki bar, next to a Denny’s off the interstate.

           He gets out, the crew following as the BAR MANAGER (50), 
           beer gut, trucker hat, steps outside, approaching. 

                                 BAR MANAGER
                        Can I help you boys?

                                 TOMMY
                        Here for the gig...

                                 BAR MANAGER
                        Oh, we cancelled you. Three days ago. 

                                 TOMMY
                        What? 

                                 BAR MANAGER
                        Having trouble understanding my english?

                                 TOMMY
                                (unfazed)
                        I was born in Mississippi.
                                 BAR MANAGER
                        You didn’t meet the minimum. Ten tickets.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Man, we’re almost ten. Just count us. 

                                 BAR MANAGER
                        Sure, if you want to pay to play here...

           Ice clenches his jaw. Tommy checks his watch, thinking.

                                 TOMMY
                        Alright, if we can get to Coasters in 
                        Atlanta by eleven, they’ll probably let 
                        us play a late set --

                                 ICE
                        Goddamn it Tommy. That’s far as fuck! 

                                 TOMMY
                        Not if we make good time.

                                 ICE
                        Fuck that! I’m sick of this. I’m done!

                                 CHILL
                        Whoa. Ice. Hold up, man. 

                                 ICE
                        I ain’t holding up for shit! All we do is 
                        go from shitty club to shitty club. This 
                        isn’t what you promised, Tommy. 

                                 CHILL
                        Man, we’re getting paid! To rap! You 
                        could be selling cars right now. So let’s 
                        just get in the van --

                                 ICE
                        Hell no! I’m not coming! Nuh uh! No way 
                        I’m getting back in that van! 

           INT./EXT. TOUR VAN - NIGHT

           Ice sits shotgun. Silent. Pouting. Tommy drives. The rest 
           of the VIP napping in back. Desolate two lane highway. 

                                 TOMMY
                        By the way...Coasters? Great buffet.

           Ice shakes his head. Doesn’t respond. Tommy gives up,  
           turning on the radio, flipping through channels.
           INT. WAGH RADIO STATION - NIGHT

           Darryl the DJ leans toward his mic while changing out 
           records on two turntables. 

                                 DARRYL
                        That was “Ego Trippin’” off Critical 
                        Beatdown, a personal favorite.

           He drops the needle onto De La’s 3 FEET HIGH AND RISING.

                                 DARRYL (CONT’D)
                        Now here comes a joint from... 

           The record skips. His brow furrows as he pulls it off the 
           turntable, eying A LARGE SCRATCH down the vinyl. 

                                 DARRYL (CONT’D)
                        ...around the way...

           Reaching furiously for the nearest record, he picks up 
           PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC by Vanilla Ice, frowning. 

           Then he gets an idea, FLIPPING THE RECORD over, reading 
           the B-Side with a curious look on his face. 

                                 DARRYL (CONT’D)
                        ...This is something brand new... 

           CLOSE ON the needle drop. The record crackles as...

           ...WE DESCEND toward the spinning label. The words are 
           rotating, but we can read them, loud and clear...

           INT./ EXT. TOUR VAN - NIGHT

           ...Tommy drives in silence. Ice’s head dips as he nods 
           off. On the radio, the opening bars of ICE ICE BABY. 

           Tommy squints. Is he hearing things? He fumbles for the 
           volume. Turns it up. Then stares ahead, breathless.

           Ice’s eyes open. He lifts his head. Listening. Confused.

                                 ICE
                        Why’d you put this on?

                                 TOMMY
                                (quietly)
                        It’s the radio.

           In the back of the van, Chill stirs from sleep, waking 
           and listening, equally confused.
                                 ICE
                        They’re playing the B-side?

           Tommy shrugs, clueless. Chill leans forward, sticking his 
           head between them.

                                 CHILL
                        Yo...that’s you...

           Ice looks at him, nodding, still processing. Chill whips 
           back toward Shay, smacking his chest. 

                                 CHILL (CONT’D)
                        Ay, wake up! 

           Shay and Earthquake stir, sitting up. 

                                 SHAY
                        What the fuck?

                                 CHILL
                        This motherfucker’s on the radio!

                                 SHAY
                        For real?

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Serious?

                                 CHILL
                        Listen!

           Chill reaches out and cranks the volume.

                                 SHAY
                        Oh, shit!

           Ice grins widely, his adrenaline surging. 

                                 ICE
                        Ay! We on the motherfucking RADIO! 

           They all start screaming as the van breezes down the 
           desolate highway, taking us into a MONTAGE...

           INT. COLLEGE WEIGHT ROOM - DAY

                                    COLUMBUS, GEORGIA

           ...A radio plays ICE ICE BABY. A WHITE FOOTBALL PLAYER 
           spotting his BUDDY reaches back, turning the volume up...
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

                                 CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE 

           ...A boombox plays ICE ICE BABY from a lifeguard stand. A 
           group of WHITE BIKINI GIRLS AND SURFER BROS dance...

           INT. GIRL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                               SUMMERVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA

           ...A stereo plays ICE ICE BABY in a white girl’s (16) 
           bedroom. She’s with 4 WHITE FRIENDS at a sleepover. All 
           of them giggling and rapping along...

           EXT. PARK - DAY

                                  JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 

           ...A radio plays ICE ICE BABY at a cookout. A BLACK GUY 
           ON THE GRILL shakes his head dismissively and switches 
           stations, blasting FIGHT THE POWER by Public Enemy. 

                                 CHUCK D (RAPPING)
                        Elvis was a hero to most but he never 
                        meant shit to me / he was straight up 
                        racist and lame --

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

                                     MIAMI, FLORIDA

           ...A PA system picks up right where we left off, playing 
           ICE ICE BABY on the set of a music video. 

           Ice, Shay and Chill dance to the track dressed in suits 
           with collarless shirts, no ties. Tommy sits in video 
           village with the DIRECTOR and CREW.

           We cut to the video for ICE ICE BABY, recreated shot-for-
           shot. Ice dances on this rooftop, then --

           -- Ice raps against the city skyline, wearing a 
           University of Miami sweatshirt and a gold chain, then -- 

           -- Ice drives through the hood in Shay’s white 5.0 with 
           the top down, his hair blowing. 
           EXT. STRAUSS SQUARE ARENA - DAY

                                      DALLAS, TEXAS

           Ice and the VIP dance to the last verse of ICE ICE BABY 
           on an impressively large stage under a sign that reads: 
           “KJMX103 Summer Jam.” Tommy watches from the wings.

           Ice’s family, Kip, Byron and Beth stand in a GIANT CROWD, 
           staring, dumbfounded, unable to process how this could 
           have happened to little Robbie. The song comes to an end.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        Yo man, let’s get out of here...Word to 
                        your mother...

           INT. CHARLES’ OFFICE - CBS BUILDING - DAY

           CHARLES KOPPELMAN (50), thin, white, bald, part CEO, part 
           hapless uncle, sits behind a luxurious teak desk, a view 
           of the Sunset Strip behind him.

                                       LOS ANGELES
                                       MARCH, 1990

           Tommy, Ice, Chill and Shay sit across from him, looking 
           defiant and out of place. Charles clears his throat.

                                 CHARLES
                        I just listened over and over again to 
                        “Ice Ice Baby.” I probably listened to it 
                        about fifteen or twenty times. And it 
                        kept feeling great. 

                                 ICE
                        Well, I’m glad you approve. 

           Charles can see Ice is not feeling him. At all.

                                 CHARLES
                        Let’s cut to the chase. We’re gonna help 
                        you cross over. 

                                 ICE
                        What does that mean?

                                 CHARLES
                        It means unlike a lot of other hiphop 
                        acts, you’ve got real star appeal. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLES (CONT'D)
                        If we can market you across every 
                        demographic, we can introduce rap music 
                        to people that have never really listened 
                        to it before.

                                 ICE
                        Those don’t sound like my people.  

                                 CHARLES
                        Look, there’s a lot of money to be made. 
                        But it’s not on the streets. It’s in 
                        suburban homes all across the country. 

           INT. LOBBY - CBS BUILDING - DAY

           Ice and the VIP gather, having a post-mortem talk.

                                 ICE
                        Who the fuck is this guy, Tommy?

                                 CHILL
                        Yeah what does Orville Redenbacher know 
                        about hiphop?

           Chill and Shay snicker. Tommy looks Ice in the eye.

                                 TOMMY
                        Look, this is a good deal.

           Chill shakes his head. Ice looks incredulous. 

                                 ICE
                        We could have gone with Atlantic. 
                        Columbia. Def Jam. Who the fuck is SBK? I 
                        never heard of them --

                                 TOMMY
                        Charles Koppelman knows what he’s doing. 
                        And he’s making us Top Priority. That’s 
                        huge. It means serious, quantifiable P&A. 

           Ice, Chill and Shay stare at him, clueless.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Print and Advertising. It means our 
                        record’s not going to sit at the bottom 
                        of the pile. SBK’s going to put in ten 
                        times more on publicity than other labels 
                        and get “Ice Ice Baby” on the radio -- 

                                 ICE
                        We’re already on the radio!
                                 TOMMY
                        The national radio.

           Ice shifts uncomfortably.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know this wave of attention feels 
                        good. But we’re only on rotation in the 
                        south. Charles will get us airplay on the 
                        east and west coast. That’s not easy.

                                 ICE
                        I don’t know man. All that shit about 
                        crossing over. Suburban homes? Sounds 
                        soft to me. I’m not a sellout. 

                                 CHILL
                        Damn straight, son.

                                 TOMMY
                        No one’s asking you to be. 

                                 ICE
                        Then end of discussion. 

           Tommy looks despondent, then remembers something. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Oh, I forget to mention -- this is the 
                        highest upfront payout of any label. 

                                 ICE
                        How much? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Five hundred thousand.

           A collective hush falls over them. 

           INT. CHARLES’ OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON the tip of a pen. “Robbie Van Winkle” scrawled 
           in cursive. Ice finishes signing and Charles shakes his 
           hand, both of them holding Cuban cigars like made men.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, I thought you only smoked cigars 
                        after having a baby.

                                 CHARLES
                        Well we’re having one...an “Ice Ice 
                        Baby.”
                                 ICE
                        Okay, pops... 

           Charles smiles, taking this as a compliment.  

                                 CHARLES
                        This is going to be a historic moment for 
                        hip-hop. And, um, the community...

           He motions to Chill and Shay, who stand nearby, doing 
           their best to not show how they feel about this. 

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        And you... You know who I’m looking at?

                                 ICE
                        Who?

                                 CHARLES
                        The new face of hip hop.

           Charles pulls Ice in as A PHOTOGRAPHER shoots them.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        You boys rest up. ‘Cause in a week, 
                        you’re going on tour. 

                                 ICE
                                (confused)
                        Yo, we were just on tour. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Not like this.

           INT. ARENA STAGE - NIGHT

           A massive stage. Big as it gets. Ice and the VIP wear 
           white and blue sequined parachute pants and blazers.

                                 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN 
                                      APRIL, 1990 

           The song ends and an AUDIENCE OF 18,000 goes wild.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, New York! Thanks for all the love. I 
                        want to give props to the VIP and to the 
                        headliner, my mentor, Mc Hammer! Word to 
                        your mother!
           INT. STAGE WING - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN 

           MC Hammer stands watching with his two main backup 
           dancers, ALONZO (27) and RALPH (26), in matching suits.

                                 ALONZO
                        Man, they look like the bargain basement 
                        version of us.

                                 RALPH
                        You know they jacking our style, right?

                                 HAMMER
                        It’s not a competition. There’s room for 
                        everybody.

           His eyes tell us he’s thinking the exact opposite. 

           INT. ARENA STAGE - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

           Hammer performs U CAN’T TOUCH THIS on stage, killing it 
           with his signature dance moves. His crew has grown. 
           TWENTY DANCERS accompany him, all in perfect rhythm. 

                                 HAMMER (RAPPING)
                        You'll probably get hyped boy 'cause you 
                        know / You can't touch this!

           INT. ICE’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ice, Chill and Shay change out of their concert gear. A 
           KNOCK on the door.

                                 ICE
                        It’s open --

           Tommy enters with MONTE LIPMAN (25), a high-strung neo-
           con in large tortoise shell eyeglasses and a boxy suit. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Ice -- this is Monte Lipman. Charles’ 
                        right hand man. 

                                 CHILL
                        S’up Wallstreet?

                                 SHAY
                        How’s the DOW doing? Buy, sell, buy!
                                 MONTE
                        Funny, guys. Love it. 
                                (to Ice)
                        That was a great show. Just awesome.

           Monte sniffs. Could be a cold, might be something else? 

                                 ICE
                        Thanks, Monte. Appreciate you coming out. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Monte has some news from Charles. 

                                 MONTE
                        Great news actually. We’re gonna 
                        repackage the album, add four new tracks.

                                 ICE
                                (bewildered)
                        Whoa, what do you mean repackage? And 
                        what new tracks? 

                                 MONTE
                        Here’s the deal fellas. At ten songs, 
                        it’s not quite an LP. In our market 
                        research, we need at least fourteen 
                        tracks to give fans their money’s worth. 

                                 ICE
                        Well that’s all we recorded...

                                 MONTE
                        That’s why we’ve got a studio lined up, 
                        right here in midtown. And a week to kill 
                        before your next show. 

                                 ICE
                                (grimacing)
                        Wait a minute -- you want me to write 
                        four new tracks in a week? 

                                 MONTE
                        No. Of course not. We’re going to 
                        introduce you to a three-time Grammy 
                        winning songwriter --

                                 ICE
                                (recoiling)
                        Hell nah. I write my own shit. If I don’t 
                        then it ain’t Ice. Tommy, tell him...

           Tommy remains silent. Ice looks worried. 
                                 MONTE
                        No offense, but you want to play in the 
                        majors? This is how you do it. And we 
                        don’t have a lot of time here. 

           Monte and Tommy stare at Ice, the pressure unbelievable. 

                                 MONTE (CONT’D)
                        Trust me, this guy’s a musical genius. 
                        Real hip. You will not be sorry.

           INT. SIR STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Ice in a recording booth. Lights dimmed, unnecessary 
           candles everywhere. A laughably bad slow-jam rings out. 
           He looks unsure, but it’s too late to turn back.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        In my dreams, I vision myself at the 
                        ocean / beautiful girls rub me down with 
                        some lotion...

           Monte watches through glass, bobbing his head. He nudges 
           LARRY THE SONGWRITER (65) bald, pervy goatee, tinted 
           shades, who mouthes the verse that Ice raps. Some genius. 

                                 ICE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        Even though you know I blow as cold as an 
                        ice cube / let me tell you how it is to 
                        make love on an inner tube --

           INT. CHARLES’ OFFICE - CBS BUILDING - DAY

           Charles listens to the song on his CD player.

                                 CHARLES 
                        This is really sexy stuff. 

           Ice sits across from him, smiling humbly. 

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Great job, Monte. 

           Ice’s smile fades as Monte nods proudly.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Love the lyrics. Tell Larry he outdid 
                        himself. That dirty old man. 
                                (to Ice)
                        You happy?

           Ice hesitates. 
                                 ICE
                        Well I don’t normally operate this way -- 

                                 CHARLES
                        Now you do. The ladies are gonna eat this 
                        up. You know that, don’t you?

           Ice glances uneasily at his boys; Chill unreadable, Shay 
           grinning. He tries to be a team player.

                                 ICE
                                (quietly)
                        I guess it turned out pretty good. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Exceptional. And we have everything we 
                        need to release the album. 

           A sigh of relief from Tommy and Monte, who smile widely, 
           patting each other on the back.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s talk about the title. 

           Ice squints at Charles. The room goes quiet.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        “Hooked” isn’t for a wide audience. 

                                 ICE
                        Why not? I think it’s dope.

                                 CHARLES
                        That’s the problem -- drug connotations. 

                                 ICE
                        No, man, dope, like, slammin’. And it’s 
                        not about drugs, it’s about --

                                 CHARLES
                        We’re running test groups to see which of 
                        your lyrics your fans respond to the 
                        most. We’ll base the title on that.

                                 ICE
                        Hold up man. You saying I don’t even get 
                        to name my own album? 

                                 CHARLES
                        No, I’m saying you already have. 
           INT. TOWER RECORDS - DAY

           We see the title TO THE EXTREME emblazoned above Ice 
           standing defiantly in a star-spangled red and blue suit. 
           A Tower Records CLERK (23) stocks a shelf with the album.

                                       LOS ANGELES
                                     SEPTEMBER, 1990

           The clerk heads to the front door, where CUSTOMERS gather 
           outside. He unlocks it and they swarm toward the record.

           INT. CHESS KING CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Ice walks out of a dressing room in a comically oversized 
           patchwork denim jacket and jeans.

           He joins Chill in a bucket hat and leather sweatsuit and 
           Shay in massive overalls, one strap unbuckled.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, you think we better off?

                                 SHAY
                        Damn straight. We look fresh as hell. 

                                 ICE
                        No, I mean...the album’s out, but it’s 
                        not my title. And we got a full set list 
                        but not all of ‘em are my songs. 

                                 SHAY
                        ‘Course they are. Far as anybody knows.

                                 CHILL
                        Nah, he means for real. No fake shit.

                                 SHAY
                        What’s the difference? And how the hell 
                        else could we afford gear like this. I 
                        mean, look at us...

           They stare at themselves in a large mirror. They look 
           ridiculous. Even by early 90’s standards. 

                                 ICE
                        I just wish I didn’t have to compromise. 
                        I’ve always been 110 percent original. I 
                        don’t follow trends, I set ‘em. 

                                 CHILL
                        That’s right. 
                                 ICE
                        I gotta remind ‘em. That this ain’t about 
                        Monte. Or Charles. Or Tommy. 

                                 SHAY
                        How the fuck you gonna do that? 

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Ice’s song, HAVIN’ A RONI plays at full blast. 

           He sits on the counter holding hair clippers, shirt off, 
           using two mirrors to shave block letters that spell “ICE” 
           into the back of his head.

           As he brings the clippers around, he accidentally buzzes 
           a vertical line into his left eyebrow. 

                                 ICE
                        Fuck!

           He stares at it, getting an idea, shaving another line 
           next to it. Another. Then he shaves a line into the side 
           of his head. Zigzagging it. 

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           CLOSE ON a suitcase by the bed. Ice unzips it. It’s full 
           of Aqua Net. He pulls out two cans, raising them and...

           ...FIRING, filling the room with a giant chemical cloud 
           that WHITES OUT our frame. As the fog clears, we reveal a 
           made over Vanilla Ice, in a shining gold suit. 

                                 ICE
                        Yup, yup. 

           INT. ARENA STAGE - NIGHT 

           Showtime. Ice dances to GO ILL with the VIP in front of a 
           MASSIVE AUDIENCE that rivals MSG. Killing it. 

                                        THE FORUM

           A girl in the front row, LAURA (20), teased blonde hair, 
           black miniskirt, white LA Gear hi-tops, screams at him. 

                                 LAURA 
                        You’re so fucking hot! You look so cool!!
           This gets his attention. He grins at her, then reaches 
           down impulsively, grabbing her and lifting her on stage. 

                                 ICE
                        Yo, come up here girl!

           She grinds against him as --

           -- THREE OTHER GIRLS in the audience bum rush the stage. 
           FOUR GUYS follow, along with EVERYONE ELSE nearby. 

           SIX SECURITY GUARDS try to coral them, but there’s no 
           stopping the full on stampede. Ice is jolted away from 
           Laura as the crowd tears at his suit and chains. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Yo! Watch it!

           He pushes them back, reaching out, grabbing Laura’s hand 
           and bolting off stage. The house lights fire on.

           INT. STAGE WINGS - NIGHT

           Ice pulls Laura into a shadowy spot under a flight of 
           steel stairs, turning back to watch the crowd violently 
           grabbing instruments, set lists, each other.

                                 ICE
                        Fuck, we better get out of here  --

           As he glances at Laura she dives toward him, kissing him 
           furiously. Audience members dash down the stairs, tearing 
           past them, raiding the stage wings. 

                                 CHILL (O.S.)
                        Yo -- Ice! Ice!

           Ice pulls away from Laura, eyes darting to Chill and 
           Shay, their suits torn, beaconing for him down the hall. 
           He grins at Laura and takes her hand.

                                 ICE
                        Come on --

           They take off. 

           INT. CHINA CLUB - NIGHT

           VIP Booth. Ice has his arm around Laura next to his crew, 
           who all have NEW GIRLS with them. In full Rat Pack mode. 
                                 SHAY
                        Yo, you see the two dudes fighting over 
                        the kick drum?! 

                                 CHILL
                        Who comes to a show loving an artist so 
                        much they want to tear him apart?

           Laughter. A shadow falls over them. Ice looks up. Tommy 
           appears with Monte, both inexplicably glowing. 

                                 ICE
                        Tommy! Monte! Pour a drink.

                                 TOMMY
                        Oh, we will. But first, Monte’s got 
                        something important he wanted to say. 

                                 ICE
                        What, we recording new tracks again? 

           More laughter. Monte cuts through it.

                                 MONTE
                        “Ice Ice Baby” just went to number one.

           The laughter stops.

                                 ICE
                        Say what?

                                 MONTE
                        We have the number one single in America.

           Gasps all around.

                                 TOMMY
                        No rap song’s ever gone to number one on 
                        the pop charts. Even “You Can’t Touch 
                        This” capped out at number eight.

                                 ICE
                        What are you saying?

                                 TOMMY
                        We just made music history.

           They all stare at each other in utter silence, shocked. 

                                                            HARD CUT TO:

           Ice and the VIP SCREAMING at the top of their lungs. 
           Earthquake shakes up a bottle of champagne and sprays 
           them down. Shay starts a chant --
                                 SHAY
                        We’re number one! We’re number one!

           They all join in. Losing their shit.

           Across the club, MC Hammer enters with his crew in tow, 
           watching the revelry. Alonzo whispers to him, telling him 
           what’s up. He listens with an unreadable expression. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           They’ve gassed themselves but are still running on fumes. 
           Ice’s face is flushed. Blissed out. Someone taps him on 
           the shoulder and he turns to face...

           ...Hammer. Sober. Calm. 

                                 ICE
                        Yo! Hammer!

                                 HAMMER
                        I don’t want to interrupt. Just had to 
                        say congratulations. 

                                 ICE
                        Awe, like I tell everyone, you’ve been a 
                        mentor to me...

           Hammer waves away the praise.

                                 HAMMER
                        This is your moment. And it puts hiphop 
                        in the spotlight. Which is important for 
                        all of us.

                                 ICE
                        Couldn’t have done it without you!

                                 HAMMER
                        No, my man. You did it yourself. When I 
                        saw you back at City Lights, I knew you 
                        had it. You worked hard. You deserve it.

           Ice raises his hand and Hammer daps him up, then heads 
           back to Alonzo and Ralph.

                                 ICE
                                (calling out)
                        Ay yo -- I touched this!

           Hammer freezes. Then turns back around slowly.

                                 HAMMER
                        What was that?
                                 ICE
                        You said, “Can’t touch this,” but I did. 
                        I’m not number eight, seven, six, five, 
                        four...(spacing out)...three, two...” 

           Ice beams at Hammer drunkenly, raising his index finger. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Number one, baby. Word to your mother!

           The VIP chants again as Hammer stares for a long moment.  

                                 HAMMER
                        Well enjoy it... 
                                (quietly)
                        ...while it lasts.

           Hammer exits. Ice watches him go with a tinge of concern, 
           then shrugs it off and goes back to partying.

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON Ice’s sleeping face. He wakes, cringing, 
           hangover of the century. Laura, Chill, Shay, Earthquake 
           and a dozen HALF-NAKED BODIES lay all around him. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Wearing a hoodie, wrinkled Skidz and sunglasses, Ice 
           stumbles down the hall, exiting through a side door.  

           EXT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - DAY

           He shuffles toward Sunset Blvd, passing the hotel 
           entrance, where a CROWD OF FIFTY is gathered, staring 
           into the lobby. Ice taps a YOUNG WOMAN on the shoulder.

                                 ICE
                        Excuse me...what are y’all waiting for?

           She turns around, her eyes widening insanely.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Oh my God!!!

           The entire crowd whips toward him, revealing signs, 
           albums, posters, all with Ice’s face on them.

                                 RANDOM DUDE
                        It’s him!
           Ice backs away as they lurch forward. He turns, dashing 
           to the side entrance and bursting through the door. They 
           give chase like a pack of wild dogs.

           INT. LOBBY 

           Ice barely dodges a WAITER pushing a cart full of food. 

                                 WAITER
                        Hey! You almost --

           The waiter turns, freezing as the crowd plows into him, 
           the cart toppling and plates flying everywhere.

           INT. ELEVATOR 

           Ice tumbles into the elevator as the crowd nears, the 
           doors shutting them out in the knick of time.  

           He collapses, sliding to the floor, then glancing up at 
           an RICH OLD WOMAN in a mink coat, staring, mortified.  

                                 ICE
                                (trying to explain)
                        Fans. 

           INT. TOMMY’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A POV through the 10th story window of the crowd below,  
           now DOUBLE THE SIZE, waiting at the hotel entrance. Chill 
           stares down at them, concerned. 

                                 CHILL
                        Goddamn. Shit just keeps growing.

           Ice sits on a plush hotel chair. Wiped out. Shay lounges 
           on the hotel bed, not worried at all.

           The sound of the hotel door unlocking. Ice and Chill 
           tense up. Tommy enters. They sigh in relief. 

                                 ICE
                        Thank God... 

           A giant black guy, BIG E (32), follows him inside. He 
           looks like a former linebacker who now eats for sport. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Ice, this is Big E. He’s gonna head up 
                        security. 
                                 ICE
                        Yo, good to meet you. Seriously. 

           Ice daps up Big-E, who motions to the window.

                                 BIG-E
                        I see I got here just in time.

                                 ICE
                        Thought they were gonna tear me apart. 

                                 BIG-E
                        Well you don’t have to worry no more. I 
                        got your back at all times. Anyone steps 
                        up, I’ll crack ‘em. Male or female --

           Tommy holds up a cautionary hand.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hopefully it doesn’t comes to that.

                                 BIG-E
                        Crazy comes in all shapes and sizes.

           Ice sees the barrel of a gun sticking out of his jacket.

                                 ICE
                        You strapped?

           Big-E nods, pulling a .357 Magnum from a shoulder 
           holster. Chill stares at it warily. Shay smiles.

                                 SHAY
                        Oh, snap. That Dirty Harry’s gun?

                                 BIG-E
                        Yeah. Try to fuck with the Iceman, you 
                        better believe I’ll make somebody’s day. 

           Ice shakes his head, unsure, then glances at Tommy.

                                 ICE
                        All these crowds? Reminds me of 
                        Disneyland. I don’t want to cop a theme 
                        park feel. Know what I’m saying? 

                                 CHILL
                        Hell yeah. 

                                 ICE
                        This ain’t the Mickey Mouse club. We from 
                        the streets. Rough, rugged and raw. We 
                        gotta make that clear.  
           Tommy nods in understanding, thinking of something.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’ve been going through offers with 
                        Charles and we may have just the thing. 

                                 ICE
                        Yeah? 

                                 TOMMY
                        New Line Cinema got in touch with a movie 
                        they want to integrate you into. 

                                 ICE
                        Yo, I never acted before.

                                 TOMMY
                        Not a problem. They want you to write a 
                        new single for the soundtrack and rap it 
                        in the film. The set would be locked 
                        down. Private. No crowds. Just you, 
                        making a statement. About where you’re 
                        from. The way you want.

           Ice glances at Chill and Shay, gauging their reactions. 

                                 CHILL
                        Movies could be dope. I heard Ice-T’s up 
                        on some new Godfather shit in NYC. 

                                 SHAY
                        And JB told me Cube’s working on a flick 
                        right now with his boys. In his old hood.  

                                 ICE
                        Is it gonna be like that?

                                 TOMMY
                                (smiling)
                        Even better.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           A 35mm camera on a crane swoops across a night club stage 
           as Ice, Chill and Shay dance.

                                   SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
                                   OCTOBER 31ST, 1990

           A commotion in the AUDIENCE. Ice and the VIP stop, 
           looking on. The moment feels eerily like the shooting at 
           City Lights. Is this a biopic? 
           WE PULL OUT to reveal stunt men in muppet-like costumes 
           dressed as LEONARDO, MICHELANGELO, DONATELLO and RAFAEL. 
           Yup. THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. Not a biopic.

           They fight TOKKA, a giant turtle and RAHZAR, a gray 
           werewolf on the dance floor. The vibe is like hyper-
           violent children’s theatre. 

                                 LEONARDO 
                                (acting in the scene)
                        Man, could this get any worse?!

           Ice begins dancing again. Shay smiles, into it. Chill 
           isn’t at all. He goes through the motions with dead eyes. 

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go! Go Ninja, Go 
                        Ninja, Go! Ninja! Ninja! Rap!

           INT. CRAFT SERVICE TABLE - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           A lavish snack spread. Ice sips a Perrier. Shay eats a 
           fancy muffin. Chill sits in silence, looking despondent.

                                 ICE
                        Ay yo. You feeling alright?

                                 CHILL
                        Nah, man. Not really. 

                                 SHAY
                        How you gonna say that in front of a 
                        table full of all these snacks?

           Chill shakes his head. Stands, agitated. 

                                 CHILL
                        I gotta ask, what the fuck we doing here? 

                                 ICE
                        Grinding. 

                                 SHAY
                        Making a blockbuster, son!

                                 CHILL
                        Yeah but, this feel real to you?

                                 ICE
                        It’s not suppose to be real. It’s a 
                        movie. We’re getting paid.
                                 CHILL
                        Just didn’t think it’d be like this. 

                                 ICE
                        Like what?

           The actors playing the Turtles pass by, their costumed 
           heads in their hands. They’re all blonde surfer bros.

                                 LEONARDO
                        Ice dude! Happy birthday! And on 
                        halloween -- were you born in a costume?

                                 ICE
                        Only my birthday suit.

           The Turtles guffaw. Chill shakes his head. 

                                 DONATELLO
                        Got any sick B-day plans, bro?

                                 ICE
                        Oh, you know, just killing it on a major 
                        motion picture...

                                 RAFAEL
                        Yeah, you are! That song was righteous!

                                 ICE
                        Thanks! Hey, cowabunga dudes! 

           The Turtles high-five him, wave “Shaka” signs and shuffle 
           off. Ice turns back to Chill, who stares at him woefully.

                                 CHILL
                        Like that.

                                 ICE
                        Remember when you asked me “who gets paid 
                        to rap?” We do. More than Hammer. More 
                        than Cube. More than anybody!

                                 CHILL
                        Yo, I asked you that when we were on the 
                        road. Not fucking with no Ninja Turtles 
                        sequel. No “Secret of the Ooze” --

                                 ICE
                        You’d rather be dancing in empty strip 
                        clubs in Chattanooga? Everyone’s gonna 
                        see this!

                                 CHILL
                        That’s the problem! 
           An overworked ASSISTANT DIRECTOR hurries up to them.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        Hey guys, we’ve got gear wrapping out. 
                        Can we move this onto stage B?

           INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

           Ice and Chill head down a large, industrial hall, walking 
           past CREW PEOPLE, trying to seem cordial, both fuming. 

                                 ICE
                        Man, why the fuck are you even here? 

                                 CHILL
                        I’ve been asking myself that every day.

           Shay tries to catch up, hands full of snacks.

                                 ICE
                        Really? ‘Cause I can hire anybody, 
                        anybody, to do what you’re doing right 
                        now. And they’d be happy to do it.

                                 CHILL
                        I should have never tricked your step-
                        daddy into letting you outta work. Should 
                        have known you’d sell the fuck out!

                                 ICE
                        Fuck you!

                                 CHILL
                        Nah, fuck you, fuck Charles, fuck Monte 
                        and fuck Tommy! They supermarket sweepin’ 
                        your ass! They don’t give a fuck about 
                        where that leaves you, me, any of us! 
                        Let’s see where they are when you’re 
                        getting hated on by everybody!

           Ice throws open two large doors, revealing...

           INT. STAGE B 

           ...a giant soundstage full of the ENTIRE CAST AND CREW. 
           An elaborate mix of birthday and halloween decorations.

                                 ENTIRE CAST AND CREW
                        Happy birthday!

           Chill freezes. Ice startles, then his face lights up. 
                                 ICE
                        Damn! You got me!

           Everybody laughs, cheering. Beth, his mom, steps forward, 
           along with Bryon and Kip.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        What are you guys doing here?!

           Beth hurries over, hugging and kissing him on the cheek.

                                 BETH
                        We wouldn’t miss this, baby!

           Bryon pats him on the back.

                                 BRYON
                        We’re so proud of you, Robbie!

                                 ROBBIE
                        It’s “Ice” now, Bryon.

           Laughter all around.

                                 BRYON
                        Right, sorry. Ice. 

           Tommy, Charles and Monte appear, singing “Happy 
           Birthday”. The crew joins in. Tommy slides forward a 
           director’s chair that reads “Vanilla Ice”.

                                 ICE
                        You guys! 

           Ice takes a seat as MASTER SPLINTER, the wise rat, pushes 
           a cart toward him that holds a giant Vanilla Ice Cream 
           cake with the TO THE EXTREME cover painted in frosting.

                                 MASTER SPLINTER
                        The path that leads to what we truly 
                        desire is long and difficult, but only by 
                        following that path, do we achieve --

                                 ICE
                                (cutting him off)
                        Thank y’all so much!

           Ice blows out his 23 candles. Huge applause. 

                                 CHARLES
                        I have an announcement! We all know “Ice 
                        Ice Baby” is still at the top of the 
                        charts, six weeks in a row. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLES (CONT'D)
                        And now, “To The Extreme” is not only 
                        triple platinum, it’s also the number one 
                        album in the country!

           Explosive cheers! Charles raises a thick gold chain with 
           a pendant reading “#1” and places it around Ice’s neck. 

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Everyone loves you, kid...

           Ice beams, his gaze shifting to the back of the room, 
           where Chill stands alone. He locks eyes with Ice for a 
           moment, hurt, then exits quietly. 

                                 ICE
                        Yo, let’s celebrate!

           Ice’s IT’S A PARTY drops as a surreal MONTAGE begins...

           -- Ice dances drunkenly with three of the turtles...

           -- Beth gyrates against Splinter. Byron and Kip cringe...

           -- The guys playing Tokka and Rahzar hold their masks in 
           their hands, taking bumps in the corner with Monte...

           -- Tommy stick fights with Donatello while Charles takes 
           on-the-fly bets from the grip crew...

           -- Shay makes out with APRIL O’NEIL...

           -- Ice looks hammered, taking it all in. Fully in it. 

           END MONTAGE

           INT. ELEVATORS - FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           The elevator opens and Big E steps out, making sure the 
           coast is clear. Then Ice emerges, in sunglasses, hood up.

           INT. GIFT SHOP - FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           Putting down a pack of Aspirin next to a bottle of 
           Dayquil and two Evians, Ice looks up at the GIFT SHOP 
           CLERK, who squints, recognizing him immediately.

                                 GIFT SHOP CLERK
                        Hey, aren’t you Vani --

           Big E holds up a giant hand, motioning for him to stop. 
           The clerk goes silent. Ice glances out of the door at 
           someone standing at the reception desk. It’s Chill.
           INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           Chill exits with a suitcase as Ice hurries after him.  

                                 ICE
                        Yo, Chill! Hold up!

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS - DAY

           Ice catches up to him, waiting at the curb for his cab. 

                                 ICE
                        What are you doing, man? Flight’s not 
                        ‘til Saturday.

                                 CHILL
                                (quietly)
                        Catching an early one. 

                                 ICE
                        What do you mean? 

           Chill avoids his eyes. Ice puts it together. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking serious? You quitting 
                        ‘cause of one little fight? 

           The cab pulls up and Chill hops in with no explanation. 
           As he goes to close the door, Ice grabs it, stopping him.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Album went to number one last night! 

                                 CHILL
                        Move out the way, man.

                                 ICE
                        You’re walking out on the winning team -- 
                        we’re living the dream! 

           Chill shakes his head, then meets Ice’s eyes.

                                 CHILL
                        Not mine.

           Chill slams his door. The cab pulls out, leaving Ice on 
           the curb, watching with a deeply pained look in his eyes.
           INT. STAGE - STARPLEX PAVILION - NIGHT

           Ice dances on stage in a platinum suit, parachute pants 
           to beat Hammer’s, costume glowing, nuclear. 

           CLOSE ON his face. He looks hollowed out. Exhausted. 

                                      DALLAS, TEXAS
                                     NOVEMBER, 1990 
                           VANILLA ICE’S FIRST HEADLINING TOUR

           Shay dances next to him. So does a new dancer, HI-TEC 
           (21) replacing Chill, a total pro. But it’s not the same. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Ice, Shay and Hi-Tec walk toward their dressing rooms, 
           Shay patting Hi-Tec on the back.

                                 SHAY
                        You killed it, son! Welcome to the VIP!

                                 HI-TEC
                        You know how we do! 

           Ice watches this exchange, feeling outside of it. Shay 
           and Hi-Tec push open a door to their dressing room, 
           heading in. Ice grabs Shay’s shoulder.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, Shay, can I talk to you for a sec? 

                                 SHAY
                        Of course. S’up?

                                 ICE
                        Thanks for staying loyal, man.  

                                 SHAY
                        Wouldn’t have it any other way! You know 
                        I love touring. 

                                 ICE
                        Me too. And Chill’s gonna miss out. On 
                        all of it. So fuck him.

           Shay shifts uncomfortably. 

                                 SHAY
                        He’ll be alright. 

                                 ICE
                        You talk to him?
                                 SHAY
                        Of course, man. It’s Chill.  

           Ice looks stung. Tries to hide it. Shay daps him up. 

                                 SHAY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you at the after party, homie. 

           He disappears into the dressing room, leaving Ice alone 
           in the hall, not feeling himself, not sure what to do. 

           INT. ICE’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Luxurious. Private. Ice enters and heads to the vanity 
           mirror where a STYLIST and MAKEUP ARTIST await. 

                                 STYLIST 
                        Great show.

                                 ICE 
                                (solemn)
                        Thanks.

           Sitting in a chair next to them is KEN PERKINS (32), 
           black, academic, in wireframe glasses and a tweed blazer.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Do I know you?

                                 KEN
                        Ken Perkins, Dallas Morning News. Tommy 
                        scheduled an interview about a month ago. 

           Ice shakes his hand, trying to muster the energy. 

                                 ICE
                        S’up Ken. 

           The stylist helps Ice change out of his concert gear. He 
           slips on his old Miami University sweatshirt. 

                                 KEN
                        Been looking forward to this.  

           Ice takes a seat in his “Vanilla Ice” director’s chair as 
           the Makeup Artist helps him remove his stage makeup. 

                                 ICE
                        Hit me. Ask, and you shall receive. 

                                 KEN
                        Alright. Maybe you could start by telling 
                        me about your origins. Where you from?
           Ice points to the logo on his sweatshirt. 

                                 ICE
                        Miami. Represent.

           Ken narrows his gaze. 

                                 KEN
                        I thought you grew up here in Dallas?

                                 ICE
                        Well, yeah, I lived in both places. 

                                 KEN
                        When were you in Miami? 

                                 ICE
                        When I was a kid.

                                 KEN
                        What years?

                                 ICE
                        I think ‘til I was about fifteen.

                                 KEN
                        You think? You’re not sure? 

           Ice shoots him a wary look. 

                                 ICE
                        Who are you man, Encyclopedia Brown?

                                 KEN
                        Just trying to figure out your timeline.

                                 ICE
                        We moved around a lot. I mostly grew up 
                        on the streets. That’s something I 
                        address on my album --

           Ken is completely uninterested in his album.

                                 KEN
                        So in Miami, you were classmates with 
                        Luther Campbell from 2 Live Crew?

                                 ICE
                        What? Where did you get that?

                                 KEN
                        Your bio.
                                 ICE
                        What bio?

                                 KEN
                        The one I got from your label. I looked 
                        into some of the facts and funny 
                        thing...Luther Campbell was born in 1960. 
                        You were born in ‘67. Means he graduated 
                        before you were a freshman.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah, he wasn’t there when I was.
                        Maybe they messed up some of the details. 
                        I can set the record straight though. 

                                 KEN
                        Alright. As a teenager, you won a 
                        motocross championship, then you were 
                        stabbed in a gang related incident...

                                 ICE
                        Yeah. I mean I don’t like talking it up --

                                 KEN
                        Was that in Miami?

                                 ICE
                        Yup yup. 

                                 KEN
                        Huh. 

           Perkins writes something down. Ice stares at him.

                                 ICE
                        What?

                                 KEN
                        Well, again according to your bio, you 
                        had already moved to Dallas.

           INT. CHARLE’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON the front page of the Dallas Morning Newspaper. 
           Headline: “VANILLA ICE’S FACADE IS MELTING.” Charles 
           reads the paper, across from Ice, Tommy, Monte. 

                                 ICE
                        This dude wasn’t like other reporters, 
                        man, he wasn’t asking me about the album 
                        at all. He was just out for the kill...
                                 CHARLES
                        Well there’s always going to be a bad 
                        apple in the bunch. You’re number one 
                        now. You’re a prime suspect to be picked 
                        on. That’s all there is to it. 

                                 MONTE
                        I mean if they can’t see you’re from the 
                        streets, then they’re blind. 

                                 ICE
                        He kept quoting my bio. Said he got it 
                        from you.

                                 CHARLES
                        We didn’t issue a bio. 

                                 ICE
                        Then who did?

           Charles and Monte look at each other blankly, then at 
           Tommy, who drops his eyes to his lap.

                                 TOMMY
                        I, uh, sent out a blurb. Nothing fancy. 
                        Just something to wet the appetite -- 

                                 ICE
                                (incensed)
                        You kidding me, Tommy? You know how this 
                        looks, right? Like I made up my past. 
                        They’re comparing me to Milli Vanilli! 

                                 CHARLES
                        You’re not running for office. Tommy was 
                        working in your best interest. This is 
                        entertainment. It’s how we sell records. 

                                 ICE
                        Yeah but people don’t think I’m from 
                        where I’m from --

                                 MONTE
                        You think Ice Cube lives in Compton? He 
                        moved to Burbank five years ago. I saw 
                        him at CoCo’s eating a fruit salad.

                                 ICE
                        My whole family read that article. My 
                        mom. My hometown thinks I’m a liar --

                                 CHARLES
                        Look, you exaggerated a couple of facts. 
                        So what? Give it a couple of weeks. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLES (CONT'D)
                        In one ear out the other. I’d be worried 
                        if they had something bigger. But they 
                        don’t. So relax. Worst of it’s over. 

           Ice stares at Charles, then nods, trying to relax as we 
           hear the sounds of an MTV NEWS LEAD IN. 

           INT. MTV NEWS STUDIO - DAY

           Kurt Loder sits at his MTV news desk, reporting. 

                                 KURT LODER
                        This week a scandal broke out about a 
                        white rapper from Suburban Miami Lakes, 
                        Florida, who calls himself Vanilla Ice. 

           A SHOT of Ice dancing to ICE ICE BABY in concert. 

                                 JOHN NORRIS (V.O.)
                        Like other rappers, Vanilla Ice includes 
                        samples and re-recorded versions of other 
                        songs for background beats on his debut 
                        album “To The Extreme.” In fact Ice’s pop 
                        hit “Ice Ice Baby” has a rhythm track 
                        that’s almost identical to the 1982 Queen 
                        and David Bowie hit “Under Pressure.” 

           A CLIP of a music video with a SUPER: “Under Pressure -- 
           Queen/David Bowie” comparing the identical baseline. 

                                 JOHN NORRIS (V.O.)
                        Recently when MC Hammer used the baseline 
                        from “Super Freak” in his number one 
                        single “You Can’t Touch This,” he gave 
                        half of the writing credit to Rick James. 
                        But for “Ice Ice Baby,” Ice only gives 
                        credit to himself and his DJ Earthquake.

           A SHOT of Ice getting grilled in an interview. This is 
           familiar -- it’s the same shot that opened the movie.

                                 ICE
                        It doesn’t sound anything like “Under 
                        Pressure.” Only thing that sounds like 
                        “Under Pressure” is the hook. We sampled 
                        it from them but it’s not the same 
                        baseline. It goes DING DING DING DIGA 
                        DING DING. DING DING DING DIGA DING DING. 
                        That’s the way there’s goes. Ours goes 
                        DING DING DING TING AHH DING DING. DING 
                        DING DING TING AHH DING DING. That little 
                        bitty “ting.” It’s not the same!
           Another comparison of the videos for ICE ICE BABY and 
           UNDER PRESSURE. Their baselines are the same. Clearly.

                                 NORRIS (V.O.)
                        But what if he were asked to fork over 
                        royalties to the “Under Pressure” 
                        composers? Say, through their attorneys? 
                        Would the Iceman comply?

           BACK TO Ice in his interview, smiling widely. 

                                 ICE
                        Of course!

           INT. BOARD ROOM - COHEN AND LORUSSO LAW OFFICES - DAY

           CLOSE ON Ice, crushed. He sits with Tommy in a boardroom 
           opposite FOUR IMPOSING LAWYERS (60’s). 

           Tommy signs paperwork, then pushes it to Ice, who also 
           signs, sliding it to the lawyers. 

           EXT. LAW OFFICES - DAY

           Big E opens the lobby doors, escorting Ice and Tommy out, 
           both of them in sunglasses, keeping their heads down. 
           REPORTERS and PAPARAZZI swarm around them.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Tommy! Do Queen and David Bowie now own 
                        the rights to “Ice Ice Baby?” 

                                 TOMMY
                        They’re receiving songwriting credit, but 
                        it’s Ice’s song. He came up with it. And 
                        no one can take that away from him.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Can you comment on the rumor that David 
                        Bowie doesn’t want to be associated with 
                        Vanilla Ice?

           Tommy’s face darkens but he keeps an even tone. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Ziggy Stardust is highly overrated!

           INT./EXT. PRIVATE CAR - DAY

           Tommy and Ice sit in the backseat. A deathly silence 
           between them. Finally --
                                 TOMMY
                        I think that went well...

           Ice doesn’t reply. The car slows to a stop. 

                                 ICE
                                (confused)
                        Why we stopping?

                                 TOMMY
                        Made a res for you at The Palm. You need 
                        some time to yourself.

           Ice nods begrudgingly and gets out.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I know it feels awful now. But we’re 
                        still on top and we’re gonna stay there.

                                 ICE
                        Whatever.

           INT. THE PALM RESTAURANT - DAY

           Ice eats chicken strips in a private booth, sunglasses 
           still on. Big E sits next to him, chomping on a double 
           cheeseburger. A WAITER passes. 

                                 BIG E
                        Can I get another order of curly fries? 

           The waiter nods and hurries toward the kitchen, passing 
           the front entrance as a GIANT BLACK GUY walks in, over 
           6’7”, scanning the place. 

           AN EVEN LARGER BLACK GUY enters behind him. Then FIVE 
           OTHERS. All dressed in black from head to toe.

           Big E stares at them, frozen. Ice sees his expression but 
           doesn’t look, not wanting to be spotted.

                                 ICE
                        Yo -- Paparazzi?

                                 BIG E
                        Uhh...

           The long shadows of the men fall over Ice’s table. He 
           turns, confused, coming face to face with their leader. 
           It’s SUGE KNIGHT (26), bald, bearded, menacing as hell.

           A concerned MANAGER (60’s) heads their way. 
                                 MANAGER
                        Can I help you, gentlemen?

           Suge’s men cut him off, backing him toward the entrance.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me! What do you think you’re --

           They muscle him outside. The others flank the booth. One 
           of them puts a hard hand on Big E’s shoulder.

                                 SUGE’S THUG
                        Get up. 

           Big E doesn’t move. 

                                 SUGE’S THUG (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make us get you up.

                                 BIG E
                        What do you want?

                                 SUGE’S THUG
                        A word with your boy. That’s all.

           Big E shoots Ice a helpless look, then stands as two more 
           of the men escort him outside. Suge slides into his spot, 
           sitting across from Ice. 

                                 ICE
                        You guys fans? 

           They all snicker at this. Everyone but Suge. He stares 
           through Ice. It’s terrifying.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                                (voice shaking)
                        Look, I’m...I’m just trying to eat, so -- 

           Suge reaches out, grabs Ice’s plate and pulls it over to 
           his side of the table slowly. Ice doesn’t stop him. Suge 
           picks up a chicken strip, chomping down on it. 

           Ice watches him eat the rest of his meal in silence. When 
           he’s done, he licks the grease off his giant fingers, 
           then stands, walking out. His thugs follow.  

           A moment later, the manager hurries back inside, 
           flustered, beelining toward a bartender.

                                 MANAGER
                        Johnny, call the police!
           Big E stumbles in behind him, his shirt mussed, collar 
           torn, lip bleeding. He heads toward Ice.

                                 ICE 
                                (tiny)
                        ...Who the fuck was that? 

           INT. CHARLES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Tommy sits with Ice, Monte and Charles. Big E stands by 
           the door in a new shirt, his face cleaned up. 

                                 TOMMY
                                (sighing)
                        It was Suge Knight. 

                                 ICE
                        Who is Suge Knight?

                                 TOMMY
                        Just a thug from Compton. 

                                 MONTE
                        Al Capone wannabe. Been trying to muscle 
                        his way into the business for years. I 
                        wouldn’t give it a second thought.

                                 ICE
                        These guys made Big E look like Gary 
                        Coleman. Busted his lip. Tell ‘em E!

           Big E averts his gaze, ashamed. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t we press charges? 

                                 TOMMY
                        We get the cops involved, he’ll harass us 
                        more, not less. Thug mentality. I dealt 
                        with this at City Lights. I’ll make sure 
                        he’s not a problem. Alright?

           Ice stares at Tommy, unsatisfied. Charles shifts 
           impatiently in his chair, checking his watch. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Guys, I’ve got a five thirty...

                                 MONTE
                                (nodding)
                        We should move this along. 
                                 ICE
                        Move what along? 

           Monte stands, sauntering over to a large pad of paper on 
           an easel, flipping it to reveal an elaborate flow chart. 

                                 MONTE
                        We’ve got awards season coming up and 
                        you’re a front runner for Best New Artist 
                        at the Grammy’s, the AMA’s and the 
                        Billboard Music Awards. We’re going to 
                        campaign aggressively for noms. 

           Tommy nods. Monte points to a new part of the chart.

                                 MONTE (CONT’D)
                        We set up performances at the award shows 
                        and on late night, everyone but Arsenio. 
                        Tough nut. But we’ll crack him.

           Ice nods, feeling a little better. Monte keeps flowing. 

                                 MONTE (CONT’D)
                        Next, we’ve got an Avon book deal in the 
                        works for your autobiography. 

                                 ICE
                        Whoa. How am I going to write a book?

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m almost done with it.

                                 ICE
                        What? When the fuck did you do that? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Nights and weekends. 

           Ice stares at him, incredulous.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                                (reassuring)
                        You can give it a proof read. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Alright, let’s get to the part I like... 

           Charles hits an intercom button on his phone.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ...Erin. 

                                 EMILY (ON INTERCOM) 
                        It’s Emily.
                                 CHARLES
                        Right. Emily. Bring it in.

           His sprightly assistant EMILY (23) enters with a 
           Christmas present. Red wrapping paper, green bow. She 
           smiles at Ice and hands it to him. He takes it, confused. 

                                 EMILY
                        Open it!

           Ice unwraps it, revealing a Vanilla Ice doll in a pink 
           and purple box, that reads “Postcard and Fan Club Info 
           Inside!” It’s a Ken doll, bearing his face and name.  

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                                (rehearsed)
                        Move over Cabbage Patch kids! Forget the 
                        Transformers! ‘Cause this holiday season, 
                        Santa’s got a new number one request!

           A long pause as Ice processes whatever the hell this is.

                                 ICE
                        I don’t know what to say.

           Charles nods, mistaking his response for gratitude.

                                 CHARLES
                        We knew you’d be thrilled. 

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL ROOM 

           Ice lies in bed, replaying the days weird, awful events 
           in his sleepless mind. He grabs his wallet off the 
           nightstand and removes a paper scrap, debating something. 

           Picking up the phone, he dials a number on the paper. An 
           answering machine plays an almost forgotten voice. 

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        It’s Sadie. Here it comes. Wait for it...

           BEEP! Ice inhales, then stops himself, not sure what to 
           say. He hangs up, burying his head in his pillow.

           INT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           WE CRANE ACROSS the audience of a live awards show, 
           packed with the biggest stars of the era: JANET JACKSON, 
           BELL BIV DEVOE, BON JOVI, MÖTLEY CRÜE, EN VOGUE...
                                  AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS
                                     JANUARY, 1991 

           A young KEENAN IVORY WAYANS (33) hosts. 

                                 KEENAN
                        Alright -- he went from motorcycles to 
                        music but he never stopped racing. 
                        Because his album zoomed to quadruple 
                        platinum in just two months. He crossed 
                        the finish line when he became the first 
                        rapper ever to hit number one on the pop 
                        singles charts. Here is the cool, the 
                        cold, the very hot, Vanilla Ice!

           The curtain rises on a second stage revealing Ice and the 
           VIP in sequined American flag outfits with a live band.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        The VIP is cold baby! Woof! Woof! 

           ICE ICE BABY drops. The crowd goes wild. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Ice and the VIP hurry off stage, covered in sweat, high 
           on adrenaline, cheers still echoing down the hall.

           They hurry toward their dressing rooms, burning past MC 
           Hammer, in line with FIFTEEN OTHER DANCERS. 

           Ice pauses, turns back and approaches Hammer.

                                 ICE
                        Yo, Hammer! See that shit?! Nothing left 
                        to dance on! We burned that stage down!

                                 HAMMER
                        Look, uh, we’re trying to get ready so --

                                 ICE
                        Oh, my B. See y’all after the show.

           Ice struts away. Hammer can’t shake something. 

                                 HAMMER
                                (calling out)
                        You know, you’re not saying it right.

           Ice stops, turns back, not sure what he means.

                                 HAMMER (CONT’D)
                        It’s “Word to the mother.”
                                 ICE
                                (grinning)
                        Yeah, I know. I just spun it. Thought 
                        it’d be funny. Like. Ironic. 

                                 HAMMER
                        Yeah, well, it’s not. 

                                 ICE
                        Alright, man. That’s your opinion. 

                                 HAMMER
                        Nah, that’s a fact. 

                                 ICE
                        You can believe that all you want --

                                 HAMMER
                        And you can kiss my black ass. 

           Hammer’s dancers let out deep, guttural laughs. Long time 
           coming. Ice reddens, embarrassed. He tries to respond, 
           but their laughter resounds, shutting him down.

           INT. SHRINE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           ON A GIANT SCREEN on stage, nominees are presented...

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Mariah Carey!

           A CLIP from her video, EMOTIONS. Over it, we see MARIAH 
           (23) live in the audience. She winks coquettishly at us.   

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Wilson Phillips!

           A CLIP from HOLD ON. Over it, we see the THREE PHILLIPS 
           SISTERS (20’s) smiling, holding hands in the audience. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        And Vanilla Ice!

           A CLIP from ICE ICE BABY. Over it, we see Ice, miserable, 
           still sulking from his encounter with Hammer. 

           On stage, DAVID CASSIDY (35) and LAUREN MORGAN (26) 
           present the award, both sporting unironic mullets. 

                                 DAVID CASSIDY
                        And the winner for Favorite Pop/Rock New 
                        Artist is...
           David opens the envelope. 

                                 DAVID CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        ...Vanilla Ice!

           In the audience, Ice stands, surprised, not ready for 
           this. Tommy and the VIP jump up, jostling him forward. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ice steps up to the podium and David hands him the award. 
           He leans toward the mic, no speech prepared.

                                 ICE
                        Aww yeah! Yeah...Tommy, where you at man?

           Ice grabs Tommy and pulls him forward, arm around him.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to thank my manager here, Tommy 
                        Quon. SBK records, everybody, and uh...

           Ice locks eyes with Hammer in the crowd.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        ...Word to your mother!

           Hammer shakes his head and gets up, excusing himself. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        And the people who try to hold me down 
                        and talk bad about me...

           As Hammer walks out, Ice raises his voice louder.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Kiss my white butt! Word to your mother!

           Screams and cheers as Hammer disappears. Ice nods, 
           affirmed, undefeated, thrusting his award into the air. 

           EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT

           IN SLOW-MOTION wind blows through Ice’s hair, the roar of 
           the crowd echoing in his ears. He’s floating in orbit, 
           eyes closed, arms out, suspended.

           WIDEN OUT to reveal that he’s standing up through the 
           sunroof of a limo, weaving through the Hollywood Hills. 
           Someone tugs at him from below and he drops back down...
           INT./ EXT. LIMO 

           ...sitting next to Tommy, Shay, Hi-Tec and the band THE 
           BANGLES. All drunk, high, laughing, ecstatic. Hi-Tec 
           passes Ice a coke-lined mirror.

                                 ICE
                        Nah, I’m cool...

                                 HI-TEC
                        Come on! Get loose! We’re celebrating!

                                 ICE
                        Alright, fuck it...

           He does a bump. Tommy holds a giant cellphone. 

                                 TOMMY (ON PHONE)
                        Uh huh! Yup, I’m with him right now! I’ll 
                        tell him! Alright, you too!

           He hangs up, looking at Ice gleefully. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Guess who wants you on his show tomorrow?

                                 ICE
                        Who?

           Tommy grins coyly.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Who?!

           INT. TALK SHOW STAGE - DAY

           The iconic “Hoo Hoo Hoo” chant of an AUDIENCE OF THREE 
           HUNDRED on a blue and purple talk show set.

                                  THE ARSENIO HALL SHOW

           Ice sits on a couch, pumping his fist in the air next to 
           ARSENIO HALL (35), lean, dapper, in his prime. He waits 
           patiently for the audience to settle. 

                                 ARSENIO
                        So I hear last night, you made a 
                        statement that they had to bleep out, at 
                        least on the west coast, and the 
                        statement was...uh...
                                (reading)
                        ”Those that try to hold the Iceman down 
                        can kiss my white...A double S.” 
                                 ICE
                        Yup, yup. 

                                 ARESENIO
                        Now you’ve got time to expound on that.

           Light laughs from the crowd.

                                 ICE
                        Well I basically said it because, the 
                        people who said “white boy can’t make it 
                        in rap music”, well kiss my white...you 
                        know the rest. It’s like, “Ha! Right in 
                        your face!” 

                                 ARSENIO
                        So this is a white rapper being 
                        suppressed kind of revenge?

           Laughter from the crowd. Ice keeps his composure.

                                 ICE
                        Something like that...

                                 ARSENIO
                        You’ve been embroiled in a lot of 
                        controversy. The press has been really 
                        hard on you lately, saying that you lie 
                        about your background --

                                 ICE
                        That’s old news though. 

                                 ARSENIO
                        Well I haven’t interviewed you, so it’s 
                        new news for my audience...

           The audience cheers. Ice starts to sweat, nodding, 
           despite himself, no longer sure if this was a good idea.

                                 ARSENIO (CONT’D)
                        What do you have to say to the press and 
                        the way they’ve been after you?

                                 ICE
                        Well you know there’s always going to be 
                        a bad apple in the bunch. Ever since my 
                        record went number one, I’m a prime 
                        suspect to be picked on and they’re 
                        picking on me. But if you can’t see that 
                        I’m from the streets then you’re blind. 

           Applause for Ice. But Arsenio’s not buying any of it.
                                 ARSENIO
                        KRS-ONE said you present “a distorted 
                        mutation of rap.” What does that mean?

                                 ICE
                        I have no idea. I read the same article. 
                        But they also said that I’m bringing rap 
                        music to an audience that has never heard 
                        it before. You know, rap music is here to 
                        stay. No matter what color it is. I’m not 
                        the Elvis of rap, that’s another thing... 

           The audience laughs.

                                 ARSENIO
                        ...I’m Vanilla Ice. 

           Cheers. Arsenio nods, careful about his next question.

                                 ARSENIO (CONT’D)
                        I guess you and Hammer have been having 
                        some problems too. 

           Ice freezes, not prepared for this. 

                                 ARSENIO (CONT’D)
                        Hammer took you on the road and now 
                        you’ve been quoted saying things about 
                        him. How did that battle come about and 
                        when did the friendship break off? 

                                 ICE
                        There’s no battle. We’re still friends. 
                        As far as I’m concerned I’ve never said 
                        anything bad about Hammer --

                                 ARSENIO
                        You talked about opening for Hammer but 
                        you getting more screams and applause...

                                 ICE
                        Is that saying anything bad about Hammer? 

                                 ARSENIO
                        How about you being sexier than Hammer, 
                        you dancing better than Hammer --

                                 ICE
                        I never said that.

                                         ARSENIO
                        So the press is twisting things you said?
                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Exactly. I have nothing bad to say 
                        about him. I’m not against anybody.

                                 ARSENIO
                        Well Hammer will be happy to hear that.
                        I talked to him last night. He just says 
                        that, brother, he was hurt by it all. 

           A STAGE MANAGER motions to wrap it up. 

                                 ARSENIO (CONT’D)
                        This is Vanilla Ice. The album is called 
                        “To The Extreme.”

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Ice rips off his jacket like he’s suffocating, throwing 
           it across the room, almost hitting his stylist.

                                 STYLIST
                        Whoa!

           He grabs the sides of the vanity, his arms shaking, 
           rattling the contents on the table like he’s going to 
           tear it off the wall. Tommy enters.

                                 TOMMY
                        Well that was exciting --

                                 ICE
                        That was a fucking nightmare, Tommy! 

           Tommy glances at the stylist and makeup artist, both 
           terrified. He nods for them to exit and they hurry out.

                                 TOMMY
                        So things got a little contentious --

           Ice spins toward Tommy.

                                 ICE
                        Were you watching the same interview, 
                        man? Arsenio just bled me out on live TV!

                                 TOMMY
                        Look, I’m just saying it was in good 
                        spirits. This is gonna be great for us -- 

                                 ICE
                        Can’t you see it!? I’m a fucking joke! 
                                 TOMMY
                        It’s just showbiz! The fans know that! 
                        You were cool as a cucumber. And funny. 
                        And so what, Arsenio drew a little blood. 
                        You’ll walk it off -- 

           Ice turns and storms out...

           EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY

           ...hurrying toward a limo outside of Arsenio’s building. 
           The DRIVER opens the back door and Ice dives inside as 
           Tommy catches up, smiling, acting like everything’s cool.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey! Go easy tonight, alright? Remember, 
                        tomorrow morning we’ve got a --

           Ice grabs the door and slams it in Tommy’s face. 

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bursting in, Ice hears the phone ringing. He picks up.

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                                (right where he left off)
                        -- big day and you really need your rest.

                                 ICE
                        Back up off me man!

           Ice slams the phone down, then dials reception. 

                                 RECEPTION (O.S.)
                        How can we help, Mr. Montoya? 

                                 ICE
                        Hold all my calls. 

           He hangs up, turning toward...Big E, carrying a box. 

                                 BIG E
                        Tommy said you gotta sign these...

           Ice tears it open. It’s full of books with the title: 
           “Ice by Ice: The Vanilla Ice Story in His Own Words.” 

           He storms into his bedroom and slams the door.
           INT. ICE’S HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sitting on his bed, Ice reels, trying to get his mind off 
           everything. He grabs the remote, turning on the TV. 

           On screen, it’s SNL. KEVIN BACON impersonates VANILLA ICE 
           on CHRIS ROCK’S fake black power talk show Nat X.

                                 KEVIN BACON AS ICE 
                        I’m from the streets. 

           Bacon wears a sad version of Ice’s sequined American Flag 
           suit. Rock wears a Daishiki and a giant afro. 

                                 NAT X 
                        What street?! Sesame street?!

           Huge laughs. Ice turns the TV off. Closes his eyes. 
           Breathes deeply. Searching for any remaining calm. The 
           sound of his door opening. Big E’s footsteps.

                                 ICE
                                (eyes closed)
                        Yo, Big, I just need some peace and qu --

           Without warning, Ice is dragged violently off the bed!

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL SUITE

           He flails, disoriented, just before A MASSIVE HAND wrings 
           his neck, pinning him against the wall. A face comes into 
           focus. It’s Suge Knight. 

                                 SUGE
                        Happy to see me?

           Behind him, two of Suge’s thugs beats Big E mercilessly 
           with the butt of his own .357 Magnum.

                                 ICE
                                (panicked)
                        What -- what do you want?

           Suge nods toward the far corner of the room.

                                 SUGE
                        Remember him?

           Ice’s eyes dart to a timid, skinny black kid hugging the 
           wall, staring at the floor. He looks familiar. 
                                 ICE
                                (baffled)
                        ...That’s...the intern?

                                 SUGE
                        His name is Mario. AKA Chocolate. AKA the 
                        motherfucker who wrote “Ice Ice Baby.”

                                 ICE
                        What?! 

           Suge picks Ice up by his neck. He gasps, choking horribly 
           as Suge hauls him onto the balcony...

           EXT. ICE’S HOTEL BALCONY

           ...and over the railing, hanging him 10 stories above 
           Sunset by his left leg.  

                                 ICE
                        Please! Don’t!

                                 SUGE
                        Who wrote “Ice Ice Baby”?

                                 ICE
                        Fuck! Help! Help!

           Suge loosens his grip, letting Ice slide a foot closer to 
           oblivion before catching him by the ankle.

                                 SUGE
                        I ain’t asking again.

                                 ICE
                        The intern! Mario! Chocolate! Whatever 
                        the fuck! Just pull me up!

           INT. ICE’S HOTEL SUITE

           CLOSE ON Ice’s shaking hand, signing “Robert Van Winkle,” 
           on a wrinkled contract. Suge snatches it from him. 

                                 SUGE
                        Fuck with us at all, get your people 
                        involved, you’ll wish I dropped your ass. 

           Ice nods, petrified.

                                 SUGE (CONT’D)
                        Nice doing business with you.  
           Suge, Mario and his thugs file out of the room, slamming 
           the door behind them. 

           WIDE ON the hotel suite. Everything trashed, furniture 
           broken, pictures shattered on the floor. Big E sits half-
           conscious in a pool of his own blood. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE - ICE’S MIAMI ESTATE - DAY 

           Eight GIANT SECURITY GUARDS with exposed machine guns and 
           three DOBERMANS flank the gate of a sprawling estate. 

                                     MIAMI, FLORIDA
                                       APRIL, 1991

           A black Mercedes minivan pulls up. A guard approaches, 
           hand firmly on his gun.

           The window rolls down: It’s Tommy. Sleepless. Impatient.

                                 GUARD
                        ID please.

                                 TOMMY
                                (sighing)
                        Seriously? You know who I am. 

                                 GUARD
                        ID or get the fuck out of here. 

           Tommy hands him his ID. He takes it to the other guards, 
           who all inspect it, scratching their heads. A loud BEEP. 

                                 ICE (ON INTERCOM) 
                        It’s alright, fellas. Let him through.

                                          TOMMY
                        About time!

           The guard returns and hands him back his ID. A Yin Yang 
           symbol on the gate parts and Tommy drives through. 

           INT. ICE’S MIAMI ESTATE - DAY 

           The front door creaks open, unlocked. Tommy sticks his 
           head inside cautiously.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hello?

           His voice echoes through a large foyer. Roman-inspired 
           design straight out of Scarface. A TV blares nearby.
           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Tommy enters, carrying a briefcase, following the sound 
           to...Ice, lounging on an Eames chair, remote in hand, 
           watching “At the Movies” on a giant screen. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Would it kill you to return my calls --

           Ice raises a hand, shushing him. On TV, Siskel and Ebert 
           discuss a movie on their seminal show.

                                 SISKEL (ON TV)
                        I only smiled at some of the silly prat 
                        falls. After that, Ninja Turtles II was 
                        really depressing to sit through.

                                 EBERT (ON TV)
                        I think there’s something going on with 
                        these Turtles that’s telling us an 
                        alarming truth about our society. 

           Ice hits pause on his remote, sitting in silence. 

                                 TOMMY
                        So critics hated it. Big surprise. 

                                 ICE
                        You know, I’ve finally had some time to 
                        think and one thing keeps hitting me. 
                        Through all of this shit, you haven’t 
                        protected me. Not from the critics, not 
                        from the label, not from this shitty 
                        movie and damn sure not from Suge Knight. 

           Tommy opens his briefcase and pulls out a folder, tossing 
           it on Ice’s lap. He stares at it for a second, then flops 
           it opens. Inside: Suge’s wrinkled contract. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                                (eyes bugging)
                        How’d you get this?

                                 TOMMY
                        Did you read it?

                                 ICE
                        When?! When I was pleading for my life?

                                 TOMMY
                        Well, it was written by someone...law 
                        adjacent, let’s put it that way. It not 
                        only wouldn’t hold up in court, it isn’t 
                        even spell checked --
           Ice stands, all the fear rushing back.

                                 ICE
                        I’m dead. He’s gonna fucking kill me --

                                 TOMMY
                        Settle down. 

                                 ICE
                        Don’t fucking tell me to settle down --

                                 TOMMY
                        I talked to him.

                                 ICE
                                (freezing)
                        When?

                                 TOMMY
                        On Tuesday. At The Palm, funny enough. 
                        And Mario Lavelle Johnson AKA Chocolate 
                        AKA our former intern now owns ten 
                        percent of “Ice Ice Baby”. 

                                 ICE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 TOMMY
                        We drafted up the right paperwork. And I 
                        signed over ten of my points to him. 

                                 ICE
                        You just said you didn’t have to?

                                 TOMMY
                        And you’ve got an armed militia at your 
                        gate. You’ve been holed up like Howard 
                        Hughes. I’m worried about you. 

           Ice stares at Tommy, still in disbelief.

                                 ICE
                        So...Suge’s cool?

                                 TOMMY
                        Oh, he’s more than cool. He just won the 
                        lottery. He’s starting a label with my 
                        money. Even tried to poach you from SBK. 

           Ice takes this in, then sighs in extreme relief.
                                 ICE
                        I don’t know what to say, man. 
                                (beat)
                        Thank you.

                                 TOMMY
                                (waving it off)
                        We’ll make it back. But we’ve gotta get  
                        down to business. 

           Ice nods obediently. 

                                 ICE
                        What do we got? 

                                 TOMMY
                        Universal sent over a script. 

                                 ICE
                                (smirking)
                        What, they making a Care Bears Two? 

           Tommy shakes his head. Sick of this. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Siskel & Ebert forgot to mention Turtles 
                        opened at number one. It’s tracking to be 
                        one of the highest March debuts ever.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah but it’s not me; it’s not Ice.

                                 TOMMY
                        I get it, alright? No more kids stuff. 
                        This is a serious role. Like you wanted. 
                        Rough, rugged and raw. 

                                 ICE
                        Sorry, but, I ain’t doing another movie. 
                        Nothing you say is gonna change that. 

                                 TOMMY
                        They’re offering a million dollars. 

           Ice stares at Tommy.

           INT. ZIEGFELD THEATRE - NIGHT

           The sound of ominous 80’s synth pads on a black screen. 
           “UNIVERSAL PICTURES presents” fades up, followed by “a 
           KOPPELMAN / BANDIER-CARNEGIE production...”
           The synth gains momentum as we cut to a CLOSE-UP of super 
           model NAOMI CAMPBELL (21) holding a microphone.

                                 NAOMI CAMPBELL
                        Woooo!

           A hard street beat drops. A card that reads “VANILLA ICE” 
           in neon orange and green fills the entire screen.

           APPLAUSE and SCREAMS as we cut to the film’s title, “cooL 
           AS iCE” in those exact funky cAPS. 

                                 NAOMI CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                                (lip-syncing)
                        Got to get loose!

           In the audience, Ice sits in a baggy black satin suit 
           next to Tommy. The house is packed. Tommy raises a hand 
           and they dap it up, grinning, beyond excited. 

                                      NEW YORK CITY
                                      OCTOBER, 1991
                                 “cooL AS iCE” PREMIERE

           On screen, a striking, slow-motion MONTAGE begins...

           -- A MAN’S BLACK BOOTS walk through water

           -- DANCERS fill a smokey industrial warehouse

           -- A RASTA DUDE tosses his dreadlocks back

           -- Naomi Campbell gyrates in front of an industrial fan

           We now cut to Ice, spotlit, wearing an orange windbreaker 
           and a backwards starter cap, tag still on. He’s holding a 
           mic and drops a hard verse, rapping as credits appear.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        Face the music I’m right behind / With a 
                        posse a mic and a funky rhyme / Doesn’t 
                        take a lot of time for me to climb -- 

           The verse is one of his best. Combined with the 
           chiaroscuro imagery, it’s electrifying. Dancers break in 
           an orgiastic frenzy. Ice seems unstoppable. He’s back.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        A lesson well taught here’s some more 
                        advice / I don’t sweat it on a mic ‘cause 
                        I’m cool as Ice. 

           In the audience: SCREAMS. ADULATION. Tommy’s blown away. 
                                 TOMMY
                        Holy shit! It hasn’t even started yet!

                                 ICE
                        Yeah, it’s a dope intro, but... 

           Ice hesitates. Tommy can see something’s wrong. Ice leans 
           toward him, whispering in his ear.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        ...I don’t know about the rest of it. 

           Tommy pulls away, staring at Ice, baffled. 

                                 TOMMY
                        What are you talking about?! 

           INT. ZIEGFELD THEATRE - LATER

           We’re fifteen minutes into the movie: KATHY and her 
           conservatively dressed boyfriend NICK (20’s), stand on 
           the front steps of a suburban home across from Ice. 

           Kathy grabs Nick’s hand, pulling him toward the house.

                                 KATHY
                        Come on. We’re wasting his time.

                                 ICE
                        You’re not wasting my time. I’m just 
                        coolin’.

                                 KATHY
                        Then you’re wasting our time.

           Their delivery and timing are comically bad. This could 
           be a John Waters film, if it were intentional.

                                 ICE
                        Alright, I get it. Check this though, you 
                        need me, I’ll be right over there.

                                 NICK
                        She won’t.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah, we’ll see about that. 

           Ice shuffles toward the curb, stopping, turning back. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, Kat. Words of wisdom. Drop that 
                        zero and get with the hero. 
           Groans from the audience. In just a few short minutes, 
           the atmosphere has shifted from exhilarating to bleak. 

           Ice eyes Tommy, worried. Tommy motions, “It’ll be okay.”

           INT. ZIEGFELD THEATRE - LATER

           We’re an hour into the movie now. On screen, Ice lounges 
           on a stack of 2x4’s at a deserted construction site. Kat 
           sits on his neon yellow Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle. 

                                 KAT
                        Where are you from?

                                 ICE
                        It ain’t where you’re from it’s where 
                        you’re at anyway. And right now, I’m here 
                        with you, Kat.

                                 KAT
                        So what’s important to you?

                                 ICE
                        If you ain’t true to yourself, then you 
                        ain’t true to nobody. Live your life as 
                        someone else, and you ain’t really 
                        living. Straight up fact.

           Now Ice chases Kat through the frame of an unfinished 
           house, playing a sexy game of tag. Kat grabs him, kissing 
           him as the camera spins around them, Michael Bay style. 

           A slow-jam begins. Ice raps on the soundtrack in what is 
           undoubtedly the worst song he ever made.

                                 ICE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        Love at first sight / I recite feelings 
                        in my heart I hope that we will never 
                        part...

           Now Kat teaches Ice how to ride a white horse in a field. 
           We have no idea why.

           Unapologetic laughter from the audience. Tommy himself 
           lets out an involuntary snicker, then turns to Ice. 

                                 TOMMY
                                (trying to hold it in)
                        Sorry...

           Ice sinks down in his seat.
           INT. CHARLES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Monte holds up a copy of the “Washington Post,” reading 
           to Tommy and Charles. Ice isn’t there...thankfully.

                                 MONTE
                                (reading)
                        Having established that he can't rap or 
                        dance, Vanilla Ice now adds acting to his 
                        resume. And judging by the thin crowds at 
                        screenings of his feature film debut, it 
                        might have been called "Cold as Ice.” 

           He puts down the paper. 

                                 CHARLES
                        How’s it grossing? 

                                 MONTE
                        It opened nine spots below “Ernest Scared 
                        Stupid.”

                                 CHARLES
                        We should have put him in that instead.
                                (beat)
                        What about the album? 

                                 MONTE
                        It’s gonna drop off the top 200 Friday.

                                 CHARLES
                        And Extremely Live?

                                 MONTE
                        Extremely dead. Not charting at all. 

           Charles shakes his head and stands, staring out of his 
           panoramic window. A moment of silence.

                                 CHARLES
                        Nobody sells seven million records then 
                        just falls off the face of the earth.
                                (beat)
                        We gotta stop the bleeding, get him back 
                        on tour again. How fast can he turn 
                        around a new album?

                                 TOMMY
                        Can I be frank? He’s been in overdrive 
                        for a while now and...he’s tired. 
                        Especially after the last tour, the Suge 
                        situation, the movie. I don’t want to 
                        burn him out entirely. We keep bending 
                        him, he might break. 
                                 CHARLES
                        I didn’t ask how he felt about it, Tommy.

                                 MONTE
                        We’ve got a narrow window of time here -- 

                                 CHARLES
                                (firm)
                        He needs to stay in the spotlight. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Forgive me, but don’t you think he might 
                        be just a little...overexposed already? 

                                 MONTE
                        What are you talking about?

           Tommy motions out of the window to what Charles is 
           looking at: a massive “cooL AS iCE” billboard on Sunset.

                                 TOMMY
                        People can only take so much. 

                                 CHARLES
                        You begged us for Top Priority. We gave 
                        it to you. And it wasn’t cheap.

                                 TOMMY
                        Look, I’m grateful. But now that we’ve 
                        got everyone’s attention, would it hurt 
                        to be a little more...discriminating?

                                 CHARLES
                        Where I’m from, we don’t bow down to each 
                        other and back away. This is the west, 
                        for Christ’s sake. 

                                 TOMMY
                                (quietly)
                        Not what I meant. 

                                 CHARLES
                        I’m gonna ask again -- How fast can he 
                        turn around a new album?

           INT. RECORDING BOOTH - ICE’S HOME STUDIO - DAY

           CLOSE ON a line of cocaine on a flattened music stand. A 
           nostril vacuums it up. Ice swings his head back.

                                 ICE
                        Woooo! Okay!
           He steps up to a mic, putting his headphones on. He’s 
           lost weight, his cheeks hollow, skin pale and blemished. 

                                     MIAMI, FLORIDA
                                     TWO YEARS LATER

           Earthquake sits behind a window at a mixing board.

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        Alright, let’s run it back again...

           Ice nods spastically, with drug-addled enthusiasm. He 
           waits for the beat to drop in his headphones. Then --

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        Suckers frontin’/ wantin' me to fade / 
                        Thought I was outta here fools I ain't 
                        goin' away / Back with the track that’ll 
                        keep my bank phat, huh! / Vanilla got the 
                        flavor for the funky format -- Goddamnit!

           Ice tears off his headphones. Earthquake stops the track.

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        You alright? 

           Ice nods, putting his headphones back on, hopping from 
           foot to foot like a boxer before a match. 

                                 ICE
                        Fine man! Come on, let’s go!

           Earthquake stares at him warily, running the track again.

                                 ICE (RAPPING) (CONT’D)
                        Suckers frontin'/ wantin' me to fade --
                                (stopping cold)
                        Can you turn the fucking treble down, 
                        man? You know I hate that tin can sound!

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        Yo, it’s all the way down. Like I said.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah, why can’t I fucking hear myself?!

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        I don’t know what to tell you. 

                                 ICE
                        How am I suppose to rap if I can’t 
                        fucking hear myself? 
                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        Your monitor’s on. Checked your headset.

                                 ICE
                        Stop fucking with me man!

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                                (quietly)
                        I’m not fucking with you.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah you are! You fucking up my sound! 

           Earthquake shakes his head. He’s had it.

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        I’m gonna let you cool out. 

           He stands.

                                 ICE
                        Where you going?!

                                 EARTHQUAKE (ON INTERCOM)
                        I’ll see you tomorrow.

                                 ICE
                        Sit the fuck down! 

           Earthquake heads to the studio door. Ice hurries out of 
           the recording booth...

           INT. HALLWAY

           ...cutting Earthquake off as he exits.

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Move out the way, homie --

                                 ICE
                        I ain’t your homie, I’m your boss. Get 
                        back in the studio. 

                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Yo, you better let me through --

           Ice gets right in Earthquake’s grill.

                                 ICE
                        Or what, motherfucker?

           Earthquake grabs him and slams him against the wall! 
                                 EARTHQUAKE
                        Listen, homie. Chill bounced. Shay’s 
                        dancing for Hammer. And Tommy ain’t even 
                        checking up on us no more. But no matter 
                        what bullshit you try to pull on me, I 
                        ain’t walking. ‘Cause I got a family to 
                        feed now. So we’re gonna make a fuckin’ 
                        album. You understand? 

           Ice nods. No choice. Quake lets go, smoothing out Ice’s 
           shirt for him.

                                 EARTHQUAKE (CONT’D)
                        Like I said...I’ll see you tomorrow. 

           INT. ICE’S HOME STUDIO 

           Ice enters, huffing to the mixing board. Pressing 
           buttons. We hear the track. It’s way too base heavy.  

           CLOSE ON a nob: “TREBLE”. Quake was right: it’s all the 
           way down. Ice cranks on it anyway, breaking it off. 

                                 ICE
                        Goddamn it!

           He tosses the nob, turns off the music, flops down in 
           Earthquake’s chair. High. Alone. Not sure what to do. 

           His eyes fix on a phone on the table. He contemplates. 

           INT. SADIE’S HOUSE

           CLOSE ON a landline ringing. Answering machine picks up.

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        It’s Sadie. Here it comes. Wait for it... 

           BEEP. Ragged breathing. Could be a stalker. Then --

                                 ICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Sadie. It’s Ice. I mean...Robbie.

           INT. ICE’S HOME STUDIO 

           Ice on the phone, sweating, tongue-tied.

                                 ICE
                        I know it’s weird, me calling out of the 
                        blue. But I thought I’d just see how you 
                        were doing. Been a minute.

                        You see Jurassic Park? It’s pretty good. 
                        Kinda long but, um, anyway --

           Someone picks up the phone. 

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        Robbie?

           He goes silent, stunned.

                                 ICE
                                (quietly)
                        You picked up.

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        How have you been?

                                 ICE 
                        Good. You?

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        Great. Really great.

                                 ICE
                        That’s...that’s...good to hear.

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        I’ve heard a lot about you. I mean, it’s 
                        hard not to...I’m happy you called.

                                 ICE
                                (innocently)
                        You are?

                                 SADIE 
                        Of course. 

           He tries to hold himself together.

                                 ICE
                        You know, um, it’d be great to see you... 

                                 SADIE
                        Where are you?

                                 ICE
                        Miami.

                                 SADIE
                        Well I’m in Dallas. 

                                 ICE
                        I can be there in three hours.
           Sadie lets out a light laugh.

                                 SADIE
                        What? Are you serious? 

           INT. SADIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE ON Ice’s finger, pressing the doorbell. He steps 
           back, holding a bouquet of roses, wearing his hallmark 
           American flag suit, now far too big for his skinny frame. 

           He looks like the ghost of his former self, out of time 
           and place, stage ready in the middle of the suburbs. 

           The door opens. It’s Sadie. She’s barely aged, skin 
           glowing, more beautiful than he remembers. He goes weak.

                                 ICE
                        Damn...You look great. 

                                 SADIE
                                (smiling)
                        And you look -- you headed to a concert 
                        or something?

                                 ICE
                                (embarrassed)
                        No...I just thought I’d, you know, break 
                        out the good suit. 

           She glances down at the roses, her smile fading.

                                 SADIE
                        Those for me?

                                 ICE
                        Yeah. Just a little gift...

           He hands them to her. 

                                 SADIE
                        Thanks. Come in.

           INT. SADIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ice steps inside and Sadie closes the door behind him. 

                                 SADIE
                        Let me put these in some water... 

           She veers toward the kitchen as he waits in the foyer, 
           observing the sweet, modest interior. Road not taken.
                                 ICE
                        Nice house. 

                                 SADIE (O.S.)
                        Oh please, I bet you live in a palace. 

                                 ICE
                        Not a palace, exactly, but...

           Sadie returns.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        ...it’s a whole operation. Just a big 
                        headache. I wouldn’t mind a place like 
                        this. Especially if it was just me.

           She stares at him, not sure how to respond.

                                 DARLA (O.S.)
                        Mommy?

           Ice’s eyes snap to DARLA (3), adorable pink dress, 
           braided hair, standing in the doorway to the living room. 

                                 SADIE
                        Hey, baby. 

                                 DARLA
                        Who is he?

                                 SADIE
                        This is Robbie. He’s an old friend. 
                        Robbie, this is Darla. My daughter.

           Ice turns back to Sadie, confused.

                                 SADIE (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie, why don’t you go get your daddy?

           Darla nods and dashes out. Ice tries to play it cool. 

                                 ICE
                        You’re...married?

                                 SADIE
                        No. But it’s basically the same.

                                 ICE
                                (quietly)
                        Damn.
                                 SADIE
                        Sorry I didn’t tell you over the phone. I 
                        thought about it. And I figured it’s 
                        better we all talk in person. 

           Ice shakes his head, confused.

                                 ICE
                        What do you mean?

           Footsteps. Someone enters. Ice turns and freezes. 

           It’s Chill. In old jeans and a t-shirt. Darla clinging to 
           his leg. In his arms, he holds A BABY. Chill nods warmly. 

                                 CHILL
                        Robbie. Good to see you... 

           Ice stares. No words. 

           EXT. SADIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The door flies open. Ice storms out, trudging across the 
           lawn, no idea where he’s headed. Chill hurries after him.

                                 CHILL
                        Ice! Hold up! Come on -- Robbie!

           Ice spins around, facing him.

                                 ICE
                        Soon as you got back you went straight 
                        after my girl?!

                                 CHILL
                        Whoa! It ain’t like that, man.

                                 ICE
                        Then what’s it like?!

                                 CHILL
                        She asked me out. And I even said no at 
                        first. Out of respect. But then I 
                        thought, what was I even protecting? You 
                        were off touring the world. You had moved 
                        on. And I needed to. So did she. 

                                 ICE
                        So y’all moved on together. Bet that felt 
                        real good. Sticking it to me --
                                 CHILL
                        Yo...that’s the last thing we wanted. 
                        That’s why it took so long to tell you. 

                                 ICE
                        Oh is that why? 

                                 CHILL
                        Look. We owe you a lot. And no matter 
                        what went down, we’re grateful.

           Ice stares at Chill. Enraged. Hurt. 

                                 CHILL (CONT’D)
                                (softly)
                        Yo, can we just sit for a minute? I know 
                        Sadie wants to talk to you. Catch up. I 
                        do too. We, uh...we miss you man.

           In Ice’s eyes we catch a glimpse of a deep sadness. He 
           misses them too, more than he can say. 

           INT. SADIE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ice, Sadie and Chill hang in the dining room after 
           dinner, dirty plates still on the table, kids asleep. 
           It’s like old times. Almost.

                                 CHILL
                        I don’t think Arsenio had any right to 
                        put you on blast like that.

                                 ICE
                        I can’t believe you watched.

                                 CHILL
                        The whole country watched. 

                                 ICE
                        I just mean...why bother? If I was y’all, 
                        with a setup like this, kids like those, 
                        shit...I’d want to forget about me as 
                        soon as possible. 

                                 CHILL
                        That ain’t never gonna happen.

                                 ICE
                        Why not?

                                 SADIE
                        ‘Cause you’re our boy. 
           Sadie glances at Chill and he nods in agreement.

                                 CHILL
                        Always gonna be. 

           Ice stares at them in silence, humbled. 

                                 CHILL (CONT’D)
                                (shifting gears)
                        So what’s up now, man? You writing?

                                 ICE
                        We’re on the hook with SBK. Way past due. 
                        But I’m not feeling it. Just blocked up.

                                 SADIE
                        What’d you do last time? Seemed to work 
                        pretty well...

                                 ICE
                        I just wrote about how we were living.

                                 SADIE
                        Why not do that again?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Honestly...I don’t really know if I like 
                        how I’m living anymore.
                                (to Chill)
                        I mean...the label, Charles, Monte...you 
                        were right. About all of it.

                                 CHILL
                                (quietly)
                        Yeah. I know.

                                 ICE
                        And it’s a new game now. The Chronic? 
                        Doggystyle? Regulators? That shit’s mind 
                        blowing.

           Sadie leans toward Ice, meets his eyes.

                                 SADIE
                        You know what I think? It’s easy to get 
                        lost worrying about someone else’s name. 
                        Or someone else’s life. Just get back to 
                        what matters to you. And nobody else.

                                 CHILL
                        You said it yourself. You don’t follow 
                        trends. You set ‘em. 

           Ice takes this in. Synapses firing. 
                                 CHILL (CONT’D)
                        So some new rappers blew your mind. Now 
                        you blow theirs. 

                                 ICE
                                (quietly)
                        Yeah...that’s got a ring to it...

           The intro of an intense Gangster rap track takes us to...

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           ...A MUSIC VIDEO MONTAGE of

           -- The grill of a Cadillac, bouncing on hydraulics. 

           -- IMPOSING SHADOWS, shrouded in smoke.

           -- A DOZEN BLACK EXTRAS huddled around a trash can fire.

           The images are bleak, grimy, hard as hell. A window into 
           urban blight, life on the streets. 

                                 GANGSTERS (SINGING)
                        Roll ‘em up! Roll up the Hooty Mac! Roll 
                        ‘em up! 

           -- We focus on a SILHOUETTED MAN, dreadlocks, goatee, in 
           a Phoenix Suns jersey. He steps out of the shadows. 
           It’s...Ice. Almost unrecognizable. A title card fades up:

           Vanilla Ice
           “Roll ‘Em Up”
           Mind Blowin’
           SBK Records

           He lifts a 40 oz in a paper bag, waving it around.

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        I need some herbs and spices / So I can 
                        feel as nice as / The breeze, coolin’ 
                        like a summer tree / Cause it's the I-C-E 

           INT. ICE’S FLORIDA ESTATE - DAY

           The music video continues on Ice’s TV as we pull back 
           into his smoke-filled living room...

                                     MIAMI, FLORIDA
                                       MARCH, 1994
           ...where Ice, same new look, shoots craps with the random 
           extras we just saw. He shakes a pair of dice in his hand. 

                                 RANDOM EXTRA
                        Shake ‘em up, shake ‘em up, shake ‘em!

           Ice tosses the dice, hitting a seven. Everyone hollers.

                                 ICE
                        That’s right motherfuckers! I got the hot 
                        hand! Y’all want to double down? 

           Ice takes a huge rip off a blunt, dapping up his new 
           crew. The sound of COUGHING behind him. Everyone turns, 
           glancing at...Tommy in the doorway.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Yo! Tommy! What you doing here? 

           Tommy tries to catch his breath, the smoke unbearable.

                                 TOMMY 
                        We had a meeting.

                                 ICE
                        Oh fuck, seriously? 

           Tommy nods. Ice hands his cash to an extra.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Yo, hold this. And I know exactly how 
                        much that is, so don’t try nothin’...

           INT. ICE’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Tommy sits in a breakfast nook, sipping a glass of water. 
           Eyes glazed. Contact high. Ice lounges across from him.  

                                 TOMMY
                        How do you deal with all that smoke?

                                 ICE
                        It’s just my lifestyle, man. 

                                 TOMMY
                                (dryly)
                        Uh huh. 

                                 ICE
                        You’ll see, soon as we hit the road! 

           Tommy doesn’t respond.
                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting cagey in this motherfucker. 
                        And I got some dope ideas for the tour -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        That’s actually what I wanted to talk to 
                        you about...

                                 ICE
                        Nothing too fancy. I’m keeping it street-
                        level. But I do want to be held up like 
                        Simba in The Lion King --

                                 TOMMY
                        ...There’s not going to be a tour.

           Ice grins and leans back like Tommy’s messing with him.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not joking. We can’t book you. 

                                 ICE
                        Of course you can. It’s the I-C-E -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        We tried. Believe me. Started with some 
                        of your old venues. The Forum. MSG. But 
                        the projections weren’t good so we scaled 
                        down. It didn’t matter. No one’s biting. 

                                 ICE
                                (bewildered)
                        What do you mean, no one? 

                                 TOMMY
                        I mean we couldn’t book you at Knott's 
                        Berry Farm.

                                 ICE
                        My shit’s been on MTV all week!

                                 TOMMY
                        They have a package deal with SBK. No 
                        one’s actually requesting it.

                                 ICE
                        So what are you saying?

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m saying Mind Blowin’s...blown. We’ve 
                        got to put it to bed.
                                 ICE
                        I’m making the dopest shit in my whole 
                        career. We’re just getting started! 

                                 TOMMY
                        I know it’s hard to hear. But the label 
                        can’t push it anymore then they have. 

                                 ICE
                        Then why are they even repping me?

                                 TOMMY
                        Well that’s another thing. 

           Ice’s eyes widen, panic growing.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        It was a three album contract. This was 
                        the third.

                                 ICE
                        It’s my second album!

                                 TOMMY
                        Extremely Live was your second album. 

                                 ICE
                        So what, they’re straight dropping us?

           Tommy nods. Ice fidgets, agitated, shaking his head. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Man, I hated those motherfuckers anyway. 
                        I knew from day one they were only 
                        looking out for themselves. Let’s call 
                        Jimmy at Interscope, Lyor at Def Jam!

                                 TOMMY
                        Already did. 

                                 ICE
                        And? 

           Tommy shakes his head, “No.” 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, fuck it, call Suge at Death Row!

                                 TOMMY
                        His slate’s full. He had a message 
                        though. He said: “Thanks for the label.”

                                 ICE
                        So what are we gonna do?
                                 TOMMY
                        Well, I’d advise you take a good look at 
                        your expenses and try to cut them down. 
                        Especially, you know...the drugs. 

                                 ICE
                        What the fuck are you talking about, 
                        Tommy? Why you saying this shit!?

                                 TOMMY
                                (pained)
                        Look, for a moment, it was in the cards 
                        for us. But that moment...is...gone. 
                        Which is why I need to step away for a 
                        while. Tend to some other interests. 

                                 ICE
                        Are you serious right now? After all the 
                        shit we’ve been through? You’re ending 
                        it? Just like that?

                                 TOMMY
                        I think it’s healthy we try to 
                        reprioritize. Rather than delude 
                        ourselves any further.

                                 ICE
                        Muthafucka you the one that’s deluded!

                                 TOMMY
                        Excuse me?!

                                 ICE
                        You don’t know shit! You had one idea!  
                        Make me rap Elvis! That ain’t me! I was 
                        real, and you let those SBK fuckheads 
                        take away my street cred!

                                 TOMMY
                        You could have gotten off the ride 
                        whenever you wanted. But you were having 
                        too much fun.

           Ice stops. Pissed. He takes a beat. 

                                 ICE
                        Then say it. ‘Cause I’m not going to.

           Tommy stares at Ice, silent. Ice nods smugly. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t, can you?
                                 TOMMY
                                (quietly)
                        I named you. I wrote your life story. 
                        Literally. When I look at you, I still 
                        see infinite potential. But the world 
                        doesn’t anymore. So I’ll say it. Even 
                        though it hurts me. As much as it does 
                        you. I need to move on. I’m sorry. 

           Ice looks like he’s been punched in the gut.

           EXT. ICE’S MIAMI ESTATE - DAY

           Tommy hurries out. Ice follows, calling after him.

                                 ICE
                        Come on man! Don’t do this!

           Tommy doesn’t turn back, making his way to his minivan. 
           Ice stares at him, eyes full of anguish. Lost.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Tommy!

           INT./EXT. TOMMY’S MINIVAN

           Tommy drives, glancing in his rearview at Ice on his 
           lawn. Then he tilts his mirror up so he’s out of view. 

           INT./EXT. ICE’S DALLAS ESTATE - DAY

           FLASH CUTS OF 

           -- A line of coke as the tip of a dollar vacuums it up. 

           -- Three ecstasy pills popped into a mouth.

           -- A syringe spurting. The plunger dropping.

           -- A pupil dilating. 

           Ice lies back on a rattan recliner in the sun, higher 
           than he’s ever been. RANDOM PEOPLE passing by.

           WE WIDEN OUT to reveal that he’s shirtless, in swim 
           trunks on an upscale balcony overlooking a lake. His 
           dreads are gone. Hair buzzcut like he’s in bootcamp.

           Half-naked PARTIERS, all white frat types, surround him. 

                                      DALLAS, TEXAS
                                     JULY 4TH, 1994

           A shadow falls over Ice. He glances up, squinting. The 
           silhouette of a blonde woman, backlit by the sun.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, Ice. 

                                 ICE
                        Oh...Hey...

           She takes a seat next to him.

                                 LAURA
                        Remember me?

           Ice stares at her, clueless.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Laura. 

                                 ICE
                        Yeah...Laura...

                                 LAURA
                        We met in LA.

                                 ICE
                        ...Right...

                                 LAURA
                        At the Forum? You pulled me on stage.

           A flash of recognition. Ice remembering.

                                 ICE
                        Right! Then the crowd went nuts?

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah! That was wild! 

                                 ICE
                        Crazy night... 

                                 LAURA
                                (embarrassed)
                        No kidding.

                                 ICE
                        I tried getting back to my hotel room the 
                        next day. But it got fucking mobbed. 
                                 LAURA
                        Management had to sneak us out. Past, 
                        like, a thousand fans. 

                                 ICE
                        You know, I looked for your number, but --

                                 LAURA
                        I left it! Housekeeping must have thrown 
                        it out. They had a lot to clean up.

                                 ICE
                        I was hoping to see you again. 

                                 LAURA
                        Well...here I am.

           She smiles at him. He grins back.

                                 ICE
                        Yeah...funny...

           A sunburned PARTY BRO in a starter cap runs up to Ice, 
           holding up a giant bag of coke.

                                 PARTY BRO
                        Yo, Ice! Check it!! 

                                 ICE
                        Just in time. Need a little pick me up.
                                (to Laura)
                        Want to join?

           Laura stares at him for a beat, then lifts a pendant from 
           a chain around her neck. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 LAURA
                        My one year.  

           He leans in, getting a closer look. It’s an AA medallion. 
           The inscription reads: “To thine own self be true.”

                                 PARTY BRO
                        Come on, bro! Let’s hit this!

           Ice nods, standing, following the party bro inside. Laura 
           watches him go, worried. 
           EXT. ICE’S DALLAS ESTATE - LATER

           Ice holds a mic, wobbling on his feet next to a FAT WHITE 
           DJ (20’s). Partiers surround them.

                                 ICE
                        Y’all motherfuckers having a good time?!

           Drunken screams and cheers.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Just wanted to say, I haven’t felt this 
                        much love in a while. Thank y’all for...

           Ice stares at the sea of white faces. Total strangers. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        ...for coming out...

           The mic falls on the table, feedback whining as Ice 
           shuffles off. The DJ picks it up.  

                                 DJ
                        Alright, let’s keep this bitch going!

           INT. ICE’S HALLWAY

           Ice stumbles down a dark hall, way too high, his world 
           spinning. He stops at his open bedroom door...

           INT. ICE’S BEDROOM 

           ...peering at a HALF-DOZEN PARTIERS inside. They all go 
           quiet, staring at him. He looks worse than before. His 
           face ashen, in a cold sweat. 

                                 ICE
                        How’d you get in here?

                                 BEDROOM BRO
                        Door was unlocked... 

                                 ICE
                        Well none of y’all should be here...

           Ice sees something, lurching toward a shelf full of 
           memorabilia and awards, looking at an empty spot.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Yo, where’s my record?

           No one responds. 
                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        My Spoonie Gee record was right here.

           Silence. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. Who the fuck took it?

                                 BEDROOM BRO
                        Hey, man. Chill out -- 

                                 ICE
                        Where the fuck is it?!

                                 BEDROOM BRO
                        Nobody took anything, bro!

                                 ICE
                        It’s not yours, motherfucker! 

           Ice pushes the bro hard into a wall. The partiers GASP.

                                 BEDROOM BRO
                        You’re fucking crazy, man!

           Ice sways, face contorted with rage, speech slurring.

                                 ICE
                        Give it the fuck back right now!! You 
                        hear me? It’s mine! Give it ba...b... 

           His knees buckle, eyes rolling as he collapses.

           INT./EXT. BACK OF AN AMBULANCE - DAY 

           Two PARAMEDICS push Ice into an ambulance on a stretcher. 
           Unconscious. Oxygen mask. Heart monitor flatlining.

           One of them charges a defibrillator as the other slams 
           the doors. A siren wails and the ambulance tears off, 
           leaving a mass of rattled partiers on the curb. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Ice’s eyes as they flutter and open. Something 
           in his hands. He glances down at a cardboard sleeve. 
           Clean yellow label. It’s “Spoonin Rap.” 

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                                (quietly)
                        It was on your record player. 
           Ice looks up at Laura, sitting next to his bed. He tries 
           to speak. Can’t at first. Then, in a whisper --

                                 ICE
                        How long was I...

                                 LAURA
                        About eight hours.

                                 ICE
                        Damn. 
                                (beat)
                        What, um...what are you doing here?

                                 LAURA
                        Just making sure you woke up.

                                 ICE
                        Why?

           Saddened by the question, she motions to the empty room.

                                 LAURA
                        ‘Cause no one else did?

                                 ICE
                        Well I’m awake. You can leave if you want 
                        to. 

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah. I can, can’t I?

           She doesn’t move. They stare at each other silently for a 
           long moment. The faint sound of strings fades up, playing 
           “Canon in D Major”...

           EXT. FAIRCHILD BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY

           ...taking us to a wedding in progress. About a HUNDRED 
           GUESTS are gathered around a quaint gazebo.  

                                     MIAMI, FLORIDA
                                       JUNE, 1997

           In the audience, too many familiar faces to count. Chill, 
           Sadie, Shay, Earthquake, John Bush, Big-E (with a 
           cane)...and Tommy, all worn a bit with age but happy. 

           They watch as Laura walks down the aisle, radiant in her 
           dress, sized to fit a baby bump. She approaches...
           ...Ice standing at the alter with Beth, Kip, Bryon. He’s 
           looking good: filled out, clean shaven, clean, period. He 
           gazes at her like he doesn’t deserve what he has. 

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Everyone dances, laughing, joking around. Ice and Laura 
           in the middle of it. The song comes to an end. A pause, 
           then...ICE ICE BABY drops. The crowd screams. 

           Ice shakes his head at Earthquake sitting in the DJ 
           booth, 20 pounds heavier, who shrugs innocently.

           John Bush appears, hair gray, handing Ice a mic, echoing 
           the first time they all came together a decade ago. 

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Rock the mic, Vanilla Ice...

           Ice raises the mic to his mouth as the verse hits. 

                                 ICE (RAPPING)
                        Alright, stop!

           Everyone cheers. The song continues but he doesn’t. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        No seriously, stop. It’s 1997, y’all! 
                        Time to move on!

           Laughter all around. Ice hands the mic back to John Bush.

                                 JOHN BUSH
                        Can’t say I blame you...

                                 SHAY
                        I was ready to bust it! Bad back and all!

                                 CHILL
                        Motherfucker, you’re only 32!

           Laura sees something across the hall then points it out 
           to Ice. It’s Tommy, exiting the party quietly.

                                 ICE 
                        Be right back. 

           EXT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Tommy stands on the patio alone, lighting a cigarette.
                                 ICE (O.S.)
                        How do you deal with all that smoke?

           Tommy turns, facing Ice as he steps outside.

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s just my lifestyle, man. 

           Ice laughs. Tommy offers him one. He waves “No thanks.”

                                 ICE
                        When’d you start?

                                 TOMMY
                        Couple years ago. Reminded me of touring. 
                        Smokey theaters. The way it got into your 
                        hair. All your clothes...

           Ice thinks about it, remembering.

                                 ICE
                        Maybe I will take one.

           Tommy nods, handing him the pack. Ice lights up.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell Laura, though. She thinks 
                        everything’s gonna mess up the baby.

                                 TOMMY
                        Sounds like a good mom. 

                                 ICE
                        Damn straight. 

           Ice takes a drag, looking at his cigarette.

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn, that’s good. I’d be lying if I 
                        said I didn’t miss it. 

           Tommy stares off into the darkness.

                                 TOMMY
                        Yeah. Me too. 

           Ice eyes Tommy, in a far off place. He knows that look.

                                 ICE
                        Man...I reminisce a lot. Especially since 
                        we started planning the wedding. And I 
                        don’t know about any of it now. All I 
                        know is it felt good. You thinking I had 
                        something. That I could be something. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ICE (CONT'D)
                        I believed that too. But the more I think 
                        about it, it’s only ‘cause you did. And I 
                        didn’t want to let you down.

           Tommy nods, taking this in, then meets Ice’s eyes.

                                 TOMMY
                        You know, when I met you, I was running a 
                        nightclub in the lowest income 
                        neighborhood in the city. I had a label 
                        with no stars. No real potential. And I 
                        was flat broke. Just...winging it. 

                                 ICE
                        Wait...What?

                                 TOMMY
                        City Lights never turned a profit. 
                        Overhead was so high. Security alone.

                                 ICE
                        Damn. I had no idea. 

                                 TOMMY
                        How could you have? You were a car 
                        salesman. An assistant car salesman.

           Ice nods. Good point.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I guess I’m saying, I never thought we’d 
                        go as far as we did. I wished for it. But 
                        if I’m being honest, really honest?...I 
                        can’t believe we pulled any of it off.

           Ice smiles. Agreeing. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, it may not have lasted very long, 
                        and maybe that’s on me. But at the end of 
                        the day...it happened. 

           They both take a drag, thinking about it, grateful.  

           INT. ICE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON an adorable, grumbling baby, KEELEE BREEZE (3 
           months). Ice holds her gently, calming her down.

                                      DALLAS, TEXAS
                                       APRIL, 2000
                             VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC INTERVIEW
           Laura sits next to him, holding their other daughter, 
           DUSTI RAIN (2). They’re a picturesque family, almost too 
           picturesque, as though someone posed them this way...

           Across from them sits an INTERVIEWER (30’s) next to a 
           CAMERA CREW (40’s). Lights. Grip stands. The whole nine.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Laura, how’s Ice as a dad?

                                 LAURA
                        Amazing. He loves our girls. We want to 
                        have kids running all around the house. 

                                 INTERVIEWER 
                                (to Ice)
                        And what’s your take on fatherhood?

                                 ICE
                        You know, I’m going to give my daughters 
                        everything that I never had growing up. 
                        And I’m not going to expose them to all 
                        the crap that I was exposed to. ‘Cause 
                        that can ruin somebody. I’m going to let 
                        them learn from all my experiences and 
                        lead them in the right direction.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        What direction is that? 

                                 ICE
                        Life isn’t about material things. It’s 
                        about your click at home, this little 
                        itty-bitty crowd of people you hang out 
                        with every day. That’s what life’s about. 
                        All the rest of this...
                                (motioning to the camera crew)
                        ...is entertainment.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Do you ever miss the old days?

                                 ICE
                        I’m so on the other side of those days. 
                        I’m way beyond it. Way beyond it...

           He stares off, distant, just like Tommy at the wedding.

           FLASH CUTS OF

           -- Ice on stage, dancing, sweat pouring down his face...

           -- An audience of thousands screaming into the ether...
           -- a light array firing, illuminating him standing 
           defiantly in a star-spangled red and blue suit... 

           AND WE’RE BACK

           To Ice, almost in tears now, remembering those insane, 
           unimaginable highs that he’ll never experience again. 

                                 ICE (CONT’D)
                                (anguished)
                        ...I’m much happier today.

           INT. ICE’S ATTIC - DAY 

           Ice sits on the floor, sorting through a pile of old 
           trinkets, tossing them into various boxes. 

           His daughter Dusti helps out, picking up a cracked snow 
           globe and handing it to him.

                                 DUSTI 
                        What’s that, daddy?

                                 ICE
                        It’s all just junk, baby. That’s why 
                        we’re putting it away.

           Dusti continues rummaging, finding something else of 
           interest. An old CD case. She hands it to him. 

           Ice stops cold, starring down at TO THE EXTREME. His face 
           on the faded cover. Smug. Indomitable. 

                                 DUSTI
                        Daddy...is that you?

           He looks at her, not sure what to say. Makes up his mind. 

                                 ICE
                        Nah.

           Dusti nods and goes back to rummaging. Ice tosses the CD 
           into a box as though it were nothing at all.

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                        THE END.
