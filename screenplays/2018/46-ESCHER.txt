           BACH MUSIC from an old record player.

           SUPERS APPEAR OVER BLACK - ONE LINE AT A TIME: 

           This film is an illusion.

                    Some of it is real.

                        Some of it is surreal.

                              Escher would’ve liked it that way.

           The four lines of text begin to SPIN until we...

                        You know the magical thing about a 
                        circle? It ends where it starts. Or 
                        does it start where it ends?

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           M.C. ESCHER (46, a gentle introverted genius with a world of 
           activity distracting his mind at any moment) sits on a 
           WORKBENCH in an area that resembles a carpenter’s studio. An 
           old RECORD PLAYER sings behind him, surrounded by overflowing 
           bookshelves, and various ART, SCULPTURES, and TRINKETS.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Well now, shall we do another?

           His son JAN (5) nods excitedly as Escher secures a carved 
           BLOCK OF WOOD in a clamp. Watching Escher work is pure magic 
           for the curious boy.

           Escher rolls black ink onto the block with a CRACKLING SOUND.

                                 ESCHER
                        Remember, Jan, art is nothing but 
                        an illusion. What does this black 
                        ink look like?

           He dabs a bit of ink on his finger and holds it up.
                                 JAN
                        Nothing.

                                 ESCHER
                        And this white paper?

           He lifts a sheet of paper.

                                 JAN
                        Nothing. 

           Escher carefully lowers the paper over the ink-covered wood 
           until it sits perfectly on top. Then he rubs a small IVORY 
           SPOON over the paper in small circular motions.

                                 ESCHER
                        But put them together in just the 
                        right way and I can fool you into 
                        seeing something more than black 
                        ink and white paper.

           Escher slowly peels the paper away from the wooden block 
           revealing his famous work Day and Night (1938): 

           On the left is a daytime view of a small city, and on the 
           right is the mirror image of the same city at night. The 
           night sky transforms into a flock of black birds as it 
           extends to the left, and the day sky becomes a flock of white 
           birds as it flows to the right, with the black and white 
           birds fitting together in the middle like a jigsaw puzzle.  

           Jan marvels at the print.

                                 ESCHER
                        I have to make five more of these. 
                        Would you like to help?

           We move toward the drawing, closing in on one of the black 
           birds, until...

           EXT. CLEAR BLUE SKY - DAY

           ...the ink drawing becomes a REAL BIRD flying in a real sky.  

           EXT. JEWISH CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           The BIRD lands on a gravestone with a Jewish star on it. But 
           REVEAL below the star: a red SWASTIKA painted on the stone.

           The bird takes flight as Escher walks by carrying a bag of 
           GROCERIES and wearing a leather messenger bag.
           He’s in the Jewish Quarter of Haarlem and it feels like a 
           ghost town. Businesses are boarded up. Empty streets. 
           Swastikas grow like weeds in places they don’t belong.

           EXT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Escher arrives at the back door of a quaint suburban house 
           and KNOCKS lightly.

           SAMUEL JESSURUN DE MESQUITA (70s, wise and warm) opens the 
           door and greets Escher with a big hug.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Ah hello! Come in, come in.

           A yellow fabric JEWISH STAR is sewn on De Mesquita’s clothes.  

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           De Mesquita’s wife ELISABETH (60s) unpacks wheat, potatoes, 
           and other supplies from Escher’s bag.

           JAAP (40s, De Mesquita’s son) plays a card game with his 
           daughter REBECCA (9, alert eyes, emotionally mature beyond 
           her years).

           They’re all remarkably thin. Their clothes loose.

           De Mesquita holds up a copy of Day and Night.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Beautiful. One of my favorites.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m bringing them to Klaus, I made 
                        an extra for you.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Thank you.

                                 ESCHER
                             (to Rebecca)
                        And Jan made this for you.

           Escher presents Rebecca with a CHILD’S DRAWING of two 
           children with a SMALL BROWN ANIMAL. Her eyes light up.

                                 REBECCA
                        Is that a dog?

                                 ESCHER
                        A porcupine.
                                 REBECCA
                        I love it!

           Escher puts an APPLE on the table in front of her.

                                 ESCHER
                        Jan also made me promise to give 
                        you that. He picked it out special 
                        for you. The last firm one.   

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s perfect. Please thank him.

           She pushes away from the table and clambers on top of the 
           kitchen counter to reach the high cabinets.

                                 JAAP
                        Rebecca don’t stand on the counter!

                                 ELISABETH
                        What are you looking for dear?

                                 REBECCA
                        Do we have any cinnamon? And 
                        almonds? I want to make charoset.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Oh honey, just eat it fresh. 

                                 REBECCA
                        But it’s grandpa’s favorite.

                                 ELISABETH
                        You sweet girl.

           Escher and De Mesquita exchange touched looks as they realize 
           that Rebecca’s first thought was to share the apple. 

           Escher lifts Rebecca down from the counter, then crouches to 
           her level.

                                 ESCHER
                        Jan gave me explicit instructions 
                        that this apple is just for you. To 
                        enjoy all yourself. Okay?

           Rebecca thinks. Then grins like a shrewd negotiator.

                                 REBECCA
                        I’ll enjoy it more if I share it.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Rebecca --
                                 REBECCA
                        One slice. For each of you. And 
                        then I’ll have the rest. That’s my 
                        final offer.

           She doesn’t even wait for a response before going to the 
           drawer for a knife to slice the apple.  

           Escher grins at the other adults.

                                 ESCHER
                        I guess it’s settled then.

           As De Mesquita and Jaap watch Rebecca slice the apple, 
           Elisabeth grabs Escher’s arm. Momentarily acknowledging the 
           gravity of their situation, she whispers:

                                 ELISABETH
                        Thank you.

                                 ESCHER
                        Of course.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Curtained windows leave the room relatively dark with thin 
           beams of sunlight bleeding through the cracks.   

                                 ESCHER
                        How are you getting on?

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You’re here, which makes today a 
                        good day.

           De Mesquita shuffles over to a liquor cabinet, retrieves a 
           bottle of brandy, pours two glasses, and hands one to Escher.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You have something else to show me?

           Escher pulls a drawing from his bag and lays it on the table.

                                 ESCHER
                        I had this idea playing around my 
                        head and I -- 

           He stops as De Mesquita focuses on the drawing: 

           It’s an interlocking pattern created by a series of BLACK MEN 
           and WHITE MEN that fit together perfectly, like a mosaic tile 
           floor. The black figures are hunched over and grumpy looking 
           while the white figures look a bit more upbeat.
                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Would you look at these ugly little 
                        fellows... 

                                 ESCHER
                        One is an optimist and one a 
                        pessimist. And because one always 
                        serves as the background for the 
                        other, they can’t exist at the same 
                        time. They remain oblivious to each 
                        other’s existence. 

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Ah. I am most certainly the 
                        optimist, which would make you...

                                 ESCHER
                             (chuckles)
                        I can’t argue that.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        So?

                                 ESCHER
                        I feel it’s missing something.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Beauty, for one?

                                 ESCHER
                        That too. But it’s not exploring 
                        anything new. It was a fun puzzle 
                        to work out, but -- I feel these 
                        little men have more to say.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Let’s hope the optimist has more to 
                        say than the pessimist.

           EXT. ART GALLERY - DAY

           Escher arrives wearing his messenger bag and notices a copy 
           of Day and Night behind a glass display window.

           INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

           Works of art line the well-lit, perfectly white walls.  

           KLAUS (30s), a confident, precise man with small circular 
           glasses, sits at a table flipping through several copies of 
           Day and Night as Escher fills out paperwork. 
                                 KLAUS
                        These are by far your best sellers.

                                 ESCHER
                        What exactly is this for?

           Klaus eyes the paperwork.

                                 KLAUS
                        You have to register with the Nazi 
                        Chamber of Culture to continue 
                        selling artwork under Occupation.

                                 ESCHER
                        Why do they care?

                                 KLAUS
                        All I know is they have expensive 
                        taste. I’m raising all the prices.

                                 ESCHER
                        Do you have a sharper pencil?

                                 KLAUS
                        What’s wrong with that one?

                                 ESCHER
                        Its lines are sloppy and -- never 
                        mind it’s fine.

                                 KLAUS
                        You’re worried a Nazi administrator 
                        will find your writing too ugly?  

           Klaus laughs. Escher smiles just enough to humor him.

                                 KLAUS
                        When will you have something new 
                        for me?

                                 ESCHER
                        I’ve been playing with some ideas, 
                        but you’re not going to like them.

           Klaus shakes his head. This is a topic they’ve been over.

                                 KLAUS
                        Ideas. Art is not ideas. Art is 
                        art.

                                 ESCHER
                        Then I guess I’m no artist.
                                 KLAUS
                        Well lucky for you a few of your 
                        ideas have been beautiful enough to 
                        pass as art.

           Klaus takes a pile of cash from a strongbox, counts out a 
           portion, and hands it to Escher.

                                 ESCHER
                        Lucky for you as well.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Escher arrives home to find Jan playing with BLOCKS on the 
           floor, and his other sons GEORGE (17) and ARTHUR (15) doing 
           homework at the dining table.     

           JETTA (40s, short black hair, composed, more savvy than she 
           lets on) cuts vegetables in the kitchen. 

                                 JETTA
                        How’d things go at the gallery?

                                 ESCHER
                        Good.

           He kisses his sons, who keep at their homework.

                                 JETTA
                        And De Mesquita?  How’s he?

                                 ESCHER
                        I don’t know how he stays so 
                        positive.

                                 JETTA
                        I’m sure it helps to have food 
                        delivered.

           Escher sighs as he watches Jetta drop some cut vegetables 
           into a pot of stew.

                                 ESCHER
                        They can’t go outside. They have 
                        nobody.

                                 JETTA
                        I know.

                                 ESCHER
                        What should I do, let them starve?
                                 JETTA
                        I know.

           She CHOPS a small, withered carrot with the knife.

                                 JETTA
                        We’re low. You’ll need to do 
                        another run.

                                 ESCHER
                        Jetta --

                                 JETTA
                        I’m just saying meals will be light 
                        until you go.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’ll leave tomorrow. After the 
                        lecture.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - NIGHT 

           Jetta enters to find Escher focused, nervously poring over a 
           stack of NOTECARDS, mumbling to himself. Eventually, he 
           notices her... 

                                 ESCHER
                        I hate talking to mathematicians. 
                        They’re so disappointed when they 
                        realize I know nothing about math.  

                                 JETTA
                        Mathematicians study for years. You 
                        just pluck it from that brain of 
                        yours.

           Her comment fails to console him. He anxiously scribbles a 
           note on one of the cards. 

                                 JETTA
                        Why don’t you practice on me?

           Escher gathers his notecards as she sits on the couch.

                                 ESCHER
                             (reading from a card)
                        Today I will show you how my art 
                        applies three principles of regular 
                        plane filling.

           He looks up and catches her smiling adoringly at him. He 
           smiles back. Relaxes a bit.
           EXT. LEIDEN UNIVERSITY COURTYARD - DAY

           A University Courtyard where STUDENTS and FACULTY walk among 
           400 year old stone buildings. The SPUTTER OF A MOTOR as an 
           ARMY TRUCK drives by with a large SWASTIKA on the side.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Ten to fifteen ACADEMICS fill the first few rows of old 
           wooden seats in a mostly empty lecture hall.

           Escher scans the room, breathing heavy, as BEREND (59) smiles 
           at his nervousness.  

                                 BEREND
                        You’ll do fine. 

           Berend walks to a LECTERN at the front of the room.  
           Conversations die down as he begins.

                                 BEREND
                        Crystallography holds a secret 
                        beauty that is hard for us to share 
                        with the rest of the world. That’s 
                        why it’s exciting to see principles 
                        of our research so beautifully 
                        illustrated in the art of our guest 
                        speaker, my little brother, Mauritz 
                        Cornelis Escher. 

           APPLAUSE as Escher timidly approaches the lectern. The lights 
           dim and a projector whirs to life, casting LIGHT at a SCREEN.  

           ON THE SCREEN: “Regular Division of the Plane with Asymmetric 
           Congruent Polygons - Lecture by M.C. Escher.”

                                 ESCHER
                        Thank you. My brother claims that 
                        my art brings your math to life. 
                        And yet I hardly consider myself an 
                        artist, and I certainly don’t 
                        consider myself a mathematician.

           The RECEPTIVE LAUGHTER helps Escher relax a bit. 

                                 ESCHER
                             (reading from cards)
                        Today I will show you how my art 
                        applies three principles of regular 
                        plane filling: translation, axes, 
                        and glide reflection.
           A CLICK as the projector moves to a new slide. The audience 
           reacts with interest, but we don’t get to see it yet. 

                                 ESCHER
                        But first, I must admit that unlike 
                        the scholars in this room, I feel 
                        rather unscientific in my approach.  
                        I compose these jigsaw puzzles more 
                        or less subconsciously.

           We tumble toward Escher, falling into the PUPIL OF HIS EYE, 
           filling our view with...

           BLACKNESS

                                 ESCHER (V.O.)
                        It’s a game that nags at my mind.

           The word “Metamorphose” appears in the black, then slides to 
           the left, followed by a CRISSCROSS pattern of words, that 
           morphs into the black and white squares of a CHECKERBOARD, 
           which then morphs into a jigsaw of INTERCONNECTED LIZARDS as 
           the images continue to stream from right to left.

                                 ESCHER (V.O.)
                        For me the line between two 
                        interlocking figures holds special 
                        meaning with its double function.

           Lizards become PENTAGONS which become a three dimensional 
           BEEHIVE from which BEES TAKE FLIGHT, only to become the black 
           background for a white school of FISH.

                                 ESCHER (V.O.)
                        On either side of each line, a 
                        figure takes shape simultaneously. 
                        But which is real? And which the 
                        illusion?

           Fish become BIRDS. Then BOATS. HORSES. TRIANGLES that become 
           a series of CUBES that turn into the buildings of a SMALL 
           TOWN, throwing us from two dimensions into three.

                                 ESCHER (V.O.)
                        As the mind can’t hold two things 
                        at the same moment, there must be a 
                        quick and continuous jumping from 
                        one side to the other.

           The town ends at a COASTLINE, with a STONE TOWER standing in 
           the water off-shore. But the tower is now a CASTLE PIECE on a 
           chessboard, soon joined by pawns, a bishop, a knight.
                                 ESCHER (V.O.)
                        While drawing I feel controlled by 
                        the creatures I conjure up, as if 
                        they themselves tell me the shape 
                        in which they’d like to appear.

           The CHESSBOARD morphs back into a CRISSCROSS pattern of 
           words. And we end where we started, with the word 
           “Metamorphose” in the center of BLACK.  

           We pull away, re-emerging from the black PUPIL of Escher’s 
           eye. And we’re... 

           BACK IN THE LECTURE HALL

           On the screen is Escher’s work Metamorphosis II (1939-40): a 
           long series of repeating patterns exactly like we just saw.

                                 ESCHER
                             (off the cuff)
                        I’m always fascinated with playing 
                        tricks on the eye and the mind. But 
                        convincing myself that my art tells 
                        me what to draw? I suppose that’s 
                        quite a trick I play on myself.

           The Academics laugh and marvel at this quirky, passionate, 
           creative soul speaking before them. 

           EXT. LEIDEN UNIVERSITY - COURTYARD - DAY

           Escher half-listens as Berend and MARKUS (40s, intellectual) 
           smoke cigarettes and chat. He seems distracted by the STONE 
           PILLARS, heavily dirtied with age, but he’s JOLTED back to 
           the conversation...

                                 MARKUS
                        Mr. Escher, I’m curious what you 
                        think about Coxeter’s work on 
                        hyperbolic tessellations.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry but I’m relatively 
                        useless when it comes to 
                        mathematical conversation. I just 
                        seem to latch on to the theories 
                        without realizing what’s happening.

                                 MARKUS
                        I just want to know if you’ve ever 
                        tried a non-Euclidean approach to 
                        hyperbolic tessellations.     
                                 BEREND
                             (rescuing his brother)
                        Come on, don’t bombard him. 

           Markus is about to respond, but holds his tongue as two NAZI 
           SOLDIERS walk past holding boxes of books. A moment of somber 
           silence, then:

                                 ESCHER
                        Who knew Nazis were such avid 
                        readers?

           The others laugh, though it’s unclear whether Escher meant it 
           as a joke. 

                                 MARKUS
                        Troubling times. But it’ll blow 
                        over. It has to.  

                                 BEREND
                        Three years is a long time to wait.

                                 MARKUS
                             (to Escher)
                        What do you think? Will things get 
                        worse before they get better?

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m afraid I’m just as useless 
                        discussing politics as I am 
                        mathematics.

           INT. BEREND’S OFFICE - DAY

           Berend sits at his desk in a tiny academic office, sifting 
           through a paper bag filled with food supplies.

                                 ESCHER
                        The apples are past their best.

                                 BEREND
                        It went over well. Your lecture. My 
                        colleagues loved it. 

           Berend takes out a squishy apple.

                                 BEREND
                        Oh that is just shy of rotting, 
                        isn’t it? Perhaps a pie.
                                 ESCHER
                        I leave for the country tonight. 
                        I’ll bring back fresh ones. While 
                        I’m gone, if Jetta needs anything -- 

                                 BEREND
                        Of course. 
                             (after a moment)
                        Do you enjoy it? The long drive by 
                        yourself?

                                 ESCHER
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 BEREND
                        And the Germans don’t give you 
                        trouble at the checkpoints? 

                                 ESCHER
                             (wary)
                        I give them no reason to. 

                                 BEREND
                        I know we’ve been over this, but 
                        supplies are getting much more --

           Escher gets up to leave, cutting Berend off.

                                 ESCHER
                        I agree. We’ve been over this.

                                 BEREND
                        Have you not noticed we’ve lost our 
                        country? And here you can be an 
                        enormous help to the Resistance if 
                        you would simply make introductions 
                        to your farmer friends, but --

                                 ESCHER
                        They wouldn’t want any part in it. 
                        And I would never put them at risk. 

                                 BEREND
                        They’re already part of it. So are 
                        you. I don’t understand how you can 
                        stand aside and let others fight on 
                        your behalf.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry, I’ll still help with 
                        money...

           Escher hands an envelope to Berend.
                                 ESCHER
                        ...but beyond that I’d prefer to 
                        stay uninvolved.

                                 BEREND
                             (disappointed)
                        We all do what we can.

           EXT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Escher puts a small suitcase in his car, kisses Jetta and 
           hugs his three children.

                        Do you want one giant apple? Or a 
                        thousand tiny apples?

                                 JAN
                        A giant one!

                        I wish you wouldn’t worry so much.

                                 JETTA

                                 ESCHER
                        That’s different.

                                 JETTA
                        You’re right. Far more frightening

                        artist? I’ll see you in a few days.

           Escher gets in the car and drives away.

           INT. / EXT. ESCHER’S CAR - DUTCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Escher enters a rural landscape, leaving the Haarlem suburbs 
           behind.
           EXT. BLUE FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Escher grabs his suitcase from his car. Then shares a cordial 
           embrace with JOHANN (a well-read, somewhat philosophical 
           farmer) before they enter a rustic, light blue farmhouse.  

           INT. BLUE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Escher eats dinner with Johann and his WIFE.

                                 JOHANN
                        It’s getting worse in the cities?  

                                 ESCHER
                        Hard to get large amounts of wheat 
                        or potatoes. Fresh fruit’s 
                        especially difficult. If it’s 
                        alright, I’d like to get a little 
                        more than last time.   

           Johann hesitates, but his wife chimes in.

                                 JOHANN’S WIFE
                        Of course. Whatever you need.

                                 JOHANN
                        Things’ll turn around. You’ll see. 
                        Every winter’s followed by a 
                        spring. Spend enough time as a 
                        farmer, you see cycles in 
                        everything. 

                                 ESCHER
                        Huh. I agree. History’s filled with 
                        seasons of war, starting and ending 
                        and starting again, looping 
                        inevitably. Where I differ from you 
                        is that notion fills me less with 
                        hope than despair.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Escher places a sack of potatoes in the car, then hands 
           Johann some money and they hug goodbye.

           INT. / EXT. ESCHER’S CAR - HAARLEM OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           Escher approaches the outskirts of Haarlem where GERMAN 
           SOLDIERS have set up a checkpoint.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Papers?

           Escher provides his papers to one soldier while the other 
           quickly searches the car.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Where are you coming from?

                                 ESCHER
                        The North. Visiting friends. 
                        Getting some food for my family.

           Escher reaches back and grabs an apple, then hands it to the 
           soldier who takes a bite and waves Escher on.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jetta unpacks fresh groceries in the kitchen, while Escher 
           and Jan sit on the floor, building a tower of blocks.  Jan 
           carefully places a cylindrical column at the top.

                                 ESCHER
                        There you’ve done it!

           Jan smiles proudly at his father. But as Escher stares at the 
           final BLOCK, he falls into his own thoughts.

                                 JAN
                        What do you see?

           Escher moves his head around the block, and... 

           HE IMAGINES that the CYLINDRICAL BLOCK is revealed to be 
           completely flat, like a sheet of paper standing upright. He 
           moves his head to view it from different angles, marveling at 
           the illusion.  

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           BACH plays. Escher sketches at his drawing table with his 
           son’s CYLINDRICAL BLOCK standing upright before him. He’s 
           focused. Intense.
           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DAY

           De Mesquita lowers a glass of brandy and takes a closer look 
           at the DRAWING that Escher’s laid out in front of him: 

           Two stone columns in a room. It’s an early version of what 
           will become Escher’s Doric Columns (1945).  

                                 ESCHER
                        See how the columns start out real, 
                        only to be exposed as illusions at 
                        the ends? 

           Sure enough, the stone columns fold over like origami, 
           revealing themselves as two dimensional pieces of paper. 

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You’re like the magician unmasking 
                        his trick.

                                 ESCHER
                        Exactly! Making it self-evident.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Wonderful.

           They look up as Jaap enters.

                                 ESCHER
                        Hello Jaap.

                                 JAAP
                        Mauk.  

           There’s something awkward about how Jaap lingers expectantly, 
           looking back and forth between Escher and his father.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        I didn’t ask him yet.

                                 ESCHER
                        Ask me what?

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        It’s just you’ve already done so 
                        much for us.

                                 JAAP
                        It’s Rebecca. She received a call-
                        up notice for a work camp.

                                 ESCHER
                        A work camp? Why would they want a 
                        little girl?
                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Mauk, when they take nine year old 
                        Jewish girls, they don’t actually 
                        send them to work camps.

           Escher absorbs the implications.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’ve heard rumors, but you think...

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Everything you’ve heard is true.  
                        And worse.

                                 JAAP
                        We need to get her into hiding.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        We thought perhaps you might know 
                        someone you can reach out to.

                                 ESCHER
                        Oh I don’t know...

                                 JAAP
                        Your brother’s an academic. He must 
                        know people in the Resistance. 

           Escher shifts uncomfortably.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Jaap, can you leave us?

           Jaap gives Escher one last desperate look, then heads 
           upstairs. Escher notices Rebecca peeking through the 
           banisters above before following after her father.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        I’m sorry about that. He’s just 
                        concerned.

                                 ESCHER
                        No, of course.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You’ve already been too kind. But 
                        we have no one else to ask. 

           Off Escher, concerned... 
           EXT. LEIDEN UNIVERSITY - COURTYARD - DAY

           Escher and Berend stroll around the courtyard smoking 
           cigarettes as they talk.  

                                 BEREND
                        When is she supposed to report?

                                 ESCHER
                        Five days. Can they help?  

                                 BEREND
                        That’s what they do. But they have 
                        too much to do and they prioritize 
                        very carefully.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Saving her’s not reason enough?

                                 BEREND
                        It’s all relative, isn’t it?  
                        Saving a young girl is absolutely 
                        the most important thing in the 
                        world, unless it comes at the 
                        expense of two.

                                 ESCHER
                        Stop being a mathematician. Will 
                        they help her?

                                 BEREND
                             (probably not)
                        I don’t know.

                                 ESCHER
                        That’s not good enough.

                                 BEREND
                             (patient, but stern)
                        You choose to stay in your 
                        comfortable little world solving 
                        your puzzles while in the real 
                        world, real people are fighting 
                        real enemies. You have no right to 
                        be upset with how we fight.      

           Berend walks away, leaving Escher standing alone in the 
           middle of the courtyard. Thinking. Puzzled.  

           He FIXATES on the old STONE COLUMNS, dirty with age.

           HE IMAGINES the pillars breaking free from their positions 
           and revealing themselves to be flat ribbons that flop and 
           fold over themselves.
           He snaps himself out of it and rushes after his brother.

                                 ESCHER
                        What if I help the Resistance? I’ll 
                        connect you to my friends in the 
                        country. Would that make this a 
                        priority?

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET ALONG THE CANAL - NIGHT

           A stone street along the dark waters of Amsterdam’s canal. 
           Berend leads Escher down steps to a discreet CELLAR BAR.

                                 BEREND
                        Never come here without me, okay?

                                 ESCHER
                        Why would I?

           INT. CELLAR BAR - NIGHT

           Quiet. Dimly lit. Escher feels the watchful stares of wary 
           eyes as he and Berend enter.

           A waitress, SOPHIE (20s, Bohemian feel) greets Berend with a 
           double-kiss.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Berend! I’m in love with the book 
                        you gave me. I can’t put it down.

                                 BEREND
                        That’s quite a lucky book, to rest 
                        in your hands and enjoy your love. 

           Sophie smirks as she leads them past a table with two STERN-
           LOOKING MEN who stare at Escher - perhaps trying to 
           intimidate him. 

           They round a corner and enter a small nook filled with 
           velvety couches, soft candlelight, and crowded BOOKSHELVES.

                                 SOPHIE
                        He’ll be here in a moment.

           She leaves and they wait in silence.  

           Then Escher hears SOFT FOOTSTEPS getting louder. He looks 
           around, confused at the source, until finally a section of 
           bookshelves swings open to reveal a passage from which... 
           RUDOLF (30s) emerges. Fit. Handsome. His serious eyes 
           contrast with his flippant smile.       

           Berend and Rudolf embrace affectionately. Berend plants a 
           kiss on Rudolf’s cheek before letting go.

                                 BEREND
                        My boy.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Hello dad.

           Rudolf approaches Escher and they hug.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Uncle Mauk. Good to see you.

                                 ESCHER
                        You’ve grown up.

                                 BEREND
                        What’s the expression? “War makes 
                        men of boys.”

                                 RUDOLF
                        Let’s sit.

           They sit among the couches. Rudolf offers them cigarettes.  

                                 ESCHER
                             (reluctant)
                        Okay but this is my last one.

                                 BEREND
                        He says that every time.

                                 RUDOLF
                             (as he lights them)
                        The real question is whether 
                        telling yourself it’s your last 
                        makes you enjoy it more or less. 

           Escher tastes the smoke. Considers what Rudolf said. 

                                 RUDOLF
                        So. They’ve agreed to help re-
                        locate the girl.

                                 BEREND
                        That’s wonderful!

                                 ESCHER
                        Where will they take her?
                                 RUDOLF
                        Better for you the less you know. 
                        I’ll stay involved and confirm when 
                        it’s done.

                                 ESCHER
                        Thank you.

                                 RUDOLF
                        But they will need you to introduce 
                        me to your contacts in the country.

                                 ESCHER
                        I understand.

                                 RUDOLF
                        We leave tonight.

           Escher frowns.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Is that a problem?

                                 ESCHER
                        I didn’t realize -- I’ll need to 
                        stop home first and --

                                 RUDOLF
                        Are you sure you want this?

                                 ESCHER
                        Well -- yes, I --

                                 RUDOLF
                        No, listen. These days everyone 
                        knows danger. And death. But 
                        this... what we do is another kind 
                        of danger.

                                 ESCHER
                        I know.

                                 RUDOLF
                        I want to make sure you’re not 
                        doing one thing and telling 
                        yourself another.  

           Escher checks Berend who, with the slightest of nods throws 
           his support behind his son’s words.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        If it would even slightly increase 
                        the odds of winning the world back 
                        from Hitler, I would gladly die.

                        I’d let my friends die. And my 
                        father. And you. Do you understand?

           Escher hesitates, then...

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jetta, panicked, follows Escher around the small room while 
           he packs a suitcase.

                                 ESCHER
                        It was the only way.

                                 JETTA
                        You’re not like them, Mauk. You 
                        can’t do what they do.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m not doing anything. I’m going 
                        for supplies like I always do.

                                 JETTA
                        No. Not like you always do. I have 
                        a bad feeling about this. Do you 
                        not see the enormous risk that 
                        you’re taking by -- 

                                 ESCHER
                        Of course but I’m trying not to see 
                        it and you’re making that 
                        difficult. I don’t have a choice, 
                        so I’d rather just --

                                 JETTA
                        Don’t I get a say? It’s not up to 
                        you alone. You have a family.

                                 ESCHER
                        De Mesquita is family.

                                 JETTA
                        I know he’s your mentor, and he’s 
                        dear to you, but he’s not your 
                        family. We are your family.

                                 ESCHER
                             (melting down)
                        Of course, but he... he saved me 
                        from a life of... of... of being 
                        lost.

                        Jetta, he saw who I was before I 
                        did, and I would’ve led a lost, 
                        miserable life without him. Of 
                        course I’m scared. I don’t want to 
                        go. But I need to do this for him. 
                        I need to. I need to.

           He collapses on the bed. Distraught. Emotional. Overwhelmed. 

           She sits next to him. Sullen. Blank stare.

           A few moments of silence. Then she gently touches his 
           shoulder and, in a soothing voice, whispers...

                                 JETTA
                        You’re just going for supplies like 
                        you always do.

           EXT. ESCHER’S HOUSE – NIGHT

           Jetta stands by as Escher loads his suitcase in his car. 

                                 JETTA
                        Try to enjoy the drive. And say hi 
                        to Rudolf for me.

           He nods. He seems to have re-found his calm. They kiss 
           goodbye, then he gets in the car and drives off. 

           INT. ESCHER’S CAR - DUTCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Escher drives. Rudolf in the passenger seat.

                                 RUDOLF
                        How’s your art coming along?

                                 ESCHER
                        Fine.

                                 RUDOLF
                        I always tell my father I’d love to 
                        see you make something about the 
                        working class and the capitalists.  
                        I can picture it. A capitalist and 
                        a worker fitting together - you 
                        can’t have one without the other.
                             (off Escher’s silence)
                        I know. Not your thing.

                                 ESCHER
                        How about you? I always loved that 
                        sonata, how’d it go...

                                 RUDOLF
                        I lost that one. In the bombing.

                                 ESCHER
                        Oh. Do you ever think about trying 
                        to re-create them? From memory? 

                                 RUDOLF
                        I don’t think so.
                             (after a moment)
                        I admit, I never thought my father 
                        would get you on board. 

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m not on board. This is just for 
                        your help with Rebecca.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Right. Why are you so reluctant to 
                        get involved?

                                 ESCHER
                        You mean besides the obvious danger 
                        that I’m trying very hard not to 
                        think about?

                                 RUDOLF
                             (chuckles)
                        Yes. Besides that.

           Escher thinks for a moment. Then...

                                 ESCHER
                        Lately I’ve been playing with the 
                        idea of illusion. If I draw a 
                        sphere, it’s not a sphere. It’s a 
                        flat circular image that I can cut 
                        from the paper and fold up in my 
                        hand. I’ve been toying with ways to 
                        show this idea. To make the 
                        illusion painfully obvious to the 
                        viewer. Like two hands that draw 
                        each other. Or two solid columns 
                        that fold over like paper so they 
                        can stand on each other’s flatness. 
                        Or I even have a thought to make a 
                        drawing that looks like it’s 
                        getting poked from behind so that 
                        anyone would immediately see that 
                        it’s just a flat piece of paper.

                                 ESCHER (CONT'D)
                        But even if I somehow pull that one 
                        off, it will still be a flat 
                        drawing, so I will have created 
                        only the illusion of an illusion.

           Escher smiles, tickled by his own thought. 

                                 RUDOLF
                        ...and how does this relate to your 
                        reluctance to join the Resistance?

                                 ESCHER
                        Ah yes. That’s how we got here. 
                        Well I suppose just as all art is 
                        illusion, I feel the same about 
                        politics. Every ideology I have 
                        ever encountered strikes me as an 
                        attempt to trick men into believing 
                        that what they do is right. When I 
                        hear any man justify killing and 
                        fighting, all I see is a man 
                        holding a two dimensional piece of 
                        paper and claiming that it’s three. 

           Rudolf mulls this over before responding.

                                 RUDOLF
                             (a hint of derision)
                        So you’re a pacifist then. That’s a 
                        convenient way to view the world.

                                 ESCHER
                        Are you working on anything new?

                                 RUDOLF
                        Yes actually. I’m calling it “Music 
                        for a Spirit in Mourning.” Fitting, 
                        right? I think there’s something 
                        special about art that grows in the 
                        middle of disaster.  

                                 ESCHER
                        How’s it go?

           Rudolf starts to hum a melody.

           Escher listens. Absorbed. He’d close his eyes if he weren’t 
           driving.

           Rudolf’s VOICE is replaced by a FULL ORCHESTRA bringing to 
           life the melody of his composition Musique pour l’esprit en 
           deuil (1941-1943). 

           The MUSIC continues over...
           SERIES OF SHOTS - DUTCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Escher and Rudolf drive along country roads and pass:

           - an army truck full of GERMAN SOLDIERS

           - the burnt remains of a farmhouse

           - a HUNGRY FAMILY walking with all their possessions

           - NAZI SOLDIERS holding a group of YOUNG MEN at gunpoint

           The MUSIC ends as Escher and Rudolf arrive at the same blue 
           farmhouse Escher visited earlier.

           INT. BLUE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Escher and Rudolf sit at the table with Johann.

                                 JOHANN
                        I don’t know him.

                                 ESCHER
                        He’s my nephew.

                                 JOHANN
                        And I don’t know him.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        I can pay well. Much more than --

                                 JOHANN
                        I don’t want money. I want nothing 
                        to do with you.

                                 RUDOLF
                        But --

           Johann stands.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        This is about something greater 
                        than any of us. It’s --

                                 JOHANN
                        Every awful misery in this world 
                        was justified by something “greater 
                        than any of us.” 

                                 RUDOLF
                             (to Escher)
                        I can see why you’re friends.
                             (to Johann)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUDOLF (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for your time. I’m sorry 
                        to bother you.

           They head to the door, but just before they leave...

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry, I --

                                 JOHANN
                        Don’t ever come back here. 

           As Escher and Rudolf exit, Escher sees Johann’s Wife through 
           a doorway. She looks at him. Disappointed.

           INT. ESCHER’S CAR - DAY

           Escher stares out the window as Rudolf drives. Brooding 
           silence.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAY

           Escher and Rudolf walk with the Wheat Farmer in the fields.  

                                 WHEAT FARMER
                        I’d like to help, and I need the 
                        money, but I just don’t know.

                                 RUDOLF
                        No one will ever find out.

           The Farmer looks to Escher. Trusting.  

           Escher nods. The Farmer sighs.

                                 WHEAT FARMER
                        Can you make it triple?

           EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

           Rudolf shakes hands with the Apple Farmer. Escher watches 
           uncomfortably.

           INT. / EXT. ESCHER’S CAR - NIGHT

           Escher and Rudolf drive in silence through the dark 
           countryside. Up ahead, a Nazi checkpoint becomes visible.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        Shit.
                                 ESCHER
                        Should I turn around?

                                 RUDOLF
                        No.
                             (thinks)
                        When we get up there, slow down, 
                        but only a little.  

                                 ESCHER
                        What are you --

                                 RUDOLF
                        If I don’t find you by morning, 
                        tell my father.

                                 ESCHER
                        Wait, I --

           As they take a curve, Escher slows down and Rudolf dives out 
           of the moving car.  

           Escher is shocked. He begins to panic as he approaches the 
           checkpoint, manned by two GERMAN SOLDIERS.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Papers?

           Escher’s too nervous to respond. His breath quickens.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Papers.

                                 ESCHER
                        I -- I was just visiting some 
                        friends in the North and --

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Step out of your vehicle.

           Escher doesn’t move. He FIXATES on the crisp angles of the 
           soldier’s COLLAR. The REFLECTION of light off a COAT BUTTON. 

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Now.

           The soldier draws his gun.  

           Escher closes his eyes and tries to calm down.

           When he opens them again, something strange catches his eye. 
           He leans over and sees that the soldiers are just TWO 
           DIMENSIONAL ILLUSIONS - flat when viewed from the side. 
           Glimpsing this distorted reality calms him. Comforts him. He 
           visibly relaxes. Breathes slower. Regains enough composure to 
           step out of the car and speak.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry. Here are my papers.
                             (hands them to soldier)
                        Would you like some fruit? I have 
                        fresh apples, or --

           The soldier looks up from the papers. Lowers his gun.  

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        I’ll take an apple.

           Escher leans into the car to grab an apple, and breathes a 
           deep sigh of relief.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Escher sits alone by candlelight. He’s been waiting up for a 
           while. He starts to nod off when a light KNOCK wakes him up.

           He opens the door to find Rudolf, who quickly slips inside.

           Escher pulls his nephew in for a tight embrace, then 
           whispers...

                                 ESCHER
                        Upstairs.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           Escher sits on the couch as Rudolf looks around the studio 
           taking in the details and cradling one of his arms.  

                                 ESCHER
                        How’s your hand?

                                 RUDOLF
                        Feels like I jumped from a moving 
                        car. Are you okay? 

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes.

           Rudolf reads volumes from Escher’s face and tone.

                                 RUDOLF
                        You weren’t ready for this.
           Escher shakes his head. With his good hand, Rudolf pulls out 
           a map and lays it out.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        Don’t worry, nobody is. You did 
                        well. Now, remind me the name of 
                        the potato farmer outside Alkmaar?

                                 ESCHER
                        What is that?

                                 RUDOLF
                        I remember his charming wife, but --

                                 ESCHER
                        It has their locations. It puts 
                        them all at risk.

                                 RUDOLF
                        No we’d never put them at risk --

                                 ESCHER
                        What if they caught you with that? 
                        You need to tear it up.

                                 RUDOLF
                        I know this isn’t easy for you. But 
                        I have to give this to the people 
                        above me. The same people 
                        responsible for re-locating your 
                        friend’s granddaughter tomorrow.

           Escher paces around the studio.

                                 RUDOLF
                        The only people who will have 
                        access to this are people I trust 
                        with my life.

                                 ESCHER
                        We all prioritize life differently. 
                        Don’t we?

           Escher flips through a stack of drawings and pulls one out. 
           It’s a pattern of interconnected black, red, and yellow 
           lizards (Reptiles 1942).

           He snatches the map from Rudolf and brings it to his 
           workbench.

                                 RUDOLF
                        I need to give them --
                                 ESCHER
                        Hold on a minute.

           Escher grabs a small metal tool and POKES HOLES in the 
           locations marked off on the map.

                                 RUDOLF
                        What are you --

                                 ESCHER
                        Just hold on!

           Escher lays the map on top of the lizards drawing, careful to 
           line the edges up perfectly. Then he uses his ink roller to 
           apply blue ink over the map with a CRACKLING SOUND.

           He lifts the map off the drawing, which now has several blue 
           dots on it. Then he tears the map to pieces.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Don’t!

           Escher hands Rudolf the drawing.

                                 ESCHER
                        Use this instead. You can buy one 
                        of those maps anywhere, and all you 
                        have to do is line it up under the 
                        drawing and stick pins in the dots 
                        and you’ll have your locations.  

           Rudolf stares at the drawing thoughtfully.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S STUDIO - DAY

           A neat orderly studio, similar to Escher’s.

           Rebecca sits at a table drawing a picture, while Escher 
           wanders the room, looking at PRINTS hanging on the walls.  

           De Mesquita enters.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Rebecca, they’re ready for you.

                                 REBECCA
                        I’m almost done.

           Escher looks at a PRINT of a man and woman huddled together 
           surrounded by a crowd of people with strange faces. 
                                 ESCHER
                        This one. I’ve always wanted to 
                        ask, is it you and Elisabeth?

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Perhaps in our fatter days.

           They share a smile.

                                 JAAP (O.S.)
                        Rebecca!

           Jaap pokes his head in, looking a bit nervous.

                                 JAAP
                        Come. It’s time to go.  

                                 REBECCA
                        One second.

           She finishes a final section of her drawing while Jaap 
           battles his patience.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You can’t rush art, Jaap.

                                 ESCHER
                        It’s true.

                                 JAAP
                        You’re not helping, dad.

                                 REBECCA
                        Okay I’m done.

           Rebecca hands Escher the finished drawing. It shows a boy and 
           girl sitting on a cloud in a blue sky.

                                 ESCHER
                        Beautiful.

                                 REBECCA
                        This is for Jan, will you give it 
                        to him?

                                 ESCHER
                        Of course.

           Rebecca lifts a bag and starts toward her father.

                                 ESCHER
                        Wait, she should take some supplies 
                        with her, no? To practice her art?
                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Good idea.

           De Mesquita and Escher scoop up paper and drawing materials 
           and add them to her bag while Jaap waits impatiently.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Escher, De Mesquita, Elisabeth, and Jaap look on as Sophie 
           squats by the back door so she’s at Rebecca’s height.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Tell me one more time?

                                 REBECCA
                        My name is Anika Visser. You’re my 
                        mother. We live in Amsterdam, and 
                        we were visiting grandma and 
                        grandpa.

           Jaap bends down to give his daughter a final goodbye.  

                                 JAAP
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry this is the 
                        world you know. I love you.

           He squeezes her tightly, tears in his eyes.

           De Mesquita puts his hand on Escher’s back. Whispers...

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Thank you.

           INT. HIDING PLACE - NIGHT

           Rudolf appraises this small stone cellar of a room. The only 
           furnishing is a tiny mattress on the ground.

           He frowns. This won’t do. He begins to spruce up the drab 
           place. He adds a colorful blanket to the bed. Lines up a 
           handful of books. Sets flowers in a small tin can of a vase. 
           Puts a stuffed animal on the pillow.

           A CREAK of a trapdoor and Sophie leads Rebecca down a ladder 
           into the small space.  

           Rebecca makes a noble attempt to hide her reaction to her 
           dark, cramped new home.

                                 RUDOLF
                        You’re a brave little girl. I need 
                        you to be strong. And patient.

                        And before you know it, this will 
                        be over.

                                 REBECCA
                        What’s your name?

                                 RUDOLF
                        Rudolf.

                                 REBECCA
                        Thank you Rudolf. I’m Anika.

           They shake hands and he smiles, impressed with her composure.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The DRAWING that Rebecca made for Jan hangs on the wall.

           Escher and his three sons have turned the living room into a 
           maze of furniture and cushions covered with blankets and 
           carpets, enjoying themselves as they place the final touches.

           Jetta watches happily.

           Jan sneezes.

                                 ESCHER
                        Gesundheit.

           Jan sneezes again.

           Jetta and Escher exchange concerned looks.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Escher walks with Jan, who is bundled up and looks sickly.

                                 ESCHER
                        And that one?

           Escher points at a cloud in the sky.

                                 JAN
                        A bunny.

           He coughs.

                                 JAN
                        Looking up makes me cough.
                                 ESCHER
                        Then we’ll have to look down. Do 
                        you see anything in the stones?

                                 JAN
                        That one! It’s a kite. And that 
                        one’s a fish. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jan sits shirtless as the DOCTOR (50s) listens to his chest 
           through a stethoscope. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        He has an infection of the lung. 
                        Ideally I’d give him penicillin, 
                        but there’s a shortage and the 
                        Germans are restricting access.

                                 ESCHER
                        So what then?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Have him rest and drink fluids. I 
                        can give you something for the 
                        symptoms, but without penicillin it 
                        may only get worse.

                                 ESCHER
                        When will you get more?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I wish I knew. You didn’t hear it 
                        from me, but best bet, find someone 
                        who’s friends with Nazis.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Escher watches as Jetta chops a raw chicken and adds it to a 
           pot of soup.

                                 JETTA
                        How about Klaus?  

                                 ESCHER
                        Actually I was thinking of asking 
                        my brother.

           She gives him a look.
                                 ESCHER
                        I’ll bet the Resistance has access 
                        to all sorts of --

                                 JETTA
                        At least try Klaus first. It can’t 
                        hurt.

                                 ESCHER
                        You don’t think perhaps it’s wrong 
                        to deal with the Nazis? Now that we 
                        know --

                                 JETTA
                        It’s medicine for your son.

           Escher frowns as he considers.

           EXT. WEALTHY STREET - NIGHT

           Escher meets Klaus in front of a wealthy apartment building, 
           a portfolio under his arm.

                                 KLAUS
                        You brought them all?

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes. Anything I should know?

                                 KLAUS
                        Just that he’s my best customer. 
                        High up the S.S. chain. Reports 
                        directly to Himmler. If he can’t 
                        help you, no one can.

           INT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A well-apportioned apartment displaying expensive tastes.  

           Escher and Klaus watch as OBERGRUPPENFÜHRER HANNS ALBIN 
           RAUTER (49, stocky) flips through a pile of prints and pauses 
           on Escher’s Day and Night (1938). 

                                 KLAUS
                        That one’s very popular.

           But Rauter’s uninterested. He keeps flipping until he gets to 
           Escher’s Hand with Reflecting Globe (1935): an intricately 
           detailed print of a hand holding a mirrored sphere in which a 
           warped self-portrait of Escher is visible. 
                                 RAUTER
                        You’re gifted Mr. Escher. To be 
                        frank, that gift is under-utilized 
                        in most of your work. But in this 
                        it’s undeniable.

           Klaus nudges Escher to respond.

                                 ESCHER
                        Thank you.

                                 RAUTER
                        It takes a certain man to do a self-
                        portrait. Many can’t bear to look 
                        at themselves for so long.

                                 ESCHER
                        I prefer it to portraits. If I’m 
                        forced to be in someone’s company 
                        while I work, I’d rather it be my 
                        own.

                                 RAUTER
                        Funny. I like that. It’s natural to 
                        prefer oneself over others. The 
                        same is true about nations isn’t 
                        it?  

                                 KLAUS
                        What do you mean?

                                 RAUTER
                        As a German, I prefer what is 
                        German. Our culture. Our way. And 
                        as Dutchmen, you naturally prefer 
                        your way. And that’s the basis of 
                        all warfare, isn’t it? 

                                 KLAUS
                        A fascinating way to look at it.

           Rauter gazes at the print another moment.

                                 RAUTER
                             (to Klaus)
                        I’ll take it. Can you have it 
                        framed and delivered?

                                 KLAUS
                        Of course.

           Klaus takes the print.
                                 KLAUS
                             (to Escher)
                        Wasn’t there something you wanted 
                        to ask the Obergruppenführer while 
                        we’re here?

           Escher hesitates a moment, then...

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes, it’s about my son. He’s sick.

           EXT. NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Escher sits with Jan in a waiting room along with a handful 
           of UNIFORMED NAZI SOLDIERS.

           On the wall hangs the doctor’s framed license - with a large 
           swastika on it.

           INT. NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Jan lays on an examination table as DR. FELIX HAUSSER (40s) 
           prepares to inject a SYRINGE into his arm. 

                                 ESCHER
                        Just imagine a giant rhinoceros is 
                        poking you with his horn.

           Jan giggles, then winces as the needle goes in.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        All done. You can get dressed.  
                             (to Escher)
                        Rhinoceros. I’ll remember that one. 
                        My son’s around his age.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Have you seen one?

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        A rhinoceros? Yes. The Berlin Zoo.  
                        You?

                        Thank you.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        You’re the first non-German sent to 
                        me. You must’ve done something to 
                        impress Obergruppenführer Rauter.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I think he likes my art.

                        Ah an artist. No wonder you love 
                        Florence. Oh wait! One more thing.

           Dr. Hausser grabs a small chocolate from a drawer and hands 
           it to Jan, whose face lights up.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        You must eat one of these if you’re

                        Let’s go.

                        Disappointed? The opposite! I’m

                        Where are we going?

           INT. LEIDEN APARTMENT - DAY

           Markus, the academic from earlier, leads Escher and Berend 
           into his apartment.  

                                 MARKUS
                        Ah Mister M.C. Escher! That was a 
                        neat trick with the map. Very 
                        clever.

           Escher sees a handful of ACADEMICS in focused conversations 
           around the room. In a corner, one of them rolls ink through 
           stencils over pieces of art, just like Escher did.

                                 MARKUS
                        I’ve been thinking about what you 
                        said in your lecture, and in 
                        particular your “Development” 
                        series, and I really think if you 
                        want to move beyond a square limit 
                        you should explore Coxeter’s

                        Yes, I’m sorry.
                             (warns them)
                        He’s in a bit of a mood.

           Markus leads Escher and Berend into...

           A DINING ROOM

           ...where Rudolf is seated at a table, arm in a sling, poring 
           over documents. He hardly looks up to acknowledge them.

                                 RUDOLF
                        What do you need dad? I’ve got a 
                        lot to do.
                                 BEREND
                        You’ll want to hear this.

           Rudolf looks up, unconvinced.

                                 BEREND
                        Obergruppenführer Rauter’s in 
                        Haarlem. Mauk sold him a print.

                                 RUDOLF
                             (to Escher)
                        You met him in person?

                                 BEREND
                        It gets better. The 
                        Obergruppenführer was so taken with 
                        our Mauk that he had a Nazi doctor 
                        give him penicillin for Jan.

                                 RUDOLF
                        What was his name? The doctor?

                                 ESCHER
                        Felix Hauser.  

           Rudolf jots down the name in a small notepad.

                                 RUDOLF
                        How did you leave it with Rauter?  
                        When will you see him again?

                                 ESCHER
                        I don’t know, I -- it’s through my 
                        friend Klaus. An art dealer.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Get another meeting with him.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Wait I --

                                 RUDOLF
                        Do you have a follow-up with the 
                        doctor?

                                 ESCHER
                        Next week, but --

                                 RUDOLF
                        Find out how much penicillin he 
                        has.
                                 ESCHER
                        Hold on. I don’t feel comfortable 
                        with this sort of --

                                 RUDOLF
                        We’re fighting a war. I don’t have 
                        time for your discomfort.

           Escher, conflicted, unsure how to respond.

                                 BEREND
                             (to Escher)
                        You said you felt bad dealing with 
                        the Nazis? This should make you 
                        feel better.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DAY

           The usual glass of brandy in front of Escher - a cup of tea 
           for De Mesquita who looks sick and wears a bathrobe.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        So you feel that selling your art 
                        to this Nazi makes you, what, a 
                        collaborator?

                                 ESCHER
                        How would you feel? If one of your 
                        prints hung in a Nazi home.  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        But it’s for the best, right? You 
                        took care of Jan, and now you can 
                        help the Resistance.

           Escher looks uncomfortable.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ESCHER
                        Lately I’ve just had trouble 
                        knowing what’s right. 

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Not everything’s black and white. 
                        Right or wrong. We’re not your 
                        little optimists and pessimists who 
                        can’t exist at the same time. Life 
                        is messy. Full of contradictions 
                        and impossible choices. You just do 
                        the best you can.  
           De Mesquita coughs as he pours a healthy dose of brandy into 
           his tea, then raises his mug in a cheers...

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        To finding joy in the middle of all 
                        this misery. A beautiful paradox, 
                        isn’t it?  

           Escher sips his glass, taking in De Mesquita’s words.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Escher hurries along the street, eyes down, dour face, 
           holding his coat tightly around him.

           He stops and looks around: unhappy faces rush back and forth, 
           hunched over, bundled up against the cold.  

           A handful of Nazi Soldiers wait around for orders. Even they 
           look miserable.

           Escher finds the sun in the sky and focuses on its 
           BRIGHTNESS. Feels it on his face. Looks back down at his 
           surroundings. But now everything’s different. Brighter. The 
           colors more vibrant.  

           He focuses on interesting PATTERNS in the rooftops, a 
           glimmering REFLECTION OF LIGHT in a window, the interlocking 
           FINGERS of an OLD COUPLE holding hands.  

           He spots a FLOWER SHOP. Sees a FLORIST (female, 20s) cutting 
           stems inside. Eyes a bouquet of TULIPS in the window.   

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Escher watches Jetta place the TULIPS in a vase.

                                 JETTA
                             (shouting across the room)
                        Stay away from your brother. I 
                        don’t want you two getting sick.

           Jan lays on the couch under a blanket while his older 
           brothers play a game on the floor nearby.

                                 ESCHER
                        How’s he doing?

                                 JETTA
                        Much better. Please thank Klaus.
                                 ESCHER
                        I will.

           He heads to the stairs, but then Jetta calls to him...

                                 JETTA
                        Mauk.
                             (re: the tulips)
                        They’re beautiful.

           He smiles at his wife before heading upstairs.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Escher at his drawing table, listening to BACH and doodling 
           versions of his optimist and pessimist.

           INT. HIDING PLACE - NIGHT

           The BACH continues over Rebecca on her tiny bed, drawing with 
           the art supplies that Escher and De Mesquita gave her. 

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Escher walks with Jan along a street with a large presence of 
           GERMAN SOLDIERS. Jan coughs. 

                                 JAN
                        I’m not nervous about the shot this 
                        time.

                                 ESCHER
                        Good boy.

           A soldier holding a YOUNG MAN at gunpoint starts punching and 
           kicking him. Escher ushers Jan in the opposite direction 
           before he can notice.

                                 ESCHER
                        Maybe the doctor will have another 
                        piece of chocolate for you.

           INT. NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Jan gets dressed as Dr. Hausser turns to Escher.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        He’s doing well. I think he’ll be 
                        better in a few days. 
                                 ESCHER
                        I brought something to thank you.

           Escher pulls a drawing out of his portfolio. It’s his work 
           Inside St. Peter’s, Rome (1935): a view of the inside of St. 
           Peter’s Cathedral from an impossibly high angle. The 
           perspective is mesmerizing.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        Is this...

                                 ESCHER
                        St. Peter’s, in Rome.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        I don’t know what to say. Thank 
                        you. You made this?

           Escher nods.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        Now I see why Rauter was impressed.

                                 ESCHER
                        I was wondering, actually, if I can 
                        ask a favor.

           Hausser looks up from the print, wary.

                                 ESCHER
                        I have some friends. Sick friends 
                        who aren’t as lucky as I was to get 
                        access to penicillin.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        How many friends?

                                 ESCHER
                        Too many. But three in particular.

           Dr. Hausser considers a moment, then sighs.

           He opens a cabinet and retrieves a few VIALS OF PENICILLIN 
           and a SYRINGE, wraps them all in a MEDICAL GOWN, and hands it 
           to Escher who quickly tucks it away in his bag.

                                 ESCHER
                        Thank you.

                                 DR. HAUSSER
                        I didn’t do anything. Thank you for 
                        the picture.  
           Escher nods, takes Jan’s hand, and heads to the door, but Jan 
           interrupts...

                                 JAN
                        Wait! What about the chocolate?

           Dr. Hausser smiles at Jan and reaches for the drawer.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Elisabeth stands over an unwrapped MEDICAL GOWN with the 
           VIALS OF PENICILLIN. She’s just finished prepping a SYRINGE 
           to inject into Jaap’s arm. 

           Escher shows De Mesquita a rough sketch of his optimist and 
           pessimist - but now they are three dimensional characters 
           shaking hands. 

                                 ESCHER
                        I felt they wanted to meet each 
                        other, so I gave them an 
                        introduction.

           De Mesquita laughs, then coughs.

           INT. NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Dark. Empty.

           FIDDLING NOISES at the door -- it opens and TWO MASKED 
           FIGURES sneak silently across the room, rifling through 
           drawers and shelves, until they find...

           A LARGE STASH OF PENICILLIN, and start emptying it into bags.

           INT. / EXT. CAR OUTSIDE NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rudolf behind the wheel of a car, watching the building 
           across the street.

           A GUNSHOT and a FLASH from a room on the second floor.

           Rudolf starts the car. A few moments later the two Masked 
           Figures rush from the building into the car breathing heavy - 
           adrenaline pumping.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Who was it?
                                 MASKED FIGURE
                        I don’t know. I -- I thought no one 
                        would be there.

           Rudolf frowns and peels away.

           INT. NAZI DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           A handful of Nazi personnel investigate the doctor’s office 
           like a crime scene.  

           Obergruppenführer Rauter steps in slowly. Sees the emptied 
           cabinet of penicillin. Stares down at the dead body of Dr. 
           Hausser in a dried pool of blood.

           Then he looks up at the wall and sees the framed PRINT that 
           Escher gave the doctor.

           EXT. HAARLEM TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Escher follows Berend through a crowd of people in a large 
           plaza in front of a massive 14th century Town Hall building.

                                 ESCHER
                             (upset)
                        He was a good man. He had a son 
                        Jan’s age.

                                 BEREND
                        Lower your voice. How about them?  

           Berend points at the front of the crowd where a makeshift 
           gallows has been set up and ten DUTCHMEN stand with nooses 
           around their necks.  

                                 BEREND
                        They’re good men. They have 
                        families.

                                 ESCHER
                        Since when does one tragedy lessen 
                        another?

           Berend pushes further through the crowd and Escher follows.

                                 ESCHER
                        He was nice to me. I never would 
                        have told you anything if I knew --

                                 BEREND
                        Please. Not right now.
           Berend looks at the gallows where a NAZI OFFICER prepares to 
           give the order.

           The ten faces of the ten men range from silent defiance, to 
           dazed bewilderment, to sheer panic. 

           Escher takes it in - the gravity of the moment finally 
           impacting him.

           The Officer nods. A soldier pulls a lever. The ten men hang.

           Escher watches, sickened.  

           As the HANGING BODIES turn on their ropes, they’re flat. Two 
           dimensional. Illusions. 

           EXT. ART GALLERY - DAY

           As soon as Klaus sees Escher enter he rushes over.  

                                 ESCHER
                        What is it?

                                 KLAUS
                        Obergruppenführer Rauter wants to 
                        see you as soon as possible.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Why?

                                 KLAUS
                        He didn’t say. Come on.  

           Klaus grabs his coat and rushes out the door, followed by a 
           concerned Escher.

           INT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - DAY

           Escher warily follows Klaus as they enter and find Rauter 
           admiring a PAINTING.

                                 RAUTER
                        Johannes Vermeer. “The Astronomer.” 
                        Painted in the 1600s. Remarkable.  

           Both Escher and Klaus can’t help but step closer for a better 
           look at the masterpiece.

                                 RAUTER
                        Hitler’s a big fan of Vermeer. He 
                        wants to own every single one of 
                        Vermeer’s paintings.
                                 KLAUS
                        How much did it go for?

           Rauter sets the painting down, leaning it against the wall. A 
           black swastika is stamped on the back of it.

                                 RAUTER
                        Nothing. It was retrieved from a 
                        French Jew. I pulled some strings 
                        to have it brought here on its way 
                        to Berlin.
                             (switching gears)
                        Mr. Escher. I understand Dr. 
                        Hausser was able to help you with 
                        your son. Is he feeling better?

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes. Thank you.

                                 RAUTER
                        Are you aware that Dr. Hausser was 
                        found dead this morning, his office 
                        ransacked, a stockpile of 
                        penicillin stolen?

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes I was sorry to hear.

                                 RAUTER
                        Were you?

                                 ESCHER
                        Very sorry. He had a son the same 
                        age as my Jan.

           Rauter picks up a framed print. It’s the copy of Inside St. 
           Peter’s, Rome that Escher gave Dr. Hausser.

                                 RAUTER
                        I saw this in his office.

           Klaus gives Escher a curious look. For a brief moment, Escher 
           FIXATES on the print, but he pulls himself out of it almost 
           immediately.

                                 ESCHER
                        I was grateful to the doctor. It 
                        was a token of my gratitude.

           Rauter frowns and looks at the print.  
                                 RAUTER
                        I’m taking it to his family in 
                        Arnhem. His son will grow up 
                        looking at it.

                                 ESCHER
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 RAUTER
                        And I’d like a copy for myself. 
                        Paid for, of course.

                                 KLAUS
                        I’ll have one delivered.

                                 RAUTER
                        Friends of the Reich should be 
                        rewarded. Just as enemies must be 
                        punished.  

           Rauter eyes Escher - is it meant to be threatening?

           Escher looks away from Rauter and spots his print Hand With 
           Reflecting Globe hanging on the wall. He steps closer and 
           gazes at his warped reflection in the sphere.  

                                 RAUTER
                        You’ll be pleased to know I exacted 
                        justice for Dr. Hausser’s murder. 
                        Tenfold. We hung ten members of the 
                        Resistance in retaliation.

           The reflection TWISTS AND DISTORTS - causing Escher to sway 
           dizzily.  

           EXT. WEALTHY STREET - NIGHT

           Escher is still a bit shaken as he and Klaus walk away from 
           Rauter’s apartment building.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m quitting the Nazi Chamber of 
                        Culture.  

                                 KLAUS
                        What? Why?

                                 ESCHER
                        I can’t be around it anymore. Any 
                        of it. I’m done.
                                 KLAUS
                        But I won’t be able to sell your 
                        work anymore.

           Escher walks away.

                                 KLAUS
                             (calling after him)
                        It’s a bad idea. At least think it 
                        through!

           INT. LEIDEN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Escher at the table with Berend and Rudolf.

                                 RUDOLF
                        You’re certain he’s traveling to 
                        Arnhem?

                                 RUDOLF
                        Good. Next time you see him --

                                 ESCHER
                        I can’t see him again.

                                 RUDOLF
                        I know you’re upset about the 
                        doctor. I am too. He wasn’t 
                        supposed to be there.

                                 ESCHER
                        And the ten men. They all died 
                        because of me.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Because of you we’re getting 
                        penicillin to people who 
                        desperately need it.

                        You’re saving lives in the end.

                        I’m not a mathematician. I can’t do 
                        mental arithmetic over life and 
                        death and be okay with it. I know 
                        you think what you do is justified,  
                        but for me it’s... it’s more 
                        geometric. It’s about perspective.

                                 RUDOLF
                        The Germans are destroying our 
                        country. Frankly, I’m unconcerned 
                        with their perspective.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry. I don’t mean to 
                        disappoint you.

           Berend sees how shaken Escher is. He hugs his brother.

                                 BEREND
                        It’s okay. You’ve done enough.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jetta prepares a meal in the kitchen. George and Arthur do 
           homework at the table. 

           Escher sits on the floor with Jan, pushing wooden blocks 
           around the carpet as if they’re cars.  

           There’s a sadness about Escher. But he smiles as he watches 
           Jan play. Innocent. Simple. 

           We fall closer to Jan’s block until it becomes...

           EXT. TREE-LINED ROAD - NIGHT

           ...a real Nazi TRUCK moving along at the front of a convoy of 
           vehicles.

           Obergruppenführer Rauter rides in a BMW MOTORCAR just behind 
           the truck.

           UP AHEAD lies a Nazi checkpoint. But on closer look, one of 
           the soldiers is revealed to be -

           RUDOLF IN A NAZI UNIFORM with two other Nazi-uniformed 
           RESISTANCE FIGHTERS. He glances at the tree line where more 
           FIGHTERS wait in the shadows.

           Rudolf steps in front of the truck and waves it down, causing 
           the TRUCK DRIVER to stop.

           Rauter looks up as his car slows to a stop behind the truck.
                                 RAUTER
                        They shouldn’t be stopping us.
                             (yelling)
                        Get out of the way!

           Rudolf draws a PISTOL and shoots the TRUCK DRIVER. 

           GUNFIRE erupts from all directions targeting the convoy - and 
           the Nazis immediately return fire.

                                 RAUTER
                        Drive! Get us out of here!

           His DRIVER sits up to shift gears, but a bullet flies through 
           his head - spraying Rauter with BLOOD.

           Rudolf creeps along the side of the truck, inching closer to 
           Rauter’s motorcar as the fire-fight continues around him.

           Rauter reaches across his dead driver’s body to open the door 
           and push the body out. Then, crouched low to avoid WHIZZING 
           BULLETS, he shifts gears and pulls out from behind the truck.

           Rudolf and Rauter lock eyes for the briefest of moments 
           before Rudolf SHOOTS Rauter, hitting his arm. 

           Rauter slams on the gas - peeling past Rudolf, barely missing 
           him. Rudolf unloads bullets that SPARK off the car as Rauter 
           makes his escape.

           INT. NAZI HOSPITAL - DAY

           Obergruppenführer Rauter lies in a hospital bed, arm heavily 
           bandaged, as he speaks with a SUBORDINATE OFFICER.

                                 RAUTER
                        Our retaliation needs to be... 
                        overwhelming.   

           EXT. HAARLEM TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Escher is drawn in by the sound of GUNFIRE, and enters the 
           large stone plaza to find a Nazi firing squad surrounded by a 
           crowd of onlookers.

           WORKERS IN CHAINS carry a row of dead bodies into the back of 
           a truck, and a new row of PRISONERS is led in front of the 
           firing squad.

           Only moments later...
                                 NAZI OFFICER
                        Fire!

           GUNSHOTS and the Prisoners fall dead - only to be tossed in 
           the back of the truck and replaced with a new row of 
           PRISONERS.

           Escher’s shocked by the sight of the unending line of 
           prisoners waiting to be shot. It extends across the square, 
           at least a hundred people long, heavily guarded by well-armed 
           GERMAN SOLDIERS. 

           Escher scans the crowd and sees distraught faces.

           He flinches at another round of GUNSHOTS.

           INT. LEIDEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Markus and HIS WIFE eat dinner.  

           A CRASH as NAZI SOLDIERS break through the front door.

           The soldiers detain Markus at gunpoint and spread out to 
           search the apartment.

           INT. HIDING PLACE - NIGHT

           Rebecca huddles in the corner of her bed hugging her knees. 
           She’s thin. Weak. Scared. 

           She FLINCHES at the sound of GUNSHOTS outside.

           She hears GERMAN YELLING.

           She closes her eyes and hugs her legs tighter. A TEAR 
           trickles down her face.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Escher fiddles with a small clay FIGURINE of a worm-like 
           creature that will later appear in his House of Stairs 
           (1951).

           Berend and Rudolf watch him patiently, waiting for a 
           reaction, which finally comes...

           ...as Escher HURLS the figurine across the room, SMASHING it 
           to pieces.

                        If I didn’t tell you where Rauter 
                        would be, you wouldn’t have 
                        ambushed his convoy, and none of 
                        those prisoners... there were so 
                        many. So many. Just lined up.

                        He’s right, it’s my fault.

                        Your guilt doesn’t absolve me of 
                        mine. Don’t you see? We’re stuck in 
                        an endless loop of violence and now 
                        I’ve helped it along.

                                 RUDOLF
                        We’re fighting against the 
                        violence.

                                 ESCHER
                        Fighting, fighting, and more 
                        fighting. Look at history. What 
                        seems like a good cause today is 
                        always used to justify tomorrow’s 
                        tyranny.

                        Hers too. My source tells me the 
                        Nazis will start raids in three 
                        nights. By then we need to re-
                        locate everyone.  

                                 ESCHER
                             (skeptical)
                        Everyone. In three nights.

                                 RUDOLF
                        We need a system to organize it all 
                        so if any one link gets caught it 
                        won’t bring down the whole chain.

                                 BEREND
                        Mauk... we need your help.

                                 ESCHER
                        You’re joking. There’s no way.

                                 RUDOLF
                        It’s the only way.

                                 BEREND
                             (calmly)
                        Without a system, there’s no 
                        operation. Without an operation, 
                        Rebecca will die. And hundreds with 
                        her.

           Escher is overcome with emotion. Embarrassed, he abruptly 
           stands and paces to a bookshelf, keeping his back turned from 
           the other men to hide his watery eyes.

           Berend and Rudolf exchange a look and wait silently as Escher 
           gathers himself.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m not meant for this sort of 
                        thing. It’s too much.

           Berend stands and starts to approach Escher, then thinks 
           better of it.

                                 BEREND
                        We’ll give you a few moments.

           Rudolf follows Berend out, leaving Escher alone to pace the 
           room in a raw, emotional, daze.

                                 JETTA (O.S.)
                        Mauk?
           Escher turns to find his wife approaching him. She spots his 
           red, watery eyes and immediately wraps her arms around him 
           from behind. Comforting him.  

           He stares at her slender wrists, draped around his neck. He 
           traces a line along her wrist with his finger. She smiles.

                                 JETTA
                        You still love them?

                                 ESCHER
                        Your wrists? Just as much as the 
                        first day in Siena.

                                 JETTA
                        Good.

           She lays her head in the crook of his neck.

                                 JETTA
                        You’re not done yet? With your 
                        brother?

                                 ESCHER
                        Not yet.

           They stand in silence a few moments together.

           LATER - NIGHT

           Rudolf on the couch, Berend paces, Escher hunched over his 
           drawing table. They’ve been here a while.

                                 ESCHER
                        Okay come here.

           Rudolf and Berend crowd behind Escher.

                                 ESCHER
                        We have three cities. Amsterdam, 
                        Haarlem, and Leiden.  

           Escher indicates three CITY MAPS on the table.

                                 ESCHER
                        Around twenty locations in each 
                        city that need to be changed. So we 
                        need a point A and a point B. And 
                        we need to communicate these two 
                        points to your operatives without 
                        tipping off the Germans if anyone 
                        gets captured.
                                 BEREND
                        Sounds about right.

                                 ESCHER
                        Right. So. If I create a repeating 
                        pattern like this...

           Escher shows a rough sketch of a repeating pattern drawing of 
           interlocking fish and birds.

                                 ESCHER
                        ...and I color one of the eyes red 
                        and one blue...

           Escher dabs red ink over the eye of one of the fish, and blue 
           ink over the eye of one of the birds.

                                 ESCHER
                        ...then when we line it up over a 
                        map, red equals the old location, 
                        blue is the new one.

           Rudolf considers.

                                 BEREND
                        How do you make the locations line 
                        up with their eyes. Is that easy?

                                 ESCHER
                             (grinning)
                        No it’s incredibly difficult.
                        And we’ll need an individual 
                        woodcut for every re-location.

           Escher goes to his record player and puts on BACH.

                                 BEREND
                        You’re going to make sixty woodcuts 
                        by tomorrow morning?!

                                 ESCHER
                        We are. Start cutting.

           Escher tosses a long BLOCK OF WOOD to Berend.

           As the MUSIC continues...

           MONTAGE - ESCHER, BEREND, AND RUDOLF WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT  

           - Berend cuts small blocks of wood. 

           - Escher uses a metal tool to carve details into the wood.  
           - Rudolf rolls ink onto individual blocks.

           - Escher perfectly lines up a block over a sheet of paper, 
           using a map as a guide.  

           - Escher applies red and blue ink to individual eyes, and we 
           realize that it’s...

           MORNING

           They’ve been at it all night.

           Rudolf rolls ink over a block of wood, but hardly any gets 
           transferred. He pours a jar of ink into a dish but only a few 
           drops come out.

                                 RUDOLF
                        We need more ink.

                                 BEREND
                        How many did we get through?

                                 ESCHER
                             (sighs)
                        Twenty-two.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jetta feeds the boys breakfast as Escher goes for the door.

                                 JETTA
                        Mauk!

           She rushes to the kitchen, grabs a piece of bread and hands 
           it to Escher.  

           He gives her a kiss and continues on his way.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DAY

           De Mesquita hands Escher a large jar of ink.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        When the stores run out of food, 
                        that we can live with. But they run 
                        out of ink? That’s just unbearable.

                                 ESCHER
                        I wish you could come see what I’m 
                        working on.
                                 DE MESQUITA
                        A new project?

                                 ESCHER
                        A special project - for the 
                        Resistance. Art with purpose.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        I can’t wait to hear more.

                                 ESCHER
                        For now just know that it will keep 
                        Rebecca safe.  

           Escher steps to the door, but pauses...

                                 ESCHER
                        What if I arranged for you to go 
                        into hiding too?  

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        I’m too old for all that.  
                             (off Escher’s concern)
                        Here’s how I see it. Every day is a 
                        game. If I wake up in my own bed 
                        then I win and the Nazis lose. 
                        Right now I’m on a winning streak 
                        and I plan to ride it as long as I 
                        can.  

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           BACH plays as Escher, Berend, and Rudolf continue making 
           prints.   

                                 RUDOLF
                        How many left?

                                 BEREND
                        Maybe thirty?

                                 RUDOLF
                        I’ll get them started on the first 
                        batch and we’ll do the rest 
                        tomorrow night.

           Rudolf leaves. Escher stands and stretches his back. Flexes 
           his cramped fingers. Gazes out the window.  

                                 ESCHER
                        How do they do it? Without getting 
                        caught.
                                 BEREND
                        However they can. Move in the dark. 
                        Avoid checkpoints. Go slow. 

                                 ESCHER
                        I can’t imagine.

                                 BEREND
                        Makes you happy to be here at home, 
                        making art, doesn’t it?

           Escher gazes out the window and the BACH MUSIC morphs into 
           Rudolf’s Musique pour l’esprit en deuil as he IMAGINES that 
           he sees...

           EXT. HAARLEM NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           ...across the street an invisible trapdoor opens from the 
           wall of the house and a RESISTANCE MAN (20s) steps out 
           cautiously before waving a MOTHER (30s) and DAUGHTER (9) to 
           join him. 

           They scurry over to the next house and hide behind a bush.  

           A GERMAN SOLDIER walks by, searching for them.  As he looks 
           in their direction, they turn sideways, revealing that 
           they’re two dimensional and flat - their profiles just 
           vertical lines that the Nazi fails to detect.

           Then they dart off and find themselves at the bottom of...

           A STAIRCASE. They rush up the steps. But the Nazi appears in 
           their path up ahead and spots them.  

           Before he can reach them, they slip to the...

           OTHER SIDE OF THE STAIRS. Standing upside down as if gravity 
           has been reversed - like in Escher’s print Relativity (1953). 

           The Nazi rushes to the spot he last saw them, and pauses 
           directly above them, confused, before continuing away down 
           the stairs.

           They sneak along the upside-down side of the stairs, and then 
           a SHOUT...

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Hey! Stop!

           ...and a SURREAL CHASE is on. They scurry along the upside 
           down stairs until they reach a ladder that they climb, and it 
           brings them into a...
           STRANGE WORLD OF CONVEX AND CONCAVE STAIRCASES

           They’re in a mind-bending space that resembles Escher’s 
           Convex and Concave (1955), rushing up and down warped stairs 
           and paths with paradoxical perspectives, always just steps 
           ahead of the German soldier until they climb up to...

           A ROOF 

           ...that looks like the infinity staircase in Escher’s 
           Ascending and Descending (1960). Round and round they go, 
           running “up” the infinity staircase with the soldier chasing 
           behind them, until the soldier stops for breath, and they 
           catch up to him from behind. But before he can turn and grab 
           them, they leap over a railing and land in a...

           STONE-LINED TUNNEL

           ...that extends ahead to a distant vanishing point. They rush 
           along the tunnel until they get to a ladder that they climb 
           in order to reach a...

           HOUSEHOLD HALLWAY

           ...where a trapdoor opens from the ceiling. The mother and 
           daughter rush up into an attic and the trapdoor closes behind 
           them just as the Nazi arrives.  

           The Resistance Man greets the Nazi with an innocent smile. 

           BLUE LIGHT fills the space as we pull up and away, until 
           we’re...

           ABOVE THE HOUSE in a suburban neighborhood. A BLUE DOT of 
           light covers the house.  

           We rise even further and see an entire map layout of a city 
           with more BLUE DOTS over other houses coming into view.

                                 BEREND (O.S.)
                        Mauk.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           Escher snaps out of it. The music returns to BACH from the 
           record player.  

                                 BEREND
                        We better get back to it.

           Escher gives a last look out the window before returning to 
           his desk.
           He compares a city MAP to a small DRAWING of interconnected 
           lizards. He places the city map carefully over the drawing. 
           The map has one RED DOT on it and one BLUE DOT.  

           We PUSH IN on the red dot until we’re overlooking a...

           EXT. HAARLEM NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           ...and we PUSH THROUGH the roof of one of the houses until 
           we’re...

           INT. INSIDE THE HOUSE - NIGHT

           ...where a RESISTANCE MAN (20s) takes a YOUNG WOMAN (teens) 
           by the hand and leads her to the front door.  

           She’s scared. They’re both scared. This is not the surreal 
           fantasy Escher just imagined. This feels more REAL.  

           The Man and Woman nervously step outside into the dark night.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           The Resistance Man and Young Woman creep along an alley. He 
           peers around a corner, and then...

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Hey! Stop!

           But there’s no chase. No music. No surreal illusions. The 
           soldiers descend upon the Resistance Man and BEAT HIM.

           One of the soldiers throws the woman aside. Her head CRACKS 
           against the wall and she falls to the ground.  

           The soldier looks down at her. Lifts his gun. Grins. BANG!

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           The same Resistance Man is badly beaten. Broken. A NAZI 
           INTERROGATOR has been doing the breaking for some time.  

           As Obergruppenführer Rauter enters, arm in a sling, the 
           Interrogator gives a tired Heil Hitler salute, then hands 
           something to Rauter. 

           It’s a DRAWING of interconnected lizards, birds, and fish, 
           all in black ink except for one dot of RED and one dot of 
           BLUE over two of the eyes.
           Off Rauter, considering...

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Escher asleep on the couch. Berend asleep on the workbench.  

           Jetta enters. Wrinkles her nose at a smell - and rolls her 
           eyes at the two cigarette butts in an ashtray.

           She sits beside Escher. Strokes his hair.

           He stirs. Recognizes her. Sees sadness in her smile.

                                 ESCHER
                        It’s done. We’re done. Don’t worry.

                                 JETTA
                        No more?

                                 ESCHER
                        No more. I promise.

           She breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 JETTA
                        Come. Eat some breakfast.

           But then, BANGING comes from below the open window.  

           She peeks outside and her face goes white.

           MORE BANGING. Escher joins her at the window and sees...

           A NAZI STAFF CAR parked out front. SOLDIERS knocking on his 
           front door below.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Open up!

           Escher and Jetta look at each other. Panic.

                                 BEREND (O.S.)
                        Stay here.

           Berend has woken - immediately poised and alert.  

                                 ESCHER
                        What do they --

                                 BEREND
                        Stay here!

           Berend disappears down the stairs.
           EXT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           A Nazi Soldier BANGS again before the door opens, revealing 
           Berend wearing an overly friendly smile.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER
                        Mr. Escher?

                                 BEREND
                        What can I do for you?

                                 NAZI SOLDIER
                        Come with us.

                                 BEREND
                        Happy to oblige.

           Escher and Jetta watch from the upstairs window as Berend is 
           handcuffed and loaded into the back of the Nazi Staff Car.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jetta watches expectantly as Escher hangs up the phone.

                                 ESCHER
                        I need to meet Rudolf.

           Escher grabs his coat and hurries to the door, but Jetta 
           clutches his arm.  

           No words. She just clings to him a moment.

           He kisses her and pulls her head against his chest in a tight 
           embrace. Then he disappears out the door.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Berend, tied to a chair.  

           A Nazi Interrogator rolls up his right sleeve. Punches Berend 
           in the face. Rolls up his left sleeve. He’s taking his time.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Escher walks cautiously. Alert. The Nazi presence in the 
           streets of Haarlem feels especially strong. 

           A TRUCK filled with Nazi soldiers zooms past Escher, barely 
           missing him.  
           Up ahead the truck stops. Soldiers leap out and begin setting 
           up a checkpoint.

           Escher lowers his head, turns down a side street, and picks 
           up his pace.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Escher and Rudolf sit in a dark corner of a mostly empty 
           coffee shop. Rudolf smokes a cigarette. Offers one to an 
           anxious-looking Escher.

                                 ESCHER
                        Okay, but it’s my last one.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Just this once let’s not wish for 
                        that. It sounds more ominous than 
                        you intend.  

           It takes Escher a moment before he smiles.

                                 RUDOLF
                        There you go. You can’t forget to 
                        smile. Even during the worst.

                                 ESCHER
                        Is that where we are now? In the 
                        worst?

                                 RUDOLF
                             (a smoky sigh)
                        We know he’s been arrested. But 
                        they thought he was you. So with 
                        any luck they’ll see it as a 
                        misunderstanding and let him go.  

                                 ESCHER
                        And the operation?

                                 RUDOLF
                        They caught wind pretty early and
                        cracked down right away. 
                        Checkpoints everywhere. Strict 
                        curfews. We had to suspend things.

                                 ESCHER
                        How many did we save?

                                 RUDOLF
                        A few.

           Escher reacts - only a few?!
                                 ESCHER
                        What about Rebecca?

           Rudolf shakes his head.

                                 ESCHER
                        You can still move her though, 
                        can’t you? Just her?

                                 RUDOLF
                        There’s nothing we can do now.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m not talking about a whole big 
                        operation. Just one girl.

                                 RUDOLF
                        All the roadways and waterways in 
                        and out of Amsterdam are choked 
                        off. It can’t be done.

                                 ESCHER
                        But you can still save her if you 
                        want to, can’t you? You must. 

           Rudolf frowns at his uncle. Appraises him.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Do you have a place you can hide?
                             (off Escher’s blank look)
                        They’ll be back for you. You can’t 
                        stay at home. You need to go 
                        somewhere.  

           Escher FIXATES on his coffee: a white WISP OF CREAM that 
           hasn’t yet blended with its dark surrounding slowly spins in 
           a gentle dance.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Uncle!  

           Escher is jolted back out.

                                 RUDOLF
                        You’ve always been a bit of a -- 
                        what do I want to say?
                             (thinks, starts over)
                        Sometimes while composing a piece, 
                        I’d live in that musical world. It 
                        would overtake me. Consume me. 
                        Wherever I looked I saw musical 
                        notes. Rhythms. Harmonies. Until I 
                        finished puzzling it all out. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUDOLF (CONT'D)
                        Only then would I truly be back in 
                        the regular world with everyone 
                        else. I suppose it’s the nature of 
                        being an artist. And you, well, 
                        let’s just say I always admired how 
                        much of an artist you allowed 
                        yourself to be. But we need you 
                        here now. Fully here. Your family 
                        needs you here. You’re in it now, 
                        and there’s no going back.  

           Off Escher, looking overwhelmed.

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           Rudolf and Escher leave the coffee shop together. A daze 
           remains in Escher’s eyes. But Rudolf is alert. He notices two 
           GERMAN MEN in suits across the street, staring - as if they 
           were waiting for him.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Stay with me.

           Escher, about to go his own way, follows his nephew in the 
           opposite direction, though he doesn’t yet know why. As they 
           walk along the street, the two German men follow.

           Escher sees Rudolf glance at the men before turning down a 
           side street.

                                 ESCHER
                        Are those men following us?

                                 RUDOLF
                        Stay calm.

           The German men round the corner behind them as Rudolf leads 
           them down another street.

           Escher grows more alarmed as they walk, frequently looking 
           back over his shoulder. He sees the men emerge from around 
           the corner behind them and pull out GUNS.

           Rudolf leads Escher around another corner, bringing them into 
           an empty alleyway. Escher realizes it’s a dead end, and his 
           panic rises.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Just stay calm.

           The German men round the corner into the alley. Trapping them 
           in. For a moment the four men stand facing each other.
                                 GERMAN MAN
                        Turn around.

           Rudolf slowly complies, showing his back to the men. But 
           Escher remains motionless.

           WHAP! One of the men pistol-whips Escher across the face, 
           spinning him onto the ground.

                                 GERMAN MAN
                        On your knees.

           Rudolf kneels. Remarkably calm. At peace.

           Escher, still wobbly, manages to get to his knees. BLOOD 
           starts to flow from a gash that has been opened on his brow.  

           A drop of blood falls onto the stone in front of Escher.  

           More drops follow, painting the stone red.

           Escher FIXATES on the blood. He reaches out and traces his 
           finger through it. Shaping it. Fashioning it into a pattern. 

           BANG! A gunshot - and a spray of blood is added to his canvas 
           from beside him.

           He CLOSES HIS EYES.

           BANG! A second shot.

           Escher opens his eyes. He’s still alive. He turns around and 
           sees that Rudolf is already on his feet, sprung into action, 
           next to Sophie who stands over the bodies of the two men, a 
           pistol in her hand.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        Quickly.

           Escher follows the two of them to the edge of the alley. 
           Rudolf peeks around the corner.  

           Sophie hands Escher a handkerchief, but he just clutches it. 

           She takes it back and wipes the blood from his face.

           They set off down the street together at a hurried, but 
           inconspicuous pace. When they reach a major intersection, 
           Rudolf turns to Escher.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Get into hiding and stay there. 
                        Good luck.
           Rudolf hugs Escher firmly. Then darts off, followed by 
           Sophie.  

           Escher, alone in the intersection, reaches up and touches the 
           gash on his forehead. Pulls his hand down. Sees bright fresh 
           blood on his fingers.  Looks around.  

           People and vehicles pass through the intersection in various 
           directions. Hardly anyone takes notice of Escher - just 
           another sad sight during a horrible war.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Berend. Bloody. Tied to a chair at a small table.  

           The Nazi Interrogator stands at attention with a Heil Hitler 
           salute as Rauter enters the room, arm in a sling.

           He takes his time removing a cigarette.

                                 RAUTER
                             (to Berend)
                        I am Obergruppenführer Hans Albin 
                        Rauter.
                             (to Interrogator)
                        His hands.

           The Interrogator unties Berend’s hands. Rauter sits down 
           across from Berend. Gives him a cigarette. Lights it.

                                 RAUTER
                        You are Berend George Escher.  
                        Professor of geology at Leiden 
                        University. Father of Rudolf 
                        Escher. Talented composer. Member 
                        of the Communist party. Known 
                        leader in the Dutch Resistance.

           Berend remains expressionless as he smokes his cigarette.

                                 RAUTER
                        That must be difficult for you, no?

                                 BEREND
                        Oh you know kids. Always rebelling.

                                 RAUTER
                        Brother to Mauritz Cornelis Escher.

                                 BEREND
                        Don’t let him hear you call him 
                        Mauritz. He prefers Mauk.

                        happy, call him M.C.

                                 RAUTER
                        I met your brother. Nice man. 
                        Talented artist.

                                 BEREND
                        He’d be pleased to hear you say 
                        that. How did you come to meet? 

           Rauter grins.

                                 RAUTER
                        Why did you pass yourself off as 
                        your brother?

                                 BEREND
                        I didn’t.

                                 RAUTER
                        Were you protecting him?   

                                 BEREND
                        Your soldiers called me “Mr. 
                        Escher,” which I am. And told me to 
                        come with them, which I did.

                                 RAUTER
                        You must have known they were there 
                        for the Mr. Escher who lived there.

                                 BEREND
                        It crossed my mind. Yes. But if a 
                        Nazi with a gun tells me to do 
                        something, I do it. I don’t presume 
                        to know what he wants better than 
                        he does.

           Rauter takes a moment to appraise Berend. Smiles. Takes out a 
           piece of paper and unfolds it on the table: it’s a repeating 
           pattern drawing of lizards, birds, and fish.

           Rauter waits in silence. Cold eyes stare knowingly. Berend 
           realizes it’s on him to speak next...

                                 BEREND
                        You are a fan of his, aren’t you.

                                 RAUTER
                        In the past twenty-four hours we’ve 
                        apprehended several Resistance 
                        members, each with a drawing of 
                        your brother’s.
                                 BEREND
                        I guess my brother has many fans.

           Rauter waits for a better answer.

                                 BEREND
                        You know those aren’t real 
                        drawings. Well obviously they’re 
                        real, but a man with your eye must 
                        see that they’re rushed. Sloppy.  

                                 RAUTER
                        Your point?

                                 BEREND
                        It’s a publicity stunt. He gave 
                        these out to as many people as 
                        possible to promote his work. 
                        Shameless if you ask me. I’m not 
                        surprised you’re finding them in 
                        everyone’s pockets.

           INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Rauter eyes Berend through a one-way mirror as he speaks with 
           his Subordinate Officer.

                                 OFFICER
                        He’s lying.

                                 RAUTER
                        He’s good. We may have arrested the 
                        right Escher brother after all.

           INT. ESCHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jetta patches up the gash on Escher’s face, while George, 
           Arthur, and Jan crowd around.

                                 ESCHER
                             (to George and Arthur)
                        You’ll need to be excessively 
                        cautious.

                                 JAN
                        I don’t want you to go.

                                 ESCHER
                        I know, but I have to.

                                 JAN
                        Are you scared?
                                 ESCHER
                        Yes.

                                 JAN
                        That’s okay. Just pretend a giant 
                        rhinoceros is with you. He’ll keep 
                        you safe.

           Escher hugs Jan tightly.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Jetta, shell-shocked, watches as Escher, a fresh bandage over 
           his eye, points at an open drawer.

                                 ESCHER
                        And in this drawer are the account 
                        numbers. And my address book.  

           She pulls him into a tight hug.

           They hold each other. Fear. Love. Tears.

           Over in the corner sits an unfinished sketch of Escher’s 
           optimist and pessimist. We PUSH IN on the pessimist, who 
           becomes...

           EXT. HAARLEM STREETS - DAY

           ...Escher walking hunched over along the street. Dour. 
           Hopeless.

           He walks past the Flower Shop. It’s closed. Boarded up. 
           Broken glass where the display window once stood. A large red 
           SWASTIKA painted on the door.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S KITCHEN - DAY

           De Mesquita opens his back door to find Escher holding a 
           small satchel.  

                                 ESCHER
                        I need a place to hide.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        That’s our specialty.
           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           De Mesquita lifts a bottle of brandy and sees there’s very 
           little left. He splits it between four glasses and doles them 
           out to Escher, Elisabeth, and Jaap. 

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        To life.

                                 ESCHER AND ELISABETH
                        To life.

           They all drink except Jaap, who stares off, paying little 
           attention.

                                 ELISABETH
                        It’s quite an incredible thing you 
                        all did, trying to re-locate 
                        everyone like that.  

                                 ESCHER
                        But we failed.

                                 JAAP
                        You should have moved Rebecca 
                        first.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Jaap.

                                 JAAP
                        Then she’d be safe now.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Or she’d be caught.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Are you sure they know where she 
                        is?

                                 ESCHER
                        I don’t know.  

                                 ELISABETH
                        So she might be fine?

                                 ESCHER
                        She might.

           Escher’s tone rings untrue, so he continues with less sugar-
           coating:
                                 ESCHER
                        My nephew thinks all the locations 
                        are compromised. And that the Nazis 
                        will start raiding them tomorrow.

                                 ELISABETH
                        The poor thing.

           Silence... broken when Elisabeth notices De Mesquita’s face.

                                 ELISABETH
                        Oh Samuel.

           De Mesquita is weeping - quietly and inconspicuously - 
           struggling to tamper his emotions. But getting spotted by the 
           others only opens the floodgates.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        Excuse me.

           He hastily leaves to the kitchen, followed by Elisabeth.

           Jaap glares at Escher. Then gulps downs his glass of brandy 
           and retreats up the stairs.

           Escher looks toward the kitchen and sees De Mesquita and 
           Elisabeth, framed by the doorway, crying in each other’s 
           arms, lit by two Sabbath candles burning low.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S STUDIO - NIGHT

           On the wall: the PRINT of a man and woman huddled together in 
           a crowd of strange faces.

           Escher stares at the print.  

           A SPARKLE OF LIGHT reflects off a TEAR that forms in the 
           man’s eye and slowly slides down his face.

           Escher goes to the desk. Finds paper and a pencil. Begins 
           sketching. Focused. Determined. 

           The SKETCH starts to take shape - lines and curves.  

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Jetta, alone in Escher’s studio. Wandering around by candle-
           light in her husband’s private sanctum. Missing him.

           She searches through a portfolio of old drawings. The outside 
           of the portfolio is labeled “Siena.”
           She finally finds what she’s looking for. Pulls it from the 
           others. Brings it over to the couch and sits with it. Stares 
           at it. Gets lost in it - letting it take her somewhere else.

           REVEAL: it’s a pencil sketch of two female arms resting on a 
           table. The slender WRISTS are the focus. Her wrists.

           INT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           De Mesquita sits at the table staring at a piece of paper.

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        It’s mad. Extraordinarily clever. 
                        But mad.

                                 ESCHER
                        Do you think it can work?

           De Mesquita passes the paper back to Escher

                                 DE MESQUITA
                        You don’t need to do this.

                                 ESCHER
                        It’s me or no one.

           Escher folds the PAPER and slides it into his coat pocket.

                                 ESCHER
                        I see a way to save a life. Even if 
                        the odds are damn near impossible. 
                        As long as there is one, 
                        infinitesimal chance, it’s a puzzle 
                        with a solution. Difficult puzzles 
                        are my specialty.

                                 DE MESQUITA 
                        I don’t know. I just don’t know.

                                 ESCHER
                        I do.

           EXT. DE MESQUITA’S SHED - NIGHT

           Escher pulls a bicycle from the shed. 

           He looks back one last time. Sees De Mesquita and Elisabeth, 
           huddled together in the doorway.

           A bittersweet smile. Then Escher rides off.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS BETWEEN HAARLEM AND AMSTERDAM - NIGHT

           Escher pedals in the dark, lit only by the moon.

           Up ahead, CAR HEADLIGHTS.

           He brakes and scurries to the side of the road. Stashes the 
           bicycle behind a bush. Crouches low. Waits for the car to 
           pass. Then re-emerges and continues his journey.

           EXT. NEAR CHECKPOINT OUTSIDE OF AMSTERDAM - NIGHT

           Escher surveys a checkpoint up ahead that stands on a bridge 
           between him and Amsterdam. He sees similar checkpoints on 
           similar bridges in either direction.   

           He thinks. Unsure.  

           Then he lifts a large rock and bashes it against the wheel of 
           the bicycle, bending the frame.

           He uses the rock to scrape a hole in the knee of his pants 
           and spreads dirt all over his clothes

           EXT. AT THE CHECKPOINT - NIGHT 

           Two GERMAN SOLDIERS lift their guns as Escher approaches 
           carrying the bicycle.

                                 ESCHER
                        I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        What are you doing?

                                 ESCHER
                        I know there’s a curfew, but I was 
                        riding in the country and busted my 
                        bike. I had to walk the whole way.

           He points out the damaged tire.   

           One of the soldiers frisks Escher and finds the folded PAPER 
           in Escher’s pocket.  

           He unfolds it. Looks at it. Takes it to the other soldier who 
           pulls out ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER - one of Escher’s repeating 
           pattern drawings.

           The soldiers look back and forth between the two pieces of 
           paper, comparing them.
           Escher waits nervously.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Go ahead, hurry home.

           He hands Escher’s paper back and waves him on.

           Escher hurries past the checkpoint, onto the bridge.  

           He pauses in the middle. Glances down at the paper. Allows 
           himself a tiny, relieved smile.  Then folds the paper, puts 
           it back in his pocket, and continues across the bridge 
           carrying the bicycle.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET ALONG THE CANAL - NIGHT

           Escher stashes the bicycle against a building, then continues 
           down a stone street that lines the canal.

           He pauses and looks both ways before hurrying down the steps 
           to the Cellar Bar that he visited with Berend earlier.

           He knocks lightly and waits.

           He knocks again, a bit louder. Waits.

           Looks around.

           Goes to knock again but stops when he hears footsteps on the 
           other side of the door.  

           A beat.

                                 ESCHER
                             (whispers)
                        I’m Rudolf’s uncle. Please let me 
                        in. Please.

           The door opens - Sophie appears through the crack.

                                 SOPHIE
                        C’mon then. Hurry.

           Escher slides inside.

           INT. CELLAR BAR - NIGHT

           Escher looks around the dark, empty room as Sophie puts away 
           a PISTOL behind the bar.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        You shouldn’t have come here.  
                                 ESCHER
                        Is he here?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who?

                                 ESCHER
                        Rudolf.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No.  

                                 ESCHER
                        Do you know where he is?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Of course not. Everyone’s in 
                        hiding. You should be too.

           Escher collapses in a booth, despondent.  

           Perhaps out of pity, or curiosity, she grabs a bottle and two 
           small glasses and sits opposite him. Pours.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You have a place to stay?

                                 ESCHER
                        In Haarlem. I don’t know how I’ll 
                        get back.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You came from Haarlem? How?

                                 ESCHER
                        By bike.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You rode a bike from Haarlem.

           He nods.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How’d you get past the checkpoint?

                                 ESCHER
                        Banged up the wheel, told them I 
                        had an accident.

           Sophie nods, impressed. She lifts her glass. He clinks it 
           with his and they drink.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What do you want with Rudolf?
                                 ESCHER
                        Rebecca. The little girl. You 
                        remember her?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Of course.

                                 ESCHER
                        I have a plan. To move her.  

           Unseen by Escher, Rudolf enters from the back area and starts 
           listening in.

                                 SOPHIE
                             (skeptical)
                        You have a plan.

                                 ESCHER
                        I have to save her. I need to try. 
                        Even if it seems pointless to you. 
                        I just need to know where she’s 
                        hiding and I need help gathering a 
                        few supplies, but I’ll take the 
                        risk myself. Please. I can’t just 
                        sit by.  

           She shakes her head, surprised, marveling at his conviction. 
           But he misinterprets it.

                                 ESCHER
                        I -- I know I don’t belong here...

                                 SOPHIE
                        No?

           Sophie raises her eyebrows at Rudolf as Escher continues 
           unaware.

                                 ESCHER
                        ...but that’s why it shouldn’t 
                        matter to the Resistance if I fail. 
                        I wish I could just tell him my 
                        plan because I feel like if he 
                        heard it, then --

                                 RUDOLF
                        Uncle Mauk.  

           Escher turns and sees Rudolf behind him.  

                                 RUDOLF
                             (grins)
                        You look like you’ve seen a ghost. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUDOLF (CONT'D)
                        Let’s hear this plan of yours, 
                        shall we?

           INT. BOOKSHELF-LINED NOOK - NIGHT

           Escher follows Rudolf over to the wall where the secret 
           passageway through the bookshelves lies open.

           Rudolf picks up a candle and enters the passage.

           With Sophie behind him, Escher takes a deep breath and 
           follows, into the...

           SECRET PASSAGEWAY

           ...down stone steps, to a large wooden door. Rudolf knocks 
           twice, and a moment later the door opens to reveal a...

           INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           It feels like a military operations center. LARGE MAPS on the 
           walls. A RADIO communications set-up. A series of COTS in the 
           back where a handful of RESISTANCE MEMBERS (male and female, 
           20s-40s) are resting.    

           Escher takes it all in.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Welcome to the Resistance.

           LATER

           Escher, Rudolf, and Sophie sit together at a table.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        They’re stopping and searching any 
                        boat that could be hiding anything. 

                                 ESCHER
                             (excited)
                        Ah, yes. Exactly. And how do you 
                        hide something if you can’t hide 
                        anything?

           Escher takes out the piece of PAPER and lays it on the table. 
           It looks like a design for some sort of rowboat.

           We PUSH IN on the SKETCH OF THE ROWBOAT until it becomes...
           EXT. AMSTERDAM CANAL - NIGHT

           ...a SMALL ROWBOAT floating in the dark water.

           We hear them before we see them - Escher and Rudolf swimming 
           slowly toward the boat, heads bobbing just above the water.

           They untie the boat and, as quietly as possible, lead it back 
           across the canal where Sophie is waiting at the opening of a 
           STONE PASSAGE in the side of the canal wall.

           INT. STONE PASSAGE - NIGHT

           Sophie leads the way by candlelight, followed by Rudolf and 
           Escher carrying the rowboat along the passage.  

           INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The rowboat sits in the middle of the room.

           A buzz of activity as Rudolf, Sophie, and various other 
           Resistance Members carry out different jobs. Some saw. Some 
           sand. Some stain wood.  

           Escher, hair still damp from the canal, orchestrates the 
           activity like the foreman of a building site.

           INT. STONE PASSAGE - MORNING

           Rudolf and Escher carry the boat along the stone passage.

           They get to a metal door and open it, revealing the first 
           rays of the MORNING SUN.  

           They lower the boat into the water of the...

           EXT. AMSTERDAM CANAL - MORNING

           The morning sunlight SPARKLES over the water as Amsterdam 
           starts its day with a trickling of boat traffic.

           Rudolf stands perched in the stone passageway over Escher who 
           sits in the rowboat.  

                                 RUDOLF
                        You know where you’re going?

                                 ESCHER
                        Yes.
                                 RUDOLF
                        Because I can draw you a map of 
                        lizards and frogs.

                                 ESCHER
                             (grins)
                        Thank you Rudolf.

                                 RUDOLF
                        Good luck.

           Escher casts off, rowing the small empty wooden boat out into 
           the canal as Rudolf closes the metal door with a low CREAK.

           And with that... Escher is alone. A few morning birds. The 
           SWISH of his oars cutting into the water.  

           It’s peaceful. Quiet.  

           EXT. AMSTERDAM CANALS - DAY

           Escher gets to an intersection in the waterway. Looks around 
           to get his bearings. Turns in one of the directions.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM CANALS - DAY

           Escher finishes tying the boat to a small dock on the side of 
           the canal, then climbs a stone stairway up to the street.

           He checks the house numbers as he walks, searching for the 
           right one.  

           He tries to act calm as he passes a few GERMAN SOLDIERS.

           Finally he spots the house he’s looking for. Looks around, 
           waits until the coast is clear, takes a deep breath and 
           approaches the front door.  

           INT. HIDING PLACE - DAY

           Rebecca’s small hiding room is much as we last saw it. But 
           the flowers have long since withered, and several of the 
           books are strewn about.

           And Rebecca is skinnier. Paler. Ungroomed.

           A CREAK of the trapdoor. Escher climbs down into the space.

           Rebecca looks at him with curiosity, and he tries to hide how 
           awful he finds her situation.
           He kneels next to her. Squeezes her in a gentle hug. Sees a 
           pile of DRAWINGS in the corner.

                                 ESCHER
                        You brave girl.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS ALONG THE CANAL - DAY

           Escher eyes his surroundings warily as he walks hand-in-hand 
           with Rebecca along the canal - quickly but not rushed.

           They go down the stone steps to where the boat’s tied up.

                                 ESCHER
                        Are you ready to go somewhere 
                        impossible?

           EXT. AMSTERDAM CANALS - DAY

           The canals are busier and more crowded than earlier.

           Nazi patrols scan the water traffic. Some of the larger boats 
           have been called over to the sides for inspection.  

           In the midst of it all, Escher paddles along in an EMPTY 
           ROWBOAT. The Nazis don’t give him a second look.

           Escher takes a turn away from the center of Amsterdam and 
           approaches a large WATER LOCK - the gateway that separates 
           the canals of Amsterdam from the larger waterway beyond.

           A CHECKPOINT is set up at the water lock, with a few boats 
           lined up in front of Escher.

           He watches nervously as a GERMAN SOLDIER boards the boat in 
           front of him, searching compartments and opening boxes.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Papers.

           Escher FLINCHES - unaware that a second SOLDIER had 
           approached. He quickly hands over his papers.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Where are you headed?

                                 ESCHER
                        Haarlem.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        In that?
                                 ESCHER
                        I know. It’ll take a while.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        The war might be over by the time 
                        you get there.

           Over the above conversation, we slowly shift our angle until 
           we see that the emptiness of the boat is an OPTICAL ILLUSION.  

           From a lower angle we see Rebecca hiding beneath a thin plank 
           of wood designed to appear like an empty space when viewed 
           from above.

           The soldier takes a moment to review Escher’s papers.

           A BLACK BIRD lands on the edge of the boat and stares at 
           Escher, then hops down onto the hidden compartment, ruining 
           the illusion - seemingly WALKING ON AIR!

           Escher tries to shoo the bird without raising the Soldier’s 
           attention, but the bird just looks up at him curiously.

           Finally, just before the soldier turns his attention back to 
           Escher, the bird hops back up to the edge of the boat.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Good luck.  
                             (makes a rowing gesture)
                        I hope your arms can take it.

           He laughs and hands back Escher’s papers, then continues on 
           to the next boat.

           Escher breathes a sigh of relief.  

           As he lifts his oars and starts rowing, the BIRD takes off.

           We follow the bird up into the...

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           ...where it’s joined by a flock of BLACK BIRDS all flying 
           together in a triangular formation.  

           Before our eyes, reminiscent of Escher’s Day and Night, the 
           spaces between the black birds morph into WHITE BIRDS flying 
           in the opposite direction with the black birds becoming a 
           dark sky in the background.  

           One of the white birds breaks off from the rest and flies 
           down until we’re in a...
           EXT. HAARLEM NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK

           ...in the Jewish Quarter, approaching De Mesquita’s house.  

           The bird lands on a DRAWING lying on the ground. Several 
           other drawings blow in the wind along the street.

                                 ESCHER
                        They’ll be so excited to see you.

           Escher leads Rebecca toward the house and notices one of the 
           drawings. He picks it up. Recognizes it as De Mesquita’s.  

           He notices the other drawings blowing around.  

           He rushes to De Mesquita’s house and stops when he sees the 
           front door. Wide open. Broken from its hinges.

           INT./EXT. DE MESQUITA’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Escher runs through the house, searching for any sign of his 
           friends.

                                 ESCHER
                        Samuel!

           The place is in disarray. Furniture turned over, valuables 
           ransacked. Broken glass. De Mesquita’s drawings are strewn 
           about everywhere, fluttering around from gusts of wind.

                                 ESCHER
                        Samuel! Elisabeth! Jaap!

           He frantically searches every room. Clinging to desperate 
           hope. But he slowly accepts it - they’re gone.  

           He returns to the front doorway, where Rebecca waits for him.

                                 REBECCA
                        They’re gone?

           He nods.  

                                 REBECCA
                        Why?

           He sits on the stoop and shakes his head. In a daze. He 
           stares at the empty street. All is still except for a few 
           drawings, fluttering in the wind.

           A drawing blows past and lands at her feet. She tries to grab 
           it, but the wind pushes it just out of reach.  
           She chases it, but it keeps blowing away just before she can 
           grab it, until she finally outsmarts the wind and snatches it 
           up.  

           She returns to Escher and he takes the drawing from her. It’s 
           De Mesquita’s print of a man and a woman huddled together in 
           a crowd of strange faces, but now it has a large Nazi BOOT 
           PRINT covering it.

           TEARS fill his eyes as he stares at it.

                                 REBECCA
                        Do I have to go back? To the 
                        cellar?

           There’s a quiet strength in Rebecca’s innocent eyes. After 
           all this, she’s preparing herself to go back into hiding. It 
           melts Escher’s heart.

                                 ESCHER
                        No dear. You’ll stay with me from 
                        now on. I’ll keep you safe.

           INT. ESCHER’S STUDIO - DAY

           CRACKLING as Escher rolls black ink onto a block of wood.   

           SUPER: “Two months later”

           He carefully lowers a white sheet of paper over the ink-
           covered wood until it sits perfectly on top.

           Jan and Rebecca watch closely as he rubs a small IVORY SPOON 
           over the paper in small circular motions.

                                 ESCHER
                        Are you ready to see what’s hiding 
                        on the other side?

                                 REBECCA AND JAN
                        Yes.

           Escher slowly peels the paper away from the wooden block 
           revealing his finished version of Encounter (1944): 

           The familiar two-dimensional pattern of interlocking 
           optimists and pessimists, but with three-dimensional versions 
           breaking free of the background and marching in a line until 
           they meet in the middle where one optimist and one pessimist 
           shake each other’s hand.
                                 ESCHER
                        You see back here they serve as 
                        each other’s backgrounds. They 
                        can’t exist at the same time. But 
                        up here they’ve broken free of 
                        their flat existence to march in a 
                        circle until they meet each other 
                        up here.

                                 JAN
                        I’m glad they met each other.

                                 REBECCA
                        This one reminds me of you.

           She points at the optimist.  

                                 JAN
                        Why are they walking in a circle?

                                 ESCHER
                        You know the magical thing about a 
                        circle? It ends where it starts. Or 
                        does it start where it ends?

           Something STRANGE happens. We PAN over until Rebecca is no 
           longer in frame and we find ourselves back in the first scene 
           of the film.

                                 ESCHER
                        Well now, shall we do another?

           Jan nods excitedly as Escher secures a carved BLOCK OF WOOD 
           in a clamp. Watching Escher work is pure magic for the 
           curious boy. 

           Escher rolls black ink onto the block with a CRACKLING SOUND.

                                 ESCHER
                        Remember, Jan, art is nothing but 
                        an illusion. What does this black 
                        ink look like?

           As the opening scene continues to unfold exactly as we 
           remember it, something EVEN WEIRDER happens. We PULL OUT and 
           see the CAMERAS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT filming the first 
           scene. We see the set for what it is... unmasking the movie 
           magic so it’s self-evident.  

           The scene continues under the following TITLE SEQUENCE:

           - “This film is an illusion.” 

           - “But the following is real.”
           - “Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita, his wife Elisabeth, and his 
           son Jaap were sent to Auschwitz and murdered by the Nazis in 
           February of 1944.”

           - “Berend Escher was eventually released by the Nazis and 
           went into hiding until the end of the war.”

           - “Obergruppenführer Hanns Albin Rauter was found guilty of 
           war crimes and sentenced to death in 1949.”

           - “The Dutch Resistance helped over 300,000 people hide from 
           the Nazis. Even with the help of the Resistance, 75% of all 
           Dutch Jews were killed in the Holocaust.”  

           A SERIES OF ESCHER’S MOST RECOGNIZABLE WORKS along with the 
           following TITLES:

           - “M.C. Escher was one of the world’s most famous graphic 
           artists. His most popular creations explored themes of 
           opposites, illusions, and paradoxes. His art continues to 
           amaze millions of people all over the world. He died in 1972 
           at the age of 73.”

           BACK IN ESCHER’S STUDIO 

           We move toward the wall where we find De Mesquita’s drawing. 
           A man and a woman, huddled close together, surrounded by a 
           crowd of strange faces - the stain of a Nazi boot print 
           stamped over them.   

           TITLE: “He kept his mentor’s drawing in his studio for the 
           rest of his life, never removing the Nazi boot print.”

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
