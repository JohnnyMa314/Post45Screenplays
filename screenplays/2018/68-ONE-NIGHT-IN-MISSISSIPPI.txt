                        Based on, "One Night in Mississippi"
                               By Craig Shreve  
           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- DIRT ROAD/FOREST -- NIGHT 1964

           The moon glows upon the face of GRADEN WILLIAMS, 17, a black 
           youth in final withdrawal from childhood, not yet a full-
           fledged man. 

           He’s tall for his age, wearing a bit-too-short khakis and a 
           worn, button down shirt. His facial features are joyful; wise 
           mien, with a naturally open presence.

           We remain tight on him as he moves slowly, stopping, then 
           moving again. It’s as if he’s waiting for something or 
           someone.

           He is passing through the forest of maple, hickory, and oak 
           changing in colors. Wind is BLOWING. With each FOOTSTEP there 
           is a CRUNCHING of leaves. He is unaware that... 

           A lone speck of light grows behind him through the darkness. 

           The CAR ENGINE HUM meets Graden’s senses. Alerted, he looks 
           over his shoulder. 

           The growing light separates into two beams which zero in on 
           Graden’s figure. 

           He turns back and takes a sharp breath as he now fully 
           anticipates the situation. 

           Beat.

           Graden scans the forest, considers running... but stays put. 
           He bends his head and walks quickly forward, continuing on 
           the main road. 

           An ENGINE and COUNTRY MUSIC rises and falls away. Only to 
           rise once again as if it were next to him. 

           Graden barely glances toward the road. 

           A car BREAKS and doors OPEN. FOOTSTEPS.

           Graden stops.

           Remaining focused on Graden. The MEN from the CAR are mere 
           voices, sounds - gradually moving closer.

                                 MAN #1 -PATRICK OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Stay in back, Earl.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        How ya doin’ son?

           Graden’s eyes lower.
           Leaves CRUNCHING underfoot.

           In shallow focus - seeing movement of figures and only 
           glimpses of bodies when adjacent to Graden. The back of MAN 
           #1 and the arm/side of MAN #2.

                                 GRADEN
                        I’m doing good, sir.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        What are you doing out here at this 
                        time?

                                 GRADEN
                        Walking, sir.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        “Walking.” Don’t look like you was 
                        walking. Looks like you was 
                        standing there...

                                 GRADEN
                        Just resting for a minute, sir.

           Graden’s calm is an effort.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        What’s your name, son?

                                 GRADEN
                        Graden Williams.

                                 MAN #1 - PATRICK OLSEN (O.S.)
                        I know this boy. I’m mighty 
                        surprised you all don’t. This here 
                        is the famous Graden Williams! 

           ENGINES can be heard of additional vehicles pulling in.

           Graden’s eyes dart. 

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        Where you off to?

                                 GRADEN
                        I’m off to fetch my brother from up 
                        the road, sir. He’s with some 
                        friends.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        So you know this boy?

                                 MAN #1 - PATRICK OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Hell ya, like I said, he’s famous.
                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        On account of what?

                                 MAN #1 - PATRICK OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Cause he’s almost white. The way I 
                        hear it, our boy Graden is just 
                        about the smartest Negro in all the 
                        county and the next one too.

           Quiet CHATTER behind Graden - near the additional vehicles.

           FOOTSTEPS moving in Graden’s direction. They belong to... 

           EARL, 16, stuck between boyhood and manhood, shares a frame 
           with Graden - we fully see Earl.

                                 EARL 
                   (Quietly)
                        They said to bring him.

           Fear takes hold of Graden - he stares out into the dense 
           trees and tall grass. 

                                 MAN #1 - PATRICK OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Why don’t you get in the car, son? 
                        We’ll give you a ride up to that 
                        brother of yours...

                                 GRADEN 
                        I thank you, sir, but it’s a 
                        pleasant night and I’d rather walk.

           MAN #2 reaches out and grabs hold of Graden’s upper arm.

                                 MAN #2 - MARTY BAVON (O.S.)
                        Get in the car, boy.

           Graden exits the frame. 

           Earl steps forward and stares out into the forest, just like 
           Graden did moments before...

           EXT. FOREST

           Languidly pan across the forest. 

           A car door SLAMS.

           Cars MOTORS HUM driving away.

           The pan continues out onto...
           EXT. DIRT ROAD/FOREST

           Three cars speeding off in the distance. The rear end of a 
           Studebaker is the last in the line.

                                   CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- SHACK -- DAY

           A weather beaten, four room shack with a sloped porch sits 
           next to a cut-for-winter cotton field. A newly built, plain, 
           wooden coffin stands upright on the front porch.

           A Dodge panel wagon pulls in and parks on a patch of dirt. 
           Two WHITE MEN retrieve from the back a green tarp roll 
           bundled in twine. They let it drop to the ground.

           The grief stricken WILLIAMS FAMILY gather on the porch: 

           WARREN, 21, and his sisters, ETTA, 19, and GLENDA, 22, PAPA, 
           40s, and MAMA, 40s, exit with PASTOR LONNY, 60s, at their 
           side. AUNTS, UNCLES, and COUSINS follow soon after. 

           Papa, whose face is dark and wrinkled, solemnly meets the 
           White Men halfway.

                                 WHITE MEN 
                        Sign here to accept the body of 
                        Graden Williams.

           A clipboard is shoved in front of Papa, accompanied by a pen. 
           Papa’s arms reveal visible scars covering the length of them. 
           His swollen, work hand shakes as he lifts the pen and 
           scribbles a nonsensical line. 

           Warren walks across the dirt yard. He stands above the tarp-
           shrouded figure. He clenches his hands. His right bandaged 
           and taped - tucked into a ball.

           The White Man yanks the clipboard from Papa’s grasp. And the 
           White Men return to the vehicle as carefree as they came.

           They call out the window as the wagon pulls away...

                                 WHITE MEN (CONT’D)
                        Y’all return that tarp and twine!

           Warren and Papa carry the body toward the shack. Warren’s 
           arms awkwardly wrap around the tarp - the injured hand flaps 
           about - unable to be of real assistance.
           INT. SHACK -- GRADEN AND WARREN’S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren and Papa place the body with care on top of an 
           awaiting plank that lies upon one of two rickety beds located 
           in the spartan bedroom. A lantern and school books are 
           scattered across a wooden desk. 

           Mama, Etta, and Glenda enter with buckets of water, soap, 
           cloth, fresh clothes, and a comb.

           INSERT: A composition notebook sits on top. Handwritten on 
           the front reads: GRADEN WILLIAMS

           Warren attempts to gently remove the twine. His maimed hand 
           unable to help get the job done. The more he fails, the 
           harder he tries. 

           Papa approaches...

           Warren steps back, letting him take over.

           The ladies join in and the tarp is unwrapped.

           All eyes try to digest this form that lies before them that 
           once was their brother, their son. Once a boy... turning into 
           a man... This was Graden.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           - Glenda, steely-eyed, moves forward with water and cloth.

           - Mama digs her nails into her upper arms.

           - Tears well in Etta’s eyes -- she wipes them away quickly.

           - A cloth wipes the body - mud and blood rung into water.

           - Debris cleaned from knotted hair.

           - Soiled, broken nails on Graden’s body.

           - A pillbug crawls across the clavicle. A hand removes it. 

           - The unseen hand reaches out a window and releases the 
           pillbug. Once pulled back we find it belongs to Etta. 

           She turns. Warren is watching her.

           INT. MISSISSIPPI -- SHACK -- NIGHT

           Warren rises from the floor. He steps over bodies of family 
           members locked together in their sleep.
           Someone’s SNORING. A random COUGH.

           He passes...

           INT. GRADEN AND WARREN’S BEDROOM     

           Pastor Lonny sitting on Warren’s bed - silently reading the 
           bible. The pine casket is set on the other bed. Graden’s bed.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SHACK -- MOMENTS LATER  

           Warren steps outside. Glenda and Etta sit on the front porch, 
           legs hanging over the side. 

                                 ETTA
                        Couldn’t sleep?

           Warren shakes his head.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        We couldn’t either. When will they 
                        go and get those men?

                                 GLENDA
                        When the law gets good and ready. 
                        Or maybe never. That’s when. 

                                 ETTA
                        I just want this to be over. They 
                        always take the best of us.

                                 GLENDA
                        You’re right about that!

           Glenda abruptly stands and reenters into the shack.

                                 ETTA
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean nothing by 
                        it. Don’t let her bother you.

           Etta hugs Warren. He doesn’t hug back. She lets go.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s all right. Can’t be hurt by 
                        what’s true.

           Warren steps away from Etta and stands alone.

           THE PRESENT -- FORTY FOUR YEARS LATER -- 2008
           INT. DETROIT, APARTMENT -- MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

           Morning light seeps into the room, revealing decrepit, 
           yellowed walls and water stained ceilings. 

           It’s a relatively bare apartment with exception of a wrought 
           iron coffee table, a brown love seat, and a faux leather 
           recliner with foam erupting from the cracks. Warren sleeps 
           there...

           The PHONE RINGS.

           The neighbor POUNDS the wall in protest. 

           The RINGING continues.

           Warren awakens he moves into the kitchen. 

           INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

           The kitchen wall is covered with reminders; some are readable 
           notes: “Check ALL BILLS on 1st of the month,” and “I Am 
           Warren Williams,” while other notes are illegible. 

           On an adjacent wall, an oversized calendar hangs next to a 
           pull calendar. 

           On the refrigerator are names, addresses and phone numbers: 
           “JOB - Lafayette foods - 1565 E. Lafayette - 555-1212.”

           A packed box containing folders and notebooks sit on top the 
           refrigerator.

           Warren glances at the notes around him - familiarizing 
           himself. 

           He picks up the phone.

           We get a closer look at his disfigured right hand; the thumb 
           and forefinger are partial nubs with the remaining digits 
           atrophied together in a knotted hook. A dark scar runs down 
           the middle of the hand.

                                 WARREN
                        Yes, this is Warren Williams.

           He listens, then...

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        You’re mistaken. They’ve all been 
                        arrested. 

           He listens. A beat.
                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        It can’t be... he’s dead.

           Warren looses his footing. He steadies himself against a 
           chair. He sits down. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Say that again?

           He writes with a sharpie on a Post it:

           “Woman with no name 555-602-6272.”

           INT/EXT. DETROIT -- LAFAYETTE FOODS -- DAY

           Dreary, overcast days are a constant this time of year.

           Warren pulls his green Explorer into a parking space. He and 
           the car both have aged: grey hair, cracked windshield. A 
           balding man, chipped paint. 

           He sits in the parked vehicle, wearing a work uniform. His 
           hands clasp the wheel. Grounding him. 

           A random mix of notes and reminders of different shapes and 
           sizes cover the dashboard of the vehicle.

           He stares at the center of the wheel where a Post it sits:

           “Woman with no name 555-602-6272.”

           An adjacent note reads:

           “Must Remember.” 

           With an arrow drawn, pointing to the phone number.

                                 RADIO COMMENTATOR
                        Senator Barack Obama has pulled 
                        ahead of Hillary Clinton in the 
                        race for the Democratic Party’s 
                        presidential nomination after 
                        winning Maryland, Virginia and 
                        Washington D.C. The Illinois 
                        senator has set out plans to revive 
                        the economy in an attempt to 
                        counter criticism that his campaign 
                        is too strong on rhetoric and too 
                        weak on detail. 

           ALBERTO, late 20’s, has an afro-latino thing about him. He 
           clears grocery carts in the lot, wearing headphones with a 
           confident demeanor; he grooves as he gathers.
           He pauses and glances toward Warren, inside his vehicle.

           INT./EXT FORD EXPLORER (PARKED) -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

           On Warren gazing... A hand enters frame, knocking against the 
           window. Warren comes to, focuses on...

           Alberto, his headphones lowered, speaking through the glass. 

                                 ALBERTO
                        It’s your shift now?

           Warren removes a bag of peanuts from the glove compartment 
           and hurries out of the vehicle. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT

           Alberto pushes a stack of carts through the parking lot 
           toward the store. Warren follows him.

                                 ALBERTO
                        What’s with the Pennsylvania 
                        plates?

                                 WARREN
                        I move around when I need to.

                                 ALBERTO
                        How long you been in Detroit?

                                 WARREN
                        A few months.

                                 ALBERTO
                        You always work in grocery stores?

                                 WARREN
                        I work at whatever puts gas in my 
                        car and food in my stomach.

                                 ALBERTO
                        I hear you, man! I got two kids and 
                        a third on the way! That’s no joke!

           They enter LaFayette Foods through the sliding glass doors.

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- CASH REGISTER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren bags groceries for LUPE, 55, a small Hispanic cashier. 
           A MOTHER, 35, watches Lupe total the groceries on the 
           register. A LITTLE GIRL, 3, in her stroller and her BROTHER, 
           7, stare up at Warren. They observe Warren’s maimed hand. 

           He packs the last bit of groceries - several packages of Cup 
           Noodles. 

           Little Girl puts her hands out, she wants one... He gives her 
           the package to hold. She smiles. 

                                 WARREN
                        I like those too. 

           The Brother rips it out of her hand. She begins to wail. 

           The Mother takes another package of the Cup Noodles out of 
           the packed bag. She bends down and turns it over the Little 
           Girl. She coos quietly to the children in an attempt to mend 
           the rift.

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- GROCERY AISLES -- LATER

           Warren sweeps and removes trash bags from the bins.

           EXT. DUMPSTER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren throws bags into the dumpster. Crows flutter. He takes 
           peanuts from his pocket and scatters them on the ground.

           FOURTY EIGHT YEARS AGO -- 1960

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SHACK -- DAY

           Graden, 13, finds a young, injured crow beneath a patch of 
           trees. He collects it onto a cloth. Warren, 17, approaches...

                                 WARREN
                        What are you gonna do with that 
                        thing? 

           Graden brings the crow inside. Warren trails behind.

           INT. WARREN AND GRADEN’S BEDROOM  

           Warren watches Graden softly place the crow on his bed. He 
           pulls out prepared items from underneath his bed and places 
           the crow on a cigarette tin lined with grass. He tries to 
           feed the crow crumbs.
                                 WARREN
                        We barely got enough to eat! 

           Graden ignores him and continues his attempt to feed the 
           crow.

           LATER --

           It’s dark outside. Warren lights a lantern. He pulls the tin 
           out from under Graden’s bed. He touches the crow’s brittle 
           wings - he grimaces. It’s dead.

           Warren dumps the crow into Graden’s pillowcase and turns out 
           the lantern. He crawls into bed.

           Graden enters the dark room and changes out of his clothes.

                                 GRADEN
                        Warren?

           Warren’s eyes are open, but remains still, pretending sleep.

           Graden SHUFFLES about. The BED CREAKS as he gets into it. 

           A moment later - Graden YELPS. 

           Warren remains motionless. RUSTLING over by Graden. 

           A moment passes. 

           FOOTSTEPS leaving the room.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SHACK -- NIGHT

           Warren steps onto the porch. Graden digs into the earth. 

                                 WARREN
                        It’s just a bird, leave it!

           Graden stares at Warren, then drops his head in 
           disappointment.

           Warren remains motionless - his eyes well with tears.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I put it in the pillow case, but I 
                        didn’t kill it! 

                                 GRADEN
                        I know.

           Graden ignore’s Warren’s presence.
           Warren runs to Graden, falls to his knees and helps dig the 
           hole to bury the crow.

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           EXT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- DUMPSTER -- DAY

           Warren stares ahead. The crows crowd around the peanuts, 
           pecking voraciously. 

           INT. DETROIT, APARTMENT -- MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

           Warren enters his apartment holding a bag of groceries from 
           Lafayette Foods. The side of the bag has the Lafayette Food’s 
           logo and below it reads: “Thank you, Thank you, Thank you,” 
           several times over.

           Inside the kitchen he looks at his oversized wall calendar 
           and the adjacent pull calendar - Warren examines tomorrow’s 
           date. 

           His finger points to February 28th, it reads:

           “MAMA - Harmony Manor 4226 Rolling Hills, Pittsburgh.”

           INT. FORD EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           It’s overcast as Warren drives, leaving the city of Detroit 
           behind. He turns on his cellphone and places it in the center 
           console. 

                                 RADIO NEWS
                        Representative John Lewis, a 
                        Georgia Democrat and civil rights-
                        era hero, formally reverses his 
                        endorsement, from Clinton to Obama 
                        for the Presidency. John Lewis is 
                        an American hero and a giant of the 
                        civil rights movement, Mr. Obama 
                        said in a statement issued after he 
                        arrived here for a campaign stop. I 
                        am deeply honored to have his 
                        support. 

           Warren turns to music. Bobby Hebb sings the acoustic version 
           of “SUNNY.”

           On the seat next to him is a thermos, jar of instant coffee, 
           and instant Cup Noodles. 
           Every so often, wearing worn glasses, he glances at a spread 
           out map. He takes 1-76W to Harrisburg.

           EXT. INTERSTATE 579 S -- DAY

           Warren’s Explorer turns onto exit 2A for I-579 S towards  
           “Pittsburgh.”

           EXT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Warren drives through the grounds of a modern nursing home -
           he locates a spot and parks.

           Warren parks his Explorer. 

           INT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- HALLWAY -- DAY

           A NURSING AID escorts Warren to a room. She knocks on the 
           doorjamb and pokes her head inside.

           The institution makes an attempt at comfort with pictures and 
           plants, but the sterile ambience of an “old folks” home 
           remains. 

                                 NURSING AID
                        Mrs. Williams, you have a visitor.

           INT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- MAMA'S ROOM -- DAY

           Mama, now in her late 80’s, one side of her face drops with 
           paralysis, lifts her head and offers a crooked smile.

           Mama’s speech is slurred.

                                 MAMA
                        I was wondering when you were gonna 
                        get here.

                                 NURSING AID
                        I’ll leave the two of you.

           Warren enters the room. Mama glances out the window and 
           points out with a trembling hand.

                                 MAMA
                        The hummingbirds. There’s a feeder 
                        outside. They all come for some 
                        sugar, but it’s cold now... 

           She trails off... seems lost, but comes back strong.
                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        I asked Glenda over and over, when 
                        is that boy gonna come and visit 
                        his Mama.

           Warren sits on her footstool. Mama puts her hand on his face.

                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long time. Where you 
                        been?

                                 WARREN
                        Detroit.

                                 MAMA
                        How’s your studies, young man?

                                 WARREN
                        School was a long time ago.

           She pats him twice and pulls back her hand.

                                 MAMA
                        I always knew you’d do good in 
                        that. Always sneaking out on your 
                        Papa. You keep running to that 
                        school like it were a playground. 

           Suddenly, Warren grows apprehensive. Something’s not right.

                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        Your Papa couldn’t get you to do a 
                        stitch of work. I know you, Graden.

           Warren sags under the weight of disappointment. 

                                 WARREN
                        Mama.

           Mama resumes looking outside.

                                 MAMA
                        Where do they all go?

           Warren places his head in his hands and rocks himself. He 
           embraces Mama and leaves the room.

           INT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- HALLWAY -- DAY 

           Warren wanders. He starts and stops. His breath caught 
           somewhere inside of him. Not sure where to go and what to do. 
           He sits in one of the chairs lining the hallway. 
           FORTY EIGHT YEARS AGO -- 1960

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SHACK -- COTTON FIELD -- DAY

           Moving forward... Warren, 17, drags a ten foot sack behind - 
           connected by a strap wrapped across his shoulder. He picks 
           cotton and drops it in.

           Graden, 13, falls into step, carrying his own sack. Graden is 
           bigger and faster than Warren. He picks effortlessly.

                                 WARREN
                        Where you been?

                                 GRADEN
                        School.

                                 WARREN
                        I figured.

           Warren watches Graden’s lips move silently.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 GRADEN
                        Memorizing the states.

                                 WARREN
                        What for? You ain’t ever gonna 
                        leave this one.

                                 GRADEN
                        You don’t know that!

                                 WARREN
                        Do too. Mississippi is where your 
                        family is. You got a head full of 
                        stuff you don’t need.

                                 GRADEN
                        You know there are places up north 
                        where black men have jobs. In 
                        Chicago they dress up, go to work, 
                        and get paid just like white folks.

           Warren struggles to keep up. 

                                 WARREN
                        There’s places like that right here 
                        in Mississippi. It don’t mean 
                        nothing to you, though.
                                 GRADEN
                        Maybe it does.

                                 WARREN
                        Now you hold on. All that schooling 
                        is messing you up. At least my 
                        behind don’t got welts. Going to 
                        school, shying away from the work, 
                        ain’t working for Papa.

           Warren is momentarily distracted.

           Papa closes in with a paddle in hand. He pulls Graden away. 
           Graden drops his sack as he is taken to the work shed.

           Warren listens to the PADDLE SLAP against Graden. Warren 
           grimaces with every blow. He watches as...

           Graden moves back into position - his eyes water from pain, 
           but not from tears. He remains unbroken.

                                 GRADEN
                        School’s important.

                                 WARREN
                        Not getting whipped is important.

                                 GRADEN
                        I’m going to college in Chicago. I 
                        don’t care what he does to me.

                                 WARREN
                        You better watch that mouth of 
                        yours. Papa may whip you, but 
                        others will do worse. Emmett Till 
                        was from up there, ended up beaten 
                        and dead in the Tallahatchie. 

           Graden picks as fast as he can, leaving Warren behind.

           THE PRESENT -- 2008

           INT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- HALLWAY     

           Warren continues down the hall... he exits outside.

           EXT. HARMONY MANOR ASSISTED LIVING -- ENTRANCE/EXIT -- DAY

           A car continuously HONKS. Warren exits and walks towards the 
           parking lot. The source of the honking appears...
           INT./EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVEWAY -- GLENDA’S SEDAN 

           Glenda, now in her late 60’s, rolls down her window, waving 
           her hand in the air. She appears perpetually aggravated; big 
           frown, pursed lips. 

                                 GLENDA
                        Warren! Over here! Get in!

           Warren sits in the sedan’s back seat. 

           Etta, in her mid 60’s, sits on the passenger side. Kindness 
           in her eyes for Warren. 

           Etta leans over to give him a hug, her coordination doesn’t 
           work and Warren holds back. Etta lovingly takes his hand into 
           hers for a brief moment, until he quickly retracts it.

           EXT. HARMONY MANOR -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER 

           Glenda’s jaw clenches as she circles the lot.

                                 GLENDA
                        If you’re gonna start coming around 
                        you should tell us when. They call 
                        me when she gets visitors, you 
                        know. The elderly always getting 
                        taken for...

           Beat.

                                 GLENDA (CONT’D)
                        Where you living now?

                                 ETTA
                        Glenda... I told you. He lives in 
                        Detroit.

                                 GLENDA
                    (Scoffs)
                        Lord knows for how long... moving 
                        all over the country like a 
                        drifter... upsetting Mama. Never 
                        keeping in touch with your family.

                                 ETTA
                        He’s here now. We don’t have to do 
                        this. 

           Glenda can barely contain herself.
                                 WARREN 
                        I was trying to do right by our 
                        brother. Mama didn’t need to know--

           Glenda pounds the breaks - car lurches forward.

                                 GLENDA
                        Don’t you tell me how to care for 
                        Mama. You disappeared, you know! 
                        You gave up that right!

                                GLENDA (CONT'D)
                WARREN
           It’s over. There’s no more to 
           be done.
                           I’ll never understand it. 
                           Getting a bunch of old men 
                           arrested.

                                 WARREN
                        They murdered him.

                                 GLENDA
                        You think you’ve suffered more than 
                        the rest of us?

                WARREN
           I was supposed to take care 
           of him.
                                GLENDA (CONT'D)
                           Maybe you should have stayed 
                           gone!

                        Christ is our Savior! Not Warren 
                        Williams! You understand?

           Glenda trembles with anger... 

           Warren gets out, he glances inside one more time. Glenda 
           refuses to meet his gaze. Warren shuts the door. 

           INT./EXT. FORD EXPLORER (PARKED) -- PARKING LOT

           Warren approaches his car. He opens the door to sit inside.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Warren!

           Warren turns... Etta approaches. 

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        I wish I knew you were coming... I 
                        would have come alone.

                                 WARREN
                        Didn’t they call and report me?
                                 ETTA
                        I don’t know why she says half the 
                        stuff she does. You’re not a 
                        visitor... you’re family. 

                                 WARREN
                        How’d you know I live in Detroit?

                                 ETTA
                        Warren? We spoke? We chatted after 
                        the final arrest was made. 

           Warren appears confused, causing Etta to be taken aback.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        I gave you this address. We talked 
                        about how it felt, now that it’s 
                        over... 

                                 WARREN
                        Okay. That’s right...

                                 ETTA
                        I’ve missed my brother.

           Etta looks inside the Explorer. She views the reminders.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        What’s all this?

           Etta is getting the picture.

                                 WARREN
                        Reminders. 

           Etta’s watchful eye settles on the center of the wheel. 

                                 ETTA
                        What’s “Woman with no name?”

                                 WARREN
                        I’m not sure. 

                                 ETTA
                        It says you, “Must remember?”

           The horn HONKS. Etta turns to see Glenda parked and standing 
           outside her car waiting.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s try to move on. Mama doesn’t 
                        have much time left. 

           Etta wraps her arms around her stiff, closed-off brother.
                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        The day I get you to hug me is a 
                        day I’ll rest peacefully.

           Etta releases her grip and makes her way to Glenda.

           INT./EXT. INTERSTATE 76N -- EXPLORER (MOVING) - NIGHTFALL

           The grey sky darkens into night. Warren turns on the radio. 
           WHFR 89.3 plays Nina Simone’s of “I Want a Little Sugar in My 
           Bowl”(LIVE) - IT IS FINISHED.

           On his hand, written in pen, it reads “Call Woman with no 
           name - who is she? 555-602-6272.”

           SERIES OF SHOTS AT NIGHT

           - Warren’s Explorer passes under a sign: 1-75N to Detroit.

           - Warren fills the gas tank.

           - Warren inside a fast food joint eating a burger. 

           - Warren drives through the night. 

           EXT./INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           He enters his dark apartment. He sits in his recliner without 
           turning the lights on.

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- GROCERY AISLE -- AFTERNOON

           An ELDERLY MAN, 80’s, tries to balance against his walker 
           while pushing a grocery cart, moving slowly with uncertainty.

           The Elderly Man drops a can of pickles onto the ground. It 
           SMASHES loudly - pickles and juice fly everywhere. 

           Warren puts a new jar into the Elderly Man’s cart and begins 
           cleaning up the mess.

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- CASH REGISTER   

           Lupe works the front register, while Alberto packs for her 
           customers. They watch Warren help the Elderly Man.

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- GROCERY AISLE  

           Warren places orange cones around the spill.

           Alberto slides over to Lupe...

                               (Spanish) 
                        You know who he is, right? A real 
                        dope dude. Check this out...

           Alberto pulls out his smart phone.

                        A new trial was pursued at a 
                        federal level. The prosecution, 
                        along with members of the local 
                        police department, had hidden 
                        documents and interviews connected 
                        to the case. New evidence has been 
                        turned over to the FBI.

           EXT. POLICE PERIMETER -- DANIEL OLSEN’S TRAILER 

           A police perimeter is drawn around an unkempt lawn with a 
           cracked driveway and pots of dead plants strewn about...
                                 HUEL PERKINS (O.C.)
                        The video footage shows the arrest 
                        of Daniel Olsen, which happened 
                        here, in Detroit. He is the last 
                        man to be arrested. Seven of the 
                        total eight men involved in the 
                        crime were subsequently prosecuted 
                        as guilty and put behind bars.

           Several NEWS TEAMS jockey for position and get close to the 
           action. The LEAD OFFICER steps up broken cinder block stairs; 
           he knocks on the door. Behind him, FOUR POLICE OFFICERS 
           provide backup, with hands near their guns.

           DANIEL OLSEN, in his 80’s, bald, fragile with a hare lip and 
           cleft palate, wearing pajama bottoms, no shirt and 
           slippers... shuffles outside.

           Alberto hides the phone as Warren approaches, pushing the 
           Elderly Man’s cart.

           Warren leaves the Elderly Man with Lupe and Alberto.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - LATER

           Several LAFAYETTE FOOD EMPLOYEES relax on break. Warren 
           quietly eats his Cup Noodles.

           Alberto arrives, grooving with his head phones on. He holds a 
           Subway sandwich in his hand - he uses it as a microphone. 

                                 ALBERTO
                        One, two, three!
                        My baby don't mess around 
                        Because she loves me so
                        And this I know fo sho!

           The Employees focus on the youthful Alberto’s antics. Alberto 
           stands behind Warren and puts the headphones on him.

           Warren listens to Outkast’s, “Hey Ya!”
                                 ALBERTO (CONT’D)
                        I know... a bit old school, but it 
                        always gets me going.

           Warren takes the headphone off.

                                 ALBERTO (CONT’D)
                        I got my lady with these moves... 
                        now I gotta keep all the others 
                        away! Nah, just playing. Warren’s 
                        the real player! A certified old 
                        school pimp!

           Alberto puts the headphones back on and eats his sandwich.

           EXT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- GROCERY AISLE -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Warren removes cans of green bean from a box stocking the 
           shelves while humming the Outkast tune, mumbles the lyrics... 

                                 WARREN
                        Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya...

           He removes two cans of green beans and wanders the aisle.

           EXT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- GROCERY AISLE  

           Warren enters another aisle - seemingly lost. Alberto passes 
           with a stack of deconstructed boxes. 

                                 WARREN
                        I don’t... know...?

           Warren lifts the can into the air.

                                 ALBERTO
                        The green beans? Over here.

           Alberto escorts Warren to where he previously stood. Warren 
           places the cans on the shelf. 

           EXT. DUMPSTER -- CROWS

           Warren deposits the trash into the dumpster. He throws 
           peanuts out for the crows. He looks at his hand and reads the 
           reminder written in pen:

           “Call woman with no name - who is she? 555-602-6272.”

           It takes him a moment to find and dial his flip cell phone.

                        then leave me alone.

                                 WARREN
                        I am. Please tell me... How do you 
                        know me?

           Warren is blank.

                        I know someone... He may be one of 
                        those men. 

                                 WARREN
                        What’s his name?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Earl. And I know you’ll say he’s 
                        dead, but... I’m not so sure.

           Warren’s body stiffens

                                 WARREN
                        When can we meet?

                        Is that where he is?

                        No.

           Warren returns into the store...

           INT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- STOCKROOM     

           Warren enters a cluttered stock room... he looks around for a 
           pen and paper... he finds a marker and a newspaper -- he 
           writes across the paper: “Sudbury - Ontario.” 

                                 WARREN
                        Wednesday?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        What time?

                                 WARREN
                        5 or 6?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        There is a Petrol station off the 
                        first exit. On Regent. 

           He continues to write on the newspaper.

                                 WARREN
                        Petrol station... exit at Sudbury.

           CLICK.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        You there? 

           No answer - the Unidentified Woman is gone. 

           Warren tucks the cellphone back into his pocket.

           EXT. LAFAYETTE FOODS -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

           It’s sleeting rain. Warren and Lupe cross the lot heading in 
           different directions. 

           Warren to the Explorer, Lupe to the bus stop. 
           Lupe holds a newspaper over her head, the rain beats down. 
           The paper does no good. She is getting pummeled. 

           EXT./INT. PARKING LOT -- EXPLORER 

           Warren takes the information written on the newspaper and 
           tapes it onto his wheel... notes of different shapes and 
           sizes cover the inside of the vehicle. He drives out of the 
           lot.

           Lupe waves to Warren and runs to him. She knocks on the 
           window... he opens the door.

                                 LUPE
                        Can I have a ride? Bus is late...

           Warren stares, follow by a reluctant nod. 

                                 LUPE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. I need to watch my 
                        grandchildren. My daughter works 
                        nights. Her husband was deported.

           Lupe sits in the vehicle, closes the door. Struck silent and 
           dumbfounded as she locks eyes onto the inside of the 
           vehicle... 

           The wash of notes posted/taped on dashboard and wheel. 

           INT. DETROIT STREETS -- EXPLORER (MOVING) 

           Warren takes Bagley Avenue towards southwest Detroit. 

                                 LUPE
                        Warren, do you have children?

           Warren shakes his head.

                                 LUPE (CONT’D)
                        Where you from? 

                                 WARREN
                        Mississippi. 

                                 LUPE
                        I’m from Mexico. I miss it even 
                        though my family is here. Do you 
                        miss Mississippi? 

                                 WARREN
                        No. 
           Lupe contemplates and makes a decision...

                                 LUPE
                        I know who you are. 
                                 (Beat)
                        I saw the news. You went after 
                        those bad men.

           Warren breaks at a traffic light.

                                 LUPE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for all that happened to 
                        you and your family. You are brave.

                                 WARREN
                        Not really.

           Warren’s face strains. 

           Small bursts of disjointed segments rush forth:

           SERIES OF SHOTS - ALL WARREN’S POV

           - Lupe talking to Warren.

           - Lupe worriedly stares at Warren, she reaches over him to 
           put the car in park.

           - Warren looks down at his cell phone. He can’t reach it.

           - A Vision of Graden now sits next to Warren, watching 
           Warren. The Vision of Graden looks into the street - Warren 
           follows his stare...

           - A Vision of a Young Graden stands on the street staring 
           back.

           - Flashing lights.

           - Lupe is in the rain flagging down a police car.

           - Hospital ceiling.

           - MRI scan.

           INT. DETROIT RECEIVING HOSPITAL 

           Warren lies in a hospital bed. DOCTOR ATTAR, 50s, stares down 
           at him. Screens divide him from the rest of the room.

                                 DR. ATTAR
                        Mr. Williams? Can you hear me?
                                 WARREN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 DR. ATTAR
                        You’re at Detroit Receiving 
                        Hospital. I’m Dr. Attar. Is there a 
                        history of dementia in your family?

           Warren nods as he begins to digest his surroundings.

                                 DR. ATTAR (CONT’D)
                        Your MRI reveals cortical atrophy. 
                        With additional tests we can ensure 
                        an exact diagnosis and rule out 
                        other causes, but you have 
                        definitive signs of dementia. It’s 
                        possible it could be onset of 
                        Alzheimer’s, but we have to get you 
                        to a Neurologist--

                                 WARREN
                        Do you know where my car is?

                                 DR. ATTAR
                        Police left information at the 
                        front. Let me find the nurse to 
                        walk you through the process, but 
                        it’s not advisable to drive. We can 
                        help in calling a taxi for you to 
                        get home. If the diagnosis is as I 
                        suspect, you will need to talk over 
                        the best course of action with a 
                        Neurologist.

           Dr. Attar pulls the curtain aside to flag down a nurse.

           INT. HOSPITAL DESK -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren signs some papers. He is handed his wallet and 
           cellphone. He places those items into his pocket.

           EXT. TAXI -- IMPOUND LOT -- NIGHT

           A taxi drops Warren off in front.

           EXT. DETROIT IMPOUND LOT -- MORNING

           Warren pays the cashier.

           Warren exits the lot in the Explorer.
           INT. DETROIT, BASEMENT APARTMENT -- MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

           Warren enters. He moves immediately into the kitchen.

           He pulls down the packed box containing folders and notebooks 
           from on top of the refrigerator. He unloads previously packed 
           contents. 

           INSERTS:

           - A photo from 1964 Mississippi. Eight Men, mostly dressed in 
           fine suits and shined shoes walk down courtroom stairs: 

           PATRICK OLSEN ,in his 40s, with a bulldog face, leads the 
           pack. He’s follow by MARTY BAVON ,30’s, goblin-like with bent 
           yellow teeth. 

           BLAINE PLIMPTON, 30’s, with pockmarked cheeks and PAUL 
           PROUST, late 40’s, the oldest of the group are followed by 
           the red-headed cousins, BARRY and ROB TYWATER, both in their 
           20’s. 

           Lagging behind, different than the rest, is DANIEL (40’s) and 
           Earl Olsen. They wear worn clothes, heads hung low. 

           - Graden William’s 1964 autopsy folder and paperwork. It 
           reads: “Deceased testicle’s clipped, broken skull, cause of 
           death, drowning.”

           - Maps, yellow notepad with notes, Graden’s composition 
           notebook... Warren runs his fingers over Graden’s name 
           written on the front. Something sticks out from behind...

           - An autopsy photo of a ravaged body. Warren pushes it back 
           inside.

           - Lastly, a picture of Graden, face-down in the swamp.

           LATER --

           Warren rests on the recliner. Opposite from Warren, on a 
           wrapped piece of furniture, sits a Vision of Graden. 

                                 GRADEN
                        You shouldn’t be driving.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s the only way... to end this.

                                 GRADEN
                        This ends when you decide.

           Warren stands and yells.
                                 WARREN
                        It’s not my decision! 

           Graden’s stare penetrates. Warren sits back on the recliner.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m trying to... let me just do 
                        this. I have to... I’m very tired. 
                        I need sleep.

           Warren closes his eyes.

           SOUNDS of the SWAMP emerge. The chitter and whistle of 
           insects. Grey heron’s high-pitch croak along side a chorus of 
           frogs, then...

                                      FADE TO:

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- SWAMP -- DAY

           SOUNDS of the SWAMP continue as we push in hovering above 
           stagnant water that grows tupelo and giant bald cypresses 
           displaying autumnal colors. 

           We venture further into the forested wetland and focus upon 
           what looks to be a shadow from the trees above. Moving in for 
           a closer inspection, it becomes clear it is a lifeless, naked 
           body floating face down in the algae and duckweed.

           NEXT EARLY MORNING --

           Morning light seeps into the basement room. Warren remains 
           asleep in the chair. The Vision of Graden has left. 

           Warren awakens. 

           EXT. KMART - DAY

           Warren parks his Explorer. He walks inside.

           INT. KMART FOOD COURT - DAY 

           Etta sits at a table with a cup of coffee cupped between her 
           hands. She rises and hugs him. At first, he doesn’t respond.

           Warren does his best to give a hug. 

                                 ETTA
                    (Shocked)
                        As I live and breathe... Warren 
                        Williams!
           They sit together.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        I got you coffee, you want anything 
                        else?

           A coffee and cake sits at an empty seat.

                                 WARREN
                        I don’t... this is good, Etta.

                                 ETTA
                        After the matter at the nursing 
                        home, well it’s just nice to see 
                        you. I’m glad you called.

           Warren EXHALES with a WINCE.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        Glenda’s always been angry. She 
                        blames the world. Graden’s not your 
                        fault. It doesn’t matter he was out 
                        there to fetch you home. Those men 
                        had their eyes set on him, and they 
                        would have gotten to him anyway, if 
                        not that night then on some other.

           Warren solemnly stares, she hasn’t changed his mind.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        This woman you’re meeting. What if 
                        she isn’t telling the truth? 

                                 WARREN
                        I have to see for myself.

                                 ETTA
                        It doesn’t sound right, especially 
                        seeing that he’s dead. The police 
                        said so--

                                 WARREN
                        Mississippi police. 

                                 ETTA
                        Well... I can’t help wishing things 
                        were different for you. Easier. But 
                        I made my mind up. I watched you 
                        work from afar, but I am here for 
                        you brother. Anything you need. I 
                        did some research.

           Etta pushes forward Warren’s birth certificate... Warren 
           opens it and examines the yellowed and aging document.
           INSERT: Standard Certificate of Live Birth. State of 
           Mississippi.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        Surprised I held onto it?

           Warren nods.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need this to get over the 
                        border. Also, I was thinking... you 
                        should clean out some of the notes 
                        in your car, the ones that seem 
                        older and don’t mean anything to 
                        you.

           She stares at Warren sipping his coffee. He nods. 

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        How’s your memory?

           Warren takes an exhaustive breath...

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        That good huh? Good thing you 
                        called when you did. You’re gonna 
                        need my help, even if you don’t 
                        remember needing my help.

           Etta chuckles. Warren manages a crooked smile.

           LATER IN THE DAY --

           The kitchen is cleared out - all reminder notes removed. 
           Warren’s duffle bag is packed on the kitchen table. 

           Warren wears his coat and hat. He counts cash and leaves it 
           in a piece of paper, fashioned to an envelope on the table. 
           He scribbles “Landlord” onto it.

           He picks up a single reminder note left next to the phone: 
           “JOB - Lafayette foods - 1565 E. Lafayette - 555-1212. 

           He dials.

                                 WARREN
                        This is Warren Williams. 

           Warren listens...

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Yes. I’m okay. I’m calling because 
                        I’m going out of town... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t continue. I’m sorry for any 
                        problems that may cause...

           Moments later... he loads the investigation materials into 
           the “Lafayette Foods” grocery bag. 

           He adds: a camera, thermos, instant coffee, and several 
           containers of Cup Noodles. He picks up the bag and duffle.

           INT. DETROIT, APARTMENT -- MAIN ROOM  

           Warren exits the apartment - the lock SNAPS. The keys slide 
           under the door.

           Out the apartment window. It’s a grim, grey morning. Warren 
           loads the Explorer, gets inside, and drives away.

           INT./EXT TRAVELEX CURRENCY SERVICE -- STREET -- LATER

           Warren exits with an envelope of Canadian currency in hand 
           and gets into the Explorer.

           INT./EXT AMBASSADOR BRIDGE -- EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren crosses the large blue, steel structure suspended over 
           the Detroit River. 

           On the center of the steering wheel the ripped piece of 
           newspaper hangs, reading: “Sudbury, Ontario.”

           INT./EXT. CUSTOMS -- EXPLORER -- DAY

           A CUSTOMS OFFICER, 50s, glances inside Warren’s Explorer. 

           Warren hands his identification card and his birth 
           certificate over. Next to him a road map has been unfurled 
           and the notes have been somewhat cleaned up.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        Where you headed to?

                                 WARREN
                        Sudbury.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        For what purpose and how long?

                                 WARREN
                        Vacation. A couple weeks.
           Customs Officer hands back Warren’s identification.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        Got your map ready to go. Don’t see 
                        too many of those.

                                 WARREN
                        Trying to check how long the drive 
                        is? My eyes aren’t working good... 
                        lost my glasses.

           The Custom Officer softens.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER
                        Seven hours. Your best bet is to 
                        take the 401 East to the 400 North 
                        to Sudbury.

           Warren grabs for a pen and quickly writes on a note.... He 
           finishes, placing the note on the wheel.

                                 CUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Canada.

           Warren “nods a thanks” and drives into Canada.

           INT./EXT. CANADIAN LANDSCAPE -- EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren drives by different landscapes as cloudy weather 
           churns through the day. Toronto rises on the west as the 
           Explorer turns away from it - heading north. 

                                 RADIO COMMENTATOR (O.S.)
                        A three day severe weather alert 
                        for the Ontario region begins today 
                        February 20, 2008. For the next 
                        three days a tricky system is 
                        tracking in, set to bring a blast 
                        of wintry weather; heavy snow and 
                        icy precipitation with below 
                        freezing temperatures.

           He drives through several small towns, Barrie and McDougall. 

           An animal road sign exhibits ducks crossing the road.

           EXT. SUDBURY, PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP -- EXPLORER -- DAY

           Warren parks at a large truck stop with several buildings 
           containing: restaurants, convenient stores, showers, and gas.
           INT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP -- SHOWER AREA -- DAY

           Warren, with duffle bag in tow, enters a depressing, dark 
           waiting room where TRUCK DRIVERS - mostly men, some women - 
           watch television and smoke cigarettes.

           INT. PETRO-CANADA TRUCK STOP -- SHOWER/BATHROOM 

           Warren enters a small bathroom with shower, toilet, and sink 
           with mirror. His duffle placed next to a clean towel and wash-
           cloth. 

           LATER --

           Warren exits the shower and dresses in layers. He wipes his 
           hand across the steamed mirror. He stares at his face - the 
           face of an old man. 

           EXT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP -- CONVENIENCE STORE -- LATER

           Warren pumps gas into the Explorer’s tank.

           INT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP -- CONVENIENCE STORE -- MOMENTS

           Anything and everything you could imagine is available for 
           purchase: clothes, stuffed moose, and snow globes.

           Warren tries on a pair of readers, followed by a sweatshirt 
           with the “Canada” logo, gloves, packages of Cup Noodles, and 
           a hot coffee. He refills his thermos with hot water. 

           EXT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP PARKING -- EXPLORER -- DUSK

           The Explorer sits in a parking space overlooking a barren 
           field with a cluster of trees gathered to one side.

           Warren drops off the purchased goods into his car. He looks 
           at his notepad: “Sudbury. 5pm.”

           INT. PETRO-PASS CONVENIENCE STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Warren sits with notepad in hand at a small seating area 
           nursing a cup of coffee. He watches out the window: various 
           big rigs, trucks, and cars pull in and out of the truck stop. 

           LYMAN, 70’s, large man with baggy Levis’ that sag in the ass - 
           wears oversized glasses as he fills his Kia Sportage’s tank. 
           His head and shoulders bent downward exhibiting a personal 
           inadequacy.
           Warren’s CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Are you sitting at the booth?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

           The phone CLICKS.

           The Unidentified Woman, 50s, with a strained look and red- 
           hair exits the Kia and speaks to Lyman.

           Lyman watches the Unidentified Woman cross over to the 
           convenience store. She adjusts her hair as she enters.

           The Unidentified Woman enters the convenience store and sits 
           in the empty seat across from Warren.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        You Warren?

           Warren nods. 

           The Unidentified Woman was once pretty, but has gotten older; 
           time and lack of care has had it’s way with her. She wears 
           too much eyeliner and portions of her skin have been picked 
           out. 

           She is full of nervous energy and avoids eye contact

                                 WARREN
                        I didn’t get your name?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        Does it matter?

           Unidentified Woman glances around the store.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You alone?

           Warren nods. 

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Lyman didn’t want me to come. I was 
                        in rehab for a short bit. Had to 
                        take a break. I was afraid when I 
                        came in I’d see news cameras. I’m 
                        gonna get something to drink.

           The Unidentified Woman walks to retrieve a soda fountain 
           drink... she returns to Warren.  
                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t bring money... I can go 
                        out and ask Lyman...

           She doesn’t go out and ask... she waits. She stares.

           Warren pats himself down to find his wallet. He pulls out a 
           Canadian five note. Miriam takes it without hesitation. 

           She pays the CASHIER and returns to sit across from Warren.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        You see him out there?

           Warren glances out the window at Lyman, as Lyman turns the 
           page of a book.

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        Reading?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        He sure likes books... 

           Miriam opens something below the table top. Her hands shake 
           as she removes the plastic top and straw. She pours two 
           airplane sized bottles of liquor into her fountain drink.

           She sips through the straw voraciously.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t offer any. Sorry.

                                 WARREN
                        Don’t drink booze.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        What’s that for?

           Referring to the notepad next to Warren.

                                 WARREN
                        So I remember everything.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        You got problems with that?

           Warren doesn’t respond.
                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I do because I barely sleep. And 
                        I’m talking for days on end... no 
                        shut-eye. You get through detox and 
                        then you realize you can’t sleep. 
                        Then you wonder why you tried to 
                        get sober.

           She removes a prescription bottle from her purse.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        They’re prescription. My nerves. 

           She takes two of the pills.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I keep telling myself it couldn’t 
                        be true, but... its been on my mind 
                        for a long time... keeps me awake. 
                        Never sat right--

                                 WARREN
                        What didn’t?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        Earl. That’s why we are here? 
                        Right? You know, he hasn’t always 
                        lived here. He’s from the south. 
                        Somewhere way down. His father 
                        passed away months back. He was old 
                        and whatnot, but he was in jail. 
                        That’s something that you tell 
                        someone you live with. Someone you 
                        love. Anyway, it was the beginning 
                        of our end. The end. He said I 
                        asked too many questions... Kicked 
                        me out like a dog. Like a fucking 
                        dog. Felt like shit.

           Unidentified Woman’s breath is taken away with a GASP, she 
           lays her head on the table.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        He moved to the place up north. We 
                        had a place not far from here. I 
                        live with Lyman now. He tries 
                        hard... wouldn’t hurt a fly.

                                 WARREN
                        Would Earl?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        What?
                                 WARREN
                        Hurt a fly?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        He’d have to, to do the things he’s 
                        done. Wouldn’t he? If he’s the one, 
                        which I don’t know if he is? You 
                        can figure that out. It seems like 
                        you’ve been good at it.

           She knocks her forehead a few times on the hard surface, she 
           rubs it and turns onto her cheek. 

           The attractive CASHIER, 20s, stocks the shelves.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        That can get you everything... I 
                        used to be young like her.

           The Unidentified Woman uses her index finger to point and 
           follow the Cashier through the store. 

                                 WARREN
                        What about Earl?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        He didn’t go to the funeral. Weird. 
                        He mentioned his dad’s first name 
                        was Daniel.... So that was weird... 
                        a person being named two of the 
                        same names.

                                 WARREN
                        What’s he calling himself?

           Tiring...her words begin to slur.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        Earl Daniel. So his dad would be 
                        Daniel Daniel... would have been. 
                        He got angry... He went back... up 
                        north...left me. With nothing.

           She takes her jacket off.

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN (CONT’D)
                              (Whispers) 
                        I would like to have some peace and 
                        whatnot... Once I get through this 
                        bad patch, I want to live a good 
                        life. Feel more better than bad.

                                 WARREN
                        What’s your name?
           Her head drops. 

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                       (Whispers a chuckle)
                        Not on the menu.

           She reaches her hand over to Warren’s maimed hand.

                                 WARREN
                      (Urgency)
                        You have an address for him?

                                 UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
                        Outside of Hearst. Been there once.
                        Hope-something... There’s no hope.

           Warren retracts his hand. He removes his glasses to write 
           information onto his notepad.

           The Unidentified Woman disappears into the ladies room - 
           leaving her coat behind.

           Moments pass. 

           Warren pulls the Unidentified Woman’s coat to him and removes 
           the pill bottle. It reads: MIRIAM GANGE 

           The Unidentified Woman will now be MIRIAM.

           Warren writes her name onto his yellow pad.

           Warren glances out at the Kia meeting up with Lyman’s staring 
           directly at him.

           Warren pockets the pill bottle and exits the store. Leaving 
           the coat behind. At the same time...

           EXT. PETRO-PASS CONVENIENCE STORE - DUSK

           Lyman rises out of the car with book in hand. 

                                 WARREN
                        She’s in the bathroom. I don’t know 
                        how long...

           Lyman puts the book into the car races inside. Warren 
           follows.

           INT. PETRO PASS/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Warren watches as Lyman tries to open the bathroom door. 
           Lyman KNOCKS. Nothing.

           Warren quickly crosses to the front desk. 

           Warren follows the Cashier to the back and grabs Miriam’s 
           coat bringing it with him.

           The Cashier uses her keys to open the locked door.

           Warren looks on as Lyman enters. Miriam is on the toilet, she 
           leans against the wall, it holds her up.

                                 CASHIER
                        Should I call an ambulance?

                                 LYMAN
                        No. Don’t do that! No, she’s had 
                        the flu. Been sick. Give me a 
                        minute. One second. Miriam... 
                        Miriam... wake up!

           Lyman makes sure Miriam is properly covered. Miriam MOANS.

                                 LYMAN (CONT’D)
                        Everything is fine now.

           The Cashier rolls her eyes and moves away from the door.

           EXT. PETRO-PASS CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Warren helps Lyman bring Miriam out to the car. Lyman opens 
           the passenger side door and places Miriam inside.

           Warren hands Miriam’s jacket over and the prescription 
           bottle.

                                 LYMAN
                        She take any?

                                 WARREN
                        Maybe two. 

           Lyman feels Miriam’s pockets. He removes the vodka bottles.

                                 LYMAN
                        God dammit.

           Warren walks away from the scene. He crosses to...
           EXT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP PARKING -- EXPLORER -- DUSK

           The sun drops behind the horizon. Warren looks in his 
           notebook, he reads “Hearst” - he transfers it to a Post-it 
           note and sticks it onto the wheel: “Hearst, Ontario.” 

           He continues to read his notebook: “Hope?”

           And then reads a note: “Call Etta/Sister - 555-555-1414.” 

           He feels his pockets. He dials his cellphone. 

                                 WARREN
                        Etta? I had to buy new reading 
                        glasses. I couldn’t see the map and 
                        lost the others.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        That’s to be expected at your age. 
                        Reading glasses come and go. If you 
                        had GPS you could plug it in.

                                 WARREN
                        I met her. She said he lives 
                        outside of Hearst, Ontario. Hope or 
                        something like that?

                                 ETTA
                        I’ll look around the area and see 
                        if I can book a room. On the 
                        computer now.

                                 WARREN
                        Nothing fancy.

                                 ETTA
                        I see a town called Hearst, but I 
                        don’t see anything called Hope.

                                 WARREN
                        I’ll drive through the night, gonna 
                        take a quick nap though.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        I’ve located a boarding house next 
                        to a surplus store. I’ll see if 
                        they have a vacancy... it’s a long 
                        drive for you.

           Warren closes his eyes. He shivers. He opens them. 

                                 WARREN
                        It’s cold up here.
                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        You still think you’re in 
                        Mississippi after all these years.

                                 WARREN
                        Mississippi. 

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Warren, where will you go when this 
                        is over? 

           Warren looks at the note in his hand - “Etta.”

                                 WARREN
                        Etta?

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        I’m still here. You didn’t 
                        answer... Where will you go when 
                        you’re done up there?

                                 WARREN
                        It doesn’t matter. I spent most of 
                        my life doing nothing. Doing 
                        nothing is easy to go back to.

           Warren watches a murder of crows swarm a tree.

           EXT. PETRO-PASS TRUCK STOP -- FIELD -- DUSK

           The final blue before darkness takes the sky. We watch Warren 
           at a distance as he walks towards the gathering of trees.

           Crows swarm into the air - land on the adjacent trees, only 
           to swarm again - like ephemeral art or fireworks in the sky.

           Warren stands beneath the spectacle. 

           INT. EXPLORER (PARKED) -- NIGHTFALL

           The Vision of Graden sits in the driver’s side.

           Warren gets in on the passenger side. He trembles from the 
           cold, pouring hot water into his Cup Noodles and stirs them. 
           He puts them close to his face and warms his hands on it.

                                 GRADEN 
                        You suffer, my brother.

                                 WARREN
                 (Too much to bear)
                        You’re the one that suffered.
           The crows settle in the trees. 

           Off Warren...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SHACK -- 1941 FORD FARM TRUCK -- DAY

           Warren backs the truck away from the shack - GEARS GRINDING. 

           Graden watches, sitting in the passenger seat.

           Warren notices Graden, watching him. He’s annoyed by this. 

           Graden turns away, but continues with an unobtrusive eye.

           INT./EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN ROAD -- 1941 FARM TRUCK (MOVING)

           Warren’s brow furrows. He clenches the wheel. 

           Graden relaxes, kicks his feet up and enjoys the ride... 

           An oncoming dark blue Pontiac GTO, filled with WHITE MEN veer 
           in their direction. DEWEY, 20’s, a local, drives the GTO. 

           Warren hits the breaks. The truck SCREECHES to a halt. He 
           adjusts the gears in attempt to move forward, the truck 
           SPUTTERS.

                                 GRADEN
                        You want me to drive?

                                 WARREN
                        No! Papa asked me. Not you!

           Warren continues on at the wheel.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN -- OLSEN’S STORE -- DAY

           Warren parks at the side of the store. 

           Patrick Olsen smokes a cigar as he stands out front talking 
           to Paul Proust and Marty Bavon in a black sedan. 

           He notices Warren and Graden and motions for them to head to 
           the back. 

           Warren nods and follows instructions.

           MOMENTS LATER --
           INT. OLSEN’S STORE -- DAY

           Warren enters the back, followed by Graden. Patrick Olsen 
           arrives through the front. 

           Earl Olsen sits by the cotton at the scales. He watches on...

           Segregation signs - dividing  the bathroom and fountain into 
           “COLORED PEOPLE” and “WHITES.”

                                 WARREN
                        Hello sir, my name is Warren--

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        You’re James Willams’s son.

                                 WARREN
                        Yes sir, he’s sick and sent me this 
                        way with the cotton. 

           Graden steps forward.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        This is my brother, Graden.

           Patrick Olsen ignores Graden.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Bring it on in. Wait in back when 
                        you’re done.

           Warren and Graden carry loads of cotton inside. Patrick 
           Olsen’s WORKERS weigh the cotton as each bag comes. Earl 
           Olsen assists.

           EXT. OLSEN'S STORE -- 1941 TRUCK -- LATER

           Warren and Graden wait outside. Graden is visibly annoyed by 
           the process...

           Patrick Olsen steps out, waving Warren in.

           INT. OLSENS STORE 

           Warren enters, followed by Graden. 

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Your old man knows how to run a 
                        field, does a good job with the 
                        cotton. Them bags are pretty even 
                        for measure. I can give a dollar 
                        and eight-five cents on the bag. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PATRICK OLSEN (CONT'D)
                        That’s an even twenty dollars for 
                        the lot.

           Patrick Olsen reaches in his pocket and starts counting off 
           dollar bills.

                                 GRADEN
                        We brought fourteen sacks, sir.

           Warren stiffens at his brother’s pronouncement.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Yup, don’t worry about it. We 
                        counted them.

                                 GRADEN
                        But that ain’t right, sir. A dollar 
                        eighty-five a sack is twenty-five 
                        dollars and ninety cents.

           Patrick Olsen’s expression darkens. His Workers and Earl 
           Olsen tune into the conversation.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                    (Amazed)
                        You say I’m cheating ya?

                                 GRADEN
                        No, sir, a mistake. I can show you?

           Warren steps in front of Graden.

                                 WARREN
                        Please, pay him no mind, sir.

           Patrick Olsen is confused. Taken aback...

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Don’t pay him no mind? That’s an 
                        odd request considering that he 
                        just called me a cheater or an 
                        idiot? Now listen here, I done 
                        right by your old man. I dealt with 
                        him for a lot of years and always 
                        been fair. I don’t need some boy 
                        coming to my store to insult me. I 
                        can’t understand it. After all I’ve 
                        done for you people.

           Graden stands still - he’s not backing away. Warren turns to 
           Graden, his eyes pleading: say no more.
                                 WARREN
                 (Under his breath)
                        Go back to the truck. This ain’t 
                        the time to get fancy.

           Graden leaves. 

           Warren faces Patrick Olsen.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                     (Confiding)
                        You know, I’m the only man in town 
                        that will buy cotton from a nigger. 
                        I hate to say this, but I imagine 
                        your father is gonna tan your hide 
                        something awful when you gone back 
                        to him with a truck full of cotton 
                        and no money.

           He turns his back on Warren. 

                                 PATRICK OLSEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you what. I will give you 
                        thirteen dollars for your father’s 
                        sake and you can be on your way.

           Warren stares at the back of Daniel Olsen.

           INT. 1941 FARM TRUCK (MOVING) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Graden watches Warren drive through town and out onto a 
           country road. 

                                 GRADEN
                        He’s cheating us!

                                 WARREN
                        Don’t you think I know that!
                        That’s right! You want to go back 
                        there and talk some more? Maybe 
                        we’ll get nothing instead of 
                        thirteen, and maybe you’ll get a 
                        beating out of it too. 

           Warren stares ahead...

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           INT. EXPLORER (PARKED) -- NIGHT

           The Vision of Graden is gone. 
           The Kia pulls up adjacent to the Explorer. 

           Lyman rolls down his window. Warren does the same.

                                 LYMAN
                        You staying up in Hearst?

                                 WARREN
                        Yep. A boarding house.

           Warren watches Miriam readjust her positioning in the 
           passenger seat - she’s only partly awake. 

                                 LYMAN
                        You know her name... the 
                        prescription bottle?

           Warren is unreadable.

                                 LYMAN (CONT’D)
                        You gonna call the police?

                                 WARREN
                        Not yet. 

           Lyman thinks hard before he speaks.

                                 LYMAN
                        Could you keep her out of it?

                                 WARREN
                        You speaking for her?

                                 LYMAN
                        This man has nothing but problems. 
                        She’s fragile and on probation.

                                 WARREN
                        It will take what it takes. 

                                 LYMAN
                 (Incredulous)
                        She came here to help you.

                                 WARREN
                        I just met her. Know nothing about 
                        her. You know where he lives? 

           Lyman SCOFFS. 

                                 LYMAN
                        I don’t know nothing.

           Lyman rolls up his window and pulls out to the main road.
           Warren starts the car in an effort to warm up. Closes his 
           eyes. Sleeps until...

           A heavy glare of light shines through Warren’s window. An 
           eighteen wheeler rolls by with it’s high-beams blasting at 
           the Explorer until it turns past.

           Warren wakes. He looks at the clock... 12:22A. 

           The Post it note on the steering wheel: Hearst, Ontario. 

                                 WARREN
                        Hearst.

           Warren puts on his “Canada” sweatshirt with maple leaf. 

           He reaches into the visor and removes Visine - he drops 
           liquid into each eye. 

           He makes a cup of instant coffee.

           Warren puts reading glasses on and examines the map.

           He puts on gloves, drops into gear and pulls out. Warren 
           turns on the radio... music plays... he turns the channel... 
           RADIO NEWS plays on the radio in the background.

           EXT. ONTARIO HIGHWAY 144 N. -- EXPLORER (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           Warren takes an exit onto the Ontario ON 144 N. 

           Animal road signs exhibit deer crossing the road.

           He turns on his wipers, a light snow hits his windshield.

           INT. EXPLORER (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           Headlights passing by, few and far between, mostly trucks. 

           INT./EXT. FORD EXPLORER (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           Warren continues driving. Sleet taps against the windshield.

           The animal road sign exhibits moose crossing. 

           Driving this way...

           Suddenly - a black object smacks into his window shield. 

           Warren turns too quickly. 
           The Explore skids and swerves. The two front wheels fall into 
           a trench cut on the side of the highway.

           EXT. FORD EXPLORER - TRENCH -- NIGHT   

           The Explorer tilts forward. Warren opens the door and falls 
           into the snow. 

           The wind HOWLS wildly.

           He climbs from the trench, onto the snowy land. He stares at 
           the windshield. It’s cracked, there’s blood and black 
           feathers. 

           The Vision of Graden stands next to Warren. Warren walks out 
           into a field to nowhere.

           The land is far-reaching. In the distance is a forest. Warren 
           walks randomly in that direction.

                                 GRADEN
                 (Yelling)
                        Where are you headed?

           Warren turns.

           The Vision of Graden stands across the trench, on the 
           highway. He motions for Warren to follow him.

                                 WARREN
                        I know where I’m going.

                                 GRADEN
                        This way!

                                 WARREN
                        Leave me alone.

           Warren continues his own way. Leaving Graden behind.

                                 GRADEN
                        It’s not time yet.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 GRADEN
                        You know, brother. It’s not time.

           Warren pauses and considers, staring out into the open land - 
           WIND RUSTLES. 
           He changes direction and forges toward Graden, sliding 
           awkwardly down and then back up onto the road. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY -- LATER

           Warren watches the back of Graden’s head as he follows him 
           along the side of the highway.

           Graden turns on occasion to watch Warren’s progress.

           Time passes. 

           An eighteen wheeler flies by. 

           Warren raises a hand with some effort...

           It keeps moving.

           Warren sits on the ground.

                                 WARREN
                        I’ll rest a bit now.

           Warren stares up at Graden and holds his gaze for a moment.  
           He stares back down at his hands.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I can barely feel them.

           Warren shivers.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Graden?

           Warren looks up... 

           GEORGE, 30s, Anishinaabe/Obijiwe, in a mechanic’s uniform 
           covered by an army parka, stands over him. Next to him, 
           EUGENE and JOE, 7, THE TWINS.

                                 GEORGE
                        You go into the ditch back there?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay.

           Warren looks behind... shockingly, he’s not accomplished any 
           significant distance from the Explorer.
           INT. TOW TRUCK, HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

           George backs the tow truck up towards the Explorer. 

           A Canadian Army cap rests on the dashboard  Warren sits in 
           the passenger side. The Twins are in the back seat. 

           All arching their heads in unison watching Georges’s 
           precision driving.

           George opens the door of the tow truck. 

           Warren makes a move to get out.

                                 GEORGE
                        Stay in the truck.

           George shuts the door behind him.

           EXT. HIGHWAY 

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           - George connects the tow truck to the Explorer’s rear and 
           pulls it out.

           - George unhitches the tow truck and moves it to the front. 

           - George stares into the front windshield and sees bird 
           feathers and blood.

           - He finds Warren’s glove on the ground.

           - George pulls away with the Explorer in tow.

           INT. TOW TRUCK -- NIGHT   

           The Twins sleep in back as George drives. George watches 
           Warren, taking his eyes away from the road every now and then 
           to look across at Warren. 

           Warren struggles to keep his eyes open.

                                 GEORGE
                        What happened?

                                 WARREN
                        I think a bird smashed into the 
                        window causing me to loose control 
                        of the truck? 
           George pulls a black feather out of his pocket and places it 
           onto the dashboard.

                                 GEORGE
                        Or the truck hit into the bird 
                        causing it to die... 
                                  (Beat)
                        Where you headed to?

                                 WARREN
                        I’m not sure.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who is Graden?

                                 WARREN
                        My brother.

           George slows the tow truck...

                                 GEORGE
                        Where is he?

           Warren leans back 

                                 WARREN
                        Dead.

           The tow truck pushes ahead.

           EXT. EABAMETOONG FIRST NATION - NIGHT

           The tow truck makes it way down a rural road with small homes 
           and trailers... some lit by porch lights.

                                 GEORGE
                        You can sleep inside.

           They pull up to a dimly lit trailer.

           INT. EABAMETOONG FIRST NATION -- TRAILER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren lies on a couch. George deposits first Eugene and then 
           Joe, on the adjacent couch and floor, respectively.

           George lights a fire in a small wood stove. He removes 
           burning charcoal, placing it on the hearth pad to cool. 

                                 GEORGE
                 (Softly spoken in 
                  Anishinaabemowin)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        We offer our prayers, tobacco, and 
                        out hearts. Thank you for the 
                        Grandfathers and Grandmothers of 
                        yesterday, today and tomorrow.

           He removes tobacco from a pouch and scatters it into a bowl. 
           He places the bowl on top of the stove.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                 (Softly spoken in 
                  Anishinaabemowin)
                        Thank you spirits of the winds, 
                        water, fire and earth.

           He marks the boys head with the cool piece of charcoal.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                 (Softly spoken in 
                  Anishinaabemowin)
                        Thank you spirits of the north, 
                        east, south and west. Please help 
                        us to live a good life.

           He moves to mark Warren. Warren blocks his hand.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Helps brother’s spirit leave limbo.

           Warren lets go. George marks Warren’s face with charcoal and 
           takes leave...

           Warren watches Eugene’s chest rise and fall - taking comfort.

           He closes his eyes and opens them. 

           Watching Eugene’s chest rise and fall. 

           Warren closes his eyes.

           SOUNDS of the SWAMP rise.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SWAMP VISION -- NIGHT

           SOUNDS from the SWAMP continue... we push through water 
           tupelo and bald cypress trees into the center of the swamp. 
           Graden’s body floats face down.

           INT. TRAILER -- KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM -- DAWN

           Warren awakens. His face covered with charcoal markings.  
           A soft light radiates from kitchen. The Twins sleep soundly. 
           Both of their faces marked with charcoal.

           The couch he lies upon is in a small den that opens into the 
           kitchen. 

           Warren rises, joining George who putters around in the 
           kitchen.

                                 WARREN 
                 (Referring to charcoal 
                  marking)
                        This work?

                                 GEORGE
                        Won’t hurt. Boys are younger, more 
                        open to the walking spirits.

           George shrugs his shoulders.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        When did your brother pass on?

                                 WARREN
                        Forty-four years ago.

                                 GEORGE
                        Long time in limbo. 

           Warren flinches, barely. He wants to change the subject. He 
           recovers with a glance over at the Twins.

                                 WARREN
                        Those boys got a mama?

                                 GEORGE
                        Dead. Cancer. 

           George closely examines Warren. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You ever been in war?

                                 WARREN
                        No. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Eats at the mind. Sticks to you. On 
                        you. Death. With death always at 
                        your door... you learn to live in 
                        fear. People don’t want to be 
                        around it. They run from it. Those 
                        boys... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        when it became just me and them, 
                        helped me find life’s direction 
                        again... Peace. Without them I’d be 
                        fucked.

                                 WARREN
                        Not everyone has a choice. 

           George nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe so, although it is a lonely 
                        life with no peace. That is until 
                        The Creator has decided the end has 
                        come for you... You and the spirit 
                        who walks with you. Maybe you were 
                        already taken a long time ago. It’s 
                        hard to say. 

           George walks over to the sleeping Twins. He sits with them, 
           softly jostling them awake.

           INT. BATHROOM 

           Warren enters the small adjacent bathroom. He wipes his face 
           and rids himself of the dark black, charcoal markings. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER   

           Warren returns to the kitchen. The Twins sit, each eating Cup 
           Noodles.

                                 GEORGE
                        Breakfast?

           George holds up a styrofoam cup for Warren.

           EXT. TRAILER -- JUNK YARD -- MORNING 

           The first morning light barely peeks through the trees beyond 
           as Warren follows George out into a yard filled with trucks 
           and car parts. 

           EXT. JUNK YARD -- GARAGE

           The Explorer is raised on a jack. The front tire is replaced. 
           The old tire sits adjacent, mangled and crushed.

                                 WARREN
                        How much do I owe?
                                 GEORGE
                        It’s a used tire. Old rim.

                                 WARREN
                        And the tow? Labor?

                                 GEORGE
                        I was driving this way. Picked up 
                        the boys from their grandmothers.

           Warren opens his wallet - pulls several twenties and hands 
           them over. George takes what Warren offers.

           INT./EXT. GARAGE -- EXPLORER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Warren backs out from the garage with George and Twins 
           looking on. He puts the Explorer into park.

           Warren checks over his yellow notepad. It reads: “Hope?”

           He brakes next to George.

                                 WARREN
                        You know of a place called Hope?

                                 GEORGE
                        We live in Eabametoong. White folk 
                        call it Fort Hope, but it is not 
                        our name. Nearby there is a 
                        mountain called Great Mountain - 
                        Kitchi Wajiw -  White folk call it 
                        Hope mountain... they like to 
                        rename things to take for their 
                        own.

           He points into the distance.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Kitchi Wajiw is not part of the 
                        reserve. Road to the mountain heads 
                        northwest. People go there to get 
                        lost. Hearst is to the East.

           Warren scribbles in his yellow notebook - drawing a small 
           map. 

           George steps to his truck, he returns with Warren’s glove and 
           hands it over to Warren and walks away.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (To the Twins) 
                        Let’s go.
           George and The Twins proceed to the trailer. George turns 
           back toward Warren. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t kill anymore birds!

           Warren nods. George nods back. George and The Twins enter the 
           motorhome. He closes the door behind them.

           INT./EXT. EABAMETOONG FIRST NATION -- EXPLORER (MOVING)

           Small houses and trailers sit far apart in a random mix. 
           Electric lines and their posts loom large. The town center 
           has little in offerings: only a few stores and town clinic. 

           EXT. FORD EXPLORER (MOVING)-- HIGHWAY -- MORNING

           Warren merges back onto the highway heading East.

           EXT. EXIT TO HEARST - FORD EXPLORER (MOVING) -- MORNING

           Heavy, dark, clouds fill the sky. The Explorer exits the 
           highway into the small town of Hearst.

           Warren parks in the center of town and listens to his 
           cellphone message...

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        I made a reservation at the local 
                        boarding house. Off Main on Queen.

           Warren writes on the notepad.

           EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- FOR EXPLORER (MOVING) -- MORNING 

           Warren passes modest storefronts, mostly occupied by mom-and-
           pop shops & restaurants - a blue collar flashback to 
           yesteryear. 

                                 ETTA (O.C.)
                        They have one room left, so check 
                        in as soon as you arrive. It’s next 
                        to a store called Greeny’s Depot.

           Canadian flags hang from lamp posts. 

           PEDESTRIANS moving about are bundled in winter wear.
           INT./EXT. QUEEN STREET -- FORD EXPLORER -- MORNING

           The Explorer turns onto a side street and parks in front 
           Greeny’s Depot with mural of forest painted across the front.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Call me. As soon as you get this.

           He unloads bags, puts his notebook into his brown paper, 
           research bag. Makes his way next door to...

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- MORNING

           Warren rings the BELL of a large Victorian brown brick home 
           in neglected condition. 

           A moment passes.

           EDWARD, 50s, answers the door. A stocky, small man, hobbit-
           like - breathing heavily. His hair is long, a reddish grey. 
           He wears a “Fu Manchu” mustache.

           DOGS BARK out back.

                                 WARREN
                        I’m Warren--

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh, you betcha. Wasn’t sure when 
                        you’d arrive. I’m headed out, but 
                        will show you up real quick.

           The DOGS continue to BARK. Edward moves to the side making 
           room for Warren in the foyer. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM -- BOARDING HOUSE -- MORNING

           A spartan waiting room with a small colonial writing desk and 
           several straight back chairs give way to a narrow stairway to 
           the second floor.

           Warren removes his hat and gloves. 

           Edward notices Warren’s hand, but quickly averts his eyes.

                                 EDWARD
                        My parents lived here for forty 
                        years. After my father died, my 
                        mother turned it into a bed and 
                        breakfast... Once she passed on, I 
                        took over. Now it’s a boarding 
                        house. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDWARD (CONT'D)
                        Youse certainly wouldn’t want to 
                        taste my cooking. There’s a small 
                        kitchenette in your room.

           BARKING is nonstop. 

           Edward stares at Warren’s hand.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        That’s Buddy and Buster. Beagles. 
                        They saw me packing up and they’re 
                        ready to run. They’ll shut up soon 
                        enough. Taking some folks hunting 
                        for snowshoe hair. You a hunter? 

                                 WARREN
                        No.

           Edward leads and Warren follows as they climb the narrow 
           stairway to the top.

                                 EDWARD
                        Dolores cleans in the mornings. If 
                        youse don’t want your room cleaned, 
                        put the sign on your door at night 
                        or else you’ll wake up finding 
                        Dolores. 

           Edward chuckles.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- SECOND FLOOR 

           A slim hallway that connects six rooms - all doors are closed 
           except for a shared bathroom at the end.

                                 EDWARD
                        We’re full to capacity. Got a 
                        couple snowshoers... you snowshoe?

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 EDWARD
                        Washroom at end of hall. If the 
                        door’s locked, someone needs 
                        privacy. And if youse need privacy, 
                        lock the door or else you’ll get 
                        unwanted visitors. 

           Edward stops at the door closest to the stairs and opens with 
           a key that he hands over to Warren.
           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- WARREN’S ROOM  

           A twin bed with a patchwork bedspread, two pleather, olive 
           green chairs, and a dresser with colonial flourishes. 

           Along one side is a kitchenette: consisting of a mini-
           refrigerator, microwave, and mugs.

           Warren drops the duffle and grocery bag on the bed.

                                 EDWARD
                        There’s a squall out there that’s 
                        surely shaping into a storm. Once 
                        in a while a real bugger rolls 
                        around, locks us in for days. Stock 
                        up in the store. Never know how 
                        long it will last, eh? Good for the 
                        folks that like to cross country 
                        ski... but not for everyone else. 
                        You ski?

                                 WARREN
                        No. 

           Warren stares out from one of two large windows. He puts his 
           hand over the crack - cold air shoots through a stuck window.

                                 EDWARD
                        We’ll get someone up here to fix 
                        that. Your sister said you’ll be 
                        here for a week and decide from 
                        there, eh? I told her cash only.

           Warren takes out some Canadian cash from his wallet. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Two-fifty loonie will do ya.

           Warren hands some bills over. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure doing business with youse.

           Edward exits into the hallway counting the money. A “DO NOT 
           DISTURB” sign swings. 

           Warren hangs it on the outside, shuts it, and locks it.

           Warren empties the grocery bag - placing the brown paper 
           research bag on one of the pleather chairs. He removes his 
           camera, coffee, and Cup Noodles - placing these items on the 
           counter.
           INT. MAIN STREET -- FORD EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren drives down Main Street and turns into...

           INT. GROCERY STORE -- AISLE -- MOMENTS LATER 

           A modest, small town grocery store - a few LOCALS glance in 
           Warren’s direction. A new face in town.

           He picks up groceries and a local Hearst, tourist’s map and 
           cashes out.

           INT. PARKING LOT -- FORD EXPLORER (PARKED)   

           Warren wears reading glasses as he examines the map. 

           INSERT: He uses a finger to follow the main street until the 
           end of town. He finds the reservation and a road cutting 
           northwest. The map dead-ends at the forest’s edge. The forest 
           goes on forever... 

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY

           Warren enters.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- ROOM    

           Warren locks the door behind him. He puts groceries away and 
           makes instant coffee, warming water in the microwave. 

           He reopens the Hearst map and the Ontario map on the bed. 

           He turns to the pleather chair where he placed his brown 
           paper research bag - the bag is missing. 

           His eyes dart about. It’s nowhere.

           Warren unmakes his bed, he pushes up the mattress, he opens 
           drawers, and moves the dresser away from the wall.

           LATER --

           Warren paces the room. He nervously wrings his hands.

                                 WARREN
                        Someone knows...

           The Vision of Graden stands at the window - looking outside. 
           Warren sighs with momentary relief.
                                 GRADEN
                        Steady, brother.

                                 WARREN
                        I thought you moved on.

                                 GRADEN
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           Warren stands next to Graden and looks outside.

                                 WARREN
                        I knew that. I did.

           Warren suddenly runs out from the room.

           INT./EXT. FORD EXPLORER (PARKED) -- DAY

           Warren marches through gentle snowfall to his vehicle.

           Warren scavenges inside, underneath the seats, in the glove 
           compartment... nothing.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- BACK HALLWAY -- EDWARD’S ROOM

           Warren KNOCKS on Edward’s downstairs door. No answer.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- STAIRS -- DAY

           Warren bounds up the stairs. He spots through the railing...

           Feet moving on the second floor towards...

           INT. HALLWAY/SECOND FLOOR -- THE NEIGHBORING ROOM  

           Warren ascends the rest of the stairs, the adjacent GUEST 
           ROOM door closes.

           Warren POUNDS on the door. 

           A BEARDED MAN (late 30s) opens the door. He’s large in 
           stature, but doesn’t look well. His skin is pale with a green 
           hue and his eyes red and watering.

                                 WARREN
                        I’m missing things from my room. 

           The Bearded Man is confused by Warren.
                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m right next to you. Right 
                        there... You go in there? 

           Warren points to his room.

                                 BEARED MAN
                        What? I have been up all night. 
                        Puking my brains out. Can’t barely 
                        make it to the bathroom.

           The Bearded Man closes the door. Warren inserts his foot at 
           the bottom, stopping the door’s movement short.

                                 WARREN
                        I saw you wandering and everyone is 
                        gone. There’s only you. 

                                 BEARED MAN
                        I told ya, I’m supposed to be 
                        hunting, but I’m sick. I have to 
                        go... Sorry.

           Warren bulldozes forward. The Bearded Man pushes him back.

                                 BEARED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Stay away, old man. I told ya, 
                        you’re gonna get hurt. 

           Warren tries to thrust the Bearded Man aside. Bearded Man 
           raises his arm swatting Warren away like a fly. 

           Warren hits the wall, bashing his head and landing on the 
           floor. A wound on his forehead begins to bleed.

                                 BEARED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus! I’m sorry. You made me! I 
                        told ya! You’re fucking crazy, old 
                        man! 

           The Bearded Man closes the door. The lock CLICKS. 

           Warren picks himself off the ground. 

           INT. HALLWAY -- THIRD DOOR

           Warren knocks on the adjacent door. No answer.

           INT. WARREN’S ROOM -- LATER

           Warren sits on the bed, in the upended room, with a rolls of 
           paper towels. He blots his head.
           The Vision of Graden is no longer. 

           The front door BUZZES. 

           Warren stares out the window. 

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- DAY

           Miriam stands at the front door nervously picking her face.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- SITTING ROOM -- DAY

           Warren descends the stairs and opens the door with pieces of 
           paper towel adhering to his head. 

           He steps aside letting Miriam in.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Lyman told me you were staying at a 
                        boarding house. There’s only one in 
                        town. I called your cell phone. You 
                        didn’t pick up.

           He pats himself down. No phone.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        You need stitches?

                                 WARREN
                        No. It’s okay. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Hold on.

           Miriam pushes out the front door, back outside. 

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE   

           She runs to the KIA and opens the trunk. She rummages inside.

           INT. SITTING ROOM

           Warren touches the soaked piece of paper towel covering the 
           wound. There is blood on his fingers. He wipes them across 
           his pants.

           Miriam returns with a small first aid pack.

                                 MIRIAM
                        It’s freezing out there. 
           Mirima shuffles through the box. She locates a large sized 
           band aid.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        This should do it.

           Miriam pulls the wrapping off and places the bandage across 
           the wound in a haphazard manner.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. My hands are blocks of ice.

                                 WARREN
                        I have coffee.

           Miriam nods.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get you one.

           Warren heads up the stairs. He pauses and unexpectedly 
           realizes that Miriam follows. He continues up the stairs.

           INT. WARREN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Miriam looks over the wrecked room. Warren is self conscious. 

                                 WARREN
                        I think someone broke in. I’m 
                        missing things. 

                                 MIRIAM
                 (Alarmed)
                        Who?

           Warren shakes his head.

           Miriam begins to nervously clean the room.

                                 WARREN
                        You don’t have to do that.

                                 MIRIAM
                        It couldn’t have been him. He 
                        doesn’t even know...

           Warren makes coffee as Miriam continues cleaning up.

           Warren brings the cup to her. Miriam sits on a chair.

           Warren sits on the bed across from her. A drop of blood seeps 
           out from the bandage.
                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        You know my name.

           Warren nods. Miriam shudders.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to get mixed up in 
                        this, but I couldn’t live with 
                        knowing... something like that. It 
                        would be a terrible thing. 

                                 WARREN
                        Are you scared?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I am because you know my name.

           Miriam’s sob come from deep down. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        He knows me... things I’ve done.
                               (Breaks Down)
                        I’m on parole and I won’t go back. 
                        I’ll kill myself before that 
                        happens. I swear to God I will. 
                        I’ve done things, but I’m not an 
                        animal.

           Her cup shakes, coffee spills. She places the cup on the 
           ground. Her hands, covered with coffee. 

           She moves to the refrigerator and pulls off several paper 
           towels. She cleans her spot. 

           She sits next to Warren. He starts to get up.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Stay here.

           He sits back down.

           She dabs the wound on his head with a clean paper towel. 
           Genuine tears roll down her face. She holds onto his hands.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        I need sleep, but the thing is... 
                        when I finally do, I have awful 
                        dreams... 

           Beat.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Do you dream?
           Warren slowly nods.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        This sense of dread. It’s in the 
                        pit of my stomach. Rotting me.

           Miriam folds into herself and fully leans into Warren. She 
           continues a muffled cry. 

           Warren unsure what to do, places a awkward hand on her back.

           WARREN'S ROOM - DAY -- LATER

           Warren and Miriam both lie on the bed, side-by-side, fully 
           clothed. Miriam sleeps in a fetal position... her hands 
           grasping Warren’s arm. 

           Warren lies flat and stares at the ceiling. 

           Miriam opens her eyes.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Will you call the police? Isn’t 
                        that what you do?

                                 WARREN
                        Not this time. 
                                 (Beat)
                        Is that why you came here?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I came because... I didn’t know 
                        what I said--

                                 WARREN
                        Why didn’t you?

                                 MIRIAM
                        You know! Don’t make me say it!

           Miriam sits up. 

                                 WARREN
                        You told the truth. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Yeah.

                                 WARREN
                        Does he own a gun?

                                 MIRIAM
                        He did. Probably still does. 
           She gazes outward at sky.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        I should go. It’s Lyman’s car and 
                        he’ll be worried.

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- MIRIAM’S VEHICLE -- DAY

           Miriam and Warren stand next to the KIA, which is parked next 
           to the Explorer. Miriam puts her hand forward to shake 
           Warren’s, as if they are formal business partners.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Thank you, Warren. For the coffee.

                                 WARREN
                        Thank you... Uh...

           Warren continues his own way. Leaving Graden behind.

                                 MIRIAM
                 (Thin, plaintive)
                        You forgot it?

                                 WARREN
                        My minds not working. Don’t be 
                        hurt.

                                 MIRIAM
                        You a lush like me? You black out?

                                 WARREN
                        I am sick, but in a different way.

                                 MIRIAM
                        What way is that?

                                 WARREN
                        Don’t make me say it. When we spoke 
                        last, you mentioned where I could 
                        find Earl...

           Miriam stares hard at Warren.

                                 MIRIAM
                        I know I can trust you. 

           Moments later --

           EXT. SNOWY ROAD

           Warren’s Explorer follows close behind Miriam’s KIA.
           Off Warren...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           EXT. TOWNSEND FARM -- COTTON FIELD -- NIGHT

           A POV - but we don’t know whose - moves out of the forest 
           toward a cut-for-winter cotton field and a barn.

           EXT. TOWNSEND BARN -- NIGHT

           The barn door is slightly ajar, the POV peers through.

           A congregation of fifty some members of the local black 
           community gather; they sit, lean, and squat wherever a space 
           is found. There are mostly MEN, a few WOMEN, dressed in dark 
           colors. 

           Graden speaks with Mr. Townsend and a light skin MALE #1, 
           late 20s, who makes an effort to dress like one of the 
           farmers, but fails to convince.

           Graden stands on the back of a farm truck.

                                 GRADEN
                        We all know the risk... We’ll go 
                        anyway. It’s our right to vote and 
                        even the President of The United 
                        States says so. 

           There is a MUMUR of approval from the crowd.

                                 GRADEN (CONT’D)
                        They use dogs and fire against us 
                        because their ideas have lost 
                        force. And so they turn to force. 
                        But if we yield to these tactics, 
                        they will continue to use them. If 
                        we let them push us back, they will 
                        continue to push. The way to defeat 
                        them is simply not to be deterred. 
                        We will not be intimidated. Show 
                        them that the power they wield will 
                        not give them power over us. 

           LUTHER, 40s, slides through the door, out into the field, we 
           turn back to the door to discover it has been Warren’s POV 
           all along. He continues watching... 

           Graden finishes speaking and moves to the back of the room, 
           shaking people’s hands, moving towards Warren.
           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren at the wheel driving, he follows behind the Kia with 
           Miriam driving....

           EXT. HEARST -- EXPLORER (MOVING)

           We follow the Kia leading the Explorer to the outskirts of 
           town and back onto the highway.

           EXT. HIGHWAY -- HOPE MOUNTAIN -- LATER

           The Explorer follows the Kia. They veers off onto what looks 
           to be a single lane fire road, but is a country road heading 
           deep up into brush and trees. 

           The Kia pulls to the side, Warren pulls up next to it. Miriam 
           rolls down the window. She nods toward the country road.

                                 MIRIAM
                        It will take some time before you 
                        see it. Brown cottage. 

           Warren examines the road.

                                 WARREN
                        How long?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t know. 

           Miriam quickly takes off in the opposite direction. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - FORD EXPLORER -- LATER

           A steep grade, covered with packed snow. The Explorer climbs, 
           until it skids, almost hitting a mailbox.

           Through the trees, approximately two hundred yards away, is a 
           small brown cottage with green trim. 

           INT. EXPLORER (PARKED) 

           The snow quickly accumulates on the windshield. Warren turns 
           on the wipers. He spots a crew cab truck in his rearview 
           mirror making its way up the grade, towards where he sits.
           EXT. FOREST CLEARING -- FORD EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren continues up the hill and cuts his vehicle back into a 
           clearing. He watches...

           EXT. FOREST ROAD -- CREW CAB TRUCK 

           An UNIDENTIFIED MALE, 60’s, exits the cabin and lumbers to 
           the truck. After performing a rough three point turn the 
           truck returns down the hill. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING -- FORD EXPLORER 

           Warren pulls out and drives back to...

           EXT. FOREST ROAD -- MAILBOX

           Warren stops at the mailbox. He puts his glasses on and looks 
           inside - it’s junk mail with “Resident” as the receiver.

           EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- FOR EXPLORER (MOVING) -- DAY

           Warren follows the crew cab truck at a distance. The truck 
           pulls over to the side. Warren parks on the opposite side.

           The truck’s logo reads: Hutchinson’s Hunting. 

           INT./EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- EXPLORER (PARKED)

           Warren focuses his camera on...

           EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- HUTCHINSON’S HUNTING TRUCK 

           The Unidentified Male grips onto the top of the door pulling 
           himself out of the crew cab truck. He steps onto a sidewalk 
           and shuffles with a slight limp into a small market.

           INT./EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- EXPLORER (PARKED)

           Warren shoots photos until the Unidentified Male disappears 
           into the market. Off Warren...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964
           EXT. TOWNSEND BARN -- NIGHT

           Graden exits into the night air, dragging Warren with him.

                                 GRADEN
                        Who’s out here?

           Graden whirls about. He places a hand on Warren’s shoulder.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s me! Watching you! Those people 
                        are from the North. You shouldn’t 
                        be here. This is trouble.

                                 GRADEN
                        Trouble is that gin shack you spend 
                        so many nights at.

                                 WARREN
                        I don’t know what you think you’ve 
                        gotten into, but this is no good. 

           Warren shakes Graden’s hand loose.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going up the hill and minding 
                        my own business--

           Warren runs into the field.

                                 GRADEN
                        To get drunk is what you mean!

           Warren ignores Graden and keeps running.

           EXT. FOREST -- NIGHT

           We lead/follow Luther as he runs through the forest. He is on 
           alert and checks his surroundings as he runs into...

           EXT. MAIN ROAD -- LATER

           Luther exits the forest onto the main road, running along the 
           side. A car approaches...

           Luther ducks into the brush.

           The car passes.

           Luther resumes his journey.
           EXT. DRIVEWAY -- FARMHOUSE -- LATER

           Luther walks a long drive that ends at a farm home with 
           wraparound porch and a black Studebaker parked out front.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

           Luther grows closer... We see a dark figure sitting on the 
           porch smoking a cigar. Upon closer inspection it is revealed 
           to be... Patrick Olsen.

           Luther pauses for a moment

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        That you, Luther?

                                 LUTHER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        You got news for me?

                                 LUTHER
                        Yes, sir.

           Luther climbs the stairs.

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           INT./EXT. HEARST, MAIN STREET -- FORD EXPLORER (MOVING)

           Warren starts the car, puts it into gear, pulls away 
           continuing down the street.

           IN. GREENY’S DEPOT -- EXPLORER -- DAY

           Warren parks and exits from the Explorer with a reminder note 
           in hand. Through snowfall he watches as...

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY

           Edward and several HUNTERS remove limp, blood soaked rabbits 
           from the back of the truck. 

           INT. GREENY’S DEPOT -- DAY

           An all purpose store filled with outdoor gear, winter wear, 
           pet feed, dry goods, hardware, office and art supplies.  
           Warren checks his pockets for his glasses... unable to find 
           them... he squints in order to print out pictures from his 
           camera on the computer...

           Warren copies the Unidentified Male’s photo.

           Warren tries on reading glasses in the small mirror on the 
           stand. He notices his long forgotten, head wound needs 
           redressing. 

           He locates a first aid kit. 

           Warren refers to a reminder note - using his new glasses - 
           “ETTA’S FAX 555-555-1212.” 

           As the fax works it way through...

           Warren removes a single piece of paper from the fax machine. 
           He sketches a map depicting the Unidentified Male’s property: 
           The road, the clearing, and writes the letters “E” on top of 
           a square depicting the cottage.

                                 THOMAS (O.S.)
                        What happened to your hand?

           Warren flips over the hand-drawn map.

           THOMAS, 5, a blond haired boy stares at Warren. JUDITH, 30s, 
           spots her son across the way. She swoops in from behind.

                                 JUDITH
                        Thomas! What have we talked about?

           She grabs Thomas by the shoulders - her eyes land on Warren’s 
           maimed hand, but pretends she never did by averting her eyes.

           Warren pushes his hand in his pocket.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s no problem, ma’am.

                                 JUDITH
                        He knows better, but apparently he 
                        doesn’t this afternoon.

           Judith chuckles an uncomfortable laugh.

                                 JUDITH (CONT’D)
                        Thomas, you know not to be rude to 
                        people. Apologize to the man.

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m sorry.
                                 WARREN
                 (Mumbles)
                        It’s really no problem.

                                 JUDITH
                        His curiosity gets the best of him. 
                        I haven’t seen you around before? 
                        Are you new to Hearst? A hunter?

                                 WARREN
                        Just visiting, ma’am.

           Thomas tries to steal another look at Warren’s hand. 

                                 JUDITH
                        This is my boy, Thomas. I’m Judith. 

           Judith stares. Warren is not going to introduce himself.

                                 JUDITH (CONT’D)
                        Is your head okay?

                                 WARREN
                 (Shortening in temper)
                        It’s fine. I slipped.

                                 JUDITH
                        Well, if your not used to the snow 
                        and ice it can really get ya...

           Thomas moves ever-so-slightly towards Warren’s pocket to try 
           and look at Warren’s hand. 

           Warren suddenly jerks back, slightly hitting into Thomas.

                                 WARREN
                        Get the fuck away from me! 

           Judith pulls Thomas back in protection.

           Warren gathers his things, with one hand, continuing to hide 
           his maimed one. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean... I should be going. 

           Warren cashes out and makes a quick escape.

           EXT. GREENY’S DEPOT -- FORD EXPLORER -- DAY

           A trail of blood from Edward’s truck leads to the back of the 
           boarding house. Warren gets into the Explorer takes note of 
           the bloody bandage on his head.
           He awkwardly redresses his wound using the rearview mirror.

           He writes a note, on his newly purchased post-its, to 
           himself, “glasses in visor” and sticks the note with the many 
           others on the dashboard.

           INT./EXT. QUEEN STREET -- FORD EXPLORER -- NIGHT

           The Explorer is covered with snow. Warren uses the brush to 
           clear his vehicle.

           The Vision of Graden sits in the passenger seat.

           He returns to the wheel, throwing the brush into the back. A 
           CRUNCHING beneath... He shakes his head.

           He pulls the newly bought glasses out from under him. The 
           glass is intact, the frame is broken.

           Graden smiles. 

           Warren tapes the frame together with tape from the first aid 
           kit.

           Graden nods to Warren’s maimed hand.

                                 GRADEN
                        You never told me the whole story?

           Several snow plows ride past.

           Off Warren...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           INT. MISSISSIPPI, FOREST -- HILLSIDE GIN SHACK -- NIGHT

           In the forest sits a small, abandoned grain shed, that has 
           been cleaned and fashioned into a hang out. The radio turns 
           momentary static. 

           JOHN YOUNG, 19, readjusts the antenna and SAM COOKE is in the 
           middle of “Twistin’ The Night Away.”

           Warren along with THE TITTLE BROTHERS - SAM & RONNIE, 20’s 
           with their cousin, John Young, drink gin and play cards. 
           SEVERAL GIRLS party with them. Some are dancing.

           Warren - right hand perfectly formed at this time - fills 
           everyone’s drink with a jug of gin... he drinks his down and 
           refills it quickly again. He stops when he sees..
           PENNY NEWCOME, 20s, white with blond hair, blue eyes, thin 
           frame, and large chest, appears at the door with two white 
           GIRLFRIENDS who cower outside the shack’s door.

           Howlin’ Wolf sings, “Going Down Slow” on the radio. Everyone 
           looks away. Except...

           Warren who doesn’t look away... can’t look away.

           Penny beelines directly to him.

                                 WARREN
                        You shouldn’t be here, Miss.

                                 PENNY
                        You shouldn’t worry about it. 

           Penny places her hand on Warren’s chest and sways.

           Warren moves stiffly with her. 

           Her lips to his ear...

                                 PENNY (CONT’D)
                        Not like that... like how you dance 
                        with those other girls...

           He places one hand firmly on her upper arm.

           His other on her hip and begins to move more freely.

           Warren observes the smooth skin along her collarbone as she 
           rolls her head backward.

           The music abruptly stops. Warren and Penny look around - all 
           eyes are on them.

                                 GIRLFIRENDS (O.S.)
                        We should leave now, Penny.

           Penny runs to where she first left her Girlfriends, they dart 
           outside together. 

           The music turns back on.

           EXT. ROAD -- FOREST -- NIGHT

           Warren walks home for the evening. He visualizes...
           INT. HILLSIDE GIN SHACK -- FLASHBACK

           Penny’s dress, her hips, her collarbone as she throws her 
           head back pressing against him.

           EXT. ROAD -- FOREST -- NIGHT

           Warren runs into the forest. 

           He drops to his knees onto the spongy underbrush, he 
           pleasures himself against a tree. 

           Passionate SIGHING to an orgasmic HOWL.

           He falls onto the tree. 

           He exits the forest and continues on the main road.

           DAYS LATER --

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN -- FARM TRUCK ON STREET -- DAY

           Warren exits a store carrying a crate of canning jars; moving 
           towards the farm truck in the distance.

           Out of the corner of his eye... 

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN -- SERVICE STATION

           A Girlfriend (from gin shack) of Penny Newcome, chats with 
           THREE WHITE MEN - one is Dewey - with slicked back hair. 
           Adjacent to them is a blue, Pontiac GTO. They all turn to 
           stare in Warren’s direction.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN -- STREET

           Warren quickens his pace and avoids eye contact... 

                                 DEWEY (O.S.)
                        Hey! Hey! I know you hear me!

           RUNNING FOOTSTEPS grow louder, closing in. A white hand lands 
           firmly on Warren’s shoulder and violently swings him around.

           Canning jars crash to the ground. 

           Warren is pushed down, on top the of shards of glass.

           Feet kicking and pounding on Warren. 
           A fist hammers against Warren’s jaw. 

           MOMENTS LATER --

           Warren’s POV watching the blood trail his wounds leave behind 
           as he is dragged across the street moving closer towards...

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI TOWN -- SERVICE STATION 

           Penny’s Girlfriend with terror in her eyes.

                                 DEWEY
                        Is this him? Is this the one that 
                        put his hands on Penny?

           Warren is pushed up, on display, in front of her.

           Penny’s Girlfriend nods, sobs, and runs for cover into the 
           station. Warren’s body slacks, he slumps backward...

           Dewey removes his jacket, throws it into his Pontiac GTO. His 
           perfectly coiffed hair becomes loose, a piece falls, to 
           dangle and bounce in his face as his anger grows.  

                                 DEWEY (CONT’D)
                     (Screaming)
                        You want to touch my girlfriend? 
                        Grab his hand...

           The trunk of the Pontiac is lifted...

           Warren’s hand is pressed against the inside, above the 
           taillight. The White Men SLAM the trunk downward - onto 
           Warren’s hand.

           And again... they lift the trunk again and SLAM it down...

           Warren falls onto the ground.

           Warren watches the White Men SHOUT... It’s indiscernible to 
           him... He can’t hear... pain has taken over.

           The White Men return to the station and reappear with fresh 
           colas. They get into the GTO and drive away.

           Warren is left bleeding in the dirt. He focuses beyond his 
           mangled hand and the trail of blood across the street at...

           EXT. PATRICK OLSEN'S STORE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Earl stands outside staring towards Warren’s limp body...
           Daniel Olsen - hare lip and cleft pallet - collects Earl from 
           out front and takes him inside.

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           INT./EXT. QUEEN STREET -- FORD EXPLORER (PARKED) -- NIGHT

           Warren observes the falling snow. The street lights have 
           icicles hanging from them. 

           The Vision of Graden is no longer there.  

           Warren exits the vehicle. The supply store’s lights turn off, 
           closing for the evening. He crosses to...

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT 

           It’s dark, with the exception of outdoor lights illuminating 
           the back of the yard. Warren walks through the downstairs 
           hallway to the back window. Through ice frosted windows...

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT

           Edward and another HUNTER at a makeshift plywood table next 
           to a small work shed. 

           They hack off the snowshoe rabbits’ heads and feet under a 
           glaring white light.

           INT. WARREN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Warren enters, locking the door behind him. The wind blows 
           through the open window. 

           He drops into a pleather chair, closes his eyes. 

                                 WARREN
                        It’s so loud. The blood flowing 
                        through my body.

           SOUNDS of the SWAMP rise.

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI SWAMP VISION -- NIGHT

           SOUNDS from the SWAMP continue... we push through water 
           tupelo and bald cypress trees into the center of the swamp. 
           Graden’s body floats face down.
           INT. WARREN’S ROOM -- MORNING 

           Warren remains slumped in the same chair from the night 
           before. His eyes closed, his skin grey. Almost lifeless. 

           His eyes open, darting about with uncertainty.

           KNOCK on the door. 

           Warren focuses on the door with fear. He walks to it and 
           unlocks it, partially opens and stares out...

           Edward waits on the other side. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t like any problems here.

           Warren opens fully.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        There’s a call for you.

           Edward arches his neck to examine Warren as he moves toward 
           the stairs. Warren follows Edward out. 

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- HALLWAY DAY.

           Warren picks up the phone in the small hallway behind the 
           sitting room. Edward disappears behind a closed door.

           Dogs BARKING outside.

                                 WARREN
                        Yes?

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Warren. Thank goodness, I’ve been 
                        trying to reach you. Where have you 
                        been?

           Silence.

                                 ETTA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Why haven’t picked up your phone?

                                 WARREN
                        I’ve lost it.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Oh, Warren! The owner said you were 
                        having problems with another guest?
                                 WARREN
                        Mama?

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                 (Incredulous)
                        It’s Etta. Your sister.

                                 WARREN
                        God, you sound like Mama.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        She has no idea you’re up there!

                                 WARREN
                 (Covering up)
                        I know, but you’re getting to be 
                        like her.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        You’re worrying me. Should I come 
                        up there?

           Warren stares at his arm. Earl’s address.

                                 WARREN
                        No! 
                          (Warren whispers) 
                        My bag was stolen. My folders are 
                        gone. Someone knows...

           Warren glances out the window to the back yard. 

           EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY

           The bounty of Edward’s hunting trip - skinned rabbits - hang 
           across a wooden pole. They flap in high winds that blow.

           The beagles jump into the air in an attempt to snag a rabbit.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        I don’t like this, Warren. Are you 
                        sure it was stolen?

                                 WARREN (O.S.)
                 (Warren whispers angrily)
                        Do you think I’m lying?

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        No. I don’t. But when we get older 
                        we lose things, we forget--
                                 WARREN (O.S.)
                        I know what is happening! I know 
                        what is going on!

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                   (Calming)
                        Don’t be confronting anyone.

           Beat.

                                 ETTA  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I got the fax. He doesn’t look the 
                        same. Too full in the face--

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- DAY

           Warren smacks the wall with the palm of his maimed hand.

                                 WARREN
                 (Whispers, impatiently)
                        He’s gained weight. He’s older.

           Edward exits the back room. He observes Warren for a moment, 
           then exits outside - back to the rabbit carcasses. 

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        How can you be a hundred percent 
                        sure?

                                 WARREN
                        I’m not yet.

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Call the police when you are.

           Warren looks outside.

           EXT. BACKYARD 

           Edward bags rabbit parts, while intermittently YELLING at his 
           beagles. 

                                 WARREN 
                        The ugly way we treat one 
                        another...

                                 ETTA (O.S.)
                        Do you hear me, Warren?

           Warren barely listens to these words. Her voice is muffled.
           INT. WARREN’S ROOM -- LATER

           Warren removes a cup of hot water and adds instant coffee. He 
           opens the mini refrigerator and takes out the milk. Inside... 

           The brown paper research bag. He removes it.

           He stares at Graden’s composition notebook with his name 
           written on the front of it. He touches Graden’s name.

                                 WARREN
                        Goddamn losing it. Please let me 
                        finish what I started. Help me keep 
                        my broken mind straight.

           He sits abruptly on a chair with the bag in his lap.

           Warren removes the photo of the Eight Men walking down 
           courtroom stairs - he focuses on Earl. 

           He places it next to the photo of the Unidentified Local.

           INT. HEARST LIBRARY -- COMPUTER DESK -- DAY  

           Warren, appearing wan and tired, searches through Hearst 
           telephone books dating back several years.

           INSET: Warren’s finger runs over the D’s and the O’s... 
           trying to locate a “Daniel” or an “Olsen.”

           Warren logs onto a computer and tries to locate the address 
           of the cottage on a GPS map program... to no avail.

                                 BARB (O.S.)
                        Good morning, Mr. Daniel.

           Warren raises his head and observes through a space between 
           books on the library shelf...

           INT. LIBRARY -- FRONT DESK 

           The Unidentified Male/Mr. Daniel waits for BARB, 40s, to 
           return to the check-out desk. Earl leans against the counter. 

           Barb reappears a moment later. 

                                 BARB
                        Here you go!

           Barb presents what looks to be a large stack of newspapers 
           and magazines. 
                                 UNIDENTIFIED MALE
                        Have a good one.

                                 BARB
                        Stay warm out there.

           The Unidentified Male shuffles through the contents as he 
           moves away from the desk.

           INT. LIBRARY -- LOBBY

           The Unidentified Male exits the library.

           INT. LIBRARY -- FRONT DESK

           Warren returns the phone books to Barb.

                                 BARB
                        Find what you need?

                                 WARREN
                        I’m not sure, maybe... You know, I 
                        think I recognized that man? Earl 
                        is it?

                                 BARB
                        Yes. Earl Daniel. He comes in every 
                        so often to pick up mail... Not a 
                        lot of it though. People don’t 
                        really write anymore, we do most 
                        things online, I suppose. I guess 
                        he makes it easier on the mailman 
                        by coming in here, rather than 
                        heading up the mountain.

                                 WARREN
                        I understand. Thank you.

           Warren turns to leave.

                                 BARB 
                        It’s funny. You both have the same 
                        accent.

           Warren lingers.

                                 WARREN
                        We do?
                                 BARB
                        I’m pretty good with dialects. It’s 
                        from the south... faint, but I hear 
                        it. Well, have a good one.

           Warren meanders with careful steps out of the library.

           INT. HEARST FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH -- MORNING

           The church is filled with eighty-or-so PARISHIONERS. 

           INT. BACK PEWS

           Warren sits in the last pew. His exhaustion apparent. His 
           hand tremors. He controls it by pushing it under his leg. His 
           pew is vacant with exception of the Vision of Graden sitting 
           at his side.

           INT. HEARST FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH -- FRONT OF CHURCH

           The CHOIR sings the “Holy, Holy, Holy” hymn. REVERAND SCOTT 
           sits adjacent to the podium.

           The choir sits down. Reverand Scott rises to the podium. 

                                 REVERAND SCOTT
                        Greetings to you all on this Sunday 
                        morning. I see some familiar faces 
                        that are with us time and time 
                        again to celebrate our Lord and 
                        Savior. And I also see new faces 
                        who are welcome to join us to 
                        rejoice in His name. 

           The Unidentified Male will now be called Earl. Earl sits in 
           the front pew.

           Reverand Scott smiles and looks pointedly at Warren.

                                 REVERAND SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Are there any new or visiting 
                        members who would like to introduce 
                        themselves at this time?

           The Parishioners swivel about, following the Reverand’s gaze, 
           which lands on Warren. Earl swings around spotting...
           BACK PEWS

           Warren remains motionless, stone-like, as if he were still 
           enough he would disappear. There is no Vision of Graden 
           through Earl’s eyes.

           FRONT OF CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Reverand Scott CLEARS HIS THROAT. 

           The Parishioners turn to face the front. Earl follows suit.

                                 REVERAND SCOTT
                        Job was holy and yet he suffered. 
                        Satan will come like a flood with 
                        hardship and Christians will 
                        observe sorrow and trouble. And 
                        just as God brought Job out of his 
                        affliction, so He will bring us out 
                        even though we, too, will go 
                        through the fire. God causes the 
                        rain to fall on both the just and 
                        the unjust. Take down Your wall of 
                        protection, God! Put us to the 
                        test.  

           Earl turns to glance, once again, toward the back....

           BACK PEWS

           The pew is empty. Warren is no longer there.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- WARREN’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Warren stands at the window with the Vision of Graden. The 
           wind blows harshly into the room. The window crack remains.

                                 GRADEN
                        It’s never gonna be fixed.

                                 WARREN
                        I know that.

           Warren nods in agreement.

           INT. MAIN STREET -- VILLAGE RESTAURANT/COFFEE SHOP -- DAY

           It’s a dark afternoon as we look out a coffee shop window 
           through backward letters that spell VILLAGE RESTAURANT. 
           Thick snow flurries fall. A rising HUM as the wind whips and 
           stirs on the ground outside. 

           Warren’s Explorer is parked across the street. 

           It’s a cozy place with five tables and a counter that sits an 
           additional five. A TABLE ADJACENT TO THE COUNTER SITS...

           Earl with JARED AND JASON HUTCHINSON, 40s, eating together.

           A television hangs behind the counter announcing...

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        The Northern Ontario region is 
                        entering a weather advisory. A low 
                        pressure system is moving in this 
                        afternoon so we will expect 
                        freezing rain, sleet and snow. Be 
                        prepared for snow covered roads and 
                        limited visibilities.

           The shop door WHINES each time a customer enters or exits.

           Out restaurant window - Warren exits his Explorer and 
           cautiously crosses the street. His steps are uncertain. He 
           enters inside keeping his maimed hand concealed in his 
           pocket. 

           Warren sits at the counter several feet away from...

           Earl sharply glances Warren’s way. 

           Jason elbows Jared.

                                 JASON
                        Friend of yours, Earl?

                                 EARL
                        I just noticed him around.

                                 JARED
                        Know who he is?

           Earl shakes his head.

           A bowl of soup and coffee is set on the counter top in front 
           of Warren. Warren swallows a partial spoonful, but puts the 
           spoon down onto the side of the bowl.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                 (Across to Warren)
                        Hey there. Name’s Jared, this here 
                        is my brother Jason and this is 
                        Earl.
           Warren pauses, caught off guard. He manages a light nod.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        New to these parts?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes, sir.

           Jared and Jason break out laughing.

                                 JARED
                        Sir. Did you hear that? Now that is 
                        some respect!

           Earl remains quiet, his face expressionless.

                                 JARED (CONT’D)
                        Where you come from?

                                 WARREN
                        Detroit.

                                 JARED
                        What brings you up here?

           Warren hesitates.

                                 WARREN
                        Hunting.

                                 JASON
                        Good hunting up here... I had a 
                        couple tourists this year, took-’em 
                        up to a spot I know. They bagged a 
                        bull moose the size of an elephant. 
                        I grabbed one edge of his antlers 
                        and couldn’t reach the other edge. 
                        It’s rabbit season... if you’re 
                        looking for a place to stake out, 
                        let me know. 

           Warren stares into the bowl of soup. Still full. Uneaten.

                                 WARREN
                        I appreciate the offer, but I just 
                        assume to stay on my own.

                                 JASON
                        Suit yourself. Some of these 
                        forests can be a little tricky 
                        though. And not meaning to offend a 
                        fellow, but truth be told, you 
                        don’t look like a woodsman to me.
                                 WARREN
                        No offense taken. Maybe some of us 
                        are more than we appear.

           Warren gathers himself. He removes the wallet with his left 
           hand and pulls out bills, leaves them on the counter.

           He crosses the room.

           Earl glances upward and manages to steal another look as 
           Warren walks past, exiting out of the coffee shop.

           Jared and Jason CHATTER AWAY. Earl continues to watch Warren 
           outside, through the heavy winds and falling snow, until he 
           gets into his Explorer and drives away. 

           INT/EXT. HOPE MOUNTAIN -- FOREST ROAD -- DAY

           The Hutchinson Brother’s crew cab truck advances slowly up 
           the steep grade through a heavy snow fall; the 4WD wheels 
           slide on the icy snow, unsuccessfully gripping the ground 
           below. The pick-up stops.

           Earl struggles to get out. He removes a box from the back 
           filled with food supplies.

                                 EARL
                        I got it Jason, I appreciate the 
                        ride. Now go on and get home!

           Earl walks painstakingly up the hill as the truck reverses 
           down the steep mountain. 

           Earl slips on ice and the box falls from his hands... hitting 
           the ground hard -  his supplies, CRASH and scatter.

           Earl lifts his head and crawls towards the box. He gathers 
           random bits of food and glass, some salvageable, some beyond 
           repair - putting them back into the box.

           Earl attempts to stand, slips again, falling to the side. 

           He finally pushes himself upright and lumbers forward with an  
           increasingly pronounced limp. The wind blasts against Earl’s 
           cheeks, his breathing labored. 

           EXT. FOREST ROAD -- SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- DAY

           Earl sets his box of food down and rests at the mailbox. 

           Through the trees is the small brown cottage with green trim.
                                 EARL
                        Jesus christ.

           Earl picks up the box and continues on.

           EXT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- DAY

           Earl kicks the screen door open with his foot. He leans on 
           the unlocked door to open it. His hands still cradle the box.

           INT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- MAIN ROOM

           Rustic and worn, with a stone masonry fireplace and wooden 
           floors. Through an archway, stairs lead upwards. There is 
           melted snow in the foyer. 

                                 EARL
                        Hello?

           INT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK

           Earl turns into the kitchen - setting the box on the counter.

           Takes off his boots and wet socks. 

           Pours himself some water and drinks it.

           Out the kitchen window...

           EXT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- BACKYARD -- DUSK

           The immediate backyard is cleared of trees. The weather 
           worsens; sleet hits the windows... The official storm has 
           arrived.

           MAIN ROOM

           Earl returns and tracks a trail of melted snow with his 
           eyes... The path leads up to the fireplace. His eyes move up 
           the stone wall... The wall mount for a rifle is vacant.

           FOOTSTEPS. CREAKING.  Aware of another presence, Earl 
           turns...

           Warren appears under the archway at the bottom of the stairs. 
           His left hand wrapped around Earl’s rifle, his right inserted 
           into his pocket.

           Warren’s lips are chapped, his face cold and grey; his 
           sweatshirt/windbreaker combo lacking in proper coverage.
                                 WARREN
                        You Earl Olsen?

           Beat.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m guessing you know who I am.

           Earl glances at Warren’s boots - a pool of water gathers on 
           the floor beneath them.

                                 EARL
                        Your boots are wet. Could you 
                        remove them?

           Warren ignores him. He steps down fully into the main room. 

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen you on television. 
                        Newspapers too. News this far north 
                        doesn’t care much for what’s 
                        happening down in the States.

                                 WARREN
                        You must have gone to some trouble 
                        to get it then.

                                 EARL
                        You must have gone to some trouble 
                        to get here.

           They silently stare at one another.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll fix some tea, it looks like we 
                        may be here for awhile... weather 
                        isn’t looking too good.

           Warren silently watches Earl move into the kitchen - through 
           the back window he watches the growing blizzard outside.

           Off Warren...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           INT. MISSISSIPPI -- HILLSIDE SHACK MISSISSIPPI -- NIGHT

           Warren downs a cup of gin. Through his blurry vision the 
           Tittle brothers, along with John Young shake their heads at 
           his drunken state.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        It’s best you sleep it off.
           They exit the shack.

           Warren CHUCKLES to himself as he leans against the wall and 
           slides to the ground. He braces himself with his one good 
           hand to land on the ground. His right hand: newly bandaged.

                                 GRADEN (O.S.)
                        Figured this is where you’d be!

           Warren raises his eyes to see Graden standing above him.

                                 WARREN
                        Am I in trouble?

                                 GRADEN
                        Not yet. We better get you home, we 
                        have to be up early to help Papa.

           Graden lifts Warren off the ground.

                                 WARREN
                        You remember all the times I did 
                        your work? You sneaking to school.

                                 GRADEN
                        I know. I remember. But you don’t 
                        get a pay back for coming here. I 
                        told you this place is no good.

                                 WARREN
                        You just say that cause you don’t 
                        know how to have fun. You can’t 
                        dance like me.

           Warren performs a few exaggerated dance steps and snaps his 
           fingers with his one good hand. He looses his footing and 
           stumbles.

           Graden wraps his arm around Warren’s waist letting Warren 
           lean on him. Graden pulls Warren’s maimed hand closer into 
           him... Holding it close to his chest.

                                 GRADEN
                        Brother.

           Warren snaps the injured hand away - no pity.

                                 GRADEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be doing some real 
                        dancing if Papa finds you slept 
                        here.

           Graden and Warren walk out, arm-in-arm, into the dark night.
           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- FOREST DIRT ROAD -- NIGHT

           Graden and Warren move forward together on a road that passes 
           through the forest. The fall season leaves cover the ground.

           Warren staggers and stops.

                                 WARREN 
                        I gotta piss.

           EXT. FOREST 

           We lead/follow Warren into the dense trees, covered with fall 
           leaves and wade through tall grass toward a large growth 
           pine. Behind him...

                                 GRADEN (O.S.)
                        I’m gonna go ahead. You come when 
                        you’re ready.

           No response.

                                 GRADEN  (CONT’D)
                        You hear me?

                                 WARREN
                 (Calls back to him)
                        Yeah, I hear ya!

           Warren looks over his shoulder and through the trees...

           EXT. DIRT ROAD 

           Graden grins at his brother and disappears from view.

           EXT. FOREST  

           Warren sways until he anchors himself against the tree. He 
           unzips his pants with his good hand. 

           A LOW HUM from a car ENGINE BUILDS. 

           Warren stares beyond the trees... out onto the road... 
           headlights grow closer...

           A Studebaker passes on the nearby road, playing COUNTRY MUSIC 
           on it’s radio. 

           Warren hidden by the woods - attempts to twist around, but 
           his situation is precarious as he urinates against the pine 
           tree.
           CAR DOORS OPEN. Unrecognizable CHATTER. 

           One voice elevates...

                                 PATRICK (O.S.)
                        I know this boy. I’m mighty 
                        surprised you all don’t. This here 
                        is the famous Graden Williams! 

           Warren MUMBLES to himself.

           Distant CHATTER continues on as...

           Two additional sedans drive up and park parallel and closer 
           to where Warren stands.

           Warren pulls his pants up - struggling with his maimed hand 
           to fully zip up. Warren’s view partially blocked by leaves... 

           DIRT ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Earl Olsen greets the two additional sedans. He speaks to 
           Paul Proust inside one of the cars. Daniel Olsen with a hare 
           lip and cleft palate sits in the passenger seat.

                                 PAUL PROUST
                        Is that him?

                                 EARL
                        Says his name is Graden Williams 
                        and he’s off to fetch his brother 
                        from somewhere on the hill.

                                 PAUL PROUST
                        Bring him.

           Earl makes his way back over to where Graden stands.

           EXT. FOREST

           Warren’s POV stumbles a bit closer to...

           EXT. ROAD 

           Earl arrives at where Patrick Olsen, Marty Bavon, and Graden 
           stand on the side of the road. These are the men depicted in 
           the courthouse stairs picture.

           Earl speaks to the men, but too quiet for Warren to hear.
                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                       (To Graden)
                        Why don’t you get in the car, son?

                                 GRADEN
                        I thank you, sir, but it’s a 
                        pleasant night and I’d rather walk.

           Fear takes hold of Graden - he stares out into the dense 
           trees and tall grass. 

           Marty Bavon reaches out and grabs hold of Graden’s upper arm 
           and pulls him out of Warren’s view.

                                 MARTY BAVON
                        Get in the car, boy.

           EXT. FOREST  

           Warren takes a few additional, uncertain steps towards the 
           action, but falls to his knees. Partially drunk, partially in 
           fear. He tries to get up. He’s caught on his improperly 
           zipped pants.

           He looks up and stares... pain in his eyes - wide, aware - 
           mostly scared.

           Agony of indecision. Then, stillness.

           SILENCE.

           Car doors SLAM. Car ENGINES start.

           Warren falls on his back to quickly fasten his pants with his 
           good hand. He rises and stumbles through the woods toward... 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD/FOREST 

           Three cars speeding off in the distance. The rear of the 
           Studebaker is the last in the line.

           The convoy has traveled a great distance.

           Warren runs - lagging far behind with no possibility of 
           catching up. 

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           INT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- MAIN ROOM

           The WIND DRONES. 
           Earl observes a dazed Warren from across the room. He moves 
           towards him. Warren appears to be in a trance.

           Earl stands in front of Warren, offering the cup of tea. 

           Moments pass.

           Warren, still balancing the gun, becomes aware... he glances 
           at the table next to him - instructing Earl to place the cup.

           Earl does what he is told, then notices Warren’s maimed hand.

                                 WARREN
                        Look familiar? 

           Earl is disconcerted, he refocuses on his cup of tea - takes 
           a sip and forces himself to swallow.

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        It’s what happens when you touch a 
                        white girl.

           Warren stares at Earl. Waiting.

                                 EARL
                        I’ll answer your question. I’m Earl 
                        Olsen. I’m sure that comes as no 
                        surprise to you.

                                 WARREN
                        Why you using the last name Daniel?

           Earl stares, coldly.

                                 EARL
                        That was my Daddy’s name.

                                 WARREN
                        You mean you’ve been hiding. People 
                        think you’re dead.

                                 EARL
                        I told you. People up here don’t 
                        care much about all of that.

                                 WARREN
                        But you’ve been keeping your eye 
                        out. 

           Earl sits down - across from Warren. 

                                 EARL
                        You’re right, I’ve been keeping my 
                        eye out. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        I suppose you’ve suffered quite a 
                        bit over the years. I’m not gonna 
                        pretend that’s not true. You’re not 
                        the only one. 

                                 WARREN
                        Not the only one? Not the only one 
                        who has suffered?

           Warren scoffs with disgust.

                                 EARL
                        He did a terrible thing. I know 
                        that, but it was my fault he got 
                        involved. He wasn’t one of them and 
                        my Daddy didn’t need to die in no 
                        prison! He didn’t deserve it!

                                 WARREN
                        I got no interest in assigning 
                        fault.

                                 EARL
                        If you’re not interested in hearing 
                        about it, then what are you doing 
                        here? How did you find me?

                                 WARREN
                        It don’t matter how. What matters 
                        is everyone else is behind bars. 
                        Only one left living free is you.

                                 EARL
                        That’s too simple. There were lots 
                        of things going on back then, it 
                        got complicated. You, the courts, 
                        the FBI, the media... you ever 
                        think that maybe you just don’t 
                        know what went on that night?

           Warren grows agitated. His anger rises. He uncrosses his legs 
           and leans forward, gripping the rifle tightly.

                                 WARREN
                        I know plenty what happen that 
                        night. I know he was beat for 
                        hours. I know his chest was carved 
                        up. I know he was castrated. I know 
                        he lived through it all and was 
                        still alive when you dumped him 
                        into that swamp. I know more about 
                        that night than you could ever want 
                        to know in a hundred lifetimes.
           Warren pulls a picture from his coat, hands it to Earl.

           INSERT: Graden’s autopsy photo - a body mutilated.

           Earl’s face startled, though only giving so much. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen that? Did your Daddy 
                        see it? He got what he deserve.

                                 EARL
                        You don’t know what he deserved!

                                 WARREN
                        I know what he did.

           Earl puts the photo down. Something in Earl’s eyes conveys a 
           flash of guilt and remorse.

           A long pause.

                                 EARL
                        You gonna set things straight. Make 
                        everything right in the world by 
                        hauling me in? What do you really 
                        think you’ve accomplished so far? 
                        I’ll tell you what. Nothing! 
                        Nothings changed and sending me to 
                        prison ain’t gonna change nothing 
                        either.

           Warren rises. He rubs the last bit of melted snow from his 
           hair with his right hand.

                                 WARREN
                        I don’t need to change things. 
                        Never did. But you somehow think 
                        you get to walk free just because 
                        time has passed? 
                                   (Beat)
                        You don’t.

                                 EARL
                        Well, where’s the police then? 
                        Ain’t that how you work. Show up on 
                        the lawn of doddering old men with 
                        police and news crews. Just about 
                        time to call them in!

           Warren clenches his jaw. Determined.
                                 WARREN
                        Don’t need no police. Don’t need no 
                        news team... you’re the one who 
                        knows what I want to know.

                                 EARL
                        What’s that?

                                 WARREN
                        Why didn’t you take me too?

           Earl stares at Warren for an interminable beat. Off Earl...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI -- FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

           Young Earl sits on the stairs, staring up at Patrick Olsen 
           leaning back on a porch chair. 

           Two Sedans pull in front of the house...

           Daniel Olsen emerges from the shadows around the corner. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Earl, time to go home. Supper.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Now hold on, Daniel... we got some 
                        business to discuss. Luther paid a 
                        visit last week... he said some 
                        kinda weekly meeting going on... 
                        The kind that disturbs our very 
                        beliefs here in this great state of 
                        Mississippi. 

           Patrick spreads his legs apart, placing his fists against his 
           hips.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN (CONT’D)
                        You live on our land, you pay the 
                        dues. 

           Daniel Olsen anticipates a conversation he’s not gonna like. 
           Earl sits back down eager to listen.

           INT. TWO ROOM SHACK -- NIGHT -- LATER

           We’re caught in the middle of something... Earl sits, waits - 
           he watches across the table...
           Daniel Olsen holds his hand to his forehead - in deep 
           contemplation of a decision that carries a heavy weight.

                                 DANIEL
                        You can’t go. This is man’s work.

                                 EARL
                        I’m ready for it. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I hope that’s not true. This ain’t 
                        the kind of thing a man should ever 
                        be ready for, son.

           They hold each other’s gaze for an interminable beat.

                                 EARL
                        This is what’s best.

           Earl has made his decision. He won’t be swayed.

                                 DANIEL
                        It ain’t up to you to decide. I’m 
                        still your father.

           Earl rises from the table.

                                 EARL
                        And I appreciate what you’ve done 
                        for me, but what’s it gotten us? 
                        We live here in a shack, pick 
                        cotton, no better than a... (Earl 
                        stops himself.) Uncle Patrick lives 
                        a good life, in a nice house... 
                        He’s part of the community. He’s 
                        been trying for us! Why won’t you 
                        let him? We just need to help out 
                        every so often.

           Daniel sharply looks at Earl.

                                 DANIEL
                        You don’t know what it means--

                                 EARL
                        I ain’t had anything nice in my 
                        whole life. Don’t you get tired of 
                        doing everything the hard way?

                                 DANIEL
                        Son, every way is the hard way.

           Daniel Olsen gets up to serve himself coffee from the stove.
           Earl Olsen steps across the shack. He opens the front door 
           and moves out into darkness...

           EXT. YARD -- BETWEEN SHACK AND FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

           Earl Olsen, leading us, moves toward the farmhouse... a black 
           Studebaker and two sedans sit with a circle of WHITE MEN 
           smoking and waiting.

           Circle around... now moving away from the shack... we see 
           that Daniel Olsen follows - anguish on his face.

           Earl glances behind... then looks forward with a determined 
           focus...

           EXT. PATRICK OLSEN FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

           A circle of white men smoke and chatter amongst themselves: 
           Patrick Olsen, Marty Bavon, Blaine Plimpton, Rob and Barry 
           Tywater, Paul Proust.

                                 MARTY BAVON
                        You think he’s up there?

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Old Luther’s a good nigger. He said 
                        it goes on every week. Same time, 
                        same place. I lay good odds on it. 

           Earl stands alongside Patrick Olsen. 

                                 BARRY TYWATER
                        Breaking one in tonight?

           The Men laugh at Earl’s arrival.

           They nod at Daniel Olsen as he enters the circle. 

           INT. COUNTRY ROAD -- STUDEBAKER (MOVING)  

           Earl sits in back. Gravel crunches under the Studebaker’s 
           tires as it drives down the country road. Patrick Olsen at 
           the wheel, with Marty Bavon riding shotgun. 

           They listen to COUNTRY MUSIC.

           Earl sneaks a long look at Marty Bavon - a goblin-like 
           appearance with the essence of pure evil. Marty Bavon catches 
           his stare. 

           Earl shrinks back into the seat.
           The Studebaker slows and passes Graden pausing, then walking 
           on the side of the road. 

           The Studebaker stops and yanks into reverse. Realigning with 
           Graden, pacing along with his footsteps. 

           The Studebaker cuts in front of Graden and stops. 

           MOMENTS LATER --

           EXT. STUDEBAKER (PARKED)

           Earl notices Graden clenching his fists. Patrick and Marty 
           inch closer to Graden; closing in on the prey. 

           Graden’s eyes dart from man to man.

           Earl continued POV - he turns to see...

           Parking behind the Studebaker - TWO ADDITIONAL CARS arrive, 
           one right after the other. 

           Earl searches for relief, he walks over to...

           One of the two additional cars. The WINDOW ROLLS DOWN. Daniel 
           Olsen sits in the passenger side and Paul Proust drives.

                                 PAUL PROUST
                        Is that him?

           Earl stares at his father... Daniel Olsen avoids his gaze. 
           There is nothing he can do.

                                 EARL
                        Says his name is Graden Williams 
                        and he’s off to fetch his brother 
                        from somewhere on the hill.

                                 PAUL PROUST
                        Bring him.

           Earl hesitates, but eventually makes his way over to where 
           Graden stands adjacent to Patrick Olsen and Marty Bavon.

                                 EARL
                  (Quietly)
                        They said to bring him.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        Why don’t you get in the car, son? 
                        We’ll give you a ride up to that 
                        brother of yours.
                                 GRADEN
                        I thank you, sir, but it’s a 
                        pleasant night and I’d rather walk.

           Earl watches...

           Fear takes hold of Graden - he stares out into the dense 
           trees and tall grass. 

                                 MARTY BAVON (O.C.)
                        Get in the car, boy.

           Graden is led to the Studebaker. 

           Earl steps forward, taking Graden’s place. He stares deep 
           into the woods...

           EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT

           Through scrub and grass... A PAIR OF EYES looks back at Earl.

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           INT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- MAIN ROOM

           Earl, blindsided, closes his eyes for a brief moment and 
           reopens them...

                                 EARL
                        That was you?

           Warren holds the stock of the rifle in his left hand.

                                 WARREN
                        Hiding in the grass. You looked 
                        right at me, and you left me there. 
                        I want to know why?

           Warren leans in, his whole body hungry for the answer. The 
           picture of Graden’s mutilated body sits between them on the 
           table.

                                 EARL
                        If I had said something to the 
                        others, you would have ended the 
                        same as your brother.

           Warren lifts the rifle - pointing directly at Earl.

           Earl half rises, half stumbles from the chair. 
                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        Wait, wait, wait!

           The barrel is aimed at Earl’s head. Earl’s voice shakes.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        Please, just wait. I’ll tell you 
                        whatever you want. Ok? But not with 
                        a gun pointed at me. Sit. Sit down. 

           Beat.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        We’ll talk.

           Earl puts his hand to his chest.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        But, I need my pills. For my heart, 
                        I need them now.

           Warren’s finger flexes on the trigger guard, he nods.

           Earl holds his breath and backs into the kitchen... The color 
           drains from his face.

           KITCHEN  

           Earl leans against the sink. He trembles from fear. He turns 
           the faucet on and scoops water into his mouth. 

           Earl opens the cabinet and shakes an aspirin bottle - 
           utilizing time to plan his next steps.

           He glances into the mudroom - a light weight, jacket hangs 
           and summer rain boots on the floor.

           He stares out his back window... 

           Night has come and the blizzard is in full tilt, blowing 
           wildly. The bright lights from the cabin beams into the yard -
           lighting it for a distance. 

           Where the lit yard ends and the forest begins, a wall of 
           black spruce covered with snow, from there it descends into 
           blackness. 

           Earl breaks with a limp for the mudroom. He throws on his 
           coat and boots. He steps outside...
           EXT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- BACKYARD

           Earl quickly runs across the yard, moving with a wobbly gait 
           as he favors his one leg in order to pull the bad leg around.

           Off Earl as he looks up into the light...

           FORTY FOUR YEARS AGO -- 1964

           INT./EXT. COTTON GIN COMPANY -- NIGHT

           A warehouse that processes cotton - several motorized cotton 
           gin stands & hoppers are positioned across a wooden floor.

           Earl ducks into a partially blocked view behind the doorjamb - 
           next to an open door. He observes...

           Exposed rafters covered with veins of wire lead to a socket 
           and lit bulb; it glares onto the complexions of White Men in 
           the midst of the most savage brutality.

           FIST PUNCHING, SMASHING, A GUTTURAL SCREAM... 

           A TRAIN ROARS.

           Onto a dirty wooden floor, covered with spattered blood 
           droplets, bits of teeth.

           Graden, tied to a chair, is swollen, almost unrecognizable 
           from the beating. His face tilts upward. 

           Daniel Olsen stands in between Earl and the violence -
           separating the two.

           Close-up of Barry Tywater with a loose cigarette hanging from 
           his mouth as he MUMBLES to his cousin Rob Tywater...

           Blaine Plimton and Paul Proust sit at table - having a quiet 
           discussion, seemingly unfazed by the violence.

           Marty Bavon juts his chin forward and delivers a forceful 
           blow, turning Graden’s nose sidewise into an unnatural 
           permanent state.

           Patrick Olsen removes an item from a toolbox. He walks over 
           and hands the hidden item over to Earl.

           In Earl’s hands is a pair of blood-rusty pliers.

                                 PATRICK OLSEN
                        You’re a man now. You take care of 
                        business.
           All eyes watch closely, judging Earl’s next step.

           Earl trembles with the pliers in hand. Unable to move. He 
           focuses on... 

           Graden’s head pitifully hangs, hardly moving except for 
           attempts to breath through blood and broken bones. His dark 
           skin coated with wet blood. His foot twitches. 

           Daniel Olsen crosses over to Earl removing the pliers from 
           his hands.

                                 DANIEL OLSEN
                        Wait outside, son.

           Daniel Olsen gently guides Earl into the night air. Daniel 
           Olsen returns inside... closing the door behind him.

           EXT. COTTON GIN -- RAILROAD TRACKS -- NIGHT

           A grain elevator stands adjacent to the cotton gin, while 
           railroad tracks run next to the two structures. 

           Earl jumps as a TRAIN ROARS by ... once it ends...

           GRADEN’S SCREAMS take over - permeating into the night air. 

           Earl puts his hands over his ears. The SCREAMS carry over 
           to...

           PRESENT DAY -- 2008

           EXT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT

           On Earl as he hastily glances back at the cottage. 

           No sign of Warren. 

           Earl runs into the mouth of the forest.

           INT. SMALL BROWN COTTAGE -- MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

           Warren’s head cocks ever-so-slightly. He bursts out of the 
           chair and enters...

           KITCHEN  

           Earl is gone. 

           Warren stares out into the backyard. The storm rages.
           Warren looks towards the mudroom, the door slightly ajar. He 
           leaves frame and through the window we watch...

           Warren, with his hat and gloves on, crossing the backyard 
           with signs of an ataxic gait, into the darkness.

           INT. FOREST -- NIGHT

           The interior of the forest is somewhat shielded from the 
           heavy snowfall and lit by the three-quarter moon; there is 
           moderate visibility.

           Warren plods forward searching for Earl’s trail. He spots 
           broken branches and brushed off limbs.

           The snow deepens. Warren struggles through.

           ON EARL...

           ...stumbles through the snow. His chest heaves... he falls 
           forward into the snow, WINCING with pain. He bends over and 
           rubs his knee. 

           He pulls himself up and staggers forward to continue on.

           ON WARREN...

           ...determined to push forward, delving into a trance-like 
           state....

           Warren’s POV - a burst of movement in the distance. He keeps 
           pace until he gets a clear view of...

           Earl moving in the distance. 

           ON WARREN...

           ... quickens his stride. His BREATHING ESCALATES... as he 
           closes in on...

           Warren’s POV - he is gaining on Earl - moving through densely 
           packed trees. 

           The trees quickly flash by, one after another and every so 
           often, in dispersion through the trees... 

           ...the Vision of Graden appears, repeatedly.

           ON WARREN... confusion.

           Warren’s POV - tries to continue focus on Earl, but the 
           Vision of Graden interrupts... 
                                 GRADEN
                        It’s time to go home.

           Warren stops in front of the current Vision of Graden - 
           holding his gaze.

                                 WARREN
                        I got to see this through.

                                 GRADEN
                        You gonna listen this time?

           Graden grins - the same one he gave when Warren saw him for 
           the last time... before his end. 

           We push in on Warren - of look of resolution on his face, 
           peace, clarity.

                                 WARREN
                        I waited too long. I ran to you, 
                        but I was too late.

           The back of Earl disappears into the forest. 

                                 WARREN (CONT’D)
                        I was scared.

           Warren lowers the rifle, letting Earl go. Warren exhales we 
           see his breath against the moon.

           The snow-laden ground morphs into moss-covered rocks, the 
           black spruce and trembling pine trees that sway above become 
           hardwood covered with fall colored leaves.

           Warren sits against a fallen tree. He removes his gloves, his 
           hat. 

           The lines on his palms are white. The skin on his knuckles 
           are cracked and bloody. His fingers too stiff to bend. 

           His crippled fingers have turned blue and the scar that 
           traverses his hand cracked open.

           A weight appears lifted... suddenly he is free. 

           Tears well in his eyes. He closes them.

           The storm winds are overtaken by Warren’s BREATHING.

           A SERIES OF IMAGES ONE AFTER ANOTHER:

           GIN SHACK --

           Young Warren downs his gin. 
           His friends wave goodbye to him.

           Graden appears above him.

                                 GRADEN
                        You know I wish you wouldn’t come 
                        to this place.

                                 YOUNG WARREN
                        And you know I don’t need you to 
                        lecture me. Gotta piss.

           Young Warren wades through the tall grass into trees.

           Warren’s BREATHING TAPERS.

           A CAR ENGINE.

           NURSING HOME -- 

           Mama leans over and joyfully looks upon him.

           NOTEBOOK --

           Young Warren traces the letters of Graden’s name.

           BACK IN THE SNOWY FOREST --

           On Warren.

           Crows CAW in the distance. 

           Warren removes his boots. He lifts his feet into the air and 
           drops them back onto the ground.

           Graden is a short distance away...

           Warren falters as he tries to stand.

                                 GRADEN
                        I’m going ahead. You come when 
                        you’re ready.

                                 WARREN
                        Wait, I’m coming!

           Warren stands only to fall onto his hands and knees.

           Graden turns back.

           Young Warren stares up at Graden... 
                                 YOUNG WARREN
                        You shouldn’t have come to get me.

           Graden looks downward.

                                 GRADEN
                        I wouldn’t leave without you.

           Warren looks up at Graden, standing above. 

                                 WARREN
                        They say, up there, is a magical 
                        place to be...

           Graden reaches his hand out for Warren to grab hold. 

           Warren does so and is hauled up, he stands beside Graden. An 
           old man, beside a young man.

           Two brothers walk together - disappearing into darkness.

           OVER BLACK, Warren’s final breath RASPS... Silence.

           EXT. SNOWY FOREST -- NIGHT/LATER

           Earl MURMURS. He desperately continues to fight his way... 
           His face red, hideously distorted.

           Exhausted and worn, he repeatedly twists around looking for 
           signs of Warren trailing him.

           He exhales with trembling breath.

           A BUZZING rises in the distance.

           Earl stops and listens. 

           A CAR ENGINE...

           Earl pushes toward the direction of the BUZZING. He stumbles 
           over logs and hurls himself through the bushes...

           He bursts out of the forest onto the middle of an open road. 

           He WHIMPERS, while GASPING for air... 

           ... an oncoming truck.

           Earl waves his hands in the air.

           The truck pulls over to the side, picking Earl up roadside. 
           INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT   

           The CHATTERING of a working hospital. PATIENTS, FAMILY, AND 
           DOCTORS come and go.

           Earl sits on a gurney in an open space divided by curtains. 
           He is covered with cuts, his clothes torn. 

           His pulse is taken as a NURSE questions him.

                                 NURSE
                        Your name?

           A long pause.

                                 EARL
                        Earl Olsen.

           The Nurse writes his name down as if it were nothing, but to 
           Earl this means everything.

           EXT. SNOWY FOREST -- MORNING.

           The blizzard is over. It is quiet now. 

           The sun casts a bright, white light onto the forest, hitting 
           the blanket of snow with a prism of light - refracting,  
           creating sparkles like diamonds.

           Floating past this picturesque scene until we land on...

           ... Warren half sits, half lies against a tree that has 
           fallen. His eyes partly closed, staring outward... his lips 
           slightly parted.

           There is a child-like spirit to his form... an openness, a 
           peaceful calm. As if he were part of the natural setting; 
           permanently resting in this frozen earth. 

           His search has ended and so has his journey in this world.
