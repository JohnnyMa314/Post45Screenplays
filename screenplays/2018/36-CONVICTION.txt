           The strumming of an ukulele brings in the melody of “Hawaii 
           Calls”, distant as a faded memory on an old phonograph...

           TITLE UP:         What follows is true...

           FADE IN ON:

           THE HONOLULU SKYLINE

           Shimmering like a beacon amid the dark Pacific Ocean. Faint 
           hum of 1930’s nightlife. Of paradise awaiting. 

           A POSTCARD MOON

           Hangs large and yellow, silhouetting the fronds of swaying 
           PALM TREES as we descend into --

           EXT. A LONE DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

           Snaking through forest: an endless tunnel of trees and 
           shadows. Still beautiful, but a darker side of paradise. 

           Suddenly LIGHT begins to illuminate the path, coming from 
           behind... getting brighter... brighter... until --

           A 1931 CHRYSLER-70 GROWLS past -- 

           HEADLIGHTS eating the dark. PLUME of DUST kicked up behind -- 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           FOUR LOCALS loudly sing along to the Hawaiian music blasting 
           from their radio. All rip-roaring drunk. As suddenly --

           The DRIVER SLAMS ON THE BRAKE! Everyone COLLAPSING forward -- 

           A WOMAN

           Stands in the middle of the road. Back to us. Pearl white 
           skin, blonde hair in a flapper bob, stunning emerald gown. 

                                 DRIVER
                            (honking)
                        Hey lady, you wanna get outta the...

           His words die in his throat as she slowly turns, as in a daze  

           THALIA MASSIE (21)

           Squints into the headlights that illuminate her delicate 
           pretty face... though it’s hard to tell right now because of 
           the BLOOD dripping from her mouth. The bruises on her cheeks. 
           Glazed eyes suddenly going steely as she steps forward to ask
                                 THALIA
                        Are you white folk?

           And off that charged question, we CUT TO --

           INT. COURTROOM - HONOLULU - DAY

           We’ll be moving through these scenes quickly now --

           It’s a few months later. An anxious courtroom RISES to their 
           feet as a WHITE JUDGE enters and takes a seat. He looks at... 

           THALIA MASSIE. Standing in the front row. Bruises somewhat 
           healed, but emotional wounds still on full display.

           To her right is a pair we’ll come to know well...

           LT. TOMMIE MASSIE (25). Thalia’s husband. A Navy lieutenant 
           whose perpetual cast of obliviousness suggests he may have 
           never actually fought a day in his life.

           And GRACE FORTESCUE (60s). Thalia’s mother. A Southern Belle 
           whose feigned elegance masks a general abhorrence for all 
           human life below her, which in her eyes, is everyone.

           On the opposite side of them, at the DEFENSE TABLE are...

           FIVE HAWAIIAN BOYS in handcuffs. All around the age of 18-23. 
           We’ll come to know them too, but for now, one stands out...

           JOSEPH KAHAHAWAI (23). Tall. Dark. Angular features. An 
           unflinching air of toughness. But more notably, of outrage.

                                 JUDGE
                        Mr. Foreman, have you come to a 
                        decision as to the guilt of these five 
                        defendants charged with assaulting and 
                        raping Mrs. Thalia Massie?

                                 FOREMAN
                        I’m afraid not, Your Honor.

           The whole room GASPS -- jaws dropping --

                                 JUDGE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 FOREMAN
                        We aren’t getting anywhere in there.

           The Massies and the Five Boys stand there in complete shock -- 

                                 JUDGE
                        Then I must advise you to return until 
                        you are able to come to a decision.
                                 FOREMAN
                        Four days we’ve deliberated, Your Honor. 
                        Vote is still 6-6... I’m sorry, but 
                        we’re deadlocked.

           And as the RUMBLE of rage and confusion begins to resound in 
           the hall, the Judge looking around in disgust, we CUT TO --

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           SHOUTING. MAYHEM. The Massies filing out of the courthouse 
           besieged by LOCAL REPORTERS. Thalia hangs on the arm of 
           Tommie, weeping. Grace follows closely behind, incensed...

           We stay with Grace as she stops, something catching her eye...

           ON THE SIDEWALK: A MAN walks away through the crowd with his 
           parents, the defendant from earlier... Joseph Kahahawai.

           Grace considers him, eyes narrowing with an idea, and CUT TO --

           EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING - FEW DAYS LATER

           A small, grimy shop. Corner of a Chinatown street. A bell 
           RINGS as someone exits through the glass door --

           KAHAHAWAI. Bag of groceries in hand. Turning the corner, 
           walking toward a FRIEND waiting further down the way, when --

           A CAR pulls up near him.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Joseph Kahahawai?

           Kahahawai turns to face a HAND HOLDING A PISTOL.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        May we have a moment?

           EXT. KOKO HEAD CLIFF - MIDDAY

           An OCEAN ROAD winding along VOLCANIC CLIFFS, waves spraying 
           against us as we look over the side, to infinite blue...

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Honolulu City Police?

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        It’s Officer Machado, Kahala patrol.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        What’s the problem?

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        We made an apprehension. Koko Head.
           FLASH! -- A PHOTOGRAPHER pops snap-shots of --

           A BUSTLING CRIME SCENE -- what was the lookout site, now a 
           forensic fiasco, POLICE CARS, OFFICERS, frantic REPORTERS --

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        Black buick. One male taken into 
                        custody. One female.

           We see TOMMIE MASSIE being escorted into a POLICE CAR, ashen. 
           Then GRACE FORTESCUE, seemingly unfazed.

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        There’s a body in the trunk. 

           A BLACK BUICK parked on the side of the road, trunk open. 
           OFFICER MACHADO (40s, Hawaiian) rounds the car.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        What kind of body?

           Machado nearly recoils at the sight. 

           In the trunk, a BODY covered by a WHITE SHEET SOAKED IN BLOOD.

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        Young male... Hawaiian...

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Could you identify him?

           Machado pulls the sheet up to reveal: KAHAHAWAI. Pale. Dead.

                                 MACHADO (V.O.)
                        It’s Joseph Kahahawai.

           And off that -- FLASH!

           A PICTURE OF THE CRIME SCENE

           On the front page of the HONOLULU ADVERTISER, JANUARY 9, 1932:

                    THE MASSIES TAKE REVENGE!

                                                                   FADE TO:

           EXT. MANOA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           ...that same NEWSPAPER in the hands of a PAPERBOY on a BIKE. 
           He tosses it onto the porch of a SHABBY HOME nestled in the 
           lush green of MANOA VALLEY.

           And we STAY on the porch, looking through the half-hinged 
           screen door, catching a conversation INSIDE --
                                 KELLEY (V.O.)
                        Rejected. Denied. “Wonderful credentials, 
                        but we’re going to have to decline.” Oh, 
                        here’s a good one: “We felt uncomfortable 
                        giving a man of his upbringing a 
                        permanent role in our establishment.” 

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Two suited men sitting in this cramped living room: FREEDMAN 
           (50’s), holding a glass of scotch, and... 

           JOHN C. KELLEY (38) 

           Kelley is a smart, honest man. But honesty doesn’t pay the 
           bills. He wears a crummy white suit two sizes too big and 
           sips from a glass of milk.

           We hear COOKING in the kitchen. TWO YOUNG GIRLS playing down 
           the hall...

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Alright, what’s your point, John? 

                                 KELLEY
                        My point, Mr. Freedman, is my client 
                        graduated summa cum laude from Harvard 
                        Med, has saved 127 clients over the last 
                        16 months, and has been systematically 
                        denied a position from every major 
                        private clinic in the territory.

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Private being the pivotal word there.

           A PLAYFUL SCREAM from the girls’ bedroom interrupts them --

                                 KELLEY
                        Girls?! Girls, what did I say?! 
                        Margaret! Mary!
                            (to Freedman)
                        One second.
                            (to the girls)
                        Girls, you hear me?! Margaret!

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Should I come back?

                                 KELLEY
                        No, we’re settling this right now. 

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Really? ‘Cause honestly I’m not seeing 
                        much progress here.

           And there it is.
                                 KELLEY
                        Fine then I’ll see you in court.

                                 FREEDMAN
                        You have no case, Kelley. Your client  
                        simply didn’t pass his interviews.

                                 KELLEY
                        My client’s name is Doctor Frank Iona 
                        and you’re right, he didn’t have a 
                        chance to pass. He was judged and 
                        rejected before he even walked in. It’s 
                        prejudice and your offer proves it. 

                                 FREEDMAN
                        A privately owned institution may 
                        refuse to employ anyone they wish. For 
                        any reason. No law that says otherwise.

                                 KELLEY
                        But a publicly owned hospital, like the 
                        one you represent, may not.

           He lifts a REJECTION LETTER from a stack of similar letters. 
           Slides it to Freedman. A chess master moving to check-mate.

           Freedman can’t help but smile. Almost admiringly.

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Why don’t I give you a coupla days to 
                        think it over? You can consult with your 
                        client. Come to the right decision. 

                                 KELLEY
                        The right decision.

                                 FREEDMAN
                        Yes, John, the right one. Your man 
                        wants to serve the community, nobody 
                        has a problem with that, just let him 
                        treat his own kind. Why does he want to 
                        work where he’s not wanted? Plenty of 
                        patients over on Molokai who could use 
                        the help. $500 is a heap of money here. 
                        You have your family to think of. 

                                 KELLEY
                        We’re getting along just fine.

                                 FREEDMAN
                        That’s why you’re taking meetings in 
                        your living room?

           Kelley silent. Stung. Freedman gathers his things.
                                 FREEDMAN
                        Thanks for the drink. You can call our 
                        office once you’ve decided to settle. 

           And Freedman leaves. Kelley looks down at the scatter of 
           documents and legal pads in the room. His office.

           INT. KITCHEN - KELLEY HOUSE - DAY

           Kelley enters to see FRANK IONA (30s) and MRS. IONA (30) 
           sitting at the table with another proud Hawaiian woman...

           This is NAN (35). Kelley’s wife. Ambitious, fearless, 
           tenacious. A relentless focus in those eyes. A fierce virtue 
           that we will come to realize is unparalleled.

           Kelley observes all their expressions. They’ve already heard.

                                 KELLEY
                        Don’t worry, Frank. I’m gonna talk to a 
                        guy, a physician downtown...

                                 FRANK IONA
                        What are our chances? In court, what 
                        are our honest chances?

           Kelley’s silence answers for him. Nan shaking her head --

                                 NAN
                        Can you believe this? A Hawaiian doctor 
                        in Hawaii...

                                 KELLEY
                        There are other options, we can--

                                 FRANK IONA
                        Talk to a guy, yes. Another guy, 
                        another prospect, another rejection.

                                 MRS. IONA
                        Honey...

           Mrs. Iona puts a hand on his arm. Frank stops. Gathering 
           himself. He stands...

                                 FRANK IONA
                        Thank you for the meal, Mrs. Kelley. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Frank, I think you need to continue 
                        this fight. You owe yourself that much.

           But Frank hasn’t the spirit to respond. He braves a shrug. 

                                 FRANK IONA
                        I appreciate your help, John. Always.
           And after a handshake, Frank goes. Mrs. Iona following.

           Nan and Kelley linger in the silence. Another defeat. 

           A PLAYFUL SCREAM comes from the hallway, Nan groaning --

                                 KELLEY
                        I’ll handle it.

           Deflated, Kelley goes. Nan still standing there. Fuming.

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE - LATER

           Kelley gets into his small, scuffed-up FORD in the driveway. 
           Turns the car on: nothing. Oh c’mon, not again. 

           He tries again: nothing. He keeps trying. And trying.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Having trouble there?

           Kelley nearly JUMPS -- 

           The Territorial Governor of Hawaii, LAWRENCE JUDD (45), is 
           standing right there. By his window. Tall. Slick. Refined. 
           Everything you’d expect of a successful politician.

                                 KELLEY
                        Governor Judd?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Y’know, I had an old Ford like this. 
                        Died on me several years back. You 
                        should go with the Austin Seven. 
                        British. Lasts a lot longer, go figure.

           Kelley looks around. What in the... 

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m uh, not really up to speed on 
                        cars... Or politics...for that matter.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        And from the looks of it, you’re going 
                        nowhere fast. But I’m here to hopefully 
                        change that, Mr. Kelley. I’d like to 
                        speak with you. About an opportunity. 
                        One I think you’d quite enjoy. 
                            (beat)
                        Oh, don’t worry. I’ll drive.

           EXT. IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           The hallmark of Hawaiian renaissance architecture. Former 
           home of the Hawaiian monarchy. Now, headquarters of the U.S. 
           Territory of Hawaii. NATIONAL GUARD patrolling the grounds.
           AT THE GATES: Hawaiian PROTESTERS, chanting, signs, “WE WANT 
           JUSTICE!” “MURDERERS!” “YOU TAKE OUR LAND, NOW OUR SONS!”

           GOVERNOR JUDD’S CAR rolling up to the entrance, Kelley in the 
           backseat, eyes fixed on the growing protest and we CUT TO --

           INT. GOVERNOR JUDD’S OFFICE - IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           A huge, grandiose office. Big windows. Stately furnishings.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Can I get you anything to drink, John? 
                        Gin? Scotch?

                                 KELLEY
                        You have any milk?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        You know, I’m not sure.

           A SECRETARY closes the door. 

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Well, I know this is probably all a bit 
                        much, so why don’t we cut right--

                                 KELLEY
                        The Massie affair.

           The Governor turns. Surprised.

                                 KELLEY
                        It’s why you’ve brought me here. The 
                        protesters, national news stories... I 
                        imagine you’re up to your ears. It’s--

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        It’s certainly something new for the 
                        territory.

                                 KELLEY
                        Something dangerous.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Five Hawaiian boys raping the white 
                        wife of a Navy Lieutenant?

                                 KELLEY
                        Allegedly.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Her family retaliating with a 
                        kidnapping?

                                 KELLEY
                        And murder.
                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Allegedly.

                                 KELLEY
                        The territory will be outraged if they 
                        are acquitted.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        And the whole country will be up in 
                        arms if they’re found guilty.
                            (beat)
                        Do me a favor, would you? Take a look 
                        at that pile over there and tell me 
                        what you see.

           The Governor points to a pile of HUNDREDS OF ENVELOPES nearby.

                                 KELLEY
                        Letters?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Letters from every state and every major 
                        politician in the country asking me to 
                        do everything from imprisoning each of 
                        these five boys to exiling every single 
                        Hawaiian from the territory.
                            (lets that land)
                        Now usually they pay us no mind out 
                        here, John. But this...this is a powder 
                        keg. Spotlight is fully on us now. 

           A beat. Kelley looking away. Considering.

                                 KELLEY
                        I suppose I could reach out to some 
                        people. See if they’d take the stand. 
                            (waiting)
                        That’s what you need, isn’t it? Someone 
                        to talk to the community?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        John, we need a new City Prosecutor.

           Kelley stares. Wait, what?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        We want someone fresh. Hard-working. 
                        Someone educated in the states, but 
                        with an established rapport here. It’d 
                        be a tough job. You’d have to be thick-
                        skinned. But you’d be doing Hawaii a 
                        great service.

                                 KELLEY
                        Sir...I usually handle smaller cases.
                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Says here you’ve done some criminal 
                        work in the past.

                                 KELLEY
                        Yes, but...that was years ago.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Once learned, never forgotten, right?

                                 KELLEY
                        Sir, I lost. Every case.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Someone needs to prosecute the Massies. 
                        And it can’t be me. The territory won’t 
                        be able to afford assistant counsel on 
                        this, so we need someone good. By-the-
                        book. Someone the community trusts. 

                                 KELLEY
                            (realizing)
                        They turned it down.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        What?

                                 KELLEY
                        Everyone else turned the job down.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        As I said, it’s a tough position. The 
                        evidence certainly seems to point to the 
                        defendants, but, as you know, these 
                        kinds of cases are always a challenge.

                                 KELLEY
                        Of course. Prejudice.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Worse: money. Let’s just say the Massies 
                        have some very powerful friends. And they 
                        may have contacted a... certain lawyer.

                                 KELLEY
                        Who?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Well, he hasn’t confirmed yet.

                                 KELLEY
                        Who’d they hire to defend them?
                            (off his look)
                        Oh c’mon, sir, it can’t be that bad.

                                                                    CUT TO:
           A BANNER: “AMERICA’S GREATEST LAWYER”

           We BOOM DOWN to see that we’re in --

           INT. CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           A sizable hall. A hum of impatient conversation coming from a 
           COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE -- fans, reporters, law students -- 
           cramped into lines of seats, standing in the aisles. In front 
           of them is an EMPTY STAGE. A lone PODIUM.

           CAPTION:           Chicago, Illinois.

           The LIBRARIAN turns to a CLERK, both in a worried panic. The 
           Librarian checks his watch.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        That’s it. We’ve waited long enough.

           The Librarian walks onto the stage. Pats the MIC.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Good afternoon everyone. We’re, uh, 
                        really quite thankful that you all--

                                 RANDOM SPECTATOR (O.S.)
                        Where’s Darrow?!

           Some agreeing SHOUTS and NODS.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Well, uh, see, for whatever reason, Mr. 
                        Darrow was unable to join us...
                            (disapproving BOOS)
                        However, we know that some of you have 
                        traveled very far for this, so, uh, my 
                        idea is that I will read through 
                        chapter one and maybe--

           More BOOS. People starting to head out.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Y’see, I’ve read the whole thing 
                        myself. It’s really quite fascinating. 
                        The title, as you know, is--

                                 DARROW (O.S.)
                        The Story of My Life!

           And everyone turns to the back of the room, where --

           CLARENCE DARROW (65) 

           Has just come in. The most famous lawyer in America. Or was. 
           He’s 10 years, 20 pounds, and 1,000 grey hairs past his 
           “Leopold and Loeb” and “Scopes Monkey Trial” prime. 
           Still there’s an undeniable assurance in his strut. A 
           magnetic confidence.

                                 DARROW
                        I believe it’s the Story of My Life, 
                        Charlie. I’d hate for people to get the 
                        wrong idea.

           LAUGHS and surprised APPLAUSE from the whole crowd. Darrow 
           makes his way through the audience, shaking hands, like Jesus 
           walking through Jerusalem. 

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        A grand entrance as always, Mr. Darrow.

           Darrow hops on stage, greets the Librarian. 

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        You’re an hour-and-a-half late.

                                 DARROW
                        I’ll take it from here, Charlie.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                            (realizing)
                        ... Are you drunk?

           But Darrow is already walking to the podium...

                                 DARROW
                            (into mic)
                        My sincerest of apologies to you all. I 
                        wish I had a better excuse but, well, I 
                        made the mistake of letting in some 
                        Jehovah’s Witnesses. They just wouldn’t 
                        leave. 
                            (the crowd laughs)
                        Probably still there. You’d think 
                        they’d catch the hint after seeing me, 
                        y’know, publicly debate them.
                            (more laughter)
                        I suppose you all came for this book I 
                        wrote? 
                            (applause)
                        Though judging from the sales, I may be 
                        the only one who’s read it. Y’know, 
                        someday I hope to write a book where 
                        the royalties will pay for the copies I 
                        give away.
                            (laughter)
                        I’m told I’m late, so whattya say we go 
                        ahead and get started? 
                            (applause)

                        Life.”
           INT. LOBBY - CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER

           A LINE OF PEOPLE stretching out the door, leading to a table 
           where Darrow sits signing copies of his book. Until --

           SLAP! A CASE FILE FOLDER is dropped onto the table.

           Darrow looks up to see: GEORGE LEISURE. Late 20’s. Bookish. 
           Currently very nervous. If there was a way to measure 
           Clarence Darrow fandom, this kid would be at the top.

                                 DARROW
                        Excuse me--

                                 LEISURE
                        Mr. Darrow, I, uh, wow, it’s such a 
                        pleasure to meet you, sir. I’m George 
                        Leisure. If you don’t mind my saying 
                        this, I, uh, you were the reason I went 
                        to law school.

                                 DARROW
                            (dismissive)
                        Wonderful, kid. Who do I make it out to?

                                 LEISURE
                        Oh no, I um...I’ve written you several 
                        letters. Offers actually. I’m the uh, 
                        newly appointed lawyer for the 
                        Fortescue estate, that’s Mrs. Grace 
                        Fortescue in Hawaii, mother of the rape 
                        victim Thalia Massie. 
                            (rambling now)
                        This case, sir, could be a tremendous 
                        opportunity, lots of press coverage, 
                        and y’know, I think with the right--

                                 DARROW
                        Should I be writing all of this down? Or 
                        is just “best of luck” alright?

                                 LEISURE
                        ... Um, what I’m trying to say, sir, is 
                        we need an answer as soon as possible. 
                            (then)
                        Mrs. Fortescue is willing to offer you 
                        $40,000.

           And Darrow suddenly perks up.

           INT. GOLD STAR CLUB - DAY

           Contrary to it’s name, this place is a seedy, decaying dive 
           of a bar. Corner of the city. A drinking man’s establishment.

           Darrow sits across Leisure. Mid-conversation.
                                 DARROW
                        Accidentally shot him?

                                 LEISURE
                        Yes.

                                 DARROW
                        As in...it was an accident.

                                 LEISURE
                        That’s their claim, yes.

                                 DARROW
                        Did they accidentally kidnap him too?

                                 LEISURE
                        Sir, if I may, I...I think it may be 
                        best to see this from the family’s 
                        perspective. If you were in the 
                        Massies’ shoes, how would--

                                 DARROW
                        If I were in their shoes, I’d hire a 
                        lawyer like me.

           Darrow with that cheeky smile. Waving down the WAITER.

                                 DARROW
                        Hi, yes, one more please.
                            (to Leisure)
                        Alright. Look, Fred. May I? Fred?

                                 LEISURE
                        George.

                                 DARROW
                        George. It seems you’re quite familiar 
                        with my career so I’m sure you’re aware 
                        that the papers have come up with a new 
                        name for me.

                                 LEISURE
                        “The Attorney for the Damned.”

                                 DARROW
                        Yes. Now I’m sure you’re also aware 
                        that one of the reasons I’ve been given 
                        this name is because I’ve actively 
                        represented, before the Supreme Court, 
                        nearly every under-represented, under-
                        privileged group you can imagine: the 
                        poor, the downtrodden, the disabled, 
                        the disenfranchised. This is the 
                        reputation I’ve built for myself, and 
                        I’m quite proud of it. 
                                 LEISURE
                        As you should be.

                                 DARROW
                        Right. Now you seem like a decently 
                        smart fellow, but have you ever heard 
                        the saying, “takes many good decisions 
                        to build a reputation, but only one bad 
                        one to lose it?” 
                            (off his confusion)
                        You’re telling me this is a rich white 
                        woman and her white son-in-law who shot 
                        a dark-skinned Hawaiian point blank and 
                        you’re asking me to defend their right 
                        to pull the trigger?

           Leisure studying Darrow. He needs to try a different approach. 

                                 LEISURE
                        “Human beings are not merely black-and-
                        white, and neither is any case.”
                            (holding on Darrow)
                        Those are your words, sir. Your lecture 
                        on capital punishment back in ‘25. 

                                 DARROW
                        And I’m sure I meant it at the time.

                                 LEISURE
                        Mr. Darrow, you know better than anyone 
                        that this isn’t just a question of 
                        race. It’s a question of motives. A 
                        husband attempting to avenge the rape 
                        of his wife. A mother bringing justice 
                        for her own daughter.

                                 DARROW
                            (understanding)
                        An honor killing.

                                 LEISURE
                        Exactly. The unwritten law. 

                                 DARROW
                        Yes, and there’s a reason why it’s 
                        called the unwritten law, son. It 
                        doesn’t exist. No lawyer has ever 
                        successfully defended it.

                                 LEISURE
                        No lawyer until you, sir.

           Darrow stops. Considers. Well that does sound rather nice.
                                 LEISURE
                        I know what the papers are calling you. 
                        I also know that they’re saying your 
                        best days are behind you, that you 
                        don’t have what it takes anymore. Book 
                        readings? Public religious debates? All 
                        due respect, sir, but you deserve more 
                        than this. You should be back in that 
                        courtroom where you belong. Back on top 
                        with your name in the headlines and a 
                        veritable fortune in your pocket. 

           Darrow just sitting there. Taken aback by this kid.

                                 DARROW
                        When would it start?

                                 LEISURE
                        Two weeks. 
                            (off Darrow’s scoff)
                        The Massies want the best, sir. They 
                        want you. And in return, they’re 
                        offering you a chance to win your 
                        career back.

           Darrow sits back. Exhaling. Draining the rest of his drink. 
           Weighing the options. Until finally --

                                 DARROW
                        Y’know, I’ve never been to Hawaii. 

           EXT. KALIHI NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

           THE GHETTO OF HONOLULU. The complete opposite of the postcard 
           Hawaii we’re used to. A maze of squalid shacks. DENSE CROWDS 
           of Hawaiians, Chinese, Filipinos. Kids running. Dirt flying... 

           The slum of paradise. And driving right through all this is --

           INT. KELLEY’S CAR (MOVING) - MORNING

           THE KELLEY FAMILY. Nan behind the wheel, Kelley in the 
           passenger seat, their two hapa daughters (half-Hawaiian) in 
           the back: MARGARET (10) and MARY (6).

                                 KELLEY
                        No. Absolutely not.

                                 NAN
                        John--

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m nowhere near qualified for the job. 

                                 NAN
                        So it’s fear then? Doubt? 
                                 KELLEY
                        This isn’t just Darrow I’d be up 
                        against, Nan. It’s an establishment. 

                                 NAN
                        Yes, a racist establishment--

                                 KELLEY
                        Nan--

                                 NAN
                        --that calls your own wife and 
                        daughters savages.

                                 KELLEY
                        Which is why I’d never be able to live 
                        with myself if we lost!

                                 NAN
                        Then win.

           Kelley stares. She’s totally serious. No backing down.

                                 NAN
                        We have a chance, John. A chance to be a 
                        voice where others have been muzzled. 
                        You’re going to give that up because 
                        you’re scared of losing?

           Kelley with no real response to that. Because she’s right. 
           The car takes a left, toward a small CEMETERY. Nan parking. 
           Kelley looking around. Confused.

                                 KELLEY
                        I thought... aren’t we heading home?

                                 NAN
                        Out of the car, girls, c’mon.

           They do as told. No questions. Nan turning to her husband --

                                 NAN
                        Put your jacket on. And your tie.
                        We’re paying our respects.

           EXT. PUEA CEMETERY - LATER

           JOE KAHAHAWAI’S FUNERAL. A small cemetery. HUNDREDS of 
           mourners surrounding the tombstone.

           At the front is ESTHER KAHAHAWAI (50). Mother of Joseph 
           Kahahawai. The weight of the recent event taking its’ toll. 

           Behind her is JOE SR (55). Father of Joseph. A workingman. 
           Tired, wounded eyes. And by him is the FOUR remaining accused 
           HAWAIIAN BOYS.
           The Kelley family stands among the gathering. Somber. 
           Respectful. Kelley noticing something nearby --

           A YOUNG HAWAIIAN WOMAN. Wailing. Tears of anger. Hate.

                                 YOUNG HAWAIIAN WOMAN
                        Hilahila ‘ole keia po’e haole! Hilahila

                                 MARY
                            (quietly)
                        Mommy, what is she saying?

                                 NAN
                        Shameless. The foreigners are shameless.

           Nan shares a pointed look with Kelley as --

           A number of WOMEN in the crowd begin to SING, an acapella 
           version of “Aloha ‘Oe” by Queen Liliuokalani ...

                                 CROWD
                        HA’AHEO E KA UA I NA PALI / KE NIHI 
                        A’ELA I KA NAHELE...

           A light DRIZZLE falling over the CROWD as people begin 
           grabbing hands with each other. Stranger with stranger. Young 
           with old. A community joined together in tragedy. 

           And Kelley is looking behind him now, curious as he hears the 
           VOICES swelling, growing, getting louder, stronger. He peers 
           above the crowd, the CAMERA SLOWLY RISING to see --

           It’s not merely hundreds that have gathered, IT’S THOUSANDS. 
           A procession of people lined down the sidewalk for miles. 
           Locals. Hawaiians. Immigrants of dozens of different 
           ethnicities. Voices ECHOING through the city as --

           KELLEY stands there floored. Profoundly moved. 

           He wordlessly takes his daughter’s hand. Then his wife’s. She 
           looks to him, and he nods. Nothing more needs to be said. 

           It’s clear he’s decided.

           And as we look out over the CROWD, song finishing, we CUT TO --

           EXT. HONOLULU HARBOR - DAY

           A much different crowd: A SEA OF WHITE FACES. Reporters. 
           Gawkers. Tourists. Voyeurs. Scattered across the whole 
           harbor. A cascade of voices and energy awaiting as --

           A CRUISE LINER docks. The “MALOLO”. Gangplank lowering and --

           CLARENCE DARROW is the first off. Instantly INUNDATED.

                        Christ... Clark Gable doesn’t get a 
                        crowd like this.

           But that smirk says he’s loving it. 

           RUBY DARROW (60) follows him out. Darrow’s wife. Cigarette in 
           one hand, heavy luggage in the other. A tired but hard-nosed 
           woman. She may have loved this kind of attention before, but 
           like her respect for her husband, it’s waned over the years.

                                 RUBY
                        Clark Gable get those too?

           She’s looking at -- PROTESTERS across the street -- waving 
           signs: “ATTORNEY FOR THE PRIVILEGED!”; “DEFENDER OF MURDERERS!”

           And now GEORGE LEISURE is coming out, joining Darrow and Ruby 
           as they look out over the commotion...

                                 LEISURE
                        You know it’s not as bad as I expected.

           SPLAT! -- an EGG HITS the rail -- thrown by a PROTESTER on the 
           deck -- immediately being escorted away by POLICE as --

                                 DARROW
                        Oh, yes. Quite the warm welcome, George.

           Darrow shakes it off. Puts on the camera smile. He leads them 
           down the plank, stopped by TWO WHITE HULA GIRLS holding LEIS.

                                 HULA GIRL
                        Aloha, Mr. Darrow. Welcome to Hawaii.

           They “lei” him. Darrow smiling, turning aside to the CROWD --

                                 DARROW
                        Usually I’m offered a noose when I come 
                        to town! This is much sweeter!

           BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER. Darrow reveling in it as he forges 
           fearlessly into the SHOUTING crowd, fending off reporters --

                                 DARROW
                        Yes, I’ll answer all your questions in 
                        due time, fellas, but right now, I have 
                        my clients to see.

           And Darrow PULLS AWAY. Waving as he goes. Finally out of the 
           mob. Looking down to the LEI around his neck --

                                 DARROW
                        For Godsake, get these jingle bells off 
                        of me. I look like a decorated hat rack.
           EXT. PEARL HARBOR DOCK - DAY

           The iconic Pearl Harbor. Pre-WWII. Rows of U.S. Navy Cruisers. 
           Out of the bustle of sailors comes a NAVAL OFFICER leading 
           DARROW and LEISURE to the biggest ship: the USS ALTON.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        They were moved here from their jail 
                        cell a few weeks back. Orders of the 
                        admiral. S’pose when you’re royalty, 
                        you oughtta be treated as such. Y’know, 
                        me and Tommie, we did basics together 
                        back at the academy. Gotta say, sir, 
                        this here is a real good man.

           INT. USS ALTON DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           They trudge their way up a winding flight of stairs.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        You’d be glad to know we’re taking real 
                        good care of them. Got our best cooks 
                        working ‘round the clock. Corporal 
                        stationed at their door.

                                 DARROW
                        What did you mean when you called them 
                        royalty?

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Oh, I’m just referring to their 
                        lineage, sir. 

                                 DARROW
                        Which is?

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Mrs. Fortescue’s uncle, sir. Alexander 
                        Graham Bell. And Mrs. Massie’s 
                        stepfather. Robert B. Roosevelt. Uncle 
                        of President Roosevelt.

                                 DARROW
                        You’re kidding.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        No sir. As I said these are good folks.

           EXT. USS ALTON DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           They make their way across the deck, CHALK-FULL of FLOWERS -- 

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Hell of a thing, ain’t it? We’re 
                        gettin’ truckloads of them every day, 
                        comin’ from all over the country. 
           The officer leans in, a conspiratorial whisper to Darrow.

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        Y’know, if you ask me, it’s a 
                        despicable thing these boys did. I say 
                        we oughtta string ‘em up by the balls.

                                 DARROW
                        Oh, good. You write that down, George?

           INT. COMMANDER’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           A chic, impeccably-furnished room. Basically a hotel suite. 
           Darrow rounding the corner to see for the first time -- 

           THALIA, TOMMIE, AND GRACE. Just standing there. Blankly 
           staring at us like an eerie 19th-century family photo.

                                 DARROW
                            (making his rounds)
                        Good afternoon. Good afternoon. It’s a 
                        pleasure to meet you all.
                            (stops at)
                        And you must be Thalia?

                                 THALIA
                        Yes, sir.

           Her voice is soft. Poised. 

                                 DARROW
                        May I just express how very, very sorry 
                        I am for your situation. What you have 
                        endured is simply--well--it’s 
                        indescribable.

                                 THALIA
                        You’re too kind, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        Please, shall we take a seat?

           As they sit, Darrow steals a once-over of the space: A FEAST 
           for kings on the nearby table, GUARDS stationed at each door.

                                 DARROW
                        Well, there’s much to talk about and 
                        very little time. So I’d like to begin 
                        on the morning of the abduction, right 
                        when Mr. Kaha--

                                 GRACE
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        ...I beg your pardon?
                                 GRACE
                        No. We’ll start earlier. The night my 
                        daughter was assaulted, that’s where 
                        this all began. And let’s not call it 
                        an abduction. We brought the criminal 
                        in to have a discussion. He may have 
                        died in our hands, but we did what was 
                        necessary to get him to speak, I 
                        believe we were more than justified.

           Silence. Darrow at a complete loss.

                                 DARROW
                        I’m sorry...are you...you’re not saying 
                        you deliberately killed Mr. Kahahawai?

                                 GRACE
                        No.

                                 DARROW
                        But you just said you were justified.
                        Mrs. Fortescue... if you feel there is 
                        anything that you need to tell me... 
                        anything at all, please do so.

           Grace just staring at him. This lawyer whom she is paying for 
           who just gave her permission to say something.

                                 GRACE
                        Mr. Darrow, let us get something out of 
                        the way. I know you’re from Chicago, but 
                        I’m originally from the South. Where we 
                        come from, we have our own way of dealing 
                        with niggers, that’s what this is all 
                        about. Now, as our lawyer, and as someone 
                        getting paid spectacularly well, I expect 
                        you to be understanding of our situation. 
                        More importantly, I expect you to do 
                        anything and everything necessary to get 
                        us acquitted. Or should we begin to 
                        reassess your exceedingly generous fee?

           Darrow silent. Looking to Leisure. Jesus, who is this woman? 

                                 DARROW
                        Right. Well. Since we are “getting things 
                        out of the way”... If we want to win, and 
                        believe me, I have every intention of 
                        doing so, we’re going to need to work 
                        together. Trust. Co-operation. You hired 
                        me because I’m the best, because I win 
                        the unwinnable cases. But I can’t do my 
                        job if I’m being threatened. I need you 
                        to help me assemble a case. Your case. 
                                 GRACE
                        Then no place to start like the 
                        beginning, wouldn’t you agree?

           Something sinister in that frozen grin. Her unflinching eyes.

                                 GRACE
                        Thalia, why don’t you take these 
                        gentlemen back to that horrid night. 
                        Back to where it all started...

           And as Thalia slowly stirs, gathering herself...

                                 OFFICER WATSON (V.O.)
                        Tell you what, you don’t wanna talk? 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - HONOLULU POLICE STATION - DAY

           Dark. Stripped down. Bare cement walls. OFFICER WATSON (30s) 
           grilling HORACE IDA. We recognize Horace as one of the 
           remaining FOUR alleged assailants...

           He’s 18. Japanese. All-in-all a seemingly harmless appearance 
           if it weren’t for his slumped shoulders and crossed arms 
           sending an “F-you” to all in the room.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        Make it easy for you, Horace: you tell 
                        us the truth, the honest truth, we get 
                        you off clean. A fresh start. Now 
                        c’mon, son. Work with me here. One of 
                        you is gonna break at some point. 

                                 HORACE IDA
                        We didn’t do it.

           Officer Watson just giving a dead stare as --

                                 CORPORAL
                            (poking his head in)
                        Dave, you got a guy out here wants to 
                        speak with you.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        Yeah, gimme a minute.

                                 CORPORAL
                        He’s saying it’s illegal to be 
                        interrogating without authorization.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        What?

                                 CORPORAL
                        He’s saying if we don’t stop, he’ll 
                        personally report all of us. 
                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        Who’d you say this was?

                                 CORPORAL
                        I dunno. Some lawyer.

           Watson looks out to see KELLEY AND NAN in the squad room, 
           smiling and waving. And we begin to hear --

                                 THALIA (V.O.)
                        It was a Saturday night... We were at 
                        the Ala Moana Inn...

           INT. ALA MOANA INN - NIGHT - 1931 - FLASHBACK

           ONE YEAR AGO -- Right in the swirling heart of 1930’s 
           Honolulu nightlife. Dancing. Drinking. Women. A pumping big 
           band laying down another Duke Ellington tune as -- 

                                 THALIA (V.O.)
                        We met up with some of Tommie’s Navy 
                        friends there. Had a few drinks.

           We make our way to a corner BOOTH where --

           TOMMIE MASSIE sits among a group of SAILORS and their young 
           dates. He laughs when he’s supposed to. Drinks when they do. 
           But next to him is an EMPTY SEAT, a seat that belonged to --

           THALIA. Standing in the opposite corner. Watching her husband 
           with a cutting stare. She dons an elegant green dress. Fourth 
           drink in hand. And it’s clear: she’s not having any of this.

                                 THALIA (V.O.)
                        After a while, I started to get tired.  
                        My husband seemed to be having a nice 
                        time so I told him I was gonna walk home.

           She gets up, heated words with her husband we can’t hear. At 
           the bar, a white NAVAL OFFICER tracks her, piercing gaze as--

           Thalia tosses her drink on Tommie, storms out, past the 
           Officer. Who follows her out: first with his eyes, then feet.

                                 DARROW (V.O.)
                        Wait, hold on--

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - USS ALTON - DAY

           Darrow and the Massies in the same place we left them. 

                                 DARROW
                        Your statement said he didn’t know you 
                        left. From the trial. You said your 
                        husband called home searching for you,

                        I mean I assumed she left, but I didn’t--

                        Tommie, I think Thalia can answer for 
                        herself, thank you.

           A weird tension in the air. Darrow detecting it. Thalia 
           trying to smile it off...

                                 THALIA
                        My apologies, Mr. Darrow. Maybe I didn’t 
                        tell my husband where I went. But the 
                        important thing is I did leave the club.

           A different place. A different event. The local neighborhood

           (This sequence will be cutting back and forth between the two

           Among the group leaving is THE FIVE HAWAIIAN BOYS. Laughing. 
           Hanging on each other. All very drunk.

                        Probably around 15-20 minutes. But near

           A DARK CAR slowly approaching from behind her. Slowing down. 

           Thalia looks over her shoulder. Suspicious. She begins to

                        a goddamn thing we can do about it.

           A tense silence.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m very sorry...

                                 HORACE IDA
                        You’re sorry... You’re sorry... Christ, 
                        what gives you the right to take a case 
                        like this, huh? Why should a haole be 
                        helping us? All you people... all the 
                        same. How do we know you’re not gonna 
                        screw us like the rest of ‘em--
                                 NAN
                        Now wait a minute--

                                 HORACE IDA
                        WE DIDN’T DO IT! WE NEVER TOUCHED THAT 
                        WOMAN IN OUR LIVES!

                                 JAIL GUARD
                        -- Alright, that’s enough --

                                 HORACE IDA
                        You wanna call us guilty?! Look what 
                        they did! Look how they treated Joe!

                                 JAIL GUARD
                        -- Get up, son, c’mon --

                                 HORACE IDA
                        Who do they think they are, huh?! What 
                        gives them the right?! WHAT GIVES THEM 
                        THE GODDAMN RIGHT?!

           And Horace is dragged off by the Guard -- KICKING, SCREAMING, 
           FIGHTING with all the dignity he has left -- until -- 

           BAM! -- The door is SLAMMED closed.

           Kelley and Nan lingering in this awful silence.

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - USS ALTON - DAY

           Darrow and the Massies in a similar silence. Darrow trying to 
           find the words to say, but --

                                 DARROW
                        Sorry, would you give us a moment?

           He stands, motioning for Leisure to follow him. The Massies 
           watch curiously as Darrow and Leisure leave into --

           INT. HALLWAY - USS ALTON - CONTINUOUS

           -- the door closes behind them.

                                 LEISURE
                        Something wrong, sir?

                                 DARROW
                        Is this some kind of joke?

                                 LEISURE
                        What?

                                 DARROW
                        An erratic victim, a mute, and a witch?
                                 LEISURE
                        I don’t think I’m following.

                                 DARROW
                        Our clients, George. The world’s oddest 
                        family we were just talking to in there. 

                                 LEISURE
                        Well they may not be the most pleasant 
                        of people, but--

                                 DARROW
                        How am I supposed to sell a “loving 
                        family” with that?

                                 LEISURE
                        They’d need some work.

                                 DARROW
                        They’d need a goddamn miracle!

                                 LEISURE
                        Are you saying you’re quitting?

                                 DARROW
                        I’m saying I honestly think I had better 
                        chances with two murderers on death row.

           EXT. HONOLULU POLICE STATION - DAY

           Kelley and Nan leaving the station, walking to the car --

                                 NAN
                        So? Do you believe him? 

                                 KELLEY
                        I believe those boys aren’t perfect. I 
                        believe their story doesn’t look good 
                        for them.

                                 NAN
                        But do you believe him?

           Kelley stops. Thinking.

                                 KELLEY
                        The defense is going to try to use the 
                        unwritten law. They’ll claim this is an 
                        honor killing, try to use emotions to 
                        justify the murder. We’ll need to beat 
                        them with facts, things that are 
                        undeniable. We’ll need witnesses and 
                        plenty of them.

           Not exactly the answer she was looking for. He keeps walking. 
           But she doesn’t move. Staying until he finally looks back...
                                 KELLEY
                        Of course I believe them, Nan. Those 
                        boys have been innocent from day one.

           And that’s all she needed. Nodding, satisfied. They both get 
           in the car, heading off, and we CUT TO --

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - NEXT DAY

           A striking courthouse building. What could be a royal palace. 
           Stately. Grand. Concrete columns lining cut-stone walls.

           A GOLDEN STATUE perched on the front lawn. Majestic. Bold. 
           King Kamehameha I, standing tall. Spear in one hand, welcoming 
           gesture of Aloha in the other. The Hawaiian symbol of Justice.

           INT. JUDGE DAVIS’ CHAMBERS - DAY

           JUDGE “SKINNER” DAVIS (52), a clean-cut white man with social 
           grace nearly as Ivy-League as his moustache. He sips bourbon 
           across from Kelley. Both sitting in awkward silence until --

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        You sure I can’t get you anything to 
                        drink? Scotch? Whiskey?

                                 KELLEY
                        ... You have any milk?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Ah! A White-Russian kind of man!

                                 KELLEY
                        Uh, no sir. Sober. Two years.

           Judge Davis just taking that in with confusion as --

           The door OPENS. And it’s CLARENCE DARROW.

                                 DARROW
                        Gentlemen! My sincere apologies! If I had 
                        a good excuse I’d use it, but frankly I 
                        have to say that I was simply arrested by 
                        the magnificent beauty of this island. 
                        How you get any work done is beyond me.
                            (to Judge Davis)
                        Your Honor, it’s a pleasure.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                            (in obvious admiration)
                        Likewise, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        And Mr. John Carlton Kelley! 
                        Congratulations on the new position.
                                 KELLEY
                        ... Thanks.

           They shake hands. Our two opponents. Sizing each other up. 
           Darrow smiling warmly. Kelley utterly focused. 

           And the chess match begins.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Let’s get to business, shall we? This 
                        is an incredibly difficult case. And I 
                        feel it incumbent upon myself to tell 
                        you that regardless of what the press 
                        says, I’d like to keep this civilized.

                                 DARROW
                        I wholeheartedly agree, Your Honor. The 
                        defense will remain truthful and fair.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        ... Mr. Kelley?

           Kelley is caught studying Darrow.

                                 KELLEY
                        Uh, yes. Yes, I agree.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Wonderful. One other major point of 
                        contention: let’s talk about the first 
                        trial...

                                 KELLEY
                        Actually, Your Honor, let’s not. 

           Judge Davis and Darrow shooting a surprised look to Kelley.

                                 KELLEY
                        This trial is solely concerning the 
                        killing of Joseph Kahahawai.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Yes, I was just getting--

                                 KELLEY
                        By law we’re not allowed to discuss any 
                        evidence from the first case or bring 
                        up any witnesses to testify about it.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Yes, thank you, Mr--

                                 KELLEY
                        No matter what the defense chooses to 
                        base their case off of, we will not 
                        retry the Ala Moana case. 
                                 DARROW
                        Getting a little ahead of ourselves, are 
                        we, John?

           A tense silence. Kelley clearly insulted.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        As I was saying, the first trial shall 
                        live as its own entity. Unless proven 
                        to have relevance to this investigation 
                        we will not look into it.

                                 KELLEY
                        And what about the possibility of an 
                        insanity defense?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Oh, good Lord.

                                 DARROW
                        No, it’s alright. What about it?

                                 KELLEY
                        The defense can claim a form of 
                        insanity. It would relieve your clients 
                        of any criminal responsibility. 

                                 DARROW
                        I suppose it might.

                                 KELLEY
                        Are you going to use it?

                                 DARROW
                        Expound on what you mean by “use.”

                                 KELLEY
                        I mean use.

                                 DARROW
                        Well, I can’t be sure.

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Darrow, as a fairly close student 
                        of psychology, you must know that there 
                        is no tried and true way of determining 
                        who is sane or who is insane.

                                 DARROW
                        Who said I studied psychology?

                                 KELLEY
                        Your autobiography.

                                 DARROW
                        So you read it.
                                 KELLEY
                        Of course I did. 

                                 DARROW
                        Pity I hoped they’d be sold out by now.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Gentlemen. Whatever strategies you both 
                        decide on is between the two of you.

           A steely silence. Darrow and Kelley locked in a stare-off. 

                                 DARROW
                        The defense has no plans to plead 
                        insanity.

           Kelley considers Darrow. His composure. That smug smile. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Good. Now on to more tedious things...

           EXT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - HOUR LATER

           FLASH! -- Kelley, Darrow, and Judge Davis standing near the 
           courtroom doors, several PHOTOGRAPHERS right in front of 
           them, Kelley by far the most uncomfortable.

                                 DARROW
                        Doesn’t hurt to smile, y’know.

           Kelley trying a smile. It hurts. The photo session ends. 
           Darrow and Kelley gathering their things... 

                                 DARROW
                        Well, I’d say may the best man win, but 
                        I hear it’s unlucky to wish fortune 
                        onto oneself.

           Crickets. Kelley just staring.

                                 DARROW
                        Oh c’mon, son. I’m only kidding. I have 
                        the utmost respect for my opponents. 
                        Especially the rookies. In fact, if I 
                        may give you some advice. Just some 
                        friendly counsel from one veteran 
                        attorney to a...young and unproven one.

                                 KELLEY
                        Think I’m fine without it, thanks.
                                 DARROW
                        The best thing to do is embrace the 
                        fear. Let it drive you, keep you 
                        focused. It can be so easy to get lost 
                        in all this... drama. Just focus on 
                        making it out with your integrity. Lord 
                        knows, that’s all you can hope for in a 
                        case like this.

           And with a tip of the imaginary hat, Darrow begins to leave.

                                 KELLEY
                        And what about your integrity, sir?

           Darrow stops. Turns. Intrigued.

                                 DARROW
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 KELLEY
                        You’re taking a case that goes against 
                        everything you ever stood for. You think 
                        you’ll still make it out with yours?

           Darrow just staring. This kid. 

                                 KELLEY
                        I’ve followed your work, Mr. Darrow. 
                        Studied it thoroughly.
                            (looks to Leisure)
                        Seems every lawyer in the country has.
                        This case isn’t going to save your 
                        reputation. It’ll ruin it.

           These two men staring each other down. Like two gunslingers. 

                                 DARROW
                        Son, if I thought my reputation needed 
                        saving I wouldn’t have taken a case 
                        where my clients were found with the 
                        body of the victim in their trunk, 
                        murder weapons on them, blood literally 
                        on their hands.

           Kelley a little shocked that Darrow just admitted that.

                                 DARROW
                        You think I don’t know what I’m getting 
                        into? That’s the fun of this, John! The 
                        beauty of due process: you tell your 
                        story, I tell mine. Jury picks the truth.

                                 KELLEY
                        Spoken like a true lawyer.
                                 DARROW
                        Yes, something you may become in due 
                        time. Which reminds me. I did some 
                        “thorough studying” of my own.
                            (Leisure hands him a file)
                        John Carlton Kelley. Born in 1885. 
                        Butte, Montana. Son of a copper miner. 
                        Real son of a bitch too, kicked you out 
                        of the house at seventeen ‘cause you 
                        wouldn’t take up the family business. 

                                 KELLEY
                        How did--

                                 DARROW
                        You fought your way through law school. 
                        University of Michigan. Hit the bottle 
                        pretty hard. Packed your bags, traveled 
                        the world, looking for a place to take 
                        you in, finally landing here. You may 
                        be a little wet behind the ears, but 
                        you’re making do. Working hard as 
                        always. And that’s admirable, John, 
                        believe me, I was just like you once.
                        Look, all I’m saying, just be careful. I 
                        know you got the heart, kid, but this--
                            (taps his head)
                        --this takes experience. 

           And Darrow turns and goes, calling over his shoulder --

                                 DARROW
                        There’s a saying, you know: In England, 
                        a trial starts once the jury is 
                        selected. But in America, the trial 
                        ends when the jury is selected.

           And he’s gone. Kelley left there. Trying to make sense of all 
           that as we-- 

                                                                    CUT TO:

           INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

           A JURY BOX full of PROSPECTIVE JURORS. Looking right at us. 

           Kelley walks into the frame, eyes down on a LIST in hand. 
           Sweat running down his cheek. Visibly nervous. 

           He stops before a CAUCASIAN MAN, mid-50’s. Checks his list to 
           the NAMETAG the MAN is wearing.

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Seward, thank you for coming today.
                                 SEWARD
                        I had a choice?

           The prospective jurors LAUGH. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Seward, do you think you can give due 
                        weight to circumstantial evidence in 
                        arriving at your conclusion for this case?
                            (off Seward’s confusion)
                        What I mean is, will you base your 
                        opinion only on the evidence?

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 EDDIE KALEIWAHAE
                        I guess so.

           A YOUNG HAWAIIAN being questioned by Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        And do you have an opinion as to the 
                        guilt or innocence of the defendants?

                                 EDDIE KALEIWAHAE
                        I think the Massies should rot in hell. 

                                 DARROW
                        ... So shall we say undecided?

           Darrow CROSSES Kaleiwahae’s name off his list --

           JOHNNY NOBLE (35) BEING QUESTIONED

                                 KELLEY
                        Is your hearing bad, Mr. Noble?

                                 JOHNNY NOBLE
                            (playing dumb)
                        Sorry, I can’t hear you.

                                 KELLEY
                        It says here you’re an orchestra leader.

                                 JOHNNY NOBLE
                        Yeah, still can’t hear a single word.

           MR. MIOI (70) BEING QUESTIONED

                                 MR. MIOI
                        Look, I’m a fisherman. I have bigger 
                        fish to fry.
           ANOTHER JUROR

                                 MR. SORENSON
                        My wife has a job, you see. I need to 
                        take care of the kids.

           ANOTHER JUROR

                                 MR. BEYER
                        The boy deserved to be shot.

           Kelley STRIKES Beyer’s name off the list --

           ANOTHER JUROR

                                 MR. FUKUDA
                        The Massies should be executed.

           Darrow STRIKES Fukuda’s name off the list --

           ANOTHER JUROR

                                 MR. AKEA
                        Everyone’s guilty. Society is to blame.

           Kelley and Darrow share a look. Both STRIKE Akea’s name --

           ANOTHER JUROR

                                 KELLEY
                        And you wouldn’t let any outside 
                        influence sway your position?

                                 EDWARD GOEAS
                        No, I don’t think so.

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you.

           Kelley CIRCLES a NAME. Finally. Darrow looking up from his 
           own LIST, at a line of 60 MORE JURORS. Oh, Jesus.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Next juror, please.

           INT. CORRIDOR - THE COURTROOM - TWO HOURS LATER

           The doors FLY OPEN and Darrow and Leisure are the first out, 
           waving off reporters, SHOUTING over the crowd --

                                 DARROW
                        Jesus! Have you ever seen people so 
                        scared of being chosen for a jury?! 

                                 LEISURE
                        Scared?! Why d’you say that, sir?!
                                 A REPORTER
                        Mr. Darrow have you heard of the threats 
                        on the remaining Hawaiian boys’ lives?! 

           Darrow shoots Leisure a look. That’s why.

           BEHIND THEM

           Kelley coming out, heading into the lobby as --

                                 JOE SR. (O.S.)
                        Kelley? John Kelley?

           JOE SR. and ESTHER KAHAHAWAI waiting by the entrance. Joe Sr. 
           immediately accosting him --

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Kahahawai--

                                 JOE SR.
                        They said they’d find a new prosecutor. 
                        Told us they’d get someone to defend our 
                        son. They never mentioned he was a haole. 

           Kelley struggling to find the words...

                                 ESTHER
                        Joe--

                                 JOE SR.
                        Who are you to take a case like this? 
                        They killed my son. They murdered an 
                        innocent boy. How are we supposed to 
                        trust someone like you?

                                 KELLEY
                        Sir, I took this case precisely because 
                        I wasn’t okay with it. I’m going to do 
                        whatever I can to bring justice for 
                        Joe. Everything in my power.

                                 JOE SR.
                        Justice? What justice? He’s dead! He’s 
                        gone forever! Where’s justice in that?!

                                 NAN (O.S.)
                        There is none.

           And all eyes are on Nan now. Approaching behind them.

                                 NAN
                        Which is why we need to win. To prove 
                        to the community and the country that 
                        they can’t get away it.
                                 JOE SR.
                        ... Who is this?

                                 KELLEY
                        This is my wife.

                                 NAN
                        I’m Mr. Kelley’s assistant counsel.

                                 JOE SR.
                        You’re his wife?

                                 NAN
                        And assistant counsel.

                                 JOE SR.
                        You married a--

                                 NAN
                        A good man. Just like your son.

           Joe Sr. staring. Nan staring right back.

                                 NAN
                        I can’t imagine how hard this must be. 
                        We have two children of our own and the 
                        thought of losing them... it’s...

                                 ESTHER
                        Unbearable.

           Esther couldn’t help but say it. The wound still tender. 

                                 NAN
                        You need to believe in my husband. You 
                        need to trust that he can bring justice 
                        for your son. 

                                 JOE SR.
                        I trust that he will lose.

           And all eyes shift back to Joe Sr.

                                 JOE SR.
                        Y’know, I looked you up, Mr. Kelley... 
                        Seems losing is what you do best. 

           And off Kelley’s speechless face, we move back to --

           DARROW

           Witnessing all this from the corner. Watching as Joe Sr. 
           storms out, camera bulbs FLASHING on a startled Kelley as --
           EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH LUAU - NIGHT

           A PHOTOGRAPHER SNAPS a photo of a WHITE FAMILY in front of -- 

           A small stage. Hula Dancers. Slack-key guitar music. Plastic 
           leis. Hundreds of VACATIONERS at their tables. The ultimate 
           touristy attraction. And among all this is --

           Darrow sitting with Ruby and Leisure in the back. Ruby on her 
           third cigarette. Darrow on his third drink.

                                 DARROW
                        The thing is that the jury always wants 
                        to follow their heart. They want to be 
                        led by their emotions. It’s human. 
                        Natural. It’s what I based the entirety 
                        of Leopold and Loeb on.

                                 LEISURE
                        My favorite case, sir.

                                 DARROW
                        Listen, George: there is no conscious 
                        choice between right and wrong. We 
                        think we have that choice. But we’re 
                        wrong. It’s the psychological, the 
                        physical, the environmental influences, 
                        that’s what control human behavior. 
                        It’s beyond us, son, you see what I’m 
                        saying? We just don’t know it.

                                 LEISURE
                        And how would you prove that?

           Darrow takes a sip of his drink. Calm. And just like that --

           WHACK! -- Darrow SLAPS Leisure’s hand on the table.

                                 LEISURE
                        Owww!!!

                            (rolling her eyes)
                        For heaven’s sake...

                                 DARROW
                        Oh, I’m sorry, George, did that hurt?

                                 LEISURE
                        I-- Yes!

                                 DARROW
                        Are you angry?

                                 LEISURE
                        Yes!
                                 DARROW
                        Why?

                                 LEISURE
                        You just... You hit my--

                                 DARROW
                        I hit your hand. 

                                 LEISURE
                        Yes!

                                 DARROW
                        I did it. An external force. That’s what 
                        caused the pain which produced the 
                        emotion of anger. You didn’t just 
                        produce that anger on your own, did you?

                                 LEISURE
                        Well I’m not...

                                 DARROW
                        You see what I’m saying, George?

                                 LEISURE
                        No, I really don’t.

                                 RUBY
                        Leave the poor boy alone.

                                 DARROW
                        The Massies killed Joseph Kahahawai. 
                        They did. And everyone in that 
                        courtroom is going to know that. But 
                        they were smacked on the hand. Hard. 
                        And that’s what caused their anger, 
                        that’s what caused their distorted 
                        judgment, and that’s what led them to 
                        kidnap this boy. It doesn’t matter what 
                        anyone else thinks or believes, our 
                        clients included, it’s how they feel, 
                        that’s what we’re going to need to win 
                        this case. It’s a game of narratives, 
                        George. Who can tell the better story.

                                 LEISURE
                        And what’s our story?

           Off Darrow’s sly smile, we CUT TO --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON KELLEY’S FACE.

                                 KELLEY
                        We don’t have one.
           WIDER TO REVEAL -- We’re with Kelley and Nan in their living 
           room, which is now full from wall-to-wall in files and boxes. 
           Nan is sitting on the couch. Kelley pacing. 

                                 NAN
                        John--

                                 KELLEY
                        We don’t have a story. We don’t even 
                        have a case. We’re walking in there 
                        tomorrow with nothing but evidence and 
                        secondhand testimony. It’s not a case, 
                        Nan, it’s a damn police report.

                                 NAN
                        We have facts. Indisputable facts. 

                                 KELLEY
                        And you think that will be enough?

                                 NAN
                        It should be.

                                 KELLEY
                        Well it’s not! We have to convince an 
                        Ivy-league judge, a majority white male 
                        jury, and above all the court of public 
                        opinion... most of whom are sending 
                        sympathy flowers to the Massies. And 
                        death threats to us! 

           Kelley gestures to a growing HEAP OF LETTERS near the door.

                                 NAN
                        You’re worried, I understand that. And 
                        it’s good you’re doubting our case. But 
                        you have to trust that the evidence is 
                        enough to win. The truth will be enough.

           Kelley contemplates that. Unsure. Fire of his doubt gaining 
           fuel as he lifts the NEWSPAPER, reads the HEADLINE:

                     “HAWAII NATIVES CANNOT BE TRUSTED!”

           And as we PUSH IN on the paper, taking that in, we CUT TO --

           ANOTHER HEADLINE: 

                  “HALF-CASTES LIE IN WAIT TO RAVAGE AMERICANS!”

           Being read by a CROWD of Hawaiians, all crammed in a small 
           KALIHI food shop, outraged by the portrayal. And CUT TO --

           EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - DAY

           A few WAIKIKI BEACH BOYS reading a different headline:
                      “HONOR KILLING THREATENS RACE WAR!”

           They clock the suspicious looks of haole tourists as CUT TO --

           TITLE: U.S. 14TH NAVAL DISTRICT - SAN DIEGO, CA

           A group of NAVY MEN in a mess hall, LAUGHING as they look at 
           a HAND-DRAWN CARTOON in the papers (actual drawing):

           A HAWAIIAN resembling a beast, white WOMAN in one hand, club 
           in the other, HEADLINE:

                 “HAWAII’S HIDEOUS TREATMENT OF AMERICAN WOMEN!”

           TITLE: NAACP HEADQUARTERS - BALTIMORE, MD

           A crowd of accomplished AFRICAN-AMERICANS, shaking their

                       “ASSAULT IN ISLANDS INESCAPABLE!”

           TITLE: SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO

           A NAVAJO crowd reading another HEADLINE in disgust:

           TITLE: NEW YORK, NEW YORK

           Several SUITED WHITE MEN getting their shoes shined, hold up 
           another HEADLINE with pride:

           Below them, THREE BLACK SHOESHINES spit their opinions onto 
           the fine leather of these men’s boots. 

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The courthouse. The big day. A GROWING PROTEST on one side of 
           the sidewalk. Hawaiians. Locals. Impassioned. Outraged.

           And ANOTHER GROWING PROTEST on the other side. Whites. 
           Sailors. Also impassioned. Also outraged. Right down the 
           middle of these two OPPOSING GROUPS is --

           A NEVER-ENDING LINE OF PEOPLE. Extending all the way down the 
           street. Suits. Dresses. All waiting. Hoping to witness first 
           hand the trial of the century. The biggest case Hawaii has 
           ever seen. And passing by them to the doors is --

           KELLEY AND NAN. Arm in arm. Walking confidently. Proudly. 

           We’re into ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT now...

           They stride to the doors, the GUARDSMAN stepping in front --
                                 WHITE GUARDSMAN
                        Uh sir, you’ll notice the line of 
                        people behind you.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m John Kelley. City Prosecutor.
                            (he still doesn’t get it)
                        The lawyer for this case.

           The Guardsman furrows his brow. Looks at a NEWSPAPER in hand: 
           A PICTURE of Kelley and Darrow: “DAVID VS. GOLIATH!”

           A look of disgust coming over his face. Kelley not waiting --

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you.

           And they continue on, entering into --

           INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- where they’re immediately in another BUSTLE OF NOISE. 
           Crowds of REPORTERS. Hoards of LAWYERS. Several recognizing 
           Kelley, but most just looking on, never thinking twice --

           Kelley and Nan following the line of people through the 
           concourse -- down the hall -- crossing the MARBLE FLOORS -- 
           passing the MURALS of former HAWAIIAN JUDGES, ROYALTY, KINGS -- 
           a history of former greatness looking down upon them -- 

           They arrive at a CLOSED DOOR at the end of the hallway. 

                                 NAN
                        Hold on.

           Nan grabs her husband. Fixes his jacket. Brushes him off. 

                                 NAN
                        You’re ready.

                                 KELLEY
                        We’re ready.

           She nods. He nods. And they head into --

           INT. THE COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The big room. Teeming with anxiety. Not an inch of standing 
           space. Literally every seat, every wall, full of people. 

           Kelley and Nan walk down the aisle, continuing to the front. 
           Nan sits in the front row, right behind Kelley. Kelley 
           continues to his table. Glancing over at --

           CLARENCE DARROW. Waiting there at the defense table. Slouched 
           deep in his chair. That same casual smile.
                                 DARROW
                        Afternoon, John. Let’s put on a show, 
                        shall we?

                                 BAILIFF (O.S.)
                        All rise.

           And the shot finally ends as we CUT TO --

           JUDGE DAVIS entering. The entire COURTROOM standing.

           The Judge motions for everyone to sit.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Calling the case of the Territory of 
                        Hawaii versus Grace Fortescue. Is the 
                        plaintiff ready?

                                 KELLEY
                        Yes, Your Honor.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS 
                        Defense?

                                 DARROW
                        Always.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Let’s begin.

           And Kelley stands. Takes in a measured breath. This is it. 
           The silence in the room is palpable.

                                 KELLEY
                        Gentlemen, on January 8th, 1932, Mrs. 
                        Grace Fortescue and Lt. Tommie Massie 
                        kidnapped and killed Joseph Kahahawai 
                        Jr., put him in their trunk, and drove 
                        him to Koko Head cliff with the intent 
                        of dumping his body. How do we know 
                        this? Because they are facts. Because 
                        of the overwhelming and undeniable 
                        physical evidence acquired. Now you may 
                        begin to say, “Perhaps their actions 
                        were justified. Perhaps they had a 
                        right to do what they did.” And I’m 
                        here to remind you today of three very 
                        crucial things: One, Joseph Kahahawai 
                        Jr. and the other Hawaiian boys accused 
                        of raping Mrs. Massie were never found 
                        guilty. Two, the boys have never once 
                        admitted to ever assaulting Mrs. 
                        Massie. In fact, they vehemently deny 
                        it. Three, and most importantly, Grace 
                        Fortescue and Lt. Massie kidnapped and 
                        killed a young Hawaiian boy. 
                        No matter how you feel about the crime, 
                        the crime itself is undeniable. 
                        Unlawful. Unholy. 
                            (beat)
                        Justice should be served, gentlemen. 
                        But it should be served according to 
                        the facts. The law is in your hands.

           And Kelley nods to himself. Satisfied. Glances back at Nan, 
           who gives him a nod of approval. He sits back down.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Is the defense prepared to make an 
                        opening statement?

           Darrow slowly stands...

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, the defense will wave its 
                        opening statement.

           And Darrow sits. A loud RUMBLE in the room. 

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Are you sure, counsel?

                                 DARROW
                        Quite sure.

           Kelley shares a look with Nan, Grace and Thalia sharing the 
           same look: What’s he doing?

           EDDIE ULI’I (19) ON THE STAND 

                                 EDDIE ULI’I
                        Eddie Uli’i. Friend of Joe Kahahawai. I 
                        saw him getting kidnapped.

                                 KELLEY
                        And please tell us, Mr. Uli’i, is this 
                        the paper that was used as a fake 
                        “summons” to lure Mr. Kahahawai into 
                        the car of Grace Fortescue?

           Kelley hands him the paper. If it weren’t real evidence, it 
           would seem a joke: 

           A HANDWRITTEN note with a GOLD SEAL STICKER at the top.

                                 EDDIE ULI’I
                        Yes. That’s the one. They were holding 
                        him at gunpoint.

                                 KELLEY
                        Would you please point out who was in 
                        the car?
                                 EDDIE ULI’I
                            (pointing)
                        Both of them.

                                 KELLEY
                        Let the record show that the witness is 
                        pointing to both defendants. Thank you, 
                        Mr. Uli’i. No further questions.

           Darrow doesn’t move.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow? Your cross examination?

                                 DARROW
                        No thank you. No questions, Your Honor.

           More MURMURS among the room. Again? Kelley and Nan exchanging 
           another baffled look. Grace fidgeting, just as confused.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Very well. Next witness.

           DR. FAUS ON THE STAND

                                 DR. FAUS
                        Dr. Robert Faus, coroner for the City 
                        and County of Honolulu. I performed an 
                        autopsy on the body of Mr. Kahahawai. 

                                 KELLEY
                        And what did you find in the body?

           Dr. Faus holds up an EXPLODED CARTRIDGE from an ENVELOPE.

                                 DR. FAUS
                        A lead bullet from a .45 Caliber 
                        revolver, lodged in the right side of 
                        his chest. Whoever shot him did so from 
                        the front, and in close proximity.

           CHRIS OMURA ON THE STAND

                                 CHRIS OMURA
                        Chris Omura, employee at Palolo Auto  
                        service. I rented out a black Buick to 
                        Lt. Thomas Massie. He was with a woman. 
                        I think her name was Fortescue?

           TOSHI ADACHI ON THE STAND

                                 TOSHI ADACHI
                        Toshi Adachi, Mrs. Fortescue’s maid. 
                        She paid me early, told me not to come 
                        in the next day. That was the day of 
                        the killing.
           OFFICER MACHADO ON THE STAND

           The same Officer from the beginning of the film.

                                 OFFICER MACHADO
                        Officer Luciano Machado, Honolulu Police 
                        Department. My partner and I noticed a 
                        black Buick driving with the shades down. 
                        Seemed suspicious for 10 AM. So we 
                        followed them, put our sirens on, ended 
                        up chasing them all the way to Koko Head. 
                        We finally pulled off to the side and 
                        asked all of them to exit their vehicle.

                                 KELLEY
                        What did you find, Officer?

                                 OFFICER MACHADO
                        A body. Joseph Kahahawai’s body in the 
                        trunk. The assailants admitted they 
                        were going to dump the body into the 
                        ocean. Mrs. Fortescue told us her only 
                        regret was not pulling the shades down.

           Several in the room REACT with disgust. We begin to hear 
           SOBBING from the back of the room, the crowd turning to see -- 

           ESTHER KAHAHAWAI in complete hysterics. Joe Sr. trying to 
           comfort her. Darrow quickly standing --

                                 DARROW
                        Please, Your Honor, I ask that the 
                        victim’s mother be removed from the 
                        courtroom. She’s a distraction and 
                        she’s being used as an unfair stratagem 
                        to sway the jury.

                                 KELLEY
                        A what?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow, if the victim’s mother 
                        would like to be in the courtroom, that 
                        is her prerogative. I’ll have to deny.

           Darrow shrugs. Worth a shot. Sits back down.

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you. I have no further questions.

           He walks off. Confident. Job well done in his mind. Only to 
           see -- THE JURY slouched. Yawning. Bored to tears.

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, I’d like to suggest that we 
                        take a recess and pick this up tomorrow.
                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        I think that is wise. Let’s adjourn for 
                        the day. The territory can call their 
                        next witness tomorrow morning.

           And off the POUNDING of the gavel --

           INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Darrow on his way out, REPORTERS swarming --

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Darrow, why so quiet today?

                                 DARROW
                        Well, I suppose I was a little tired.

                                 REPORTER
                        Tired from what?

                                 DARROW
                        Probably from the monotonous nature of 
                        the prosecution’s case.

           The Reporters all LAUGH.

                                 DARROW
                        I’m only kidding, boys. This trial 
                        won’t start for another few days. Until 
                        then, let’s brave through this 
                        presentation of evidence together.

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Midnight. A single LIGHT on in the house.

                                 KELLEY (V.O.)
                        The nerve! The absolute nerve!

           INT. BEDROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelley paces. Nan sitting on the bed, scattered in paperwork.

                                 KELLEY
                        Monotonous? Really? We’re offering a 
                        good case here, presenting all the 
                        evidence, well-organized...

                                 NAN
                        John...

                                 KELLEY
                        What?

           She gives him a gentle look. Just calm down. Kelley sits.
                                 NAN
                        You wanna know what I think? 

                                 KELLEY
                        Always.

                                 NAN
                        I think if we want to win, we need to 
                        win the people. I think you could 
                        afford to be a little more... dramatic.

           INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

           ESTHER KAHAHAWAI on the stand. Head held high. Fighting 
           through the grief. Bravely reining in the tears.

                                 KELLEY
                        And did you have any other children 
                        with your first husband?

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes. We had four children. Two of them 
                        died at an early age. And now with 
                        Joseph passed, I have only one daughter.

           Sympathetic GROANS from some in the room.

                                 KELLEY
                        Mrs. Kahahawai, when was the last time 
                        you saw your son?

                                 ESTHER
                        That Friday morning. He left home for 
                        his appointment at the courthouse.
                        A meeting with his probation officer.

                                 KELLEY
                        Why was he meeting a probation officer?

                                 ESTHER
                        He had to. After the Ala Moana trial, 
                        Judge Steadman ordered Joe and all the 
                        other boys to report daily.

                                 KELLEY
                        Sorry, you mean the trial that ended in 
                        a deadlock? They had to serve probation 
                        for a crime they weren’t sentenced for?

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes, sir.

           Kelley let’s that sit in with the JURY a moment. He looks 
           behind him to Nan. She nods in encouragement. 
           He walks to the evidence table. He’ll pick up and put down 
           all of the following evidence...

                                 KELLEY
                        Mrs. Kahahawai, are these the socks 
                        that Joe wore on Friday, January 8th?

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes.

                                 KELLEY
                        Are these the overalls he wore that day?

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes.

                                 KELLEY
                        Are these the shorts he wore that day?

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes.

                                 KELLEY
                        And is this the shirt that your son 
                        wore that day?

           Kelley holds up the stained shirt. It’s covered in BLOOD. 
           BULLET HOLE right by the chest. The entire room WHIMPERS.

                                 ESTHER
                        Yes. That’s his shirt. I washed it the 
                        night before.

           She breaks down. Nan watching the JURY: They’re all 
           enthralled. One of them even wiping away a tear.

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you, Mrs. Kahahawai. I have no 
                        more questions.

           And the Judge looks to Darrow for his cross-exam.

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, Mr. Kelley has clearly put 
                        the witness through enough emotional 
                        distress as it is. I think a cross-
                        examination is unnecessary. Thank you.

           Darrow sits. Kelley shooting him a look. 

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mrs. Kahahawai, you may step down.

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - HOUR LATER

           The afternoon SUN sears down on a CROWD peeking in on...
                                 KELLEY (V.O.)
                        Would you state your name and 
                        employment for the record please?

           INT. THE COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           VASCO ROSA on the stand. 40’s. Portuguese. A tall, powerful 
           physical presence, but a calm demeanor. Assured and succinct.

                                 ROSA
                        Vasco Rosa. Employee of the sporting 
                        good department of Diamond-Hall Company.

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Rosa do you have a sales record for 
                        December 16th and 17th for a firearm?

                                 ROSA
                        I do.

                                 KELLEY
                        What name is on your record for the 
                        purchase of a gun on that date?

                                 ROSA
                        Thomas H. Massie. It was one .32 
                        Caliber Colt automatic pistol, for $25.

                                 KELLEY
                        Did you also sell a gun on December 15, 
                        on a permit dated December 14?

                                 ROSA
                        Yes. To Mrs. Grace Fortescue.

           An audible GASP from the room. Kelley walks to the evidence 
           table once again and picks up several clips and cartridges. 

           He places them in a row on the stand, right in front of Rosa. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Rosa, would you please continue 
                        with the description of the gun 
                        purchased by Mrs. Fortescue?

                                 ROSA
                        It was a .45 Caliber Iver Johnson 
                        revolver.

                                 KELLEY
                        Would you please pick up the bullet 
                        that the coroner took out of Joseph 
                        Kahahawai’s body?
                            (Rosa picks it up)
                        Would you please pick up the bullet from 
                        a clip on the person of Mrs. Grace 
                        Fortescue on the morning of January 8th?
                            (Rosa picks it up)
                        Can you state if the bullets you have 
                        in your hand are the same?

                                 ROSA
                        They are.

                                 KELLEY
                        Will you please pick up the cartridge 
                        found on Thomas Massie on January 8th?
                            (Rosa picks it up)
                        Can you fit the bullet into the casing?

           Very carefully, Rosa picks up the CASING, twists the tiny bit 
           of LEAD into the SHELL, and --

                                 ROSA
                        No, sir. It doesn’t fit.

           The entire ROOM whispering, confused, leaning forward now...

                                 KELLEY
                        Will you please pick up the empty 
                        cartridge found on Grace Fortescue on 
                        January 8th?
                            (Rosa picks it up)
                        Can you fit the bullet into this casing?

           Rosa tries once again, picking up the new CASING, trying to 
           twist it in, and --

                                 ROSA
                        Fits perfectly, sir.

           GASPS. Grace silently reeling.

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Rosa, in your professional opinion, 
                        could that bullet, found in the body of 
                        Joe Kahahawai, have been fired out of 
                        the casing found on Mrs. Grace 
                        Fortescue on January 8th?

                                 ROSA
                        Absolutely, sir.

                                 KELLEY
                        I have no further questions, your Honor.

           A BUZZ of conversation. Kelley walking back with a smile. 
           Darrow sitting there thinking. An idea forming.
                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                            (looking at his notes)
                        Mr. Darrow, I’m assuming you wish to 
                        waive your cross-examination?

                                 DARROW
                        Actually--
                            (he rises)
                        Mr. Rosa, you don’t mean to say this 
                        bullet was fired from that cartridge?

                                 ROSA
                        No. Only that it might have been.

                                 DARROW
                        There’s no way you can know for sure, 
                        is there?

                                 KELLEY
                        Objection!

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Overruled.

                                 DARROW
                        Mr. Rosa, about how many pistols did 
                        you sell during December?

                                 ROSA
                        I’d say about sixty.

                                 DARROW
                        Was that after the Massie rape?

                                 KELLEY
                        Objection!

                                 DARROW
                        I’ll rephrase, was it after the alleged 
                        Massie rape?

                                 ROSA
                        Yes, it was.

                                 DARROW
                        Was it before or after the news of the 
                        recent rape at the Honolulu airport?

                                 ROSA
                        What rape at the airport?

                                 DARROW
                        Was it before or after the escape of 
                        Hawaiian prisoner Daniel Lyman?
                                 ROSA
                        Who is--

                                 DARROW
                        Was it before or after the brawl between 
                        locals and sailors on Hotel Street?

                                 ROSA
                        I don’t remember.

                                 DARROW
                        And would you say the people purchasing 
                        these pistols were mostly women?

                                 KELLEY
                        Objection! The question is irrelevant 
                        and completely suggestive--

                                 DARROW
                        Would you say the recent assaults on 
                        this island might have caused some of 
                        the women in this territory to become-- 

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor...

                                 DARROW
                        --nervous for their own safety?

                                 KELLEY
                        I must ask that be stricken from the 
                        record!

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Sustained. Counsel, that’s enough.

                                 DARROW
                        You’re right. I withdraw. Witness 
                        dismissed.

           And Darrow moves back to his table. The slightest of smirks. 
           He slumps back in his chair. Returns to DOODLING on his pad.

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - LATER

           On the front steps. The REPORTERS surrounding Kelley...

                                 REPORTER
                        A devastating prosecution you presented 
                        today, Mr. Kelley. What was the 
                        difference?

                                 KELLEY
                        Uh, well... we were focused.
                                 REPORTER #2
                        And what are your opinions on why Mr. 
                        Darrow has remained so quiet thus far?

                                 KELLEY
                        Whatever Mr. Darrow does is Mr. 
                        Darrow’s prerogative.

                                 REPORTER #3
                        Yes, but are you at all worried this is 
                        part of Mr. Darrow’s master plan?

                                 KELLEY
                        His what?

           ON THE SIDEWALK

           Nan watches this from a distance. Until she hears --

                                 RUBY (O.S.)
                        It only gets worse from here, y’know.

           Nan turns to see RUBY DARROW. Standing there. Smoking.

                                 RUBY
                        More and more questions. Harder ones 
                        too. More personal. But in time, you’ll 
                        both learn to turn a deaf ear. Tell you 
                        one thing, nothing reporters hate more 
                        than the sound of silence.

           Nan just gives an incredulous stare. Ruby extends her hand.

                                 RUBY
                        I’m Ruby, by the way. Or Mrs. Darrow, 
                        if you prefer. But I prefer Ruby.

                                 NAN
                        I know who you are.

           Ruby keeps holding out her hand. Waiting. Nan finally shakes.

                                 RUBY
                        So you’re a lawyer too?

                                 NAN
                        Not officially.

                                 RUBY
                        But you studied law?

                                 NAN
                        I’ve studied injustice.

           Ruby pauses, holding a look with Nan. She likes this woman. 
                                 RUBY
                        Well you two seem to make a great team.

           She nods at Kelley. Nan is startled by that compliment. She 
           merely looks forward. An uncomfortable silence. Until --

                                 NAN
                        Is that what you do too? Law?

                                 RUBY
                        Oh, heavens no. I’m a writer. Or I was. 
                        A journalist. For the Chicago Defender. 
                        First woman they hired... and for a 
                        while the only one in the bullpen.

           Nan didn’t know that. The admiration going both ways now.

                                 NAN
                        Wow, that must’ve been...

                                 RUBY
                        Just as dreadful as it sounds.
                            (laughs)
                        Suppose I’ve always loved studying 
                        people: what shapes them, drives them...

           She smiles at Darrow. Clocks Nan’s reaction to her husband. 

                                 RUBY
                        You’re not very fond of my husband?

                                 NAN
                        Do I have reason to be?

           Ruby genuinely considers that. Watching her husband talk to 
           reporters, as if watching a vague memory.

                                 RUBY
                        Clarence Darrow is one the most 
                        compassionate people you could ever 
                        meet, Mrs. Kelley. But he’s also one of 
                        the most ambitious. Live with him long 
                        enough and you’ll see that those two 
                        are always at odds.

           And with that, Ruby goes. Nan watching, curiously touched. 

           BACK ON KELLEY

                                 KELLEY
                        Look, gentlemen, I can only speak on 
                        behalf of the territory, but I can 
                        assure you we’ll be ready for whatever 
                        Mr. Darrow throws at us tomorrow. 
                        That’ll be all, thank you.
           Kelley recedes into the crowd. Joining Nan on the sidewalk. 

           ON GRACE: observing. She studies Darrow laughing up a storm 
           with the press. Something clearly not sitting well with her.

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - USS ALTON - NIGHT

           Darrow, Leisure, Tommie, and Thalia all watching a furious 
           Grace pace in front of them...

                                 GRACE
                        It is humiliating! It is absolutely 
                        mortifying!

                                 DARROW
                        Please, Mrs. Fortescue, why don’t we--

                                 GRACE
                        They are getting away with murder in 
                        there! Absolute murder! And you know 
                        what you’re doing about it?! Not a 
                        goddamn thing!

                                 DARROW
                        Getting away with murder. Interesting 
                        word choice.

                                 GRACE
                        I am paying you an exorbitant amount of 
                        money TO WIN, Clarence, not to sit 
                        there and watch us all get slaughtered!

                                 DARROW
                        Again. Word choice.

                                 GRACE
                        If you’re going to lose us this case, 
                        I’d rather you tell me now so I can 
                        take this up with the board and have 
                        you disbarred! 

                                 DARROW
                        And I presume you have friends in high 
                        places who can do that for you.

                                 GRACE
                        You’re goddamn right I do!

                                 LEISURE
                        Mrs. Fortescue, I think if you’d let him--

                                 GRACE
                        DID I SAY YOU COULD SPEAK?!

           Sudden. Almost animalistic. Leisure just standing there 
           paralyzed. This woman slowly beginning to scare him.
           And Darrow stands, finally fed up.

                                 DARROW
                        Alright listen here. You hired me to 
                        set you free, Mrs. Fortescue, not to be 
                        your punching bag. You want another 
                        lawyer? Fine, I’ll happily sail on the 
                        next steamer to Chicago, send a 
                        postcard to you in solitary 
                        confinement. But if you wanna win, then 
                        like it or not, you need to let me do 
                        my job. I have a plan. And part of my 
                        plan is NOT telling you my plan. I know 
                        that makes you uncomfortable, not being 
                        in control, but frankly, I’m the only 
                        thing standing between you and a 
                        lifetime behind bars. It’s your call.

           Grace and Darrow stare at each other. Neither blinking.

                                 DARROW
                        Wonderful. Lt. Massie, let’s start with 
                        discussing your side of the story...

           CAMERA PUSHES IN on Tommie’s glassy-eyed expression, as we --

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

           TOMMIE on the stand. Tense. In crisp Navy whites. 

           It’s the next day. Another full house. Except this time, 
           there are noticeably more WHITE FACES in the audience. 
           Sailors. A few high ranking OFFICERS. All watching as -- 

           DARROW steps up. Head bowed. Complete silence.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow? Would you like to begin?

           Darrow holds a finger up: One moment. He walks back to his 
           table. Takes a sip of water. Relishing this moment on the 
           grand stage now. Milking everything he can.

           He finally approaches Tomie. Looks back to Grace. Gives a 
           little tip of the hat. And the show begins...

                                 DARROW
                        Lieutenant Massie... Thank you for 
                        appearing before us today... Lieutenant, 
                        would you consider yourself a hero?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Oh, I uh... No, sir. No more than any 
                        other soldier.
                                 DARROW
                        Of course... I suppose true heroes are 
                        always the humblest.
                            (paces again)
                        Do you remember an incident of going to 
                        a dance on September of last year?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 DARROW
                        And where was this party?

                                 TOMMIE
                        At the Ala Wai Inn. 

                                 DARROW
                        At the Ala Wai Inn. And would you please 
                        explain to us what happened that night?

           Kelley is instantly on his feet --

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, I’d like to remind the 
                        defense that the court has already 
                        decided we will limit testimony to the 
                        killing of Mr. Kahahawai. Nothing more.

                                 DARROW
                        And I’d like to remind the territory 
                        that this was only true if testimony 
                        had no relevance to this investigation.

                                 KELLEY
                        Which it doesn’t.

                                 DARROW
                        Which we couldn’t know because the 
                        witness hasn’t started speaking yet.

           Some CHUCKLES in the audience.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        I’ll allow the discussion of the first 
                        case so long as it deals with the 
                        effects it had on Lt. Massie. Please 
                        proceed, Mr. Darrow.

                                 DARROW
                        Apologies for that, Lieutenant. Now, 
                        September 12, 1931. Would you please 
                        explain to us what happened?

           Kelley slowly sits. Tommie looks to Grace who gives a icy nod.
                                 TOMMIE
                        Uh, well, we went to the Ala Wai Inn. 
                        There was this dance. My wife left a 
                        little early and I met her back at home 
                        later that night. When I returned, she 
                        came stumblin’ to the door...

           As Tommie says the next few sentences, we see that Thalia is 
           mouthing the exact words to herself, memorized...

                                 TOMMIE
                        She was battered, bleedin’ from the 
                        nose and mouth, lyin’ in my arms and 
                        sobbin’ that she’d been raped over and 
                        over. I sat there stunned, and she 
                        just, she kept sayin’ to me, “I want to 
                        die! I hope to die!” Eventually she 
                        told me it was five Hawaiian boys who 
                        did it. One big boy led the whole 
                        thing, he was the ring-leader, y’see.

                                 DARROW
                        Would you later realize who this was?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Yes. It was Joseph Kahahawai.

           MURMURS. Heads shaking. Joe Sr. and Esther in a silent rage.

                                 TOMMIE
                        I was helpless. She just stayed 
                        there... In my arms... Cryin’ and 
                        sobbin’. She was weak... Completely 
                        broken... It... Oh God, it was...

           And Tommie puts his head down in his arms. All part of the 
           act. Darrow signals to Leisure. Leisure pours a cup of water. 
           Walks it to Tommie, who takes a sip, regains himself.

                                 DARROW
                        Are you able to continue, Lieutenant?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Sir, if my wife had to endure what she 
                        did, I’m sure this is the least I can do.

           Sympathetic WHIMPERS across the room. Everyone hung on every 
           word Tommie is saying. Several people dot their eyes.

                                 DARROW
                        Very well, Lieutenant. We thank you for 
                        your bravery. Would you please explain 
                        what happened to you after the trial?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Well, I began to hear rumors.
                                 DARROW
                        What kind of rumors?

                                 TOMMIE
                        About my wife. About me. That I didn’t 
                        believe her. That we were getting a 
                        divorce. That my wife wasn’t assaulted 
                        at all. That she was just some notoriety 
                        seeker trying to get in the headlines.

                                 DARROW
                        And was any of this true?

                                 TOMMIE
                        No. Absolutely not. But the enlisted men, 
                        they shunned me. You gotta understand, 
                        sir. Honor... it’s all we got in the Navy. 
                        For these men to be saying this... 

           Tommie looks to Thalia, then to the Navymen in the chamber...

                                 TOMMIE
                        Jesus, it nearly killed me. My honor 
                        was taken away. From my wife. From my 
                        marriage. And I had to restore it... 
                        restore it in any way I could.

                                 DARROW
                        So what did you decide to do then?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Well I talked with Mrs. Fortescue about 
                        how we might stop the rumors. I heard 
                        that Kahahawai was getting ready to 
                        crack and I knew we’d need a confession 
                        to win the case--

           And Kelley’s standing once again --

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, I’d like to know if the 
                        defense plans to deem this murder an 
                        honor killing.

                                 DARROW
                        Well counselor, if you’d let me--

                                 KELLEY
                        Because it seems as though the defense 
                        is painting the story of a husband who 
                        has killed another man because of what 
                        this man may have done to his wife, but 
                        under the law--
                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, if Mr. Kelley would like to 
                        try my case for me--

                                 KELLEY
                        --under the law of the Territory of 
                        Hawaii, no man can kill another unless 
                        it’s in self defense. More importantly, 
                        there is nowhere in any of the statutes 
                        that the words “honor killing” can be 
                        found. It is an unwritten law. That 
                        means it doesn’t exist. And as 
                        something that doesn’t exist, this 
                        court cannot allow it as a defense.

           Nan nods. Nice. Esther and Joe nodding too. Judge Davis just 
           looking at Darrow, waiting for an answer. And for a while, 
           Darrow remains quiet. A hand to his chin. Feigning concern.

                                 DARROW
                        You know, Mr. Kelley is right. It can’t 
                        be allowed.

           Kelley thrown by that. The whole room thrown. 

                                 DARROW
                        Let me reframe. Lieutenant, you drove 
                        to Chinatown and picked Kahahawai up?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 DARROW
                        And what happened then?

                                 TOMMIE
                        We took him back to Mrs. Fortescue’s 
                        house. Sat him down to chat like 
                        civilized men. But he refused to talk. 

                                 DARROW
                        So what did you do?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Well I took the gun and confronted him. 

                                 DARROW
                        And did you have any intention of 
                        hurting him?

                                 TOMMIE
                            (indignant)
                        I am a military man, sir, I know right 
                        from wrong. I just wanted him to speak. 
                        I told him, “The Lord will judge you, 
                        boy. You oughtta talk.” 
                                 DARROW
                        But did he talk?

                                 TOMMIE
                        No, sir. So I said, “You’ll never be 
                        able to live with the guilt, son. It’ll 
                        stick with you till the day you die. 
                        Tell us you did it.”

           And Darrow turns to the crowd, as if addressing the world --

                                 DARROW
                        And Lt. Massie, what did Mr. Kahahawai 
                        say to you?

                                 TOMMIE
                        He said, “Yes. We done it. And I wish 
                        we killed the bitch too.”

           GASPS -- Joe Sr. immediately on his feet -- Kelley too -- 
           Nan’s eyes widen, she scribbles a note. Darrow wastes no time--

                                 DARROW
                        And what happened after he said this?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Well, that’s the thing, sir, I don’t 
                        know. That’s all I remember. 

           The whole room muttering in confusion. Wait, what? 

                                 TOMMIE
                        Next thing I know, police were 
                        arresting me an hour later. 

           And a wave of panic rocks Kelley. The devastating realization 
           slowly taking root. He looks to Nan. She knows it too.

           She wild-scribbles, crossing out her first note with another:

                              “HONOR KILLING
                            TEMPORARY INSANITY”

           The whole case hinges on this. Nan sliding the note to Kelley.

                                 DARROW
                        I’m sorry Lieutenant, you mean to say 
                        you don’t recall a firing of any shots?

                                 TOMMIE
                        No. 

           Kelley crumpling the paper and leaping to his feat --

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor!
                                 DARROW
                        Or traveling in a car to Koko Head?

                                 TOMMIE
                        No, sir. 

                                 KELLEY
                        YOUR HONOR! The defense swore to us that--

                                 DARROW
                            (forging ahead)
                        And do you have any idea, any idea at 
                        all, as to what became of you?

                                 TOMMIE
                        Not one bit.

           Darrow turns to the jury, smiling --

                                 DARROW
                        Then I have no further questions.

           And the room RUMBLES -- Joe Sr. and Esther shaking with 
           outrage -- Kelley more furious than anyone --

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, this is... We were told the 
                        defense would NOT use an insanity plea!

           He’s shouting over the crowd, which erupts in chaos. Grace 
           unable to contain her satisfied smile. Thalia beaming. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Darrow promised...
                            (turning on Darrow)
                        You swore...

           And suddenly JOE SR. is standing up from the back SHOUTING --

                                 JOE SR.
                        Liar! How can you say this?! Who do you--

           The Judge POUNDS his gavel -- calling for ORDER -- but more 
           and more people are YELLING over each other now -- POINTING 
           FINGERS -- WAVING FISTS -- 

           Kelley trying to get a word in -- but unable to -- the 
           hostile noise growing LOUDER -- LOUDER -- and we CUT TO --

           INT. JUDGE DAVIS’ CHAMBERS - LATER

           Judge Davis behind his desk. Kelley standing across from him, 
           outraged. Darrow leaning against a shelf, Leisure beside him.

                                 KELLEY
                        You lied!
                                 DARROW
                        John--

                                 KELLEY
                        You lied in a court of justice and you 
                        exploited my trust in you--my trust in 
                        your integrity as--

                                 DARROW
                        Would you spare us the integrity 
                        speech? Becomes rather tedious after 
                        the first... hundred times. 

                                 KELLEY
                        You swore you wouldn’t use a temporary 
                        insanity defense! You said that right 
                        in this very--

                                 DARROW
                        I said I wouldn’t use an insanity 
                        defense. I never said “temporary.”

                                 KELLEY
                        Is there a difference?!

                                 DARROW
                        Yes, John. A very crucial difference. 
                        See, if I invoked the insanity defense, 
                        I’d have a legal obligation to inform 
                        you of that. But if I invoke a 
                        temporary insanity defense... if I 
                        claim that Lt. Massie’s sanity was lost 
                        only in the hour the gun was shot... 
                        well that’s entirely different. 

           And Kelley freezes. Caught. 

                                 KELLEY
                        That’s... You’re talking semantics! 

                                 DARROW
                        Actually, John, I’m talking the law.

                                 KELLEY
                        It’s a loophole! You can’t prove 
                        temporary insanity is NOT a form of 
                        insanity!

                                 DARROW
                        I can’t, no. Above my pay grade. But 
                        I’m betting my expert witness can.

           Darrow motions to Leisure. Leisure hands Kelley a file...
                                 LEISURE
                        Dr. Edward Williams. An alienist from 
                        Stanford University. Author of the 
                        definitive book on criminal psychology.

                                 KELLEY
                            (looking it over)
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 DARROW
                        I think you’ll find he’s quite serious. 
                        And we’re very excited to hear his 
                        thoughts on the case. Now, Your Honor--

                                 KELLEY
                        We don’t have the money to bring in an 
                        expert that can rebut a witness like 
                        this, you know that.

                                 DARROW
                        Maybe. I also know that even if you 
                        did, you wouldn’t be able to bring him 
                        all the way over here in--what is it--

           He checks his watch, smug --

                                 DARROW
                        --eighteen hours? So we can waste time 
                        bickering, John, or we can move to the 
                        next day. Great attorneys bounce back 
                        from their mistakes. No matter how big. 

           Silence. A brutal tension boiling between Kelley and Darrow.   

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, I’m... Surely you see this 
                        is a breach of mandatory disclosure. 
                        The prosecution deserves a few days to 
                        prepare for this line of defense.

           But the Judge just sits there. Thinking. And thinking. Until --

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        I’m afraid I won’t allow that.

           Kelley reacts: SLAMMING his fists onto the table.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow is right. Temporary insanity 
                        is legally different from an insanity 
                        defense. Call it semantics or a 
                        technicality or...whatever you want, but 
                        we can’t be expected to confine the jury 
                        in their hotel rooms while you catch up 
                        on a defense you weren’t prepared for.
           And that one stings Kelley. Because it’s true. 

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        We’re going back in there tomorrow, 
                        gentlemen. And we are finishing this. 
                        Once and for all. You’re dismissed.

           And Judge Davis goes. An awkward silence filling the room..

                                 DARROW
                        Sorry, kid. All’s fair in law and war.

           And Darrow leaves. Leisure watching Kelley for a moment. Maybe 
           sympathetic. Maybe ashamed. But he turns and goes too. We hold 
           on Kelley standing there, growing rage, as over this --

                                 CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Lt. Massie has proven he’s every inch a 
                        man! A new American hero! No doubt now! 
                        Mrs. Massie was indeed raped! Degenerate 
                        natives outta be put in their place!

           EXT. HOTEL STREET - DOWNTOWN HONOLULU, HI - NIGHT

           A GANG of FIVE HAWAIIANS. Listen in disgust to the radio. Two 
           sitting in the car, three standing smoking outside. 

           They are parked on the sidewalk of a traffic-jammed HOTEL 
           STREET. In the heart of DOWNTOWN HONOLULU.

           We begin to hear LAUGHING. A group of MEN approaching: FIVE 
           DRUNK SAILORS walking toward them, stopping as --

                                 SAILOR
                        Hold up, hold up, boys, lookit here...

           We’ve never seen either of these two groups, but the contrast 
           is striking. The bright WHITES of the sailors’ uniforms, the 
           hand-me-downs of the Hawaiians.

                                 SAILOR
                        Another gang of brown bastards lurkin’ 
                        in the shadows lookin’ for some trouble.

           The Hawaiians are getting out now, immediately confronting --

                                 HAWAIIAN BOY
                        Say that again, you fuckin’ haole.

                                 SAILOR
                        Fuckin haole! Wow! This one’s got nerve!
                            (the sailors LAUGH)
                        Know what I think, boys? I think these 
                        here niggers are waitin’ for another 
                        pretty white woman to take in the 
                        forest and fuck like a goddamn--
           And that’s it -- ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE -- all ten of them -- 
           blows, kicks, nothing held back -- brutal, bloody, PERSONAL --

           Even more SAILORS joining now -- more HAWAIIANS -- the entire 
           street turning into a BRAWL -- and as we BOOM UP -- getting 
           higher and higher -- SIRENS in the distance --

           EXT. HONOLULU STREET - DUSK

           SEVERAL COP CARS speed by, sirens BLARING, tearing to town as--

           Another CAR heads in the opposite direction, the familiar 
           small BLACK FORD of --

           INT. KELLEY’S CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Kelley and Nan. Kelley behind the wheel, racking his brain.

                                 KELLEY
                        What if we put Grace on the stand?

                                 NAN
                        John--

                                 KELLEY
                        Hear me out, they’re saying Tommie went 
                        insane, right? But someone was there 
                        that was still sane. Grace was a 
                        witness. We can force her to explain--

                                 NAN
                        “No person can be compelled in any 
                        criminal case to be a witness against 
                        himself”, that’s in the fifth 
                        amendment. We can’t force her to take 
                        the stand. There’s no legal way.

           Kelley reacts. Shit.

                                 KELLEY
                        Then we need to get Tommie to tell the 
                        truth.

                                 NAN
                        John, look, maybe--

                                 KELLEY
                        They’re saying he can’t remember 
                        anything because he was triggered by 
                        Kahahawai’s confession, but we know 
                        that’s a lie. We have to poke holes in 
                        that. Get him to slip up in cross-exam.
                                 NAN
                        Tommie Massie is sitting with Clarence 
                        Darrow right now preparing for any and 
                        every possible angle we could throw at 
                        him. We’ll try, and we’ll realize that 
                        he is too well-coached, and then you’ll 
                        look like you’re trying to smear the 
                        reputation of a decorated military 
                        lieutenant.

           Kelley reacts again. Shit.

                                 KELLEY
                        Then what is our play here, Nan?

                                 NAN
                        What we really need to do is prove that 
                        Joseph Kahahawai couldn’t have admitted 
                        to raping Thalia because he never did 
                        it. But that would mean going back to 
                        the first case, which we not only have 
                        no evidence for, it’s the one thing 
                        we’ve been fighting never to do!

           They both sit in silence. Trying to process all this.

                                 KELLEY
                            (quiet)
                        We don’t have a way to win this, do we?

           But Nan has no answer. Their car turns, pulling up to --

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE - DUSK

           They slow into the driveway.

           IN THE CAR

           Kelley and Nan look out, both going pale as they see --

           Several POLICEMEN waiting on the porch. POLICE CARS on the 
           sidewalk. An older Hawaiian woman, NAN’S MOTHER (60), talking 
           with the police, turning to see -- 

           Nan and Kelley quickly getting out of the car --

                                 KELLEY
                        What’s wrong? What happened, are the 
                        girls alright?

           Nan’s Mother approaches, nodding, trying to keep her 
           composure, beginning to explain everything -- 

           But Kelley is taking in the sight on the porch. The police 
           are surrounding something on the steps, a DARK PUDDLE around 
           it, what seems to be BLOOD, it is --
           A BLACK DOG. Dead. Head severed. Blood still leaking. A SIGN 
           roped around the dog’s neck:

                  “YOU LIE WITH DOGS, YOU GET UP WITH FLEAS.”

           Kelley frozen. It’s a threat. To him. To his whole family. 

                                 OFFICER WATSON (O.S.)
                        Mr. Kelley? You have a moment?

           It’s OFFICER WATSON from earlier, the one who interrogated 
           Horace Ida. Kelley sees the GIRLS waiting at the door --

                                 KELLEY
                        Go inside, girls. C’mon, go inside.

           They can’t move. Genuine fear in their eyes. Kelley ushers 
           them in, trying to soothe them, comfort them. 

           But it’s not working. They’re scared. Petrified. He looks to 
           the Officer, then back to his daughters. He can’t leave them.

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kelley is tucking the girls in. Doing his best to have some 
           sense of composure as POLICE LIGHTS seep through the windows. 

                                 MARY
                        Daddy, who did it?

                                 KELLEY
                        I don’t know, sweetie. But I’ll find 
                        out. I promise. 

                                 MARY
                        Are we safe?

                                 KELLEY
                        Of course we’re safe. It’ll be alright, 
                        okay? You trust me?

           Mary just looks at him. It’s not that she doesn’t. It’s that 
           the threat has sincerely scared her. Nan comes to the door --

                                 NAN
                        John, they need you downstairs.

           Kelley nods. He gives the girls a goodnight kiss.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’ll be right outside, ok? If you need 
                        anything at all, I’ll be right there.

                                 MARGARET
                        Papa?
                                 KELLEY
                        Yes, sweetie.

                                 MARGARET
                        Are we nigger-lovers?

           A dreadful silence.

                                 NAN
                        Margaret... Where on earth did--

           Kelley holds his hands up. Hold on. Eyes still on Margaret.

                                 KELLEY
                        Who told you that, sweetie? 

                                 MARGARET
                        ...at school...Carol she...she said my 
                        daddy loves niggers...and that I love 
                        niggers...and she said I should just be 
                        one...a full one...

           That lands like a dagger into Kelley’s heart. He shares a 
           look with Nan. Neither quite knowing what to say.

                                 KELLEY
                        Listen to me, honey. If anyone says 
                        anything like that again, you tell your 
                        teacher and then tell us, understand?

           Margaret just nervously nods. Kelley looks away to the 
           window, fuming. And he gets up, leaving --

                                 NAN
                        John--

           But he’s already heading out to --

           EXT. PORCH - KELLEY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Officer Watson is writing some notes down until --

                                 KELLEY 
                        Who did this? Who was responsible?

           Officer Watson turns to see a seething Kelley.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                            (indifferent)
                        Uh, well, not sure at the moment. 
                        Neighbors said the dog was theirs but--

                                 KELLEY
                        What are the steps you’re taking to 
                        find out who it was?
                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        Well, like I said, we have no way of 
                        being able to track them down right 
                        now, so I think--

                                 KELLEY
                        We need protection.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        I’m sorry?

                                 KELLEY
                        I want protection here at all hours. 
                        Someone guarding the house. And street.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        We already station a man here all day.

                                 KELLEY
                        And night. I’ve been getting death 
                        threats.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                            (chuckles)
                        Well of course. Does that surprise you?

           Silence. Kelley staring. What did he just say?

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        Look, John...between you and me...I 
                        spent a good deal of time with those 
                        boys. Questioned all of ‘em. Now I 
                        ain’t a racist, but...you really 
                        believe them? 

                                 KELLEY
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        I’m just sayin. You know how these 
                        people lie.

                                 KELLEY
                        These people?

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                            (realizing)
                        Oh, c’mon. You know I don’t mean your--

                                 KELLEY
                            (moving inside)
                        A guard here all day and night, Officer.

                                 OFFICER WATSON
                        John... Oh, John, c’mon...
           But the door SLAMS SHUT. Officer Watson just standing there.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - LATER

           Kelley steps into the living room. Livid. Nan slowly 
           approaches and stands in the doorway...

                                 NAN
                        What are we going to do?

                                 KELLEY
                        Who would dare to--

           But he stops himself. Fighting to not explode.

                                 KELLEY
                        We can send them to your mothers. Keep 
                        them from school maybe, at least until--

                                 NAN
                        Not with the girls, with the case. What 
                        are we doing tomorrow with the case?

           Kelley looks at her. That’s the real question. He can only 
           shake his head. No answer coming.

                                 NAN
                        Then maybe it’s for the best.

           She takes her husband’s hand. For the first time real doubt.

                                 NAN
                        If you don’t think we can do it... If 
                        you don’t think we can win... 

                                 KELLEY
                        Then what... quit?

                                 NAN
                        I’m saying we have to be careful, John. 
                            (looks to the girls’ room)
                        We have to weigh the cost.

           Kelley considers that. Considering her hesitation. His eyes 
           move to the window to see --

           OUTSIDE: A CROWD gathered now. Cops, reporters, even some 
           protesters. All on his front lawn. The fight brought to him. 

           And perhaps it’s the bruise to his ego, but Kelley’s fear is 
           turning to anger now. Outrage to motivation. 

                                 KELLEY
                        No, Nan... We have to win... There’s too 
                        much at stake. For you. For our girls.
           Nan observes him for a while. Seeing the resolve in his eyes. 
           The case suddenly made more personal for them than ever.  

                                 NAN
                        Okay... Then how?

           Kelley takes a moment to think. 

                                 KELLEY
                        We need to catch them off-guard. They’ve 
                        been six moves ahead the entire time, we 
                        need to attack from another direction. 
                        Something they couldn’t possibly expect.

                                 NAN
                        Like what?

           But that’s what Kelley doesn’t know. He stops and sighs. 

                                 KELLEY
                        I need a drink.

           INT. KITCHEN - KELLEY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Kelley opens the icebox, reaches in, past a bottle of scotch. 
           Grabs MILK instead. And as he sets it down...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. MOANA HOTEL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH. Being poured into a glass. Darrow lifts 
           it, raises it in toast to Ruby, who’s smoking next to him.

                                 DARROW
                        Can you believe it? Tommie Massie, 
                        goddamn schoolboy of a Lieutenant, 
                        can’t tie his own two shoes but he can 
                        give the testimony of his life, shift 
                        the whole momentum of the case.

           He downs that drink and begins to pour another. 

                                 RUBY
                        Haven’t you had enough of those?

           Darrow pretends not to hear, waves down the WAITER --

                                 DARROW
                        Hi! Yes, one more, please! 
                            (turning back to Ruby)
                        Y’know, I didn’t think we could win. 
                        You go into every trial and hope you 
                        will, tell yourself you can, but you’re 
                        never sure. Especially this one. 
                        These people killed a boy in cold 
                        blood! The whole case shoulda been open 
                        and shut!

                                 RUBY
                        Then why are you celebrating?

                                 DARROW
                            (scoffs)
                        Because it’s over, Ruby! Victory over the 
                        Philistines! The Spartans at Thermopylae. 
                        These were unwinnable odds. 

                                 RUBY
                        And yet you won...

           She looks away. Cold, far-off. Takes the piss out of Darrow.

                                 RUBY
                        Remember Chicago and North?

           Darrow stops. A long pause. He puts his drink down.

                                 DARROW
                        Let’s not dig up old history right--

                                 RUBY
                        You were making more money as a 
                        corporate lawyer for Chicago & North 
                        Railway than you ever made from any of 
                        your other cases. Combined.

                                 DARROW
                        Yes, I’m aware of that. And it’s 
                        because of those initial earnings--

                                 RUBY
                        You were miserable, Clarence. Hated 
                        every second. Remember what you told me?

           He tries looking away, but she doesn’t let him avoid her eyes.

                                 RUBY
                        You said you couldn’t look at yourself 
                        in the mirror any longer. You couldn’t 
                        bear the idea of working for the wrong 
                        side. Your conscience led you to your 
                        true life’s work: becoming a champion 
                        of labor, an advocate for the poor. 
                        That’s the man I fell in love with. 
                        That’s a man who had the conviction to 
                        do the right thing. That’s not the man 
                        I see in front of me now.

           Darrow sits there. Rocked. Trying to smile it off.
                                 DARROW
                        Darling, my allegiances are to my 
                        clients and my clients only. I am 
                        legally obligated to--

                                 RUBY
                        This has nothing to do with your 
                        clients. This has been “Clarence-Darrow-
                        first” from the start, and you know it.

           For once, Darrow doesn’t know what to say. Ruby takes his 
           hand, tenderly.

                                 RUBY
                        I should’ve stopped you long ago. And 
                        perhaps that’s where I failed. But I’m 
                        here, I’m here today because I was 
                        hoping--praying--that the man I married 
                        is still in there somewhere.

           He stares at her for a while. Guard subtly coming down.

                                 DARROW
                        And what’s the verdict?

           She looks him right in the eyes. A slight shrug...

                                 RUBY
                        Jury is still out.

           And she gathers her things, and goes. 

           Darrow taking all that in. He swirls his drink, stares at his 
           reflection in the glass, not sure he likes what he sees there 
           either. He downs the shot as --

           INT. MOANA HOTEL BAR - LATER

           Thirty minutes later. Darrow sits alone at the beachside bar, 
           a row of empty glasses before him. He asks for yet another as--

                                 LEISURE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Darrow? Do you have a moment? 

           Leisure is standing right beside him. Awkwardly waiting.

                                 DARROW
                        What, you follow me to the bathroom too?

                                 LEISURE
                        I’m sorry to bother you so late, but 
                        uh... I have something you need to see.

                                 DARROW
                        Now?
           Leisure nods. Darrow sighs and reluctantly turns. Leisure 
           handing him an envelope --

                                 LEISURE
                        It’s a letter. From the NAACP. That’s 
                        the uh, National Association for the 
                        Advancement of Colored--

                                 DARROW
                        I was a founding attorney for the 
                        organization, George, I know what it 
                        stands for.
                            (skimming the letter)
                        They’re threatening me?

                                 LEISURE
                        It’s a warning.

                                 DARROW
                        “We strenuously suggest rethinking your 
                        involvement in this case. Our 
                        organization’s trust in you must be 
                        entirely rethought if otherwise.”
                            (looks up)
                        They’re threatening me.

                                 LEISURE
                        Sir, as your assistant counsel, I have 
                        to say--

           Darrow puts a hand up. Stop. This is everything. His entire 
           reputation on the line.

                                 DARROW
                        We win. That’s how we fix this. We go 
                        in there tomorrow and finish this 
                        goddamn thing once and for all. Prove 
                        I’m on the right side of this.

                                 LEISURE
                        ... I thought there was no right or wrong.

           Darrow stops before downing his last drink, turns curiously.

                                 LEISURE
                        When we were discussing our approach to 
                        this case, you said--

                                 DARROW
                        I know what I said. I’m wondering why 
                        I’m getting my own words repeated to me.

                                 LEISURE
                        If we win, then we’re right and the 
                        prosecution is wrong. Justice is served.
                                 DARROW
                        That’s typically how the system works.

                                 LEISURE
                        And you’ll be able to sleep perfectly 
                        at night knowing the Massies are free 
                        and Kahahawai’s murder was justified.

           And Darrow finally understands what he’s getting at now.

                                 DARROW
                        Look. I’m not sure if you and my wife 
                        organized this one-two punch, but let me 
                        save you a lot of future hurt and tell 
                        you if you still have concerns tomorrow, 
                        we can talk about it then. But I’d 
                        really hate for you to have to tell me 
                        I’m in the wrong when the person who is 
                        responsible for me being here... is you.

           And Darrow pats his shoulder, and returns to his seat. Until --

                                 LEISURE
                        You know, I was there at the Sweet 
                        Trial... Fifteen years old. Sat in the 
                        back row for your entire summation. I 
                        saw a man thunder away against 
                        prejudice. Saw him address an entire 
                        country saying, “I do not believe in 
                        the law of hate. I believe in the law 
                        of love.” I saw courage, sir. The 
                        audacity to do what was right. No 
                        matter the cost.

                                 DARROW
                        And I suppose you’re going to tell me 
                        you don’t see that man anymore.

                                 LEISURE
                        No, sir. Worse... I don’t think you can.

           And Leisure finally leaves, no looking back this time. 

           Darrow left alone. Almost calling out for him. Then not. Then 
           contemplative silence. Trying to laugh it off. 

           But Leisure’s words still ring in his ear. Ruby’s as well. 
           And as the Bartender plops another bottle of whiskey in front 
           of him, Darrow considering all this, we begin to hear --

                                 BAILIFF (V.O.)
                        All rise...
           INT. THE COURTROOM - NEXT DAY

           The room rises. Kelley and Nan standing with intense focus. 
           Darrow standing with a clear hangover.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Alright. We’ll pick up where we left 
                        off yesterday. Lt. Massie, would you 
                        please return to the stand?

           Tommie rises, making his way up when --

                                 KELLEY
                        Actually, Your Honor, the territory has 
                        no questions for the witness. Thank you.

           And Kelley sits. Immediate BUZZ in the room. Darrow and 
           Tommie sharing a baffled look.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Kelley, are you saying you are 
                        waving your cross-examination?

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, the defense is claiming 
                        that the witness went insane at the 
                        time of the shooting. If that is the 
                        plea they’d like to base their entire 
                        case on, however improbable, we will 
                        attempt to refute it. But we will do so 
                        with someone more... mentally stable. 

           A RUMBLE of conversation. Tommie instantly affronted.

                                 DARROW
                        Objection, Your Honor!

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Yes, counselor, what do you mean by 
                        “more mentally stable?”

                                 KELLEY
                        Well, if Lt. Massie can conveniently 
                        forget the most important hour of this 
                        case, who’s to say he won’t go insane 
                        this very moment?

           Scattered LAUGHTER in the room. Darrow not having it --

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, it seems Mr. Kelley has 
                        taken this opportunity to antagonize 
                        and ridicule my client, a decorated 
                        military lieutenant.
                                 KELLEY
                        I am simply stating--

                                 DARROW
                        It also seems that Mr. Kelley has a 
                        severe misunderstanding of what 
                        “temporary insanity” is.

                                 KELLEY
                        Does anyone have a clear understanding 
                        of what temporary insanity is?

           More LAUGHTER...

                                 DARROW
                        As a matter of fact, yes. Experts. The 
                        foremost of whom will be here to speak 
                        with us very shortly.

                                 KELLEY
                        Wonderful. We’ll wait to hear what this 
                        witness has to say. But until then, we 
                        have no further questions for Lt. 
                        Massie. The witness may be dismissed.

           And the MURMURS continue. Tommie just standing there. Looking 
           to Grace. Her eyes burning a hole through Kelley. 

           Kelley simply sits. Playing this all off as “part of the 
           plan.” But look closely enough and you’ll see the sweat on 
           his brow, the nervous twitch in his leg.

                                 DARROW
                        Defense calls Dr. Edward Williams.

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - LATER

           An hour later. Outside. Both groups of PROTESTERS surrounding 
           TWO RADIOS, one on each side... 

                                 DR. WILLIAMS (V.O.)
                        What happens is what we like to call 
                        abnormal functioning of adrenal glands.

           INT. THE COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           DR. WILLIAMS on the stand. Tall. Thin. Grey goatee and 
           moustache. The air of a man who’s done this many times.

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        This kind of reaction only arises when a 
                        severe stress occurs, in this case, Mr. 
                        Kahahawai’s admittance to raping Mrs. 
                        Massie. An invisible pathology was then 
                        created that settled into Lt. Massie. 
                        In simpler terms, a psychological bomb 
                        was planted in his mind. And once that 
                        bomb exploded, he was liable to do 
                        anything yet have no memory of what he 
                        has done. Hence... temporary insanity.

                                 DARROW
                        So what you are saying, doctor, is that 
                        from all that Lt. Massie told you, and 
                        from the decades of research you’ve done 
                        on this topic, you can conclude that Lt. 
                        Massie was indeed not of conscious mind 
                        at the time of the shooting?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Oh more than that, sir. His passion 
                        rendered him, for a brief time, 
                        legally and scientifically insane.

           Darrow turns. Beaming. The execution was flawless. 

                                 DARROW 
                        Thank you, doctor. No further questions.

           The Jury leans back. By all accounts, a score for the 
           defense. Kelley quickly scribbling down some notes before --

                                 KELLEY
                        Dr. Williams, I find it fascinating, 
                        this business of glands and insanity. 
                        Am I correct in recalling that you 
                        recently testified for the defense in 
                        the Winnie Judd Trial? Which ended in 
                        her conviction?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Yes.

                                 KELLEY
                        Seems you testify on behalf of many 
                        famous murder cases.

                                 DARROW
                        Objection! 

                                 KELLEY
                        What was the condition of Mrs. Judd’s--

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, how in the world is any of 
                        this relevant?

                                 KELLEY
                        I withdraw. Dr. Williams, you never 
                        treated Lieutenant Massie, did you?
                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        I examined him for two hours.

                                 KELLEY
                        Two hours which you were paid for, is 
                        that correct?

                                 DARROW
                        Objection!

                                 KELLEY
                        I withdraw again. Doctor, you have 
                        testified that Lt. Massie was insane 
                        when he fired the shot. I am interested 
                        to know how much of your opinion was 
                        based on your observation and how much 
                        on what he told you.

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        I based my opinion on what Lt. Massie 
                        had told me, in addition to evidence 
                        that has been brought out in this trial 
                        and information from third parties.

                                 KELLEY
                        Third parties? What third parties? 

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Well--

                                 KELLEY
                        Doctor, for all we know, I am a third 
                        party. I could have given you 
                        information. My wife could have. Your 
                        wife could have. What third parties?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                            (offended)
                        How dare you, son... No... No, I don’t 
                        care to answer the question.

           Kelley clocking that. Looking to Nan. He can get this guy. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Then let’s talk about sanity for a 
                        moment. You don’t think a sane man’s 
                        reason can overcome his emotions?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        It’s possible, but in this case highly 
                        improbable. I don’t believe it.

                                 KELLEY
                        And how can you assume the condition of 
                        his mind?
                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Well it’s a common condition. But one 
                        that is impossible to fake. 

                                 KELLEY
                        I just find it odd that Lt. Massie 
                        happened to say to you the only thing 
                        on which you base your opinion. 

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        I have other--

                                 KELLEY 
                        Third parties. Yes, we know.

           Kelley strides to his desk. Nan hands him a BOOK.

           Grace leaning over the bar to Darrow. Are you going to do 
           something? But Darrow just holding up a finger. Hold on.

                                 KELLEY
                        Dr. Williams, have you written a book 
                        in which you stated insanity defenses 
                        are a sham in most cases?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        What? No. That is absolutely untrue.

                                 KELLEY
                        I hold here in my hands the book “Crime, 
                        Abnormal Minds, and the Law” by Ernest 
                        Hoag and Edward Huntington Williams. Are 
                        you not the same Edward Huntington 
                        Williams who coauthored this book?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        I am.

                                 KELLEY
                        Well, reading from page 74, it says, 
                        and I quote: “Most pleas of insanity 
                        are made by sane people who frequently 
                        go free, while most insane criminals 
                        make no insanity plea and are duly 
                        convicted and sentenced.”

           Grace is fidgeting in her seat now. Thalia too. Darrow still 
           sitting there, watching with an odd curiosity...

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        That’s taken out of context.

                                 KELLEY
                        What is the context then, Doctor? 

           The Judge leans forward. This is piquing even his interest.
                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        I-- I was just saying people may think 
                        they have been insane. Or may abuse the--

                                 KELLEY
                            (cutting him off)
                        Doctor, didn’t you write in your book 
                        on page 103: “According to our present 
                        methods, such testimony is largely 
                        unscientific and tends to discredit 
                        both the medical and legal professions, 
                        failing to serve the ends of justice.”

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Well...

                                 KELLEY
                        “Medical experts are employed by both 
                        the prosecution and the defense from 
                        the beginning, usually making the whole 
                        procedure purely biased rather than 
                        objective and scientific.”

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        My words were in support of a 
                        legislation now put in place. It 
                        discouraged attorneys from privately 
                        hiring alienists to say whatever they 
                        were paid to say. It is not--

                                 KELLEY
                        And where was this legislation put in 
                        place?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        California.

                                 KELLEY
                        But not the Territory of Hawaii, is 
                        that right, Doctor?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Well no, but...

                                 KELLEY
                        The Territory of Hawaii where an 
                        attorney privately hired an alienist... 
                        you...as an expert witness in this case.

           And Dr. Williams shifts in his seat. Nothing coming. The 
           silence deafening. Kelley nods --

                                 KELLEY
                        No further questions, Your Honor.
           The room BUZZES once again. Momentum quickly shifting. Nan 
           proudly smiling. They’re back in this.

           Darrow receiving an onslaught of furious whispers from Grace, 
           Thalia, but seemingly turning a deaf ear, looking back to --

           RUBY. There in the crowd. An instinctual glance to his wife.  
           She clocks that. Seeing something in his eyes. A hesitation. 

           Darrow looks to Kelley, considering. Am I going to do this? 
           Is it worth it? But before he can think about it too long --

                                 DARROW
                        Dr. Williams. How many cases have you 
                        been an expert witness at?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                            (still a bit shook)
                        Uh, thirty-two. No, thirty-three. 

                                 DARROW
                        Thirty-three. And how many of your 
                        thirty three assessments have been in 
                        alignment with the jury’s verdict?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        All of them.

                                 DARROW
                        All of them? Every single one?

                                 DR. WILLIAMS
                        Yes.

           And here is where Darrow’s tone changes, turning to Kelley --

                                 DARROW
                        Mr. Kelley, how many cases have you 
                        tried as a prosecutor?

           Kelley looks up from his notes, completely caught off-guard --

                                 KELLEY
                        Excuse me?

                                 DARROW
                        How many cases have you tried as a 
                        prosecutor and how many have you won?

                                 KELLEY
                        ... Your Honor, this--I am not the one 
                        on the witness--
                                 DARROW
                        I’ll answer for him. Zero. This is his 
                        first case as a city prosecutor and he 
                        hasn’t won a single criminal case in 
                        his career.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow--

                                 DARROW
                        Whose opinion matters here, gentlemen? 
                        Whose word will you take as truth?

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor!

                                 DARROW
                        The expert? A man who has dedicated his 
                        entire life to assessing the character 
                        of men?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow, that is enough.

                                 DARROW
                        Or a man who’s job it is to do everything 
                        he can to put my clients in jail?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        If you continue this, I will have to 
                        hold you in contempt--

                                 DARROW
                        If Dr. Williams sits up here and says 
                        he believes that Lt. Massie--

                                 KELLEY
                        This is wildly inappropriate!

                                 DARROW
                        --went temporarily insane, then who are 
                        we to think otherwise?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Consider this your final warning, 
                        counselor.

                                 DARROW
                        Mr. Kelley is asking for objectivity, 
                        well perhaps we shall give it to him! 
                        Who of these two men shall we believe?!

           BAM! -- The Judge RAPS his gavel --

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        That’s it, I find you in contempt.
           GASPS -- all eyes on Darrow now -- waiting with baited breath 
           for his next move -- Darrow surveying the room --

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Do you have anything to add, Mr. 
                        Darrow? Or would you like jail time 
                        along with a hefty fine?

           A long silence. Darrow deep in contemplation.

                                 DARROW
                        Your Honor, I... I apologize for my 
                        behavior... What I said is... it’s 
                        unacceptable. I should know better. In 
                        all honesty, I don’t know what came over 
                        me. Seems I am simply... overcome by 
                        emotions for this case. For the good of 
                        my clients.

           Kelley shaking his head. No... he’s trying to spin this?

                                 DARROW
                        I presume we are slaves to our emotions 
                        in some ways. When we care about 
                        something so deeply, so viscerally. 
                        Who’s to say what we are capable of, no 
                        matter how out-of-character it may seem.

                                 KELLEY
                        You cannot be serious!

                                 DARROW
                        But I am, Your Honor. Very serious. I 
                        apologize to this entire court for my 
                        actions. However... uncontrollable.

           And Darrow sits down again. Kelley boiling --

                                 KELLEY
                        Your Honor, I demand--

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        The court will strike this entire re-
                        cross from the record, along with Mr. 
                        Darrow’s last statement. The jury will 
                        give no weight to both in your decision.

                                 KELLEY
                        Thank you.

           And Kelley sits. But one look over the Jury and you can tell 
           they are all strangely moved by Darrow’s words. It was 
           another trick up his sleeve. Another point for the defense.

           Darrow takes a seat again. A flicker of guilt behind his 
           eyes. He turns to look back at Ruby but --
           The back door FLIES OPEN: She’s leaving. No looking back.

           Darrow contemplating that. Smile slowly fading as the Judge 
           reads out instructions for tomorrow. And we CUT TO --

           EXT. MOANA HOTEL BAR - WAIKIKI BEACH - NIGHT

           The same ocean-side bar from earlier. Hawaiian music playing. 

           PAN OVER: A small army of shot glasses lined up for battle.  
           Just as Darrow likes it. An UNSTEADY HAND reaches down to lift 
           one. Raising it. Slowly REVEALING that this is --

           KELLEY?!  

           Sitting at the bar. Overcome. Disheveled. Drunk. 

           He’s been here for a few hours. The looming dread all-too-
           obvious. The guilt washing over. He calls for the BARTENDER.

                                 KELLEY
                        Another, please.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sorry, we’re closing, I can’t. 

           Kelley checks his watch. Looks around. Fumbles for his money.

                                 KELLEY
                        Give me the bottle then. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sir--

                                 KELLEY
                        It’s alright, just give me the bottle.

                                 DARROW (O.S.)
                        No need.

           And Kelley freezes. He could recognize that voice anywhere. 

           It’s CLARENCE DARROW. Right behind him. Pulling something 
           from his overcoat and SLAMMING it down in front of Kelley: 

           A BOTTLE OF MILK.

           EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - LATER

           Darrow and Kelley sit side-by-side in the sand. Gazing at the 
           reflection of the midnight moon on the sea. Neither speaking. 

                                 DARROW
                        Nice to know we have similar taste.
                            (off Kelley’s confusion)
                        Not the milk. This bar. Been 
                        frequenting it almost every night.

                                 KELLEY
                        I know. I read in the papers. Ever the 
                        showman, Darrow.

           Darrow nods. An instinct confirmed. He had a feeling Kelley 
           wasn’t just here for the drinks.

                                 DARROW
                        So you came here to confront me then? 

           Maybe. But right now, Kelley doesn’t muster a response.

                                 DARROW
                        Look, I get you may feel some 
                        hostility. Don’t take it personally.

                                 KELLEY
                        I don’t. I take it professionally.

                                 DARROW
                        Good. Then let’s have a discussion 
                        between gentlemen. A truce if you will. 

                                 KELLEY
                        A truce?

                                 DARROW
                        Yes. For starters I think there’s 
                        several things you could’ve done better 
                        in this case.

                                 KELLEY
                        Oh, Jesus.

                                 DARROW
                        First--

                                 KELLEY
                        You know it’s possible not to 
                        condescend people, right? It is 
                        perfectly within the realms of 
                        possibility.

                                 DARROW
                        Don’t doubt yourself. That was going to 
                        be my first point. Doubt everything 
                        else, the facts, the truth... but never 
                        yourself. I underestimated you, John. 
                        You’re the most dangerous kind of 
                        lawyer. Know why? Because you’re fair. 
                        But if you don’t believe you can win, 
                        how do you think the jury will?
                                 KELLEY
                        You stood up there and told the world 
                        that Kahahawai admitted to raping her.

                                 DARROW
                        To win the jury over, yes, because--

                                 KELLEY
                        You fabricated a narrative to play on 
                        the emotions of--

                                 DARROW
                        Don’t be naive. You think those twelve 
                        men care about your client or mine? You 
                        think they care who’s right or wrong? 
                        They don’t. Not until you make them. 
                        And that brings me to my main point...

                                 KELLEY
                            (rises, fed up)
                        You actually believe your own bullshit 
                        don’t you, Darrow? I don’t know why I 
                        even bothered. I’m sick of your goddamn--

                                 DARROW
                        Conviction. 

           Kelley stops.

                                 DARROW
                        What it all comes down to. Conviction. 
                        And I’m not talking about the sentence 
                        the jury gives out. I’m talking about 
                        what you believe. What you know is 
                        true, is just... in your heart.

           Kelley staring. Where is this going?

                                 DARROW
                        You have to hold onto that... hold onto 
                        your conviction like your life depends 
                        on it. Because it does.

           Hard silence. Kelley analyzing every detail of Darrow’s face.

                                 DARROW
                        Maybe I’ve lost sight of that... but 
                        that doesn’t mean you should.

                                 KELLEY
                        Look if this is another one of your 
                        tricks--

                                 DARROW
                        Tommie Massie didn’t kill Kahahawai. 
                        Grace did.
           And Kelley stops. Frozen.

                                 DARROW
                        She shot him in the chest, threw him in 
                        her trunk, and drove to dump his body 
                        off Koko Head cliff. 

                                 KELLEY
                        ...I’m... she told you that?

                                 DARROW
                        You were right. All your facts were 
                        correct. But that’s my final point, the 
                        facts don’t matter.

                                 KELLEY
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 DARROW
                        Because you’ve been asking the wrong 
                        question all along. Everyone has.

           He gazes into his glass of whiskey. Slowly pushes it away.

                                 DARROW
                        Figure out the right one, you may just 
                        have a shot.

           And with that, Darrow leaves. Kelley standing there for a 
           while. Rocked. Mind racing. A thousand questions overflowing.

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           NAN sits waiting on the porch. She’s been here for hours. She 
           worriedly looks to her watch as --

           Kelley swerves up in the Ford Nan already standing as the 
           highbeams hit her, storming straight to him...

                                 NAN
                        John, where on earth have you--

           She stops upon seeing Kelley stumbling out of the car. 

                                 NAN
                        Oh God, have... Have you been drinking?

                                 KELLEY
                        I can explain...

           No need, she’s already storming back toward the house.

                                 KELLEY
                        Honey listen, let me apologize--
                                 NAN
                        No, you listen.

           She whips around, gloves off.

                                 NAN
                        It’s okay if we lose. We’ll find a way 
                        to recover, we always do... But this... 
                        you go back on the bottle... you’ll 
                        lose a lot more than this case.

           Kelley takes her hand.

                                 KELLEY
                        You’re right. You’re absolutely right, 
                        and I’m sorry. I’ve let you down, the 
                        girls, everyone. But Nan...

           She pulls away, been here with him before.

                                 NAN
                        It’s not us I’m afraid you’ll let down, 
                        John. It’s yourself.

           She leaves him lost in the wash of the headlights.

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kelley enters his daughters’ room. Kneels at their bedside. 
           Watches the rise and fall of their breath. It overwhelms him.  

           Tears in his eyes, he lowers his head, clasps his hands. A 
           silent prayer.

                                 MARY
                        Daddy?

           It’s MARY. Kelley’s youngest daughter. Innocence of the world 
           still not lost from her six-year-old eyes.

                                 KELLEY
                        Shh baby, it’s okay. Go back to sleep.

                                 MARY
                        Are you praying?

                                 KELLEY
                        Yes. I suppose I am.

                                 MARY
                        For what?

                                 KELLEY
                        Well... For the case... For 
                        Kahahawai... For the strength and 
                        wisdom to know the right thing to do...
                                 MARY
                        Can we pray for that woman too?

           Kelley stops, confused.

                                 MARY
                        Can we pray for Mrs. Massie?

           And that hits Kelley. An immediate flood of emotion. The 
           wisdom of this tiny girl, his own daughter, deeply moves him.

                                 KELLEY
                        Yes, I think that’s a wonderful idea.

           She nods, and sits up, closes her eyes. Silently praying. And 
           we MOVE IN on Kelley. Watching Mary. An epiphany.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nan sits on the couch. Startled as Kelley rushes in, flurry 
           of energy. A new sense of purpose for him, clarity...

                                 KELLEY
                        I’ve been looking at this all wrong!

                                 NAN
                        Yes. If we need to get you help, we will.

                                 KELLEY
                        No, I mean Thalia Massie, the whole 
                        case. I’ve been looking at it through 
                        the wrong lens. Seeing it through my 
                        own prejudices. Everyone is. But that’s 
                        how we turn this around, Nan! That’s 
                        how we win. Darrow was right...

                                 NAN
                        You were drinking with Darrow?!

           But Kelley isn’t paying attention, something catching his eye. 

           A PHOTO on the table. Kahahawai lying dead in the trunk of 
           the Massies car. Kelley picks it up, turning to Nan.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m going to need your help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           EXT. ALI’IOLANI HALE COURTHOUSE - MORNING

           As usual, a LONG LINE extends from the doors to the street.
           INT. THE COURTROOM - MORNING

           And as usual, the room is jam-packed. Everyone is silent. 
           Only the BUZZING of recording instruments can be heard over --

           The Judge taking his seat. Darrow sitting at the defense 
           chair alone. Kelley sitting across from him, also alone.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Kelley, would you like us to wait 
                        for your co-counsel?

           The room looks around. Where is she? 

                                 KELLEY
                        No. We can begin.

           Darrow and Kelley connect for a moment. Studying each other.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        The defense may call their next witness.

           Darrow watches Kelley a moment more. Then turns to the front.

                                 DARROW
                        Call Mrs. Massie.

           THALIA MASSIE

           At the back of the court, coming down the aisle. As she 
           passes through, hushed whispers: “Oh my God, she’s doing it.” 
           “That poor child.” “Look how young she looks.”

           She crosses in front of Darrow and takes the stand. Never 
           looking up. The Bailiff administers the oath as we watch the 
           JURORS regarding Thalia, observing the woman who this all 
           centers around, where it all started.

           She sits. Darrow approaching, hunched over.

                                 DARROW
                        Mrs. Massie... 

                                 THALIA
                        Yes...

           Her voice is faint. Fragile.

                                 DARROW
                        On the night of September 12th, you 
                        left the inn in the middle of the 
                        night, is that correct?

                                 THALIA
                        Yes.
                                 DARROW
                        And when did you next see your husband?

                                 THALIA
                        Well... it was when I went home... I 
                        opened the door and... and...

           Just like that, she starts CRYING. Real tears.

                                 THALIA
                        He just took me... I fell into his arms.

           Kelley rolls his eyes. Here we go again. 

           Grace hands Darrow a handkerchief. Darrow takes it to Thalia. 

                                 DARROW
                        You went home to your husband and what 
                        did you tell him?

                                 THALIA
                            (dabbing her eyes)
                        I told him everything that happened. 
                        How I was grabbed by a car full of 
                        Hawaiian boys. How they got out, 
                        grabbed me, punched me. Especially 
                        Kahahawai. He was the leader. They 
                        drove me to a spot in the trees, I 
                        couldn’t see where. I struggled to get 
                        free, but, but they held my hands down 
                        in the dirt. Pulled my dress up and... 
                        ravished me. Repeatedly. 

           Reactions in the crowd. Repulsed.

                                 THALIA
                        I told my husband of the pain, the 
                        abuse. It was humiliating. All I could 
                        think of was my Tommie. The whole time. 
                        I just wanted to be back with him again.

                                 DARROW
                        And in the aftermath of all this, what 
                        began to happen, Mrs. Massie?

                                 THALIA
                        Rumors. Horrible rumors began to 
                        spread. I tried to rise above it all. 
                        My mother always told me, “Turn the 
                        other cheek.” But I could tell that it 
                        was taking a toll on my Tommie. He was 
                        losing weight. He would walk up and 
                        down at night and go into the living 
                        room, just pacing and smoking.
                                 DARROW
                        And how did the hung jury affect him?

                                 THALIA
                        Well, he kept telling me he wished 
                        there was a way they could pry some 
                        kind of confession out of one of the 
                        men. He was trying to protect me, 
                        y’see. But he became obsessed. I’ve 
                        never seen my husband like that before. 
                        He only wanted justice to be done.

           Thalia dabs her eyes again. Half the courtroom now in tears. 

           And the DOOR OPENS, Kelley looking back -- 

           But it’s RUBY who has entered. Darrow sees her. Both of them 
           share a moment. Still tension between them. She takes a seat.

           Kelley turning back to the jury, anxious.

           Darrow turning back to Thalia, a thinking beat. 

                                 DARROW
                        Did your husband tell you of his plans 
                        with your mother to question Kahahawai?

                                 THALIA
                        No. I had no idea.

                                 DARROW
                        Then how did you find out he was killed?

                                 THALIA
                        The police came to my house and told me.

                                 DARROW
                        Were you surprised?

                                 THALIA
                        I was. But I can’t lie, Mr. Darrow. I 
                        was relieved.

                                 DARROW
                        Relieved? Really? How so?

           Thalia looks to Grace. Grace gives her a stern nod. Do it.

                                 THALIA
                        I’m sorry this fella had to die. I truly 
                        am. But I felt safer knowing there was 
                        one less felon on the streets. These 
                        people, Mr. Darrow... they simply can’t 
                        be trusted, we need to know that. We 
                        can’t sit by and watch our good citizens 
                        suffer for the sins of these natives.
           Half the room nods in agreement. The other half is ENRAGED. 
           Thalia breaks down again, her sobs inciting sympathy.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mrs. Massie, do you need a recess?

                                 THALIA
                        No, no. These wonderful people have put 
                        up with this trial for so long now. I 
                        can’t stand the thought of them waiting 
                        another minute for me. Please. I’d like 
                        to continue.

           And they can’t believe it. The strength. The modesty of this 
           scarred woman. Grace looks to the jury, all of them moved... 

                                 GRACE
                            (whispering)
                        ...it’s over...

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Well we appreciate your courage, ma’am.

                                 DARROW
                        Thank you, Your Honor. No further 
                        questions.

           And Darrow sits. The whole room quiet.

           Kelley slowly stands. Lingering in the silence for a moment. 
           He will speak calmly and sincerely...

                                 KELLEY
                        Mrs. Massie, I too want to thank you 
                        for the courage to come forward. And I 
                        want to tell you I believe you. I 
                        believe you suffered a monstrous, 
                        unspeakable crime. To be a woman in a 
                        man’s world, a world that at any moment 
                        can steal you into the shadows and take 
                        your pride... as the father of two 
                        young daughters, I cannot even...

           Kelley has to stop for a moment, the emotion welling up.

                                 KELLEY
                        I cannot even begin to imagine 
                        something that horrific happening to 
                        them. And what I might do. 

           Thalia stares at him, wondering where he’s going with this. 
           But her guard comes down a bit. She nods a thank you.
                                 KELLEY
                        Still a man’s life has been destroyed. 
                        Your mother, your husband, stand on 
                        trial. And what no one’s asked, what I’d 
                        like to know, Mrs. Massie, is what you 
                        stand for? 

           Thalia reacts, confused.

                                 THALIA
                        I don’t think I understand...

                                 KELLEY
                        Mr. Darrow’s entire defense hangs on a 
                        plea of temporary insanity. But I’d 
                        argue prejudice is a form of mass 
                        insanity... that infects us all. That 
                        spreads like a virus. Clouds our 
                        vision, blinds our better judgement. 

           He looks to the clock, the door, still no sign of Nan... 

                                 KELLEY
                        Murder is not the real crime on trial 
                        here today. No...
                            (turning back to Thalia)
                        You cast a stone, Mrs. Massie... that 
                        lead to a man’s stoning. His blood is 
                        on your hands. And if we choose to live 
                        in a world where truth, facts, justice 
                        are dragged into the shadows as well -- 
                        then we live in a world without light. 
                        Then his blood is on our hands as well.

           Grace hisses at Darrow, who rises, half-heartedly.

                                 DARROW
                        Objection. We’re in cross-examination, 
                        not closing statements.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Sustained. Mr. Kelley, I urge you to 
                        come to a question quickly.

           But before Kelley responds, the door at the back OPENS --

           It’s NAN. Finally entering. Not with an 11th hour surprise 
           witness, nor a smoking gun piece of evidence to turn the 
           whole case. No, she brings something much simpler and primal.

           Kelley relaxes, his play to buy time just paid off.

                                 KELLEY
                        Very well, I’ll ask again, Mrs. Massie. 
                        What do you stand for?
           Nan has reached Kelley, hands him a package. In one move, he 
           unwraps it and holds it before Thalia. Who goes pale.

                                 KELLEY
                        Honor...

           We see it now. A BLOWN-UP PHOTO of Kahahawai. Alive. Strong. 
           Proud. Haunted eyes gazing out. 

                                 KELLEY
                        Or your honor killing. 

           He rotates the canvas now. Another photo on the back:

           Kahahawai’s body at the crime scene. Bloody. Brutal. Lifeless. 

           An intense reaction from the crowd, the judge, the entire 
           jury. Thalia’s hands to her mouth, first time she’s seen it.

                                 DARROW
                        Objection, this is an egregious example 
                        of badgering the witness. Badgering the 
                        whole court, I’d argue.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m simply giving voice to the one 
                        witness who was never allowed an 
                        opportunity to speak.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Overruled. I’ll allow it.

           Thalia can’t keep her eyes off Kahahawai. No one can. Kelley 
           probing gently now...

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m not asking you to tell us who did 
                        this to you, Mrs. Massie. I’m simply 
                        asking you to tell us who didn’t. 

           Dead silence. For what seems an eternity.

           Thalia motionless in her seat. Looking to Tommie. To Darrow. 

           Then to her mother. Nothing said, but Grace’s hostile stare 
           burning a hole right through Thalia.

                                 KELLEY
                        One unforgivable crime should not 
                        justify another. I’m asking you to have 
                        the conviction to tell the truth.

           Thalia looks down. Suddenly quiet. Hesitant.

                                 THALIA
                        Does it matter?
           And everyone leans in. Did they hear that right?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Massie, could you say 
                        that again?

           Thalia looks to Grace once more. Something shifting inside 
           her now. The doubt turning to anger. Hesitation to outrage.

                                 THALIA
                        Does it matter who did it? You ask me to 
                        stand for my honor... but my honor was 
                        TAKEN from me! My reputation, my life! 
                        SOMEONE has to pay! If not these 
                        savages, then who?!

           And the whole crowd draws back, shocked, disturbed.

                                 KELLEY
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Massie... are you   
                        saying you don’t know who assaulted you?

           And her face goes red, unable to hold it back any longer --

                                 THALIA
                        As far as I’m concerned, it was you!
                            (singling out non-white men)
                        And you. And you. And YOU.

           Thalia fully crying now -- Grace on her feet, furiously 
           whispering at Darrow to do something -- but Darrow just keeps 
           his eyes fixed on Kelley -- 

                                 THALIA
                        Who are you to judge me, huh? YOU 
                        PEOPLE DON’T KNOW A GODDAMN THING!

           She LURCHES toward Tommie, stumbling -- Tommie catching her - 
           looking around -- disoriented -- courtroom ERUPTING in chaos -- 

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Order! We will bring order! 

           And Kelley holds a look with Nan. Neither expecting this. 

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mrs. Massie, please return to the stand 
                        to finish the questioning.

           But Kelley keeps watching Thalia. Watching the jury. Seeing 
           their faces: full of doubt now, disgust even for some. 

           It’s clear: The damage is already done. 
                                 KELLEY
                        It’s okay, your Honor, the territory 
                        rests its’ case.

           Another RUMBLE in the room. Thalia eyeing Kelley. Nothing but 
           absolute hatred. Kelley ignoring, going straight to his seat.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Mr. Darrow, your rebuttal?

           Darrow stands there. Silent. Smiling. His eyes find Ruby’s.

                                 DARROW
                        No, Your Honor. The defense rests. 

           Grace, the crowd, everything erupts. But in the chaos we hold 
           on Darrow and Ruby. A smile spreading. Of recognition, relief.

           And we hold on Kelley, eyes locked with Nan. Hoping, praying 
           that was enough. 

           INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           There’s a low murmur in the room. Everyone unconsciously 
           leaning forward. Awaiting the final result. 

           Judge Davis enters and sits. Everyone taking their seats. The 
           Jurors file in. And the Foreman stands.

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        Gentlemen have you arrived at a verdict?

                                 FOREMAN
                        We have, Your Honor.

           The Foreman holds out a piece of paper. The Clerk hands it to 
           the Judge. Judge Davis looking it over. Instantly pale. 

           He hands it back to the Clerk. 

                                 CLERK
                        Sir?

                                 JUDGE DAVIS
                        You read it.

           The Clerk takes it. Clearing his throat. Shaking.

                                 CLERK
                        We, the jury, find the defendant, 
                        Thomas H. Massie... Guilty of murder in 
                        the second degree.

           And the entire room ERUPTS -- Thalia unable to control a 
           SHRIEK -- her entire body collapsing to the floor --
                                 CLERK
                        We, the jury, find the defendant, Mrs. 
                        Grace Fortescue, guilty of murder in 
                        the second degree.

           The room is in full COMMOTION -- cheering, angry shouts -- 
           Grace on her feet -- turning to the JURY -- volcanic rage.

                                 GRACE
                        How could you?! Do you know what you’ve 
                        done?! Do you know you’ve ruined us?!

           Tommie holds her back -- the Judge CALLING the room to order, 
           but it’s past control -- And in the middle of this...

           Darrow and Kelley. Both know it’s over. Strangely, both 
           smiling. Though one of them has lost, both have won.

           EXT. IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           Many of the PROTESTERS begin to CELEBRATE, hugs, tears...  

           INT. HONOLULU JAIL CELL - DAY

           ...and HORACE IDA celebrates in his cell, pacing in elation.

           INT/EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN KALIHI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           ...and the Hawaiian community celebrates: the bars, the 
           homes, the shops, the schools, the kids in the street.

           INT. GOVERNOR JUDD’S OFFICE - IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           ...sitting at a desk, US flag above, is Governor Judd. Blank.

           INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

           ...and here are the MASSIES coming out, embracing each other 
           as they’re escorted in cuffs through the mob of REPORTERS...

                                 REPORTER
                        Do you have any comments, Mrs. Fortescue?

                                 GRACE
                        I am in shock. Utter shock. I felt all 
                        along that we would be unable to get a 
                        fair and just trial in Honolulu. But 
                        this... does it mean nothing to be free 
                        and white anymore?

           AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR

           Kelley and Nan are surrounded in smiles, handshakes, back 
           pats. And out of the crowd comes... 
           ESTHER KAHAHAWAI. Grabbing Kelley’s hands. Looking at him. 
           Eyes full of thanks beyond words. All she can muster up is --

                                 ESTHER
                        Mahalo.

           She embraces Kelley and goes. JOE SR. approaches from behind. 

                                 JOE SR.
                        Thank you, Mr. Kelley... Truly... 

           Kelley nods. Joe Sr. nods. Nothing further is needed. And 
           they part. Kelley looking around, trying to find --

           INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

           DARROW. Still in the courtroom alone as everyone files out. 
           Ruby approaches from behind. Darrow sensing her presence.

                                 DARROW
                        I know what you want to say. And I’m 
                        sure it’s all true. But right now--

           And he stops. Because her hand is on his shoulder. 

           And that fully breaks him down. His hand finding hers. Eyes 
           closing. Living in this moment as long as he can.

                                 DARROW
                        Ruby, I think... I think I’m done.
                            (looks right up at her)
                        I think this is my last case. For good.

           There is no sadness to that statement. It is simply a fact. 
           An acceptance of his fate. And Ruby is moved.

                                 RUBY
                        Let’s go home.

           She offers her arm. Darrow smiles and takes it. And the two 
           of them walk out arm-in-arm. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Darrow and Ruby exit the courtroom, instantly BESIEGED by 
           REPORTERS. Darrow glancing over the crowd, trying to find --

           KELLEY. At the other end. Also surrounded. They lock eyes. 

           There’s an undeniable admiration for Kelley in Darrow’s 
           expression. And in Kelley’s, there’s respect. 

           Kelley nods. Darrow nods back. Wanting to approach, but 
           unable to, the wave of people carrying him out. As --

           We hear the ringing of a phone... louder... and LOUDER...
           INT. GOVERNOR JUDD’S OFFICE - DAY

           The Governor is hunched over his desk. A mob angrily chanting 
           outside his window. Phone RINGING over and over. He glances 
           at it, chooses not to answer as--

           His SECRETARY rushes in, face white, urgent --

                                 SECRETARY
                        Governor? The President is on the phone!

           RING... RING... RING! On Judd, flop sweat. And then, like a man 
           to the gallows, he answers...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. IOLANI PALACE - DAWN

           It’s the next morning. Outside the palace. A BLACK CAR has 
           pulled up to the steps, escorted by TWO MILITARY VEHICLES.

           One by one, three people exit the black car: GRACE, THALIA, 
           and TOMMIE. All looking around, as if under surveillance. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - KELLEY HOUSE - LATER

           Kelley stands by the window. He hasn’t gotten much sleep.

           OUTSIDE ON THE STREET: The rioters are gone. Reporters gone. 

           He smiles a bit, heading back inside when he hears --

           A KNOCK at the door. He turns, curious.

           EXT. PORCH - KELLEY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens: It’s OFFICER MACHADO (the Hawaiian policeman 
           from the beginning of the film and the witness for Kelley).

                                 KELLEY
                        Officer Machado... Can I help you?

           And off Machado’s concerned look --

           EXT. IOLANI PALACE - LATER

           Kelley’s car SCREECHES up to the entrance -- Kelley already 
           out -- bounding up the stairs --

           INT. GOVERNOR JUDD’S OFFICE - IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           Kelley BARGES in -- immediately interrupting Governor Judd 
           and the Massies --

                                 KELLEY
                        The hell is going on here? Governor? 
           The Governor freezes. Caught in the act.

                                 KELLEY
                        The sentence meeting isn’t supposed to 
                        be for another two days.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Mr. Kelley, why don’t we have a word in 
                        private.

           Kelley observes this “meeting”: the Massies and the Governor 
           are all having tea. That’s right, tea. And breakfast. 

                                 KELLEY
                        I don’t understand, what’s going on?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                            (ushering him away)
                        Come. Just come with me.

           INT. HALLWAY - IOLANI PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Governor Judd and Kelley in the hallway. Kelley incensed...

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        I’m sorry, John. It’s already in 
                        writing. They shortened the sentence.

                                 KELLEY
                        Shortened it to what?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        It’s gonna be an hour. Here.

                                 KELLEY
                        ... Wait, you can’t -- Ten years hard 
                        labor reduced to an hour, one hour, in 
                        your office?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        There’s nothing I can do.

                                 KELLEY
                        What do you mean there’s nothing you 
                        can do?! You’re the Governor, for 
                        Chrissake!

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Listen, John, you think I want this? 
                        You don’t think I know the backlash 
                        this will stir? But I have orders from 
                        the White House. The President is 
                        threatening martial law. The whole 
                        Territory run by the U.S. military. You 
                        tell me, what’s the smart thing to do?
           Kelley looks away, trying to think of something. Anything.

                                 KELLEY
                        What about a retrial... of the first 
                        case... I’ll subpoena everyone, take it 
                        back to court--

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        At ten-o’clock today the Massies are 
                        getting on a boat to California and 
                        never coming back. And once they’re 
                        there, they will not be able to retry 
                        this case because--

                                 KELLEY
                            (realizing)
                        You can’t be tried for a crime 
                        committed in another territory.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Exactly. Now look, there are just some 
                        things we have to accept. You live this 
                        long, you get to a position like mine, 
                        you start to understand things. 
                        Sometimes it’s best to just look the 
                        other way. Trust me. It’s in everyone’s 
                        best interest.

           And only now does something dawn on Kelley. A beat.

                                 KELLEY
                        Why me?

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        What’s that?

                                 KELLEY
                        You said all the other candidates 
                        turned the job down.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        ... Well sure. They did.

                                 KELLEY
                        And you thought you could what? Use me? 
                        A working-class white man. Barely 
                        making ends meet. Plays by the book. 
                        Seems like the ideal pawn.

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        Oh c’mon, John, it wasn’t like that.

           Only it was. This is a moment of tragic clarity for Kelley...
                                 KELLEY
                        You thought I would lose... You were 
                        hoping for it...

           Governor Judd can’t summon a response. And he doesn’t need to. 
           The silence is enough. Kelley already turning --

                                 GOVERNOR JUDD
                        John! John, you misunderstand, I’m trying 
                        to help you! I’m trying to help everyone!

           But Kelley is hurrying out, down the hall, into --

           INT. GOVERNOR JUDD’S OFFICE - IOLANI PALACE - DAY

           -- where he’s passing the Massies. About to leave. But he 
           stops. Turns. Looks each of them in the eye...

                                 KELLEY
                        You may get off free, but you will 
                        never be able to run from it... the 
                        weight of your own guilt. It will crush 
                        you, slowly, I promise... 

                                 GRACE
                        He promises us? This boy promises us? 
                        Well I’ll be damned! I wasn’t aware we 
                        had God himself in this very room.

                                 KELLEY
                        God won’t be so merciful.

           He leaves them. In heavy silence. A long, long beat.

           Then Grace shrugs it off. Deep breath. Forced smile.

                                 GRACE
                        More tea anyone?

           And as she pours... 

           We hear the distant HORN of a SHIP, carrying us to...

           EXT. HONOLULU HARBOR - HOURS LATER

           The USS MALOLO, same steamer Darrow arrived on, setting sail.

           A CROWD has gathered on the dock. Reporters. Sailors. Riot-
           lines of MILITARY POLICE holding off PROTESTERS.

           CARD #1: The Massies successfully sailed for California where 
                       they were received as national heroes. 

           INT. CABIN - USS MALOLO - DAY

           DARROW stands looking out a window, arm-in-arm with RUBY...
           CARD #2: The Massie Affair was the last case Clarence Darrow 
                       ever took. To this day he is considered one of the 
                       greatest lawyers in American history.

           EXT. HONOLULU HARBOR - DAY

           KELLEY pushes his way through a bustling crowd, making his 
           way to the front...

           CARD #3: John Kelley served as Honolulu Prosecutor for 5 more 
                       years. He refused to prosecute the Ala Moana boys.

           NAN comes to join him from behind, both of them looking out 
           to see the ship slowly retreating away.

           EXT. DECK - USS MALOLO - DAY

           THALIA joins TOMMIE at the bow of the ship, grabbing his arm 
           and looking over the water... But Tommie pulls away.

           CARD #4: Two years after the trial, Tommie and Thalia filed 
                       for divorce. Tommie left the Navy and became an 
                       alcoholic. Thalia was admitted to a mental hospital 
                       and later committed suicide. 

           Tommie turns and goes. Leaving Thalia alone, lost in thought.

           CARD #5: John Kelley later hired the top detective agency in 
                       the country to determine whether the five Hawaiian 
                       boys truly raped Thalia Massie...

           She looks out to the horizon...

           CARD #6: After an exhaustive investigation they concluded: 
                       “The kidnapping and assault could not have been 
                       caused by those accused.”

           EXT. DECK STERN - USS MALOLO - DAY

           GRACE scans the receding harbor. The chaos left in her wake.

           CARD #7: Grace Fortescue lived the rest of her life in 
                       luxury. She took up waterskiing, went to Acapulco, 
                       and lived in apparent contentment until age 95.

           A slow smile spreads across her face.

           INT. PUEA CEMETERY - KALIHI, HI - PRESENT DAY

           The present day TOMBSTONE of Joseph Kahahawai. Cracked at the
