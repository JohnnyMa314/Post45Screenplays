           An ATHLETIC MALE sits in a picture perfect classroom. It’s 
           like a stock photo came to life. So clean and pristine it’s 
           unsettling.

                                 MALE ATHLETE (V.O.)
                        There are over 360,000 NCAA student-
                        athletes, and just about all of us 
                        will be going pro in something 
                        other than sports. 

           QUICK FLASHES: A volleyball is spiked, a tennis ball served, 
           a baseball caught. Again: clean. Stock. 

                                 MALE ATHLETE (V.O.)
                        Over the last 100 years, the NCAA 
                        has helped millions of student-
                        athletes find their power off the 
                        field, the court, and the rink. 

           An ethnically diverse group of athletes, all dressed for 
           different sports, stand together, arm-in-arm. 

                                 MALE ATHLETE (V.O.)
                        The NCAA puts the student...

           The same ATHLETIC MALE from the first shot, still at his 
           desk, dramatically... raises his hand. Looks directly at the 
           camera. Smiles and gives a big thumbs up. 

                                 MALE ATHLETE (V.O.)
                        .... in “student-athlete”.

           SLAM IN ON:

           A RUNNING BACK GETS ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED BY A LINEBACKER. 
           FALLS LIFELESS AND BLOODY TO THE GROUND. 

           INT. THE SUGAR BOWL - NIGHT

                                 BISSINGER
                        Get the fuck up!!! 

           TYLER CONNORS, the running back in question, lies flat on the 
           turf near the sideline. Almost certainly unconscious. 
           Definitely concussed. Upon closer inspection we see--

           He’s the MALE ATHLETE from the commercial. 

           COACH FRANK BISSINGER, 65, red in the face, headset dangling 
           from his neck, CLAPS in Connors’ face. 
                                 BISSINGER (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck up and get off the 
                        field!!

           He gets the fuck up. Dizzy. Guided to the sideline. Blood 
           gushing from the bridge of his nose.

           We hover over the burly offensive line as they get back to 
           the line of scrimmage. Bloody. Sweaty. Gasping for air like 
           their lives depend on it. 

           This is a violent game. 18 year olds crushing each other. 
           Broken bones. Shit talking. Bloody noses and lips. Hell on 
           turf. A car accident every single down.

           SCORE READS: Oklahoma 34, Auburn 28

           A mass of tens of thousands. Drunk, restless, and otherwise.

           STEVE MCGUIRE, the sophomore quarterback, sprints to the line 
           of scrimmage. Auburn on the 5-yard line. One play from the 
           championship. 

           Hurry up offense. Everything moving light speed. 

           Chaos on the sideline as the coaches try to get the play into 
           the huddle. BISSINGER still screaming. The crowd only gets 
           louder. Both school bands are blasting music. Deafening. 

                                 BISSINGER (CONT’D)
                        Colt 16 Indiana!! Colt 16 Indiana!!

           It’s almost impossible to call a football game at normal 
           tempo. Hurry up is normal tempo x5. 

           GRAD ASSISTANTS hold up COLORED BOARDS to get the play in.

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                             (to the other players)
                        Colt 16 Indiana!!

           CLAPS his hands as he calls a receiver into motion. The 
           center SNAPS the ball. The play happens in a blur of 
           unadulterated violence. 

           McGuire reads the defense. Drops back. Throws --

           The ball is TIPPED off the hand of a defender. And--

           IT’S INTERCEPTED. It’s over. Auburn loses. 
           The Oklahoma bench explodes. Players rushing to midfield. 
           Confetti shoots from the sky. 

           Close on AUBURN PLAYERS. Kneeling on the ground in shock. 
           BISSINGER. Hands on his knees. Bent over in pain. Exhaustion.

           But we’re not focused on that...

           We snake through the celebration and confetti...

           Through the chaos...

           Through the end zone...

           Through the drunken fanfare of the crowd...

           A MAN gets up from his seat, shaking his head as he walks 
           towards the exit. We can’t make out his features save for his 
           SILVER HAIR and a noticeable LIMP. 

           The screen becomes grainy as we move CLOSER AND CLOSER until 
           it’s nothing but a jumble of colors.

           Rules you need to know about college football:

           #1. For those involved in the game, it’s not a game -- it’s a 
           religion. People across the country go to church every 
           Sunday... in the South they go to church on Saturday too. 

           #2. Despite players logging over 80 hours a week on the 
           field, they are not paid. The NCAA still considers college 
           football an extracurricular activity.

           #3. Rules are made to be broken. 

           NATIONAL SIGNING DAY, 2018

                        I believe in Auburn Tigers 
                        Football.

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS’ CAR - NIGHT

           We’re, quite literally, going 100 miles per hour. We’re 
           frantic. Everything speeding by--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        I have since I was a boy.
           But it’s controlled chaos. There is a plan and it is being 
           followed. We’re never in a panic, because we’re in good 
           hands. And those hands belong to --

           ATTICUS ARCHER. 55. Silver hair. Oxford jacket. He 
           methodically checks his watch, as he always does when a plan 
           is unfolding. He has everything under control.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        The first college football game was 
                        played in 1869. Four years after 
                        Appomattox. Rutgers beat Princeton 
                        6-4. Upon seeing the violence and 
                        chaos of the game, a Rutgers 
                        professor proclaimed to the crowd: 
                        “you will come to no Christian 
                        end”.

           EXT. PATTERSON HOME - NIGHT 

           Atticus’ Mercedes glides to a stop in front of a SUBURBAN 
           HOME. It’s the smallest house in an affluent neighborhood. 
           Trying to be something it’s not. 

           Atticus gets out. He hesitates for a moment, typing on his 
           phone. He’s sending something, but we can’t see the screen. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        College football is sewn into the 
                        soil of our country, especially 
                        here in the South. When you’re on 
                        the field, you’re independent of 
                        history, and money, and politics, 
                        and everyone and everything that 
                        came before you. You have one 
                        objective: move forward. 

           The limp. Close on Atticus’ leg as he walks to the door.

           INT. PATTERSON HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Atticus is talking directly at us. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I could go on forever. But I won’t. 
                        We don’t have time for that. Not in 
                        the slightest. You know who I am. 
                        I’m not a player. I’m sure as hell 
                        not a coach. You won’t find my name 
                        anywhere on campus. And that’s 
                        exactly why I’m here. Tonight. To 
                        talk to you.
           REVEAL:

           He’s sitting across from -- 

           RICKY PATTERSON. 18. Everything you would expect a star 
           quarterback prospect to look like: the long hair, the square 
           jaw. He’s THE QB recruit, the great hope, the arm that’s 
           going to save a program --  

           BILL PATTERSON, 50’s, Ricky’s Dad. The classically 
           overbearing sports father. We all know this guy, he’s the Dad 
           that gets ejected from little league games for arguing with 
           the umps.

           Bill has waited his entire life for this night: the night his 
           boy gets a full ride to a powerhouse football program. There 
           are pictures of Bill and Ricky EVERYWHERE on the walls. All 
           with Ricky in uniform. Bill proudly standing by his side. 

           But Atticus is here to talk to --

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Francis. 

           FRANCIS PATTERSON, 16, who looks exactly like Ricky, 
           just...fatter. Ricky if he was staring into a funhouse 
           mirror. 

           SAWYER PATTERSON, Ricky’s mother, 40’s, enters the room.

                                 SAWYER PATTERSON
                        Tea?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’re too kind, Mrs. Patterson
                             (takes a sip)
                        Mmm, delicious.

           He turns his attention to Ricky, who seems to be perpetually 
           running his hands through his flowing hair. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I trust senior year is coming along 
                        well. Would have loved to have you 
                        at Auburn, but we understand and 
                        respect the commitment you’re 
                        making to Bama... especially 
                        considering what’s going on there. 
                        It’s an honorable choice. Shows a 
                        lot of character.

           Ricky starts to open his mouth but Atticus keeps going. He’s 
           in control.
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        We’ve had our eyes on both you and 
                        Francis for a very long time. 
                        Ricky, you’re the best high school 
                        quarterback in the country, and I 
                        hope you’re not offended by this, 
                        but we think Francis has a chance 
                        to be even better. 
                             (Bill smiles)
                        Tomorrow is signing day. 

           The kitchen phone RINGS. No one moves. Entranced by Atticus. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        I should be out closing our top 
                        recruits for this year. Instead I’m 
                        here, working on next year. That’s 
                        how much we believe in you, 
                        Francis.

           The kitchen phone RINGS again. Bill’s cellphone springs to 
           life on the chair, BUZZING. He pushes it aside. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        This is my last year at Auburn, and 
                        I want to make sure I leave things 
                        better than where I found them. 
                        You’re going to do great things, 
                        Francis. You’re going to win 
                        championships. We’re going to make 
                        you a star. You’re not going to get 
                        that at Alabama, not with the 
                        sanctions. 

           Francis smiles. A fat grin. 

           RING. RING. RING. Ricky nervously twists a lock of his hair 
           around his finger. What the hell is going on? 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Now, where in the hell...

           RING. RING. RING. No one can hear themselves think. 

           EVERY PHONE IN THE HOUSE IS RINGING.

           Sawyer hurries into the kitchen. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate your honesty, Mr. 
                        Archer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        To tell you the truth, since the 
                        Bama sanctions came down, we’ve had 
                        reps from every school in the 
                        nation sit on that very couch in 
                        this very living room, and we’ve 
                        told them all the same thing: 
                        you’re not getting Ricky Patterson. 
                        No fucking way.

                                 SAWYER PATTERSON
                             (calling from the other 
                              room, concerned)
                        Bill??

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        WHAT?
                             (as he walks out of the 
                              room, annoyed)
                        Excuse me a moment.

           Ricky and Francis sit silently on the couch. Murmurs echo 
           from the kitchen. Atticus nods, giving the boys a polite 
           smile. The only calm one in the house. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        RICKY???

           Ricky leaps up from his seat and into the kitchen. Francis 
           tries to look away from Atticus, who holds his gaze as he 
           patiently waits. Checks his watch.  

           We can hear an argument developing in the kitchen.  
           Exasperated. Pure panic. RICKY AND BILL ARE YELLING AT EACH 
           OTHER. Sawyer trying to break it up. 

           Francis is freaking out. Fidgeting and trying to look away. 
           Atticus still calm as can be.

           The rest of the family returns to the living room. Pale. Like 
           they’ve seen a ghost.

                                 BILL PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        T-that was Alabama. Th-they’re 
                        dropping Ricky.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’re kidding. 

           Sawyer is seconds away from tears. Bill is absolutely 
           bewildered. Doesn’t know what to do with himself. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        I can’t believe it. I... 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Bill. Breathe. Back up and tell me 
                        exactly what happened.

           TITLE CARD READS: 45 MINUTES AGO

           The ROAR of an engine. That 100mph engine. 

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS’ CAR - NIGHT

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re getting Ricky Patterson.

           Atticus speeds down the two lane highway, talking into a 
           phone. 

           He has two phones, one in hand and one clipped to the 
           dashboard. We’ll make it easy and call them BURNER and 
           CIVILIAN. It’s essential to know the difference. 

           INT. AUBURN ATHLETIC FACILITIES - NIGHT

           BENNY - The Guy on the Inside. 23, skinny, pale... Benny is 
           the overworked Grad Assistant who has dreams of running the 
           program.

           He and the other GA’s are working well into the night. 
           Nothing new. The pale light of the cement hallways weakly 
           masks the bags under their eyes. 

                                 BENNY
                             (into his phone)
                        The Ricky Patterson?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        If we had to drop Bolden, could we 
                        make that happen?

           Surprised, Benny turns away from the other GA’s. 

                                 BENNY
                             (nearly a whisper)
                        Drop Bolden?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Hypothetically.

           The other GA’s are talking over him.

                                 BENNY
                             (to the group)
                        Yo, shut the fuck up.

                        I’m talking to my Grandma. 
                             (He continues down the 
                              hallway to avoid them)
                        Usually we don’t make a habit of 
                        dropping five-stars. Hypothetical 
                        or not.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        One hour. Be prepared to drop 
                        Bolden. Don’t ask questions. 

           The line goes dead. Benny looks at his phone. We see Atticus 
           is saved as GRANDMA NANCY. 

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 

           An overly enthusiastic ROOKIE COP readily points the speed 
           gun towards the highway. As Atticus blows by--

           102MPH. 

           He reaches for the flashers. The VETERAN COP sitting shotgun 
           swats his hand away. 

                                 VETERAN COP
                        We don’t pull that car over. 

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus going even faster. Makes another call on BURNER. A 
           well-oiled machine. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I need you to stop everything 
                        you’re doing.

           EXT. SOUTHERN ROAD - NIGHT 

           GEOFF - Second in Command. 51, round, mustached. In a word: 
           Southern.  

           He’s standing at the foot of a winding driveway, all gravel 
           and dust on a deserted road. In the midst of slipping a BROWN 
           BAG into a mailbox as he answers his phone. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I’m sending you an address. Need 
                        you to drop 20 there within the 
                        hour. 
                                 GEOFF
                        20? I don’t have 20. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Go to Kenny. He’ll have it ready. 

                                 GEOFF
                        What’s going on?

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS’ CAR - NIGHT

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Don’t have time to explain. Address 
                        coming.

           He hangs up. Sends the address on BURNER. Picks up CIVILIAN. 
           Texts DIANE ARCHER: “Home late. Love you.”

           Checks his watch before TWISTING the dial on the radio.

                             (over the radio)
                        Rumors continue to flood in on 
                        where the Tigers will go with this 
                        recruiting class....
                             (turns up the volume)
                        We know Bama is out of the equation 
                        after their sanctions. Alleged 
                        payments, sexual assault, 
                        kickbacks... all leading to the FBI 
                        investigation. Four of Bama’s so-
                        called “bag men” arrested. You 
                        gotta wonder about five-star 
                        quarterback Ricky Patterson, the 
                        consensus crown jewel of this 
                        class. He continues to say that 
                        he’s sticking with Alabama despite 
                        their two-year postseason ban.  No 
                        disrespect to Steve McGuire, but 
                        I’d imagine the Tigers would love 
                        to bring in a quarterback of 
                        Patterson’s caliber considering the 
                        way last season ended.

                        There’s no reason to be polite 
                        about it. We don’t have shit at 
                        quarterback. I--

           Atticus shuts the radio off as he pulls up to --
           EXT. PATTERSON HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           The Pattersons’ house. Right where we started.

           Atticus picks up BURNER as he gets out of the car. THIS TIME 
           WE CAN SEE THE SCREEN. 

           A SCREEN SHOT OF AN EMAIL CHAIN. We recognize one of the 
           addresses as Bill Patterson’s. Atticus selects “Send photo”. 

           Scrolls through his contacts. He selects: ESPN, FOX, 
           TUSCALOOSA NEWS, FRANKIE AND THE TANK, RACHEL UPCHURCH. 

           He hits SEND just as he exits the car and limps to the door. 

           And we’re back to -- 

           INT. PATTERSON HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           NOW.

           Pure chaos. Every phone still ringing. Bill and Sawyer look 
           at Atticus. Desperate. Scared. Remember how this was supposed 
           to be the best night of Bill’s life? Oops. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        An email with an agent? Really? 
                        Bill this is...

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        We didn’t take anything. He 
                        contacted us. We discussed numbers. 
                        That’s it. Nothing happened. 

           Atticus covers his face with his hand. Shaking his head. 
           Really playing this up.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You really thought it was OK to 
                        discuss numbers over email? To 
                        leave a paper trail...?

                        those are private emails... I can

                        Time is of the essence. Press is 
                        gonna be outside that door any 
                        second. Shut off your cell phones

                        No press. Period.  

           Ricky has his head buried in his hands. He can’t look at 
           Bill. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Dad... I... I can’t believe this. 
                        How could you?  

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Ricky, it wasn’t... I’m doing 
                        what’s best for you. That’s all I 
                        ever do. 

           Panic. We can feel it. Everyone is losing it.

                        What do we do??

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Geoff trudges through a vast FIELD. Holding a DUFFEL BAG at

                        The fuck is going on...

           He continues through the tall grass. The bag bouncing at his 
           side. Crickets and cicadas buzzing. The Southern stars 
           gleaming brightly above.

                        Oh, we’re full on scholarships. Had 
                        everything wrapped up for months 
                        now. I don’t--

                        has looked great so far.

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        McGuire?? No, no, no. We--

                        Bill. Don’t be ridiculous. Every

                        We can’t just drop one of them the 
                        night before signing day.

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Ricky will do anything. We’ve 
                        worked so hard to get to this 
                        night.

                             (he looks Ricky directly 
                              in the eye)
                        This has to be what you want. Not 
                        what your Dad wants. Not what your 
                        Mom wants. Not anyone but you. You 
                        want a future as an Auburn Tiger? 
                        Then look me in the eye and tell me 
                        that.

           Ricky is a boy who has never had to answer for himself. Mom 
           and Dad always by his side. Protecting him. Telling him what 
           needs to be said. And now?

           It seems like he doesn’t know what to do. His face blank for 
           a moment. He swallows. Finally stands up. Speaks--

                        I’d do anything. Anything to play 
                        at Auburn. Please. I can’t sit next 
                        year out. I don’t want to go to a 
                        junior college. I’ve worked too 
                        hard. This is my life. I have 
                        nothing else. 

           Atticus takes a deep breath. Draws the moment out. Really 
           thinking. All the Pattersons look on... waiting for a 
           response... Desperate. He has them hook, line, and sinker. 

           With the faintest hint of a smile -- he checks his watch.

                        Then I’ll do everything in my power 
                        to make it happen. Sit tight.

                        and turn your phone back on please.

           pour in. Closes the blinds.

           but Atticus confused. He passes the phone to Bill. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                             (to Bill)
                        Answer when I call.

           EXT. PATTERSON HOME - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           Over “LET ‘EM IN” by Wings. 

           A cacophony of REPORTERS has gathered in front of the house. 
           Cameras flashing. No sign from the front door. 

           In the very corner of the screen-- 

           Atticus walks right by them, head down. Removes BURNER and 
           texts BENNIE: “Drop Bolden”. 

           Smiles as he gets into his car. 

           As he drifts away we hit Paul McCartney’s “Someone’s knockin’ 
           at the door...”
           INT./EXT. - ATTICUS' CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus reaches into his glove compartment and removes an 
           ORANGE PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. He swallows a few pills. Rubs his 
           leg. In pain. Gazes out the window...

           Now that we have a chance to catch our breath, let’s address 
           where we are: The South.

           Indian summers, glistening lakes, fried chicken so brown and 
           crispy you want to reach out, napkin be damned. And... 
           Football. Practice fields and Tiger signs everywhere. 

           Atticus pulls through town...

           MAIN STREET. 

           If John Hughes was from the South, all his movies would have 
           been set on this street. Striped awnings. Mom & Pop shops. 
           It’s a sloping hill, old shops perfectly aligned. A 45-degree 
           angle of brick. Massive old-growth oak trees line the street. 

           You’ve never been here and it still feels like home. Atticus 
           loves it like a child. Auburn... the loveliest village on the 
           plains. 

           INT. TOOMER’S - NIGHT

           One of those bars that’s upscale dive-y. Perfect for game-day 
           camaraderie or a $50 meal. Auburn apparel and memorabilia 
           lines the wall. Framed black and white photos. Pristine 
           throwback jerseys. Heaven for a Tigers fan. 

           RONNIE - The Lieutenant. 42, sits at a table in the back 
           corner. Your alcoholic uncle in another life. In this one, 
           he’s a rising bag man. He sips a glass of whiskey. He owns 
           the place. Literally.  

           A MAP of the entire United States is spread out in front of 
           him, along with a long list of players. X’s and O’s 
           everywhere... a bag man’s playbook.

           ATTICUS walks in. Makes his way behind the bar and mixes 
           himself a glass. Walks to the table. Places the glass beside 
           Ronnie’s. Except--

           Atticus isn’t drinking whiskey. He’s drinking CHOCOLATE MILK. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re dropping Bolden.
                                 RONNIE
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about? For who? 

           Atticus takes the list of players. CROSSES OUT Bolden. Draws 
           a CIRCLE around the #1 player on the list: RICKY PATTERSON.

           Ronnie’s jaw on the floor in disbelief. Has to get up. 

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were there for his 
                        brother? How...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Francis can’t play for shit. 
                        Ricky is committing tomorrow. Bama 
                        dropped him. 

                                 RONNIE
                        What?! What happened? 

           GEOFF barges though the door. Sweaty. Panting. Pissed off. 

                                 GEOFF
                        What the fuck is going on? That 
                        field smelled like my first wife’s--

                                 RONNIE
                        We got Ricky Patterson.

                                 GEOFF
                        You’re shitting me. 

           Geoff takes a seat. In a daze. Looks at Atticus.

                                 GEOFF (CONT’D)
                        You son of a bitch. 

                                 RONNIE
                        What is Bissinger going to say? 
                        Patterson can’t start with 
                        McGuire...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        He will. Wait until he sees him up 
                        close.

                                 GEOFF
                             (whispering even though no 
                              one else is in the room)
                        How much is he gonna cost?
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How much was in the bag you 
                        dropped?

                                 GEOFF
                        You said 20... 

           A stupid grin crosses Geoff’s face as he realizes what he was 
           doing all along. There’s always a plan.

           Atticus checks his watch as he picks up BURNER and dials. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (into burner)
                        Bill, it’s Atticus. 

           Geoff and Ronnie watch. In anticipation. In awe. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Listen, I have good news. It 
                        wasn’t easy, but we were able to 
                        clear a spot. I’d like to be the 
                        first to officially welcome you to 
                        the Auburn family. 
                             (listening)
                        Bill... this is a delicate subject, 
                        but I’m sure you had some 
                        arrangements with Alabama. 

           Ronnie is dancing as Atticus finishes the call. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to send you an address. 
                        You’ll find something there. We’ll 
                        have some transportation set up for 
                        Ricky as well. 
                             (listening)
                        Of course. Of course. Yes. 
                        Congratulations. 
                             (as he hangs up)
                        Ricky Patterson is an Auburn Tiger. 

                                 RONNIE
                        This could be our best class ever. 
                             (raising his glass)
                        Cheers to Atticus. Your last 
                        signing day is going to be your 
                        best. Bet you’re not gonna miss 
                        these long ass nights.  

           Atticus doesn’t say anything. Geoff clears his throat. He’s 
           been waiting to say something... 
                                 GEOFF
                        I don’t want to rain on the Ricky 
                        Patterson parade... but I have 
                        something that just might. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (intrigued)
                        Go on...

           Geoff takes out his phone. Pulls up a video. It’s grainy. 
           He’s showing it specifically to Ronnie. Atticus leans in 
           anyway. Can’t help himself.  

           It’s High School tape. A MASSIVE D-LINEMAN. We only see a few 
           plays, but he’s plowing guys over. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Meet Chance Fluker. Just 
                        transferred from New Orleans. 
                        Playing at Prattville.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How old? 

                                 GEOFF
                        17. Out next year. Let’s set up a 
                        high school visit immediately. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I’ll go next weekend.

                                 RONNIE
                        You don’t want one of us to go?

           Atticus ignores him. Starts the tape over.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Wow. 

           Close on his gaze and the grainy footage. Once Atticus finds 
           a prospect he wants, he will stop at nothing until he gets 
           him. And this is no ordinary prospect...

           He’s found a new white whale. 

           EXT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Atticus pulls up to his HOUSE. Two story, nothing flashy. The 
           only house on the block that doesn’t have an Auburn flag 
           flying out front.   
           He walks to the door. His limp a little more exaggerated than 
           before. He’s in pain. 

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           He walks into the master bedroom holding a large ICE PACK.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Jade? Or malachite? 

           DIANE ARCHER, 52, no nonsense, maybe the only person on the 
           planet who can see through Atticus’ charm, think Connie 
           Britton, walks in from the closet.  

           There are dozens of CARPET SAMPLE SQUARES scattered on the 
           floor.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        What are you doing up?

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        If you’re gonna get home late, I’m 
                        gonna stay up late.
                             (pause)
                        So what do we think?

           Atticus holds both samples up. They look exactly the same. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I think.... what room is this for 
                        again?

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        The living room. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It seems... loud. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Good news or bad news? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (matter of fact)
                        We got the #1 prospect in the 
                        country.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        How much?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Not bad.

           Atticus takes a few more pills. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Be careful with those. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Just a long day on my feet. 

           BURNER starts to ring. Atticus removes it from his jacket. It  
           never stops. Looks at it and answers.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Yeah, we got him. I’ll stop by 
                        later this week. We can discuss 
                        then.
                             (listens)
                        Yeah.

           Nods and hangs up.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Remember when I thought you were 
                        cheating on me? You and the 
                        adulterers, the only ones who need 
                        two phones.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I think malachite.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I like jade. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        These all have fancy names.
                             (pointing at a different 
                              sample)
                        What about that one? What’s that 
                        one?

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Green. Are you still good to visit 
                        next weekend? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (knows this isn’t going to 
                              go well)
                        I can’t anymore. I have a high 
                        school visit. Just popped up. 
                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        What do you mean? You’re done. No 
                        more signing days. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I know. Just some due diligence. 
                        It’ll just be next weekend. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Whatever this is, it can wait. 

           He says nothing. She knows that look in his eyes. It can’t.

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Did you at least look at the 
                        pictures I sent you?

           He takes out CIVILIAN and brings up the photos. They look 
           beautiful. Modern. Right out of Architectural Digest. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        We’re old. It’s time to get out of 
                        here. Time for our forever home.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re not old. 

           She smiles. As he gets into bed, clothes still on... 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I changed my mind. Jade. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I knew you’d come around. 

           She looks over. Atticus is already sleeping. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Folding chairs set up in rows, all facing a table at the 
           front of the gym. ATTICUS stands in the back. He’s watching 
           FLUKER TAPE on his phone. Obsessed. 

           You would think we were about to see a High School play if 
           not for -- 

           RICKY PATTERSON sitting behind the table, four hats in front 
           of him. There’s a HIGH SCHOOL MASCOT standing behind him. 
           Looks like a cheap Halloween costume. 

           BENNY stands close to the front of the room with SAWYER AND 
           FRANCIS. Bill is noticeably absent. 
                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I want to thank everyone for taking 
                        the time to come today. This has 
                        been a really long process and I...

           As Atticus watches him talk, the lightbulbs begin to FLASH... 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FIELD - DAY 

           Hazy. A dream. Shards of memory. 

           A QB launches passes. He’s good. Really good. We watch as he 
           goes through practice. Chemistry with his receivers. He’s the 
           complete package. Almost could be Ricky Patterson. 

           As he walks off the field, he takes off his helmet -- 

           It’s ATTICUS. 17 years old. 

           A group of COLLEGE COACHES. Alabama, Texas, LSU. Lined up 
           waiting. One of them is BISSINGER. It’s hard to believe he 
           was ever young, but here he is: face less weathered, softer.

           FLASHES of different COACHES and BAG MEN sitting around the 
           table with Atticus and his family. Shaking hands. Recruiting. 

           A focus on HANK ARCHER, 44, Atticus’ father and his high 
           school coach.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Back in the gym as Ricky addresses the media-- 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I won’t be commenting further on 
                        Alabama. I’m not here to talk about 
                        the past...

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           A mirrored set up to Ricky’s gym, but KEVIN BOLDEN, 18, clad 
           in his letterman jacket, is standing in the corner - waiting 
           for his ceremony to begin. An AUBURN and an OLE MISS hat on 
           the table. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (V.O.)
                        I’m here to talk about the biggest 
                        decision of my life. I’m excited to 
                        announce that I’m committing to...
           Bolden’s phone rings. He answers. We can’t hear the other end 
           of the call, but his face drops. He hangs up the phone. 

           Walks to the table and REMOVES the AUBURN hat. Crushed.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           The same AUBURN HAT. But now Ricky is reaching for it. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Auburn University. Go Tigers. 

           The Mascot starts dancing. Ricky fixes his long hair. Atticus 
           checks his watch. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t be more excited about 
                        the opportunity ahead. Feel like 
                        I’m going to get a great chance to 
                        get starting reps right away.

           INT. ATHLETIC OFFICE - DAY

           The Auburn staff watches Ricky’s announcement on TV. 
           BISSINGER spins in his chair, shocked at what he just heard. 

                                 BISSINGER 
                        Starting reps? Can someone explain 
                        to me again how the fuck we got 
                        this kid?

           INT. CONNORS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The team is gathered. Watching Ricky’s announcement. Locked 
           in but causal. No one wants to act like they’re worried. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Yo, McGuire! This kid says he’s 
                        going to start. 

           The players laugh. Who the fuck does this guy think he is? 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           BRIGHT FLASHBULBS as a crowd has gathered around Ricky. We’re 
           focused on one journalist as she ELBOWS her way to the front 
           of the crowd --

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Excuse me. Excuse me! 
           RACHEL UPCHURCH, 36, bespectacled. She looks like she should 
           be a political correspondent. Instead, she’s stuck with 
           sports. She treats it all the same. Everyone else asks bull 
           shit. She’s a pain in the ass. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH (CONT’D)
                        Ricky, when you said starting 
                        reps... did you mean this season?

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        It’ll be a good competition. I 
                        respect McGuire a ton. But, I’m 
                        here to compete. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        I notice your Dad isn’t here. Can 
                        you tell us more about that? 

           Atticus shakes his head. Fucking Upchurch. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        My Dad made a mistake. There’s a 
                        reason he’s not here today. And 
                        that hurts. To be honest, I don’t 
                        know if I’ll ever be able to 
                        forgive. But now I... I....

           He’s starting to lose his train of thought. Slipping. Atticus 
           glares at Benny, jerks his neck. “Get him out”.  

                                 BENNY
                        Alright, enough. Enough.

           Benny gets him the hell out... pushing Ricky through the 
           crowd and outside the gym.

           Atticus goes to follow them, giving Upchurch a glare as he 
           passes. 

           As he’s walking out the door... something catches his eye. 

           Someone that is-- THOMAS KENDRICK, 38, African-American. Most 
           former athletes put on fat when they retire. Kendrick put on 
           muscle.

           Atticus doesn’t recognize him, which is a problem because 
           Atticus recognizes everyone. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You press? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Yeah, what’s up? 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        For who? Never seen you around.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        I keep a low profile.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Then I would definitely know you. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                             (laughing)
                        And you are...? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Just a fan. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        You must be pretty devoted. Take 
                        off work and everything to come to 
                        some high school gym.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I work from home. 
                             (looking Kendrick over)
                        You play? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        North Texas. Four years. 

           We hear it in Atticus’ tone as soon as they start talking 
           ball: he likes this guy. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We played them, what, eighteen 
                        years ago?

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Sure did. I was on the field. One 
                        of the best games of my life. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        What was the final score of that 
                        one? 49 to....
                             (He thinks about it for a 
                              moment. But he knows.)
                        14? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Scored a touchdown in Jordan-Hare. 
                        I’ll take that to my grave.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No kidding. So who’s your SEC team?
                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        I root for the underdog. Grew up 
                        playing outside the spotlight. SEC 
                        is too much of a circus. Look at 
                        this gym. Christ. Everything that’s 
                        wrong with the game. Guided by some 
                        delusion that a player needs more 
                        than a scholarship. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You don’t think players should be 
                        paid?

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Think you should play for the love 
                        of the game. Anything else and 
                        you’re in it for the wrong reasons. 
                        If you’re good enough to get paid, 
                        you’ll get it when the time’s 
                        right. Surprised you think 
                        differently, you struck me as a 
                        traditionalist. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I am. Think people should be 
                        compensated fairly for the work 
                        they do.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Last I checked a degree at Auburn 
                        runs about, what, 110K for four 
                        years. That not fair to you? What’s 
                        more valuable than an education in 
                        this country? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I know this isn’t the case at North 
                        Texas, but at Auburn everyone is 
                        playing for the NFL. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        And how many players did Auburn 
                        send to the NFL last year? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Eight. But four undrafted free 
                        agents and one--

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        So eight. Of what? 20? Those don’t 
                        sound like fair odds to me. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        And if the others had been paid, 
                        they’d already have a jump start on 
                        life after school.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        That’s what’s the degree is for. 
                        Just like you said, compensated 
                        fairly for the work they do.
                             (off Atticus’ frustrated 
                              glare)
                        So, where’d you play? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I -- played high school ball. 

           Kendrick nods. This is everything he hates about the SEC... 
           diehard fans who didn’t play. Who don’t know what he knows.

           SFX: TAP. TAP. TAP. 

           TITLE CARD READS: YESTERDAY

           INT. NCAA HEADQUARTERS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           TAP. TAP. TAP.

           An NCAA meeting. Glass walls. Everything high-tech. Modern.

           It’s so corporate it hurts. The type of room where everything 
           is done behind a fake smile. Case in point: the offices are 
           in Indiana. And sitting in the middle of the room is--

           THOMAS KENDRICK - He’s not a journalist. 

           And he’s bored. His PENCIL hits the table in rhythm. TAP. 
           TAP. TAP.

           He looks around the glass table at his colleagues. A rainbow 
           of diversity. When they catch his glance, they SMILE. 

           From down the hall we hear... CLICK CLACK CLICK CLACK. 

           High heels. For our sake, those heels might as well be the 
           Jaws theme, because they announce the arrival of...

           SARAH SWANNER, 48, NCAA President. Block glasses. Razor sharp 
           black hair. She’s a killer. A fucking killer. 

           She sits... folds her hands... looks around the table...
                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        Shall we begin? 

           Smiles from her staff. Because that’s what you do here.

           MONTAGE OF THE MEETING:

           Different NCAA MEMBERS stand at the front of the room, giving 
           presentations. 

                                 NCAA MEMBER #2
                        Incidental Benefits—Reasonable 
                        Refreshments states an institution 
                        may provide student-athletes with 
                        reasonable refreshments (e.g., soft 
                        drinks, snacks) for student-athlete 
                        educational and business meetings 
                        and, on an occasional basis, for 
                        celebratory events (e.g., 
                        birthdays). Because the pasta 
                        constituted a full meal and not a 
                        snack, Oklahoma has self-reported 
                        the pasta violations.

           TAP. TAP. TAP.

           AFTER THE MEETING:

           INT. SWANNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kendrick knocks on Swanner’s door. Her office is well 
           decorated, but sparse. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        You wanted to see me? 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        You didn’t have much to say in the 
                        meeting. No feedback? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        The presentations were very well 
                        done. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                             (smiling)
                        I thought so too.
                             (pause)
                        How’s your summer been?

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Warm. 
           She places a FILE on the desk.

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                             (matter of fact)
                        We’re sending you to Auburn. 

           Remember the look on Atticus’ face when he saw the Fluker 
           tape? The same look is now on Kendrick’s face. He can’t 
           believe it. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to announce it in 
                        front of the others. It’s a big 
                        assignment for obvious reasons. 
                        You’ve put your time in, Thomas. 
                        It’s time to get you in the field. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Do we have intel? 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        The intel we have is the #1 recruit 
                        in the country was dropped the 
                        night of signing day under 
                        mysterious circumstances... we have 
                        to look, even if it’s nothing.. Dot 
                        the I’s and cross the T’s. Keep a 
                        low profile. See what you can find. 
                        It’s probably nothing, but you 
                        never know. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        You want me in Auburn, then I’m 
                        going to Auburn.

           Ever the company man. 

           Swanner smiles like a shark. Close on Kendrick’s determined 
           eyes.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Who’d you say you write for again? 

           Those SAME EYES look directly at Atticus. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        I’m a freelancer. 
                             (reaching out his hand)
                        Tom. Nice to meet you.
           As he does, BURNER begins to ring. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Atticus. Have to run but let me 
                        know next time you’re in town. 
                        Maybe in the playoffs. North Texas’ 
                        season should be wrapped up by 
                        then. I’ll set you up with field 
                        passes.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        I’m sure you will. 

           Kendrick watches him walk out the door. He takes note of 
           Atticus’ limp. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FIELD - NIGHT

           CHANCE FLUKER steamrolls an offensive lineman, flattening him 
           before SACKING the Quarterback. 

                                 BAMA COACH
                        Jesus fucking Christ. 

           A litany of COACHES and RECRUITERS from other schools: blood 
           red Alabama polos against the fence, bag men from LSU, 
           Florida, and Texas stand close by -- 

           All watching Chance. Everyone’s jaw on the floor. This kid is 
           an animal. A beast. An absolute, no doubt, home run, phenom.  

           Atticus sits in the bleachers. He isn’t watching Fluker. His 
           eyes are focused elsewhere--

           JENNA FLUKER, Chance’s mother. Only 39. Tired. A single 
           mother, always a million things going on. 

           Atticus watches her closely. His wheels turning. 

           AFTER PRACTICE:

           The other reps are MOBBING Chance’s coach. Atticus avoids the 
           crowd. Waits at the bottom of the bleachers for Ms. Fluker.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Ms. Fluker? 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        No thank you.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        My name’s Atticus. I’m with 
                        Aubur...
                                 MS. FLUKER
                        No thank you. I have to go. We have 
                        to make the bus and we’re already 
                        late --

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        If I could just have a moment...

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Talk to Chance’s coach. He’s 
                        arranging all of Chance’s 
                        recruiting. We’re only taking 
                        official visits.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I don’t want to talk to his coach, 
                        I want to talk to you. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        We’re not interested in your money. 
                             (a deep, frustrated, 
                              breath)
                        I know you have a job to do. But I 
                        do too. I have three children to 
                        raise. On my own. I don’t have time 
                        to listen to each and every rich 
                        white booster who tries to sell me.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        So you’re just going to let his 
                        coach do it? 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I’m going to let the experts handle 
                        it. He knows what he’s doing. He 
                        knows--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        He’s going to pawn Chance off to 
                        the highest bidder. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        He wouldn’t do that--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        He would and he will. I promise 
                        you. Your son is a once-in-a-
                        lifetime talent, and he’s going to 
                        command once in a lifetime money. 
                        All I’m asking is you listen to me. 
                        I know you don’t want my money --
                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Chance is going to do this the 
                        right way. He’s going to earn his 
                        degree, and when he plays well 
                        enough, he’ll go to the NFL. He’s 
                        not taking a penny before. My son 
                        is not going to get caught up in 
                        all your nonsense.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Why don’t I join you for dinner? 
                        I’d love to talk to you and your 
                        sons about what we can offer at 
                        Auburn.

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Mr. Archer, if you want to buy out 
                        an entire Zaxby’s and bring it 
                        over, you can join us. Otherwise, 
                        leave us be. 

           Atticus lets her go. Immediately recalibrating. This is going 
           to be a bigger challenge than he thought.  

           Watches her and Chance from a distance as the BUS pulls up. 
           The bus... it gets him thinking.

           EXT. AUBURN CAMPUS - DAY

           Establishing shot: The age-old red brick sign reads AUBURN 
           UNIVERSITY - Founded 1856. Campus, all brick and clock towers 
           and magnolia trees. 

           KENDRICK walks through the front gates. Makes his way through 
           the quad. Looking around. Taking note of everything. Like 
           anything could be a lead. 

           Students walk by him. Someone BUMPS him. He gets turned 
           around. Like he’s drifting.

           It seems huge. Needle in a haystack. Everything’s easy in 
           theory. Now he’s here. 

           Where to start? 

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - CAROLINA COAST - DAY

           Diane walks through the beginnings of their new home. Right 
           off the coast. Ocean view. Modern. Beautiful. 

           She places the CARPET SAMPLES in the living room. Examines 
           them.
                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Jade. 

           A breeze blows through the house. It’s vast. Expansive. 
           Lonely. 

           INT. AUBURN ATHLETICS - OFFICE - DAY

           ALEXANDRA NOONE - Compliance Officer, 31, no bullshit, sits 
           at her computer typing 200 words per minute. The office is 
           full of cubicles. Upscale but corporate as hell.

           KENDRICK walks in. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Hi... I’m looking for...
                             (looks down at his paper)
                        Alexandra Noone?

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        Yeah, what’s up? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                             (extending his hand)
                        Thomas Kendrick. NCAA. This is your 
                        official notice that we’re opening 
                        up an investigation at Auburn 
                        regarding potentially illegal 
                        recruitment of student-athletes.

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        OK, great. Swanner let us know 
                        someone would be coming.  

           Totally straight-faced. Like she doesn’t even give a shit. 
           Kendrick is immediately awkward. Expected her to flip out.

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE (CONT’D)
                        Follow me. 

           She guides him down the hall... Opens a door in the very 
           back...

           It’s clearly a repurposed closet. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        OK, great. Thanks. 

           This really isn’t going how he expected. 

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE 
                        Make yourself right at home, Mr.

                        Patterson. 

           Noone nods. Plays it cool. But for the first time, Kendrick 
           has played a card that maybe she wasn’t ready for.  

           INT. BIG KENNY’S AUTOMOTIVE DEALER - DAY

           Atticus paces up to the towering glass walls. Auburn gear 
           everywhere. All the ATTENDANTS give him nods of recognition. 

           BIG KENNY - The Mogul, 62, waves from inside. 

           He talks like the happiest guy in the world but you know if 
           you short him even a cent he might kill you. The stature (and 
           temper) of a rhino. 

           Big Kenny runs Auburn. Has sold half the cars in the town. 
           Owns a quarter of the real estate. The cash? It’s all him. 
           There are pictures of Kenny and famous Auburn players, 
           Bissinger, etc. everywhere.  

                                 KENNY
                        Been wondering when the gimp was 
                        going to show his face. 

           Kenny wraps his arm around Atticus’ neck. Brings him in. 

                                 KENNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna need all the details on 
                        how we landed Patterson. You rat 
                        bastard.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I didn’t have anything to do with 
                        that. 

           They make their way into Kenny’s office.

                                 KENNY
                        What are we going to do without you 
                        next year?

                        later this week. Potentially 
                        another in a few. Both are special. 
                        Let’s make sure we get them 
                        something nice. 

           Kenny smiles. Relishing the challenge.

                                 KENNY
                        Patterson?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 KENNY
                        Tell me more about him. My cash go 
                        to good use?

           INTERCUT THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION WITH: 

           EXT. AUBURN PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        He’s special.

           Ricky practicing. Something isn’t right. He’s uncertain in 
           his motion.

           BILL sits in the stands. Watching. Ricky gazes up and notices 
           him. When Bill turns, Ricky looks away immediately. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        Haven’t seen an arm like his in 
                        years. 

           BISSINGER stands behind Ricky as he THROWS...

           The ball misses an open receiver by ten yards. Bissinger 
           looks to the offensive coordinator, TIM PAYTON. Shakes his 
           head. 

           Benny watches. Twists his hands together. 

                                 KENNY (V.O.)
                        Starting?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        If Bissinger is smart he will. 

           Ricky stands alone. No camaraderie with his teammates. He 
           looks out of place. Plays with his hair. 
           INT. BIG KENNY’S AUTOMOTIVE DEALER - DAY

                                 KENNY
                        Let’s not forget who’s paying for 
                        this. Don’t want another bust like 
                        McGuire. Wasted a lot of cash on 
                        that one. 

           Atticus is straight faced as he checks his watch. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Geoff will be by later to pick up 
                        the package.

           SEPTEMBER

           Sweep over the bustling Auburn campus. Game day. Tailgates 
           everywhere. A buzz on campus. Everyone drinking. Beer pong. 
           Keg stands. The band MARCHING through the quad. 

           Opening Day. Two of the best words in sports.

           Toomer’s packed to the brim. Wall to wall with Auburn gear. 

           Thousands of Auburn fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the 
           team as they walk to Jordan–Hare Stadium.

           The sun setting over Jordan-Hare as fans stream in. 

           INT. KENDRICK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           KENDRICK sits alone at his desk. Watching the game on TV. 

                                 ESPN ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        It’s finally here, folks. Welcome 
                        to the kickoff of the 2018 season. 
                        Is Auburn for real with Steve  
                        McGuire at quarterback? ASU will 
                        try and test that tonight at Jordan-
                        Hare. 

           #9 Auburn vs. #24 Arizona State

           A buzz in the stadium. Everyone clad in their best game-day 
           attire. An offseason’s worth of anticipation all building to 
           this moment...

           Auburn comes RUNNING out of the tunnel. Rapturous cheers. 
           Deafening chants of Auburn’s age-old fight song: 

                                 CROWD
                        War Eagle, fly down the field!
                        Ever to conquer, never to yield.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CROWD (CONT'D)
                        War Eagle, fearless and true,
                        Fight on you orange and blue.
                        Go! Go! Go!

           Atticus watches from his seats. Diane stands next to him, the 
           other bag men in the same row. Atticus claps slowly. And then 
           the game begins... 

           GAME HIGHLIGHTS: 

           Auburn scores early... 

           But McGuire throws an INTERCEPTION... 

           And another one...

           HIT after HIT after HIT. Helmets colliding. Players woozy.

           RICKY on the bench. Awful body language. Slouched over. No 
           teammate even close to him. He’s not touching the field.  

           Atticus watches him. Dismayed. He sees who Ricky is looking 
           at... BILL in the stands. Atticus’ wheels start turning.

           Arizona State is driving, down 24 to 17. 

           They’re on the five-yard line, on the verge of a touchdown 
           when --

           FUMBLE. Auburn recovers. Game over. 

           FINAL: Auburn 24, Arizona State 17

                                 ESPN ANALYST
                        Auburn survives a late scare from a 
                        talented Sun Devils team. Not an 
                        impressive night for junior 
                        quarterback Steve McGuire, but 
                        he’ll take the win.

           Atticus shakes his head. Too close for comfort. 

           EXT. AUBURN PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

           Atticus waits outside of the gates as BILL exits. Already 
           decked out in Auburn gear.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Bill. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Atticus... I didn’t see you at 
                        practice.
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I don’t go to practice. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Listen, I’ve been meaning to talk 
                        to you about--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We need Ricky starting.

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                             (relieved)
                        Thank god. I was starting to think 
                        that--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        And that means we need you to take 
                        a step back. Ricky is struggling 
                        with your presence. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        How can you possibly say that with 
                        any--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        When’s the last time you spoke to 
                        him? You have no idea what’s going 
                        through his head. I don’t want to 
                        see you on campus. No more 
                        practices. No more games. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON 
                        I’ve been to every single one of 
                        Ricky’s games since he was just a 
                        kid. Every single game.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        All the games are televised. Campus 
                        security has already been alerted. 
                        You’ll be removed if you set foot 
                        on campus.  

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Now, this isn’t what we agreed to--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’re right. We didn’t agree to 
                        anything.

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        I’m going to report this. What you 
                        did. What you gave us. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I didn’t give you anything. You 
                        found a bag in a field. In fact, a 
                        good standing citizen would have 
                        called the police then and there to 
                        report it. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        You son of a bitch. This isn’t want 
                        we wanted. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No, it’s what Ricky wanted. He 
                        stood in your living room and told 
                        us as much.

           Bill has nowhere left to go. Hangs his head. Defeated. 

           INT. AUBURN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR OFFICE - EVENING

           A beautiful office, overlooking the quad. Big oak desk. 
           Mahogany. That sort of thing. Reis’ ASSISTANT leads Atticus 
           into the room. Waits by the door as he’s seated. 

           BARRY REIS - ATHLETIC DIRECTOR sits behind the desk. Half 
           moon glasses. A nice suit. Professional hand shaker and 
           hobnobber. He has one job: raise money. He does it well. 

           NOONE sits on the other side of the desk. One chair 
           unoccupied next to her. Like it was waiting for Atticus. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        Mr. Archer. So good to see you. I 
                        want to start by thanking you for 
                        your generous donation to the 
                        program, we couldn’t --

           Reis’ assistant shuts the door. He immediately stops with the 
           bullshit. 

                                 BARRY REIS (CONT’D)
                        Is Patterson clean?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Define clean. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        Did he take money?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (fucking with them)
                        From who?
                                 BARRY REIS
                        God dammit, Atticus. The fucking 
                        agent his Dad talked to. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No. He’s clean where he needs to 
                        be. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        How the hell did the press get 
                        their hands on that email? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Someone found it.

                                 BARRY REIS
                        Heard his Dad’s been to every 
                        practice. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I handled it. 

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        Good. He’s raising eyebrows. For 
                        obvious reasons. Ruffle feathers in 
                        Tuscaloosa, people are gonna come 
                        looking. NCAA has someone on 
                        campus.“Collecting information.”

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        What’d you say?

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        Nothing. Gave him the closet and 
                        left. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good. Things are taken care of. 
                        They don’t have shit.

                                 BARRY REIS
                        How can you possibly know that? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Because if they had anything, we’d 
                        already be fucked. It’s my job to 
                        make sure that they don’t. Nothing 
                        either of you has said scares me. 
                        The NCAA has reps on campus? So 
                        what? They can come sleep in my 
                        guest room for all I care. You’re 
                        forgetting the golden rule: it’s 
                        not the crime we need to hide, it’s 
                        the evidence.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT'D)
                        You show me a shred of evidence, 
                        then I’ll worry. Until then, do 
                        your jobs. I’ll do mine.

           Reis and Noone say nothing.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Who’d they send? Do we know him?

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        No. Some guy named Thomas Kendrick. 
                        This is all we have...  

           Noone hands him a file. Atticus opens it. A black and white 
           photocopy of Kendrick’s ID Badge. Atticus sees Kendrick’s 
           picture. THE GUY FROM SIGNING DAY.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        God dammit.

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        What?

           Atticus is never surprised. Maybe a split second of disbelief 
           on his face. If that. Then: calm. Collected. Like always.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Never trust someone that tells you 
                        losing 49-14 was the best day of 
                        their life. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        You know him?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I didn’t think so. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        They want to start with Patterson. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        They’re not starting with 
                        Patterson. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        What, we’re just going to tell them 
                        no? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        That’s exactly what we’re going to 
                        tell them. But you’re going to doll 
                        it up with your bullshit rhetoric. 
                             (pauses)
                        I need some time to think. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT'D)
                        Hold them off on Patterson. I’ll 
                        work with him when the time comes. 

           Atticus begins to get up. Has to stop. His leg hurting. Tries 
           again. Gets it this time. Reis and Noone say nothing.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be in touch. Keep me apprised. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                        How’s the house coming? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It’s coming great, Barry. Thanks 
                        for fucking asking. 

           Reis opens the door, has to fake nice and bullshit in front 
           of the assistant again.

                                 BARRY REIS
                        That sounds swell, Mr. Archer. You 
                        have a nice day now, and make sure 
                        you send Diane our regards.

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS' CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus speeds down the Southern highway. Dials on BURNER. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Get Geoff in.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Ronnie stands in a nearly empty parking lot. We can’t tell 
           where he is... yet. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Something wrong?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Just get Geoff in. 

           Not messing around. Ronnie dials. 

           EXT. SOUTHERN FIELD - NIGHT 

           A dark and barren field. GEOFF pulls up. Exits the car. And 
           out of the backseat... RICKY.

                                 GEOFF
                        Follow me. 
           They push through the grass... Waiting for them... 

           A BRAND NEW LEXUS. 

                                 GEOFF (CONT’D)
                        Here she is. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Holy shit.

                                 GEOFF
                        Anyone asks, it was a gift from 
                        your uncle. Paid in all cash. No 
                        receipts. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Yes, sir. 

           They both pace around the car. Taking it in. Geoff notices 
           that the back plate still has the BIG KENNY frame around it.

                                 GEOFF
                        Let’s get this off. 

           Geoff kneels down and begins to unscrew the frame. Just as he 
           does-- HIS PHONE RINGS. He checks it. Ronnie. 

                                 GEOFF (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, I gotta take this. 
                             (handing him the 
                              screwdriver)
                        Make sure you take that off. You 
                        good to get back?

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Yeah.  

                                 GEOFF
                        Call if there’s a problem. 

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS' CAR - NIGHT

           Geoff is in. Driving away from Ricky.  

           THREE SPLIT SCREENS. All three in different locations, all 
           three working towards the same cause. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Sorry, just dropped the package for 
                        Patterson. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        NCAA is on campus. 
                                 GEOFF
                        Fuck! Who? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Thomas Kendrick. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Who??

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Don’t know much. Used to play. 
                        North Texas.

           Ronnie and Geoff both laugh. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I already have my guy looking into 
                        it. Will have more for you soon. 

                                 GEOFF
                        This about Patterson?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Has to be. They don’t have anything 
                        though. Not yet.

                                 RONNIE
                        You sure? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Ever been arrested? 

                                 RONNIE
                        Twice.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Did the cops call to tell you they 
                        were gonna arrest you, or did they 
                        just do it? 

           Ronnie and Geoff silently acknowledge. Point taken.

                                 GEOFF
                        What’s the plan?
                             (a long pause)
                        Atticus?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Ship still sails. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Don’t think we should lay low for a 
                        few weeks? 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Can’t. 

                                 GEOFF
                        You sure? Don’t want to end up like 
                        Bama. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Yes. We’re still on for Fluker. 
                        Ronnie, is everything in order?

                                 RONNIE
                        Yup. Securing the location as we 
                        speak. 

           We pull back to see that Ronnie is IN A ZAXBY’S.

           INT. RICKY’S PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 

           Ricky pulls into his parking spot. Gets out of the car. He 
           admires his new ride. It’s really fucking nice. He’s 18... 
           never had anything close to this. 

           He kneels down to the license plate. Reaches out to unscrew 
           the BIG KENNY frame as--

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Yo, Patterson. Nice ride. 

           CONNORS walks up from the shadows of the garage. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Hey... Tyler. What’s... what’s up?

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Thought we could kick it for a bit. 
                        Get to know each other better. 

           Finally. Ricky’s been waiting for this moment. He can’t hide 
           his smile. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They walk down the halls of Ricky’s building. Connors isn’t 
           saying anything. The whole place is dark. Starting to feel a 
           little weird. 

           Ricky reaches for his keys as they get to his door. He 
           FUMBLES them to the ground. Reaches down. Picks them back up. 
           Looks to Connors, who nods. No big. Ricky unlocks the door...
           They enter his apartment. It’s pitch black. As he turns on 
           the light-- 

           HALF THE TEAM is crowded into the room. Ricky is taken aback.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Guys... hey. What’s up? 

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                             (overly friendly)
                        We just wanted to stop by. Feel 
                        like you’ve been quiet at practice. 
                        Get to know the best quarterback in 
                        the country a little better. You 
                        are the best quarterback in the 
                        country...
                             (looks him in the eye)
                        You said you could start, didn’t 
                        you?

           Ricky takes a step back, only to be pushed forward by a big 
           LINEBACKER.

                                 TYLER CONNORS (CONT’D)
                        Look me in the eye. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Sorry, I... is everything ok? 

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        OK? Everything is great, buddy. 
                        Why, is something wrong?

           Ricky looks to his teammates, hoping to find an answer. He 
           doesn’t. Starts to twist his hair around his finger. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS (CONT’D)
                        You like doing that, huh? Messing 
                        with your hair?

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I...

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        See, the rest of us have shaved 
                        heads. Keeps us close. Everyone’s 
                        on the same level, you know? 

           Murmurs from the other players. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS (CONT’D)
                        That’s something you want, right? 
                        To be a part of the team?
                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Yeah... yeah, of course.

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                             (smiling)
                        Great. 

           The linebacker grabs Ricky. PUTS HIM IN A HEADLOCK. Connors 
           reaches behind his back to reveal...

           A RAZOR. Everyone starts to CHEER. The player holding him 
           TIGHTENS his grip. Ricky squirms.

           The BUZZ of the razor gets everyone cheering even louder. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Guys st--

           THEY START SHAVING HIS HEAD. He struggles at first. Tries to 
           fight it. But it’s no use. He gives in. Long blonde locks 
           fall from his scalp.

           HAIR ALL OVER THE FLOOR. The linebacker tightens his grip. 
           Ricky twists his head, trying to avoid the metal. No use...  

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        Stop!! 

           He continues to resist. Tries to break free again. Connors 
           goes back in with the razor. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        Please!!

           And then the razor stops. The room silent in anticipation...

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Let’s see. 

           Ricky tilts his head up. ALMOST COMPLETELY BALD. Patches of 
           hair still remaining from the sloppy shave. Uneven. He looks 
           awful. Like a different person. Like a little boy. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Auburn. 

           INT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ricky stares into the mirror. He’s shaved the rest of his 
           head. Completely bald. Scalp scratched.

           He removes his phone. Goes to call “DAD”. His finger hovers 
           over the name... ready to call... but... 
           He slaps a row of HAIR PRODUCTS off the shelf below.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        FUCK!

           He SMASHES the mirror. Blood oozes down his clenched fist. 
           Drips to the floor. Lands on the discarded bottles of gel. 
           Close on the blood. 

           INT./EXT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - DAY

           We’re not in Old Town anymore. This is the real South. The 
           grass overgrown, houses small... few and far between. It 
           feels unwatched... dangerous... 

           Because, really, none of us are safe. At any second a man can 
           come knocking at door and change everything. 

           KNOCK. KNOCK. 

           Ms. Fluker opens the door to find ATTICUS standing outside 
           with RONNIE and GEOFF. They have a CAR FULL OF ZAXBY’S. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We were in the neighborhood. Mind 
                        if we join you?

           She can’t believe it. Shakes her head. That mother fucker. 

           INT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - DAY

           Atticus walks in. It’s a tiny house. Hard to believe they fit 
           four in it. 

           Chance walks in. He looks bigger than the living room. He’s 
           trailed by his TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Chance. It’s an honor to finally 
                        meet you. My name’s Atticus. And 
                        who’s that behind you?

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Boys.

           Chance’s brothers step out and wave. Shy. 

           Ronnie and Geoff go back and forth between the car and the 
           table, setting bag after bag of Zaxby’s on the table. It’s an 
           absolute feast. Will feed the Flukers for at least a week. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Shall we eat? 

           Everyone sits. An expectant silence as they watch Atticus.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Chance, let me start with this...
                             (an expectant pause)
                        I believe in Auburn Tigers 
                        Football. 

           And so it begins.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY 

           Diane sits in the pew of a large SOUTHERN CHURCH. A 
           congregation of hundreds. Everyone dressed up. 

           She looks around. Everyone else is there with their 
           significant other. Or their family. Their children. Holding 
           hands. Everyone but her.

           EXT. AUBURN PRACTICE FIELD - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           KENDRICK is outside the practice fields, in the parking lot, 
           scanning the cars...

           An entire row of upscale LEXUS’S....

           He crouches down, looking at the plates. Continues down the 
           row. One catches his eye in particular...

           A frame reading BIG KENNY’S LEXUS.

           RICKY NEVER TOOK THE FRAME OFF.

           EXT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - PORCH - EVENING

           Atticus stands with Ms. Fluker, watching Chance play touch 
           football with his brothers. His joy is undeniable.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Chance is a good kid.

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        He’s a good boy. He is. There’s no 
                        reason he should be. Not in this 
                        world.
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        At Auburn we believe that good 
                        things should happen to good 
                        people. That’s all. It doesn’t have 
                        to be about anything else. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I appreciate that, Mr. Archer, but 
                        we’re going to make this decision 
                        together. You can come over here 
                        everyday if you want. It’s not 
                        going to change things. 

           Atticus bites his lip. There has to be a way. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You don’t need to take the bus 
                        everyday. It doesn’t have to be 
                        like that. That car that we brought 
                        the food in? We can leave it here. 
                        You can forget the bus. You can 
                        forget waiting on the corner in the 
                        rain.  

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I’m willing to ride the bus every 
                        day if it means that Chance is 
                        going to make it. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It won’t be traced back to you. We 
                        have it taken care of. 
                             (off her hard gaze)
                        Your son should be getting paid. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        He’s going to get paid. When he’s 
                        in the NFL.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The NCAA is robbing you. All I’m 
                        trying to do is make it right. 

           Chance and the boys come running up to the porch. 

                                 CHANCE’S LITTLE BROTHER
                        Can we have more? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You can have as much as you’d like.

           This is a sentence he’s never heard. Ms. Fluker twists her 
           mouth. A bit uncomfortable. But it feels good. To not worry. 
           To not be hungry. To have what you want and need. 
           The boys smile as they race each other through the door and 
           back to the table. 

           Chance hesitates for a moment. He’s watching the car. Atticus 
           takes note. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        We’ll come for a game. One game. 
                        That’s it.

           Atticus smiles. She’s cracking. Slowly but surely. They 
           always do. 

           The sun sets over the house. It’s easy to believe that this 
           might all work out.

           INT. BIG KENNY'S AUTOMOTIVE DEALER - NIGHT

           Atticus pulls the car he brought to the Flukers’ into the 
           dealership lot. KENNY waiting for him. 

                                 BIG KENNY
                        What happened?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        She didn’t go for it. 

                                 BIG KENNY
                        Shit. You losing your magic? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        She’ll get there. They’re coming 
                        for Ole Miss.

                                 BIG KENNY
                        Damn. Big game. Didn’t want to 
                        schedule them for a cupcake 
                        matchup?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re not going to lose to Ole 
                        Miss. 

                                 BIG KENNY
                        Fair enough.
                             (leans in, whispers)
                        I hear the NCAA is on campus? 
                        Snooping around? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You get the #1 recruit in the 
                        country, that’s going to happen. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT'D)
                        I have my guy on it. Going to see 
                        him now, actually.

                                 BIG KENNY
                        I thought I was your guy. 

           Atticus cracks the slightest smile. Checks his watch. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (re: the car)
                        Keep this one close. I have a 
                        feeling it won’t be long until we 
                        need it. 

           Kenny smiles. Music to his ears.

           EXT. BIG KENNY’S AUTOMOTIVE DEALER - NIGHT

           Atticus walks out of the dealership and back to his own car. 
           He checks his watch. We linger. To see -- 

           KENDRICK is watching. He’s staked out in the parking lot 
           across the street. Again: he sees the LIMP. 

           Takes in the sight. Measured. The towering glass walls of Big 
           Kenny’s Lexus. You can’t miss it. He smiles. He has 
           something. 

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           A diner on the edge of the universe. The outskirts of town. 
           Street lights flicker on and off over the parking lot.

           Atticus pushes open the double door entrance. He looks 
           around. Finds his guy, which is an interesting way to 
           describe--

           RACHEL UPCHURCH.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Ms. Upchurch.

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        When is Patterson going to start? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (coy)
                        Ask Bissinger. I have nothing to do 
                        with roster decisions.
                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        You’d tell me if you needed me to 
                        know. Such is the nature of our 
                        relationship.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        What’d you get for me? 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Two egg scramblers and chocolate 
                        milk.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I don’t have time for theatrics. 

           Upchurch smiles. Not many people can fuck with Atticus like 
           this. She uses it to the fullest. Removes a FILE.

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Thomas Kendrick. Played four years 
                        at North Texas before joining the 
                        NCAA. He’s been working in their 
                        office for almost twenty years. 
                        Administrative assistant, then 
                        special assistant to Sarah Swanner, 
                        and then coordinator. Until now.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Bullshit titles. They sent a paper 
                        pusher to investigate the #1 
                        recruit in the country. Doesn’t add 
                        up. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        There is something.

           Atticus raises his eyebrow. Intrigued.

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH (CONT’D)
                        He was supposed to go to Alabama. 
                        Got caught taking money. Ended up 
                        at North Texas.

           Atticus nods his head. Now, it’s adding up.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You could have led with that by the 
                        way. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Don’t be an asshole.

           The waitress places a GLASS OF CHOCOLATE MILK on the table. 
           Atticus takes a long sip. 
                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH (CONT’D)
                        You’re nervous aren’t you? You’re 
                        scared of this guy. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No. I’m not. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        I’ve seen you pushed before, but 
                        this is different. This is fear. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Just keep working on this guy. And 
                        make sure the NCAA doesn’t--

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        What bothers you about the NCAA so 
                        much? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Like I said, I don’t have time 
                        for...

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Come on.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It’a an agency for self-
                        preservation, not for change. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Someone has to protect the 
                        “integrity” of the game. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        When the NCAA was established, no 
                        one knew college football was going 
                        to be a billion-dollar sport. Now 
                        it is. The only reason the NCAA 
                        still fucking exists is to make 
                        sure that money is channelled right 
                        past the players and back into 
                        their pocket. Protecting the 
                        integrity of the game? Bull shit. 
                        They’re establishing committees to 
                        tell players they can’t eat an 
                        extra serving of pasta. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Player compensation is a 
                        complicated argument. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Do you get paid for working? 
                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Of course. But I also worked plenty 
                        of unpaid gigs to get to where I...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How many hours? Players work 80. At 
                        least. Auburn athletics made $147.5 
                        million last year. The NCAA made 
                        almost a billion. You think that 
                        was from the baseball team? Who 
                        generates that revenue? The

                        The players.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The players. Come on. Minimum wage 
                        in Alabama is $7.25. That’s 15k per 
                        year per player. No one is asking 
                        for a fortune. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        What about their scholarships? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        When the school purposely puts them 
                        in bullshit classes? How much is a 
                        degree in Communications from 
                        Auburn worth?

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        I majored in Communications.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Exactly. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Fine. If it’s as bad as you say 
                        then go on the record with me. Burn 
                        the whole thing down. The system. 
                        The NCAA. All of it.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Not going to happen.

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Why? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Because then the program goes down 
                        too. 
                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        Is the program really worth it? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (checking his watch)
                        Of course it is. And as much as I 
                        would love to sit here reviewing 
                        freshman economics all night... I 
                        have to go. 

           The WAITRESS approaches the table. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Split bill?

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH
                        He’s got it. 

           Atticus shakes his head as he reaches for his wallet.

           Kendrick is sitting alone in his office. The radio on. His

                        Auburn is lucky to be 3-0. If they 
                        play like that against Ole Miss 
                        this weekend? No chance. And, 
                        listen... you know what I’m going 
                        to say.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Patterson. McGuire still doesn’t 
                        look like a championship 
                        quarterback. This is the time to 
                        get Patterson reps. 

           He Googles ATTICUS ARCHER, AUBURN.

           Diane and Atticus’ wedding announcement. Kendrick takes note 
           of Diane. Keeps clicking. Nothing else interesting. Until -- 

           An old newspaper article. Headline: Auburn drops star recruit 
           after leg injury. Kendrick continues reading. Intrigued.  

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Star recruit headed for North Texas after scandal. 
           Atticus reads an old article on his computer. A blurry photo 
           of Kendrick outside his house with his father. Head bowed. 

           Atticus pulls highlights from the Auburn vs. North Texas 
           game.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        What a catch by Kendrick! 

           Atticus pauses. Rewinds. Kendrick SPRINTS across the middle 
           of the field, reels in a wild throw, evades two defenders. 
           It’s impressive tape. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        North Texas may not be ahead on the 
                        scoreboard, but this performance is 
                        one of the most memorable I’ve ever 
                        seen considering the talent gap 
                        between these teams. 

           Close on the paused screen. Kendrick’s green uniform blurry. 

           EXT. AUBURN CAMPUS - QUAD - EVENING

           #5 Auburn vs. #8 Ole Miss

           We sweep over the Auburn Campus. It’s pure madness. Game-day 
           turned up to 11. Absolutely packed. 

           The ESPN College GameDay set. Crazy fans behind the stage. It 
           appears that every human on campus is intoxicated. Everyone 
           but--

           ATTICUS, who is laser focused as he makes his way through the 
           chaos of the tailgaters, DIANE next to him. He types on 
           BURNER.

           EXT. AUBURN ATHLETIC FACILITY - DAY 

           BENNY is with the FLUKERS, giving them the tour of campus. He 
           looks down as his phone vibrates. 

           A text from GRANDMA NANCY: “Meet at players’ entrance in 20”.

           EXT. JORDAN-HARE STADIUM - NIGHT

           Atticus and Diane come pacing up to the front gates of Jordan-
           Hare. It’s massive this close. Its walls towering over them. 

           Atticus looks around. Finally spots-- THE FLUKERS. Atticus 
           smiles. Waves. Makes his way over. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How’s everything look so far?

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Amazing. 

           Chance is showing genuine emotion. Atticus has him. But, it’s 
           not Chance he has to worry about...

           Ms. Fluker is stoic. Not giving any sign of emotion or 
           excitement. All business. She’s still not cracking. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        This is my wife, Diane. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve 
                        heard so much about you, Chance.
                             (looking at Ms. Fluker)
                        What a beautiful family you have. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Thank you. 

           Atticus bites his lip. Come on.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’re going to see something 
                        special tonight. You ever 
                        experience an atmosphere like this?

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        No, sir.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I didn’t think so. 
                             (reaching into his coat)
                        Your field passes. Enjoy the view.

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Come on, Chance. 

           Atticus nods. Not what he was hoping for.

           We pull back... Winding through the throng of fans lining up 
           outside the gates...

           KENDRICK is watching the conversation. Takes note of Atticus 
           talking with... Benny. Who the hell is that?
           INT./EXT. JORDAN-HARE STADIUM - NIGHT

           Fans pile into the stadium. It’s loud. A buzz from the 
           alcohol and the magnitude of the game. A cocktail you can’t 
           order from any bar. 

           Chance and Ms. Fluker walk onto the field... an amazing view. 
           There’s no feeling like walking out of the tunnel. 

                                 ESPN ANALYST (V.O.)
                        What a treat we have for you 
                        tonight. Two of the best teams in 
                        the country squaring off for 
                        supremacy in the South. 

           The sky is cotton candy as the game kicks off, the stadium 
           electric. SEC football at it’s finest. 

           Highlights from the first half: 

           A defensive struggle. Hardly any positive plays. Running up 
           the gut. Sacks. It’s ugly. 

           KEVIN BOLDEN, the 5-star Auburn dropped for Ricky, is making 
           plays for Ole Miss. 

                                 ESPN ANALYST (V.O.)
                        Neither team opens the game 
                        particularly strong. We expected a 
                        defensive struggle, and that’s 
                        exactly what we have. At the half: 
                        Auburn 6, Ole Miss 7. 

           Diane and Atticus watch as the players make their way to the 
           locker rooms for halftime.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Do you want anything? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No. I’m OK.

           He stretches his leg as he stands. It’s hurting. But he’s 
           focused on one thing-- 

           FLUKER. He watches carefully as Chance and his mother pace 
           the sidelines. He’s nervous. They can’t lose this game. 

           INT. AUBURN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           The Auburn players slump into the locker room. Completely 
           gassed after a grueling half. 
           Coaches yelling. SLAMMING lockers. They can’t lose this game. 
           Payton approaches Bissinger. Guides him behind the lockers. 

                                 TIM PAYTON
                        Coach. Do you want to give 
                        Patterson a run?

                                 BISSINGER
                        We’re sticking with McGuire. 

                                 TIM PAYTON
                        We have 80 total yards.

                                 BISSINGER
                        You’re the one calling the plays. 
                        Figure it the fuck out. McGuire is 
                        our quarterback.

                                 TIM PAYTON
                        Got it. Anything else?  

                                 BISSINGER
                        Yeah, stop running the fucking ball 
                        on 3rd and 8.

           INT. JORDAN-HARE STADIUM - NIGHT

           SECOND HALF HIGHLIGHTS

           Auburn scores quickly, going up 13-7.... 

           Ole Miss rallies back. A long pass.  Touchdown. BOLDEN. He 
           runs right in front of the Auburn student section and spreads 
           his arms wide in celebration. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Fucking Bolden. God dammit. 

           Checks his watch. 

           17-13 Ole Miss. Two minutes left. Auburn is driving. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        One drive, Steve.

           Bissinger on the sideline with McGuire. Screaming. Red in the 
           face. 

                                 BISSINGER
                        Take care of the ball! We have 
                        time! 

           McGuire nods, runs back to the huddle.
                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        I got it. 

           Auburn drives up the field. McGuire makes a couple nice 
           passes to get them in the red zone. And --

           He’s intercepted. A GASP from the stadium. 

           Ole Miss KNEELS. Game over. Their players are going crazy. A 
           huge win. Bolden sprinting in celebration. The sweetest 
           revenge. Atticus stands in shock. Diane rubs his shoulder. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I’m sorry, honey. 

           Atticus says nothing. Stares in anger. Geoff slumped in his 
           seat, head in his hands. 

                                 RONNIE
                        That could be it. 

           FINAL: Ole Miss 17, Auburn 13

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Atticus is watching highlights from the game. Another look at 
           McGuire’s interception. Atticus rewinds the tape. Watches it 
           again. And again. 

           Flips to SportsCenter... Bissinger’s press conference: 

                                 BISSINGER
                        If Ricky Patterson was ready to 
                        start, he’d be starting. He’s not, 
                        so he’s not. 

           Bites his lip. 

                                 BISSINGER (CONT’D)
                        McGuire is our quarterback. That’s 
                        all I have to say.

           Close on Atticus, the blue light from the television bathing 
           his emotionless face. 

           He picks up BURNER.... 

           INT. QUIXOTE’S - NIGHT

           A shitty college bar that’s revered exactly for that reason. 
           Neon lights. Neon drinks. They give you the same headache. 
           MCGUIRE stands at the bar with his GIRLFRIEND, 20. Let’s just 
           say he’s not getting the star quarterback treatment. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Could we get a fucking drink 
                        please?

           A DRUNK GUY approaches him. 

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        Hey, McGuire! You suck, bro! 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                             (shaking his head)
                        Thanks, man. Have a good night. 

                                 DRUNK GUY
                             (gets even closer)
                        Bartender! Kick this guy out! I’d 
                        say throw him out, but he’d be 
                        intercepted. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Yo, get out of here.

           McGuire gives him a little shove, pushing him away.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        You serious??

           McGuire gives him another shove, and the drunk guy pushes 
           back. Hard. He winds his arm...

                        Auburn last night, as quarterback 
                        Steve McGuire’s jaw was broken in 
                        an altercation at a local bar. No 
                        word yet as to --

           OVER BLACK

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        I didn’t even hit him that hard. 
                        Never seen a jaw break so easily.
           EXT. AUBURN - BACK YARD - NIGHT

           REVEAL: Geoff is talking to the DRUNK GUY from the bar. He 
           passes him a handful of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

                                 GEOFF
                        That’s the first half. The second 
                        comes after you keep your mouth 
                        shut.

           The drunk guy counts the bills. Stuffs them in his pocket, 
           satisfied. 

                                 FOX SPORTS ANALYST (V.O.)
                        This means that the mantle of 
                        quarterback now belongs to freshman 
                        phenom Ricky Patterson. 

           SFX: BUZZZZZZZZZZZZ

           INT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The TV is on, but the room is empty. The Fox Sports reporter 
           talking to a vacant couch. 

           BUZZZZZZZZ

           We slowly snake around the corner to see--

           Ricky standing in front of his mirror. SHAVING HIS HEAD. 
           Straight-faced. Close on the reflection of his eyes as the 
           cold metal slides across his scalp. 

           EXT. BEN HILL GRIFFIN STADIUM - NIGHT

           A sweeping overhead view of Florida’s stadium. “The Swamp”. 
           You can feel the humidity from hundreds of miles away. 98 
           degrees at kick. Sun pouring down on the plastic seats. 

           The stadium is rocking, Gator blue and orange everywhere.

           #14 Auburn vs. #8 Florida 

           Atticus walks the sideline as the team warms up. He focuses 
           on Patterson, launching balls in warmups. Bissinger STARES at 
           him from across the field.

           EXT. BEN HILL GRIFFIN STADIUM - NIGHT

           Atticus reaches his seats. Stands with Diane and the other 
           bag men. 
                                 ESPN ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        And here we go. All eyes on the 
                        freshman quarterback as he steps 
                        into the Auburn huddle for the 
                        first time.

           Patterson takes the first snap. Steps back. And --

           TOUCHDOWN. 

           A 70-yard bomb. He runs up the field celebrating. The team’s 
           going crazy. Bissinger turns to Payton. Raises his eyebrows. 
           “Holy shit”. 

           HIGHLIGHTS

           Patterson continues to light it up. Auburn dominates. 

           Bissinger watching Patterson run the huddle from the 
           sidelines. He turns to the OC. 

                                 BISSINGER
                        What the fuck is this? That’s not 
                        what we called. He’s calling his 
                        own plays. 

           Payton smiles as Patterson launches another pass. Shrugs his 
           shoulders. 

                                 BISSINGER (CONT’D)
                        That son of a bitch. 

           FINAL: AUBURN 35, FLORIDA 7

                                 ESPN ANNOUNCER
                        A shocker in Gainesville tonight. 
                        After Steve McGuire goes down with 
                        the broken jaw, Ricky Patterson 
                        sets a record for touchdowns by a 
                        true freshman quarterback in their 
                        first start. What else can you say 
                        but... wow. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           The team WHOOPING and HOLLERING, basking in victory. Music 
           blasting. As Patterson removes his pads, he’s approached by 
           CONNORS. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Yo, Freshman. Why don’t you come 
                        out with us tonight? Help us 
                        celebrate.
           Ricky smiles. 

           INT. QUIXOTE’S - NIGHT

           That EXACT SAME SMILE as everyone lifts Ricky up, passes him 
           across the room and onto the bar. 

           BIG KENNY walks in, a string of GIRLS following him.

                                 KENNY
                        Time to celebrate boys. 

           The bartender tosses Ricky a bottle of champagne.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Let’s fucking go!!!

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                             (shouting over the chaos 
                              of the bar)
                        YO! Think we got off on the wrong 
                        foot. What we did... That was cold.  

           Ricky processes the apology. And just when we expect him to 
           gloat... 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Never liked it anyway. Made me look 
                        like a girl. Cheers, bro!

           The grin that crosses his face tells us one thing: Little 
           Ricky Patterson is gone. He pops the bottle and sprays it 
           everywhere. Looks at his teammates.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        We’re fucking kings. 

           And we see it in his eyes. He believes it.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           The pews packed. Sunday mass. The high walls of the church 
           echoing THE PREACHER’S sermon. Atticus and Diane sit in one 
           of the front rows.

                                 PREACHER
                        No one can serve two masters, for 
                        either he will hate one and love 
                        the other, or he will be devoted to 
                        the one and despise the other. 
           A VIBRATION. Atticus reaches for his pocket. It’s BURNER. He 
           slowly removes it. Has a text from UPCHURCH: “Wow.” Atticus 
           goes to respond... 

           Diane elbows him. “Don’t.” Atticus bites his lip. Puts burner 
           back in his pocket. IT VIBRATES AGAIN. Another text. BENNY: 
           “CALL ME.”

           HE GETS UP. Makes his way out of the row. Passing at least 
           ten people as he does.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (under his breath)
                        Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. 

                                 PREACHER
                             (continuing with his 
                              sermon)
                        A man cannot serve both God and 
                        money.

           The congregation turns as Atticus walks down the center aisle 
           to the front door of the church and out to --

           EXT. CHURCH - FRONT GARDEN - DAY

           He traipses outside. Opens a text from BENNY. A link. He 
           clicks it and opens an ESPN VIDEO:

                        Remember Ricky Patterson lighting 
                        it up down in Florida on Saturday 
                        night? Exclusive footage to ESPN 
                        shows Patterson enjoying himself 
                        after the game. 

           Blurry cell phone footage from Quixote’s. Patterson stands on 
           top of the bar, dousing the crowd with champagne. 

                                 ESPN ANALYST
                        Remember, Patterson is a true

                        I’m sure that was just juice in 
                        there.

           Both analysts laugh. Atticus stares in disbelief. The 
           laughter continues. It’s interrupted by an incoming call: 
           ALEXANDRA NOONE.
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (answering)
                        Yeah. I saw it. 

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        Saw what? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The footage of Ricky. 

                                 ALEXANDRA NOONE
                        Oh. We have a bigger problem than 
                        that. NCAA wants to interview Ricky 
                        this week. Can’t hold them off any 
                        longer. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (recalibrating)
                        OK. We knew this day was coming. 
                        I’ll work with him. 

           Hangs up. Checks his watch. Paces back into--

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           The PREACHER is finishing his sermon as Atticus returns to 
           his seat.

                                 PREACHER
                        And, of course, let’s pray for our 
                        Tigers next week. God has placed 
                        quite a few obstacles in their way 
                        of late, but let’s pray that Coach 
                        Bissinger will rise above to face 
                        the challenges ahead. 

           CHEERS from the congregation. Diane looks at Atticus.  

           INT. RICKY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Atticus KNOCKS on the door. It opens just a CRACK. Ricky 
           peeks out. Surprised to see Atticus. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Mr. Archer... 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Can I come in? 

           Ricky opens the door. Atticus surveys the apartment. The 
           place is a mess. Empty bottles everywhere. The remnants of an 
           after party. 
           A guy walks out of the bedroom holding a GIANT BONG.

                                 BONG GUY
                        Yo, Ricky. You doing another hit?
                             (he notices Atticus)
                        Oh, what’s up man?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good evening.

           Bong Guy awkwardly retreats back to his room. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        You need to get ahold of yourself. 
                        First start went well. I get it. 
                        We’re all excited. Don’t let that 
                        jeopardize what’s ahead. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I know. I’m sorry... I... got 
                        caught up in the moment. 

           Ricky’s starting to get nervous. He instinctively reaches his 
           finger up... goes to twist it in his hair. There’s nothing 
           there.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        NCAA is starting their interviews 
                        this week. You’re at the top of 
                        their list. Nothing to worry about, 
                        but we need to get you ready.

           Ricky’s really getting nervous. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        These things all go according to a 
                        script.
                             (as he sits down)
                        Luckily, I know the script. 

           INTERCUT INTERVIEW SCENES:

           INT. RICKY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Atticus sits across from Ricky. Coaching him.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        They’re gonna sit you down in one 
                        of the empty athletic offices. It 
                        will be you and the agent. A tape 
                        recorder on the table. Probably one 
                        light on. They start with the same 
                        question every time.
           INT. ATHLETIC FACILITY - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The room is EXACTLY how Atticus described it. Kendrick sits 
           across from RICKY. 

           As nervous as Ricky is, Kendrick is showing some nerves as 
           well. This is what he’s been waiting for. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Tell me about your recruitment to 
                        Auburn. You had an official in-home 
                        visit, but went with Bama anyway.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        The visit was great. Bissinger and 
                        Benny were really nice. But I was 
                        committed to Bama. That’s where my 
                        Dad wanted me. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Clearly. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        My Dad made a mistake. But we 
                        didn’t do anything illegal. He 
                        never took anything.
                             (chip on his shoulder)
                        Went with the school that wanted 
                        me. Welcomed me with open arms. 
                        Auburn was always in my top 3. 
                             (really big chip on his 
                              shoulder)
                        You can check. 

           The room has shifted. Ricky’s confident. 

           INT. RICKY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Second question can vary, it 
                        depends on the benefit in question. 
                        I’m guessing he’ll be asking about 
                        Big Kenny.

                                 KENDRICK
                        What can you tell me about Big 
                        Kenny’s Lexus? 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        That’s where I got my car. 
                                 KENDRICK
                        Paid for all in cash. By your 
                        uncle. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        That’s right. 

           Kendrick nods. Interesting. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Last question: will you consent to 
                        letting the NCAA access you and 
                        your family’s bank records?

           INT. RICKY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The bank records. Always the last 
                        question. Here’s the secret: they 
                        don’t need your permission. They’ll 
                        get a warrant and do it anyway. So 
                        just say yes. 

           INT. ATHLETIC FACILITY - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Ricky nods. He’s ready. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Of course.

           Kendrick bites his lip. Interview over. Ricky begins to get 
           up--

                                 KENDRICK
                        Actually, I have one more for you. 

           Off Ricky, who’s immediately showing nerves again -- 

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        What’s your relationship with 
                        Atticus Archer?

           SHIT. Ricky’s floored. Deer in the headlights. Stutters. 

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        Do you need me to repeat the 
                        question?

                                 RICKY PATTERSON 
                             (voice shaky)
                        I... don’t know who that is.
           Kendrick stares at him. Fire in his eyes. Are you sure?

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Atticus paces down the hallways of upscale student 
           apartments. He stops in front of a single door: 811. Looks 
           around. No one else in sight. 

           He KNOCKS. Waits. The door slowly opens to reveal --

           MCGUIRE. Jaw wired shut. He beckons Atticus in. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How’s the jaw? 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Broken. 

           They sit in silence. Atticus taking a moment to collect his 
           thoughts, choosing his words carefully. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I know... I know things didn’t work 
                        out the way we hoped, but that 
                        doesn’t mean you failed. Doesn’t 
                        mean you aren’t a talented player, 
                        and, more importantly, a quality 
                        person.

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Really easy to say now that you 
                        have a starting quarterback. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Steve. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Don’t fucking “Steve” me. I was 
                        Ricky Patterson before there was 
                        Ricky Patterson. Remember how badly 
                        you wanted me? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The way you performed isn’t my 
                        fault. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        I wasn’t given a fair chance! What 
                        happened to that loyalty you 
                        preached?? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVE MCGUIRE (CONT'D)
                        You sat in my living room... looked 
                        me and my family in the eyes. Told 
                        us all the great things we were 
                        going to do together. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We gave you two years! Look what 
                        Ricky’s doing in one start. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Ricky’s an asshole! How do you not 
                        see that? I don’t care how well 
                        he’s played. We have guys on this 
                        team - guys who are going to make 
                        millions--  who have raped girls. 
                        Who steal shit. Who are high off 
                        their ass every fucking night. You 
                        cover all that up for them every 
                        time without question. They get to 
                        play. And I’m punished? I’m 
                        punished because I threw one 
                        interception? I--

           He has to stop. Hurts to move his mouth this much. He rubs 
           his jaw to ease the pain. 

                                 ATTICUS
                        We’re going to get you back out 
                        there, I--

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        You play well, you’re untouchable. 
                        You throw one interception? Your 
                        jaw is broken. Tell me if that 
                        feels backwards to you. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I know you’re upset. It’s 
                        understandable. I... I know what 
                        you’re going through.

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        You know?? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Yes. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        You don’t know shit! You never 
                        played a snap. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (a beat)
                        I came to give you this. 
           He hands Steve a BAG. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        A token of our appreciation. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        I don’t want your fucking token. 
                        It’s not going to work like that. 
                        You can’t just sweep me under the 
                        rug.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Steve.

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                        Get out. 

           Atticus stares him down. He leaves the bag on the table 
           before walking out the door. 

           Steve grabs the bag and SLAMS it against the wall. HUNDRED 
           DOLLAR BILLS float through the air. 

           INT. KENDRICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Kendrick is still awake. Pouring over the interviews. Looking 
           for something. Anything. 

                                 KENDRICK
                             (recording)
                        What’s your relationship with 
                        Atticus Archer? 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                             (recording)
                        I... I don’t know who that is. 

           Stops... Rewinds the tape and starts again.. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                             (recording)
                        Bissinger and Benny were really 
                        nice.

           Pauses it... Rewinds... Once more: 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                             (recording)
                        Bissinger and Benny were really 
                        nice.

           He raises his eyebrow... RUSHES to the shelf...
           Removes the AUBURN MEDIA GUIDE. Hurriedly flips through the 
           pages. Finds what he’s looking for--

           BENNY. Special Assistant - Recruiting. Kendrick recognizes 
           him immediately. The guy that was with Fluker and his family 
           before the Ole Miss game.  

           INT. BENNY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A KNOCK on the door. Benny opens it to find KENDRICK. 
           Immediately goes to shut it-- 

           Kendrick FORCES the door further open. Walks in.

                                 BENNY
                        You can’t just--

                                 KENDRICK
                        I’m here to help you. So shut the 
                        fuck up and listen.
                             (really taking control)
                        We have the program dead to rights. 
                        We found deposits in Patterson’s 
                        accounts.  

                                 BENNY
                        That’s not true, I would have 
                        heard...

                                 KENDRICK
                        From who? 

           Benny goes to say something, but Kendrick talks right over 
           him. In control. 

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t hear from anyone because 
                        you’re the fall guy. The fall guy 
                        is always the last to hear. 

                                 BENNY
                        No, I would know. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Benny, you’re a pawn. There’s a bus 
                        coming. Who do you think is getting 
                        thrown under it? Bissinger? Reis? 
                        Archer? It’s going to be you my 
                        friend. Little Benny. They don’t 
                        need you. This is a big machine and 
                        you’re the smallest cog.   

           Benny tries to stand tall. Bites his lip--
           But it quivers. He hangs his head.

                                 BENNY
                        I didn’t want this.

                                 KENDRICK
                        That’s why I want to give you a way 
                        out. Full immunity. Your name will 
                        never be mentioned in this 
                        investigation. 
                             (reaching into his jacket)
                        I just need you to wear this. 

           He reaches into his jacket-- holds up a WIRE. Close on Benny. 
           Scared.

           INT./EXT. GEOFF’S CAR - CHICK-FIL-A - NIGHT

           Geoff and Ronnie are finishing a phone call. WE DON’T HEAR 
           THE OTHER END OF THE CALL. 

           They’re at the front of the drive-thru line. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Yeah. Everything’s taken care of.
                             (listening)
                        Copy. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Yeah, could I get a #5? 

           Geoff hangs up the phone. They continue waiting. Silent for a 
           moment.

                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Atticus seem different to you? He’s 
                        supposed to be taking his foot off 
                        the gas, and instead he’s stepping 
                        down harder. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Was never going to be easy for him 
                        to walk away.

                                 RONNIE
                        Get that, but it was supposed to be 
                        our show this year. Just gonna be 
                        me and you soon enough... he’s 
                        still shouldering all the load. 

           They stay quiet. Both mulling it over. 
                                 RONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Hear Fluker’s official at Ole Miss 
                        went real well. LSU putting 
                        pressure on as well. Has the 
                        hometown connection. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Gonna be tough. Mom’s not cracking.

                                 RONNIE
                        That’s why I think it’s time to 
                        stop thinking so much about his 
                        Mom. 

                                 GEOFF
                        Atticus knows how to handle these 
                        things.

                                 RONNIE
                        What Atticus doesn’t know won’t 
                        kill him. 

                                 GEOFF
                        What’re you saying?

                                 RONNIE
                        Sayin’ that we might need to take 
                        matters into our own hands.  

           INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Close on a phone vibrating... 

           REVEAL: GRANDMA NANCY is calling. It’s Benny’s phone.

           Kendrick is standing over him. Benny lets it vibrate.

                                 KENDRICK
                        Is that him? 

           Benny has a panicked look that says nothing but yes.

                                 KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        Answer it. 

                                 BENNY
                             (turns around to face 
                              Kendrick)
                        He’s a professional. He’s not just 
                        gonna walk into a trap like this.

                                 KENDRICK
                        Answer it. 
           He does. 

                                 BENNY
                        Yeah. 

           INTERCUT WITH--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Got a weird call yesterday. Kid 
                        from down South. Interested in an 
                        official. Already took one with 
                        Bama and LSU.

                                 BENNY
                        OK...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You OK? You sound stressed.

           Benny stutters. Kendrick grabs his shoulder. SQUEEZES. 

                                 BENNY
                        Yeah. Yeah. I’m good. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Said it would take 15 to confirm an 
                        official. Geoff dropped a bag this 
                        morning. You should be getting a 
                        text from him tomorrow to confirm 
                        the date of his official.

           Benny silent again. Kendrick prods him. ASK WHO IT IS. 

                                 BENNY
                        Wh-who is it? 

           Benny closes his eyes. Don’t say it. Don’t say it. Don’t say 
           it. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Adoree Mair. 

           Fuck. Benny’s face drops. Kendrick smiling. 

                                 BENNY
                        Ok. Got it. Yeah, I’ll... 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Benny... maybe I haven’t been 
                        saying this enough lately. You’ve 
                        done a great job. If we can get 
                        through this year, all of your hard 
                        work will be worth it. 
                                 BENNY
                        I know... it... I want to be here.

           He’s having a hard time keeping it together. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How would you feel about being the 
                        director of football operations 
                        next season? 

           This kills Benny. He knows he’s never going to get the 
           chance. You can see his heart break. 

                                 BENNY
                        Amazing... it sounds amazing.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good. Confirm with me when you get 
                        the text tomorrow. 

           Hangs up. Kendrick immediately springs to the computer--

                                 KENDRICK
                        Look up the address. 

           Benny does. A fire in Kendrick’s eyes. He has them. 

           EXT. SOUTHERN ROAD - NIGHT

           Kendrick pulls up. Nearly jumps out of his car.  

           Goes to the mailbox... Opens it to find...

           A BAG.

           Kendrick shaking as he reaches for it. He fucking has them. 

           Pulls it out and opens it all the way to find--

           IT’S FULL OF MONOPOLY MONEY. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        No...

           He rips into the bag-- Orange 500’s spill out. A rainbow of 
           technicolor bills: blue 50’s, yellow 10’s all flutter in the 
           air around him.  

           TITLE CARD READS: 45 MINUTES AGO

           The rev of an engine. By now, we know the sound by heart. 
           100MPH.
           INT./EXT. ATTICUS' CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus is finishing his call with Benny. HE KNEW THE WHOLE 
           TIME. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good. Confirm with me when you get 
                        the text tomorrow.

           Hangs up and immediately dials RONNIE and GEOFF. 

           INT./EXT. GEOFF’S CAR - CHICK-FIL-A - NIGHT

           They’re at the back of the drive-thru line. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Benny’s been compromised. Cut off 
                        all communications immediately. 

                                 GEOFF
                        God damn. Well, bag’s already been 
                        planted. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good. Kendrick should be headed 
                        there as we speak. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Dumb ass.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Same address I sent you? 

                                 GEOFF
                        Yeah. Everything’s taken care of.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Great. See you at Toomer’s tonight.  

                                 GEOFF
                        Copy. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Yeah, could I get a #5?

           INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           NOW. 

           Atticus storms in without a word--
           REACHES UP BENNY’S SHIRT AND RIPS THE WIRE OFF. THROWS IT ON 
           THE GROUND AND CRUSHES IT WITH HIS FOOT. 

           Finally can speak--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I really thought you were 
                        different.

                                 BENNY
                        Atticus I-- What about Patterson’s 
                        account? He said they fo--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You fucking idiot! How could you 
                        not call me?? They haven’t even 
                        looked at his accounts yet. 

           Benny’s face drops. Realizes Kendrick completely fooled him. 

                                 BENNY
                        Atticus, he barged in here... there 
                        was nothing--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How could you not call me?? 

                                 BENNY
                        Because I thought we were fucked!

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re never fucked unless I tell 
                        you that we’re fucked. I knew 
                        Kendrick would come to you next. 
                        And you failed. 

                                 BENNY
                        Then why didn’t you call to tell 
                        me? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Because I didn’t know if you were 
                        already wired. If he had already 
                        come to you... I trusted you would 
                        do the right thing. 

                                 BENNY
                        Atticus, please this--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Pack your things. You’re fired. 

                                 BENNY
                        You can’t do that.
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’re right. Bissinger will give 
                        you the news tomorrow. I’m just 
                        giving you a head start.

                                 BENNY
                             (tearing up)
                        Did you tell him?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Tell him what?

                                 BENNY
                        Did you tell Ricky to say my name 
                        in his interview? 

           Atticus doesn’t say anything. 

                                 BENNY (CONT’D)
                        This is my life. It’s all I have.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It’s time to start a new life then. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chance walks off the practice field. GEOFF and RONNIE are 
           waiting for him outside their car.

           Close on Chance. He doesn’t know what to do. 

           EXT. BENNY’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Atticus walks away from Benny’s complex. His limp a little 
           exaggerated. He’s in pain. 

           BURNER begins to ring. He sits down. Answers. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                             (furious)
                        How dare you?? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        What’s going on?

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Your men... your... goons. They 
                        cornered Chance. Told him that I 
                        was interfering.

           And for once... Atticus is beginning to panic. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Jenna, please... Chance must be 
                        mistaken. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Are you calling my son a liar?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No, no. I’m saying that there’s 
                        information that he isn’t...

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I knew from the second you 
                        approached me that this was dirty. 
                             (flustered)
                        I haven’t worked all my life just 
                        to throw it away. We’re so close. 
                        You try and poison us. With your 
                        money and your gifts and your 
                        power. I see why this game is so 
                        corrupt. It’s so hard to say no. So 
                        hard. But I always will. You’re not 
                        getting to us. You won’t.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I think if you just take--

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Chance’s recruitment is closed. 
                        That’s final. I never want to see 
                        your face again. 

           She hangs up. Atticus bows his head. Crushed. 

           INT. TOOMER’S - NIGHT

           Atticus barges through the door. Angrier than we’ve ever seen 
           him. Geoff and Ronnie are already seated. Well into some 
           whiskey. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Is all that true? What she told me? 

                                 RONNIE
                        We did what we had to!

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Who the fuck can I trust here?? You 
                        see what Benny’s doing and then you 
                        turn around and go behind my back?
                             (really furious)
                        What the fuck were you thinking? 
                                 RONNIE
                        You’re in too deep with the family. 
                        It’s not about the family, it’s 
                        about Chance. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No, it’s all about the family. 
                        Where the fuck have you been, 
                        Ronnie? 
                             (turning to Geoff)
                        Whose idea was this? 

           Geoff clenches his teeth. Unsure where to jump in. It’s 
           getting ugly.

                        We were so close. We had him!

                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about? You can’t quit.

                        this. I’m not living in your shadow 
                        anymore.  Things are never going to 
                        change. I see that now.  
                             (pause)
                        It’s just football, Atticus.

                        don’t fucking care. 

           Geoff looks at Atticus, who simply checks his watch. 
           Recalibrating.  

                                 GEOFF
                        Do we have to get him? What if he 
                        rats?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        He won’t rat. He says anything, 
                        he’s going to fuck himself too.
                             (a breath)
                        We don’t have time to worry about 
                        him. He’s a quitter. We have jobs 
                        to do. If you think differently, 
                        then go ahead and walk out with 
                        him.

           Close on Geoff. Starting to worry about more than just 
           Ronnie. 

           INT./EXT. - ATTICUS' CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus pulls up to his house. Parks the car. Takes a deep 
           breath. Rubs his leg. It’s really hurting. 

           He reaches into the glove compartment and removes the orange 
           bottle. Swallows a handful of pills before walking in--

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Diane is waiting for him, drinking coffee. Sees how bad the 
           limp is. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Honey, you need to slow down. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We lost him. We lost Fluker. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Maybe that’s for the best.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It’s not. Ronnie’s out. Benny’s 
                        out. 

           Diane rubs her temple, realizing how bad everything is. 
                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        And you were supposed to be out... 
                        months ago. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’re almost done. We were so 
                        close.

           Diane is thinking. Takes a sip of her coffee. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        You get Chance, and that’s it. You 
                        walk away for good. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Yes. That’s always been the plan. 

           She wants to believe him. So badly. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        You promise?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I promise. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        If that’s the case... 
                             (a long pause and a deep 
                              breath)
                        I have an idea.

           EXT./INT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - DAY

           Ms. Fluker looks out the window as THE MERCEDES pulls up to 
           the house. She rolls her eyes. Waiting for Atticus to make 
           his way to the door. She walks to the door. Opens it...

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I thought I told you not to--

           DIANE WALKS OUT OF THE CAR. Strides to the front door. Looks 
           confident. Really fucking confident.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Ms. Fluker. Good afternoon. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I can’t believe he sent you.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        He? No one sends me anywhere. 
                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Then what are you doing here? 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I want to talk to you. Can I come 
                        in?

           On Ms. Fluker -- still trying to take this all in.

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Yes... of course.

           INT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY

           They sit down at the table. Feeling each other out. Diane 
           takes a deep breath and begins. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I’ve been with Atticus for almost 
                        thirty years. I’ve never seen him 
                        this obsessed with a recruit. And 
                        this whole time... I’ve been trying 
                        to figure out why. And it hit me 
                        the moment I met him: it’s because 
                        Chance is a genuinely good person.

           Off Ms. Fluker... Diane’s right. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying he’s not talented. 
                        Because he is. I’m not an expert 
                        with that stuff. But I am an expert 
                        at judging character... and 
                        Chance... he’s different. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Atticus did mention that.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Exactly. And he’d usually never say 
                        that. Trust me. 
                             (she goes for the kill)
                        I’m not sure if Atticus ever 
                        mentioned this to you... but I grew 
                        up with a single mother. Never met 
                        my Dad. I don’t like to talk about 
                        it. But I know the position you’re 
                        in.
                             (reaches into her purse)
                        This is her. 

           She removes PHOTOS. A lot of them. All showing a young Diane 
           with her mother. They’re alone in almost every photo.
           We focus on one in particular: an infant Diane and her mother 
           on the beach. Just outside the surf. A bright summer day. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        The one lesson my mother taught 
                        me... well, she taught me a lot of 
                        lessons, more than I could ever 
                        say, but the most important one was 
                        this: It’s OK to ask for help. I 
                        know how hard you’ve worked. I know 
                        how many people have turned their 
                        backs on you. But it doesn’t have 
                        to be like that. You don’t have to 
                        be alone. Auburn is a family. We’re 
                        here to help you, not hurt you.

           Ms. Fluker is torn open. Raw and emotional. We’ve never seen 
           this side of her. It’s like she’s been waiting her entire 
           life for someone to say those words to her. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I... thank you. 

           Diane gets up. Hugs her. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        It’s OK. You’re not alone. You’re 
                        never alone. Just take an official 
                        visit. You’ll see exactly what I’m 
                        talking about.  

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        OK. 
                             (a long and deep breath, 
                              almost relieved)
                        We’ll do it. I trust you. 

           Close on Ms. Fluker’s eyes. Trust. Diane did it. 

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - DAY

           Atticus sits at the table. BURNER: “Fluker’s official is 
           scheduled. What happened?” 

           Atticus pumps his fist. The most emotion we’ve seen. He 
           checks his watch. 

           Our gaze drifts to what’s on the table...

           PHOTO ALBUMS, all spread open. We focus on one of them: ten 
           photos on each side. About half of them missing. The other 
           half all have the same thing in common: DIANE’S FATHER.
           We focus on one photo in particular: Diane’s father at the 
           beach. PART OF THE SAME PHOTO DIANE SHOWED MS. FLUKER. It’s 
           been carefully cut out. The same bright day.

                        Ricky Patterson has taken the sport 
                        by storm. 

           HIGHLIGHTS FROM AUBURN’S NEXT THREE GAMES

           Patterson continues to dominate. Touchdown after touchdown. 
           All rockets and bombs. 

           FINAL: Auburn 35, Texas A&M 14

           Ricky in his element at Quixote’s. Making out with girls. 
           Doing drugs. Partying. 

           He’s a new person.

                        More footage surfaced early this

                        Ricky Patterson, celebrating their 
                        victory late... or early... into

                        Frankly, what’s happening right now 
                        at Auburn is remarkable. 

           FINAL: Auburn 38, LSU 7

           Ricky partying more. He’s out of control.

                        And with a victory over Alabama in 
                        the Iron Bowl, Auburn has secured 
                        their spot in the championship 
                        game.

           Atticus remains calm as the stadium explodes in excitement. 
           Auburn is going to the championship.

           Sawyer and Francis wait above the tunnel. Ricky BLOWS BY 
           THEM. Head down. 
           INT. BAR - NIGHT 

           KENDRICK paces into the dive bar. BILL PATTERSON sits in the 
           very back corner, his face lit only by the neon beer signs 
           above. Bad country music blaring. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Mr. Patterson. I’m glad you called. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON 
                        I didn’t want it to come to this. 
                        But I have to do something. I can’t 
                        stand by silently anymore.
                             (a defiant pause)
                        I’m turning in Atticus Archer. 

           Kendrick’s eyes light up. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        He gave us 20k. All cash.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        You have the cash?

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        He gave it to you? 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Well, he gave me the address. It 
                        was in a field. In a duffel. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Do you have a record of this?

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        Of course. Of course. He called to 
                        tell me. 

           Kendrick deflating. Atticus is always a step ahead. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        So, you don’t have a record. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        No, I mean... 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        We need hard evidence. There’s 
                        nothing we can do with 20k you 
                        found in a field. I mean, Bill... 
                        That’s actually a crime. 
                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        There has to be something--

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        They’ve thought these things 
                        through ten times over. Nothing 
                        else happened that night?

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        No, I mean-- after the emails 
                        leaked, he was there for us. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Why do you think that was? 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        I mean, they wanted Francis and--

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Bill, who do you think leaked those 
                        emails? Who would benefit most? 

           It’s sinking in. Holy shit. 

                                 BILL PATTERSON
                        I just... I want my boy back. 
                        That’s all. I just want to talk to 
                        him. He’s going down the wrong 
                        road. That’s not Ricky. That’s 
                        someone else. This isn’t what we 
                        signed up for... it isn’t what we 
                        wanted.

           Kendrick sighs. There’s nothing he can do. 

           EXT. AUBURN CAMPUS - TWILIGHT 

           A NEW GA guides CHANCE AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY across campus. 
           All of them clad in Auburn gear. ATTICUS and DIANE wait for 
           them at the end of the quad. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                             (to the kids)
                        Looks like we have a bunch of 
                        future Tigers here!

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How was the tour? 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        It was amazing.
           Atticus smiles, tries to hide how excited he is. Never heard 
           her this enthusiastic. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (really playing it up)
                        Now, I know Mom wouldn’t usually 
                        let you have dessert before dinner, 
                        but Diane was hoping to show you 
                        boys the best ice cream on campus. 
                        Maybe she’ll make an exception just 
                        this once.

           A chorus of “please”’s. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                             (all smiles)
                        Oh, fine. I might have to get some 
                        myself.

           All the kids cheer. This could not be going better.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Chance and I will hang back. I want 
                        to show him more of the practice 
                        facilities. We’ll get him set up 
                        for the night too. 

           Ms. Fluker turns and gives Chance a giant hug. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        You call me if you need anything, 
                        alright? 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Yes, Mom. 

           Atticus and Chance watch as Diane leads his family away. Once 
           they turn the corner and are out of view--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Follow me. 

           Chance does... but they’re walking away from the facility. 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Thought we were going to the 
                        practice facility? 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Wanted to show you something first. 

           Atticus reaches into his pocket, and we can hear the jingle 
           of--
           KEYS. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I know your mom isn’t going to like 
                        this, but when you get on campus 
                        next year, this’ll be waiting for 
                        you.

           They round the corner to-- THE LEXUS. The same decked out one 
           that Atticus brought to the house. 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Mr. Archer...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Just take it for a spin while 
                        you’re here. Our secret.

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        You sure?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Next year it’s all yours.

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Thank you. Thank you so much. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Have fun tonight, alright? Stay out 
                        of trouble. 

           Chance gives him a bear hug.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to do great things 
                        together. 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Yes, sir. 

           Hold for a long beat. All smiles. Chance’s eyes gleaming. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (V.O.)
                        Fuck you!

           INT. PATTERSON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Those same eyes. Terrified. 

           All the visiting players on their knees. Fluker is surrounded 
           by four other guys. Close on a tabletop. LINES OF COKE 
           everywhere. 
                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Come on, pussy!

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                             (starting to get up)
                        I can’t. I...

           Chance has never seen a line of coke in his life.  He doesn’t 
           know what to do. 

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        Yo, dude. Take it easy.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Nah, this is what we do to new 
                        guys. 
                             (looks at Connors)
                        Right? 

           Patterson walks over. Forces Chance’s face onto the glass 
           table.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to play Auburn football 
                        or not?

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Yes. Yes, sir. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Then fucking do it.

           Chance doesn’t say no to anything. When he’s told to do 
           something....

           He does it. Brings his head back up, eyes rolling back. 
           Dazed. 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Shit. 

           Everyone CHEERS.

                                 TYLER CONNORS
                        How are we getting to the party? 

           Ricky looks around. Everyone hammered. He circles back to--

           CHANCE.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        New guy had a nice ride. He can 
                        take us. 
           INT./EXT. CHANCE’S CAR - NIGHT

           CHANCE BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HIS LEXUS.

           The car is packed with the players. Ricky is taking a handle 
           pull. They’re loud. We’re anxious. Want to look away.

           Chance closes his eyes. Tries to concentrate. Drives slowly. 
           They approach a stop light just as--

           THE LIGHT TURNS YELLOW. Fuck. Chance freaks. Presses on the 
           gas, into the intersection, but then--

           STOPS. Barely avoids a car making a left through the yellow. 
           HORNS from all directions. Fuck. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Go!!! Go!!

           Chance pounds on the pedal. Speeds through. Everyone looks 
           around. Waiting for sirens or lights. After a loooong beat--

           We’re good. For now. 

           INT. RESTAURANT -  NIGHT

           Atticus and Diane are out to dinner with Ms. Fluker. All 
           smiles. Fancy place. White table cloth. The whole nine yards.

           Ms. Fluker has never had anything close to this. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                             (taking a bite of her 
                              pasta)
                        This is amazing.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We’ll come here every night before 
                        game-day next year. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        I just hope Chance is doing OK.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Oh, I’m sure he’s getting along 
                        with the boys just great. 

           INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           A crazy costume party. Sweeping shot through the foyer. Black-
           lights, keg stands, shots, people hooking up. Repulsive to 
           anyone not 18-21. 
           RICKY is standing on the bar, two girls by his side, 
           shotgunning a beer. 

           Fluker walks through the party alone. He’s really messed up. 
           Accidentally bumps into a FRAT GUY dressed as an ASTRONAUT. 
           The guy takes his helmet off. 

                                 FRAT GUY
                        Big man. You in the house?

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        Uh... no... I... 

                                 FRAT GUY
                        I didn’t think so. Then what the 
                        fuck are you doing here? 

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                             (mumbling)
                        I’m.... here with Ricky. 

                                 FRAT GUY
                        Speak up!

                                 CHANCE FLUKER
                        I’m here with Ricky. 

                                 FRAT GUY
                             (turns to Ricky)
                        Ricky! Is this guy here with you?

           Ricky looks at him. Super drunk.

                                 RICKY PATTERSON 
                             (slurred)
                        Him? Fuck no! 

                                 FRAT GUY
                             (turning back to Chance)
                        Get out. 

           He shoves Chance. Chance shoves back. Harder. 

                                 FRAT GUY (CONT’D)
                        Yo, what the fuck?

           The frat guy punches him to little effect. 

           Fluker PUNCHES back. Hits him clean in the face. The guy 
           drops immediately. Chaos. Chance is gang tackled by HALF A 
           DOZEN GUYS. 

           They bring him down. His leg CRACKS. He SCREAMS in pain. He’s 
           balled up on the floor like a child.
           EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Chance comes limping out... 

           He looks around. No escape. Except for --

           His CAR. He frantically searches his pockets for his keys...

           Finds them just in time.... Unlocks it and crawls in...

           INT./EXT. CHANCE'S CAR - NIGHT

           He’s still really fucked up. Tries to concentrate. He’s 
           bloody. Barely conscious at this point. Drifting in and out 
           of consciousness. 

           Just as he’s about to pass out, he accelerates forward-- Into 
           an intersection. A painful beat before--

           CRASH. 

           CUT TO BLACK

           INT. RESTAURANT -  NIGHT

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (in the middle of some 
                              story)
                        And I told them, this kid is the 
                        best prospect I have ever seen--

           He’s cut off abruptly. BURNER rings. 

           Diane looks at him. Don’t answer. He does. Ms. Fluker looks 
           at both of them-- confused and concerned. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Atticus--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Hello?
                             (his face drops)
                        We have to go. 

           INT./EXT. ATTICUS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Atticus goes speeding out of the parking lot and into the 
           night. Diane and Ms. Fluker riding shotgun and in the back 
           seat respectively.
                                 MS. FLUKER
                        Did you talk to Chance? Is he OK? 

           Atticus doesn’t respond... He’s already on the phone.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Kenny, I need to get rid of a car. 
                        Do you have a guy? 
                             (listening)
                        Now! Right now. I’ll meet you at 
                        the dealership.

           Hangs up. Dials another number. 

           Diane watches. Panicked. Looks back at Ms. Fluker. Trying to 
           figure out something to say. Nothing comes. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Geoff, I need you to meet me on the 
                        corner of Magnolia and Lem 
                        Morrison. Hurry. 

           EXT. AUBURN STREET - NIGHT

           The crime scene is already starting to develop. The side of 
           Chance’s car is severely dented. The COPS have already set up 
           a perimeter. 

           Atticus’ Mercedes comes SCREECHING to the corner. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (to Diane)
                        Stay here. Keep her in the car! 

           He nearly ejects out the door, the adrenaline practically 
           negating his limp. 

           Chance lies on the ground. LEG ALMOST BACKWARDS. He SCREAMS 
           IN PAIN. Trying to breathe.

           Atticus kneels next to him. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK. It’s OK. 

           Geoff pulls up. Rushes out of the car. Sees Fluker--

                                 GEOFF
                        Oh, what the fu--
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We need to get him home. I have a 
                        guy... he’s already on his way 
                        there.   

                                 GEOFF
                        What about the hospit--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No hospitals.  

           Geoff looks at him. Holy shit.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        We need to get him in the car right 
                        now. 

           They try and lift him. Atticus has trouble putting weight on 
           his bad leg. CRACK. Fluker’s leg gives out even more. HE 
           SCREAMS.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                             (sobbing)
                        Atticus! He has to go to the 
                        hospital.

           Atticus turns around. Diane is standing outside the car. Ms. 
           Fluker is grasping onto her. Hysterical. 

           He thinks about it for a moment. Bites his lip. It seems like 
           he’s ready to give in. Desperation in Diane’s eyes. But--

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No hospitals. Get her back in the 
                        car! 

           Diane looks him in the eye. Hardly recognizes him. He’s 
           desperate. There’s no plan. 

                                 GEOFF
                        What do you think?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Again. 

           They heave. Atticus putting too much pressure on his bad leg. 
           Doesn’t matter... 

           They LIFT CHANCE UP and move towards Geoff’s car. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        You’re ok. You’re ok. 
                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Atticus!! Stop! For god’s sake!!

           She’s horrified. Tears streaming down her face. 

           They place him in Geoff’s car. Atticus turns to the VETERAN 
           COP, who GETS IN CHANCE’S CAR AND DRIVES IT AWAY. The rookie 
           cops look on... says nothing. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Atticus!!

           Looks right past Diane to the front of the crowd that has 
           gathered. Standing there is--

           RICKY. He stares right at Atticus. Doesn’t need to say 
           anything. Atticus knows. 

           EXT. AUBURN STREET - NIGHT

           Kendrick screeches to a halt. Yellow tape already up. The 
           cops cleaning up the scene. Runs up to the ROOKIE COP. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        What happened to the car?? 

                                 COP
                        What car?

                                 KENDRICK
                        The car from the fucking accident!! 

                                 COP
                        Uh... I don’t know. They must have 
                        impounded it already. 

           Kendrick looks around. Desperate. Can’t believe it. 

           INT./EXT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Atticus paces up to the Flukers’ front door. GEOFF is 
           waiting.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How is he? 

                                 GEOFF
                        It’s... it’s really not good. Your 
                        guy’s here. 

           Ms. Fluker comes RUSHING OUT. 
                                 MS. FLUKER
                        You son of a bitch!

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Ms. Fluker...

           She POUNDS his chest. Punch after punch. She’s sobbing. It’s 
           all she can do. Atticus stands. Takes it. It’s all he can do. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        My baby....  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Help is here. It’s going to be OK. 

                                 MS. FLUKER
                        He’s just a boy... My little boy. 

           She can’t watch. She can’t do anything. Her life as she knew 
           it is over. Everything they’d worked for. Gone in a snap. 

                                 MS. FLUKER (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                             (pounding his chest)
                        What the hell is wrong with you?!? 
                        That’s my little boy!

           There’s nothing Atticus can say. 

           INT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chance lies on the bed. BLOOD EVERYWHERE. He’s in and out of 
           consciousness. Struggling to breathe. 

           An OLD MAN in a white lab coat stands over him. DR. THEROUX, 
           or as Atticus knows him: The Night Doctor.. 

                                 DR. THEROUX 
                        Archer.

           OPENS the trunk to reveal a tightly packed assortment of 
           medical tools. DEVICES, VIALS, NEEDLES, ETC. 

           Examines his leg. Chance continues to WAIL in pain. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How bad?

                                 DR. THEROUX
                        Broken. We’ll apply a cast. But... 
                        this will be permanent damage. 

           The word permanent makes Atticus flinch. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Do what you need to do. 

           He looks back to see DIANE waiting at the door. 

           EXT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           They walk into the yard. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        She looked at me and told me I was 
                        a monster. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Who gave him that car?

           He keeps walking. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        Who gave it to him???
                             (Atticus still silent)
                        Say it!!

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I was trying to help... this was 
                        the only way to do it. He needed 
                        something to push him over the 
                        edge.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        You’re delusional! 

           Atticus doesn’t say anything. He can’t. She knows. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        You promised that this was it. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane...

           She HITS him the chest. He stands there. Just takes it. She’s 
           SOBBING. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I knew it. This is never going to 
                        end. 30 years of my life... this 
                        was it. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I just need a little more time. 
                        I’ll get this all figured out.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        We don’t have any more time! 
                             (between breaths)
                        I can’t do this anymore. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane, don’t...

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        It’s my fault. I’m the one who 
                        convinced them.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No, that’s not how--

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I did it. It was me. God dammit. 
                        How could I let you pull me into 
                        this? I was so foolish. So foolish. 
                        How can I look them in the eye?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It was me.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        No...it was me. How do you expect 
                        me to live with myself? How can I 
                        go back in there? Do you know how 
                        that feels? The guilt? I can’t. 
                        Atticus, I can’t. I’m only human.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane--

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        How??

           He goes to put his hand on her shoulder.

           A lifetime before his eyes. The woman he loves. The woman 
           that loved him. Tears stream down both of their faces.

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        When I get home... I don’t want to 
                        see you there. I need space. I need 
                        time. 

           She pushes his hand back and walks away. Leaving him alone. 
           More alone than he’s ever been. 
           EXT. FLUKER RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Atticus wanders deeper into the field behind the house. 
           Deeper into the night. Holds his leg. It’s hurting. Looks up 
           to the sky. The stars in the sky gleam as brightly as ever.

           Under the weight of everything. He collapses. Falls to his 
           knees in the Southern swamp. He’s covered in mud and blood 
           and it’s all his own mess. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        FUCK! 

           Out of breath. Again.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        GOD DAMMIT!

           He puts his hands on his knees. Looks to check his watch. 
           It’s not there. 

           INT. PATTERSON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Atticus barges into Patterson’s apartment. RICKY is on the 
           couch, shirtless. He looks stoned. 

           Atticus SLAPS him in the face. Patterson takes a moment to 
           recover before Atticus SLAPS him again.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You’ve jeopardized the entire 
                        program. Everything we’ve worked 
                        for. Who the fuck do you think you 
                        are? 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I’m Ricky Patterson. 

           Atticus GRABS him and SHOVES him against the wall. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Don’t fucking talk to me like that.  

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I’m sorry he couldn’t hang. 

           He chokes Patterson.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You son of a bitch. He’s never 
                        going to play again. I thought you 
                        were above that. I thought you were 
                        different.
                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        Different? Fuck you! I am 
                        different. No one can do what I do 
                        on the field! It’s not my fault you 
                        set an amateur up with us. That’s 
                        on you. I’m Ricky Patterson! I’m... 
                        I’m.... I’m...  

           He runs out of breath. Runs out of steam. Can’t find his 
           words. Can’t find anything. 

           HE BREAKS. It happens in an instant. His face twisting. He 
           sobs into Atticus’ chest. Barely breathing. Gasping for air 
           between stifled shudders. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want this. Oh god. 

           Exactly what Benny said. 

                                 RICKY PATTERSON (CONT’D)
                        I want to go home. I miss my Dad. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Good. Because you’re not playing 
                        here any more.  

                                 RICKY PATTERSON
                        I need to go home. 

           Ricky’s done. Atticus removes BURNER. Dials. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Bill, it’s Atticus Archer. I’m 
                        sorry to bother you so late... but 
                        I’m gonna need you to come to 
                        campus. 

           INT./EXT. LYFT - NIGHT

           Atticus stands at the curb as a PRIUS pulls up. He gets in. 

                                 LYFT DRIVER
                        How’s it going tonight, sir?

           Looks back at Atticus. He’s covered in blood and dirt, his 
           clothes ripped. He says nothing. 

                                 LYFT DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Well, we’ve got plenty of mints and 
                        water back there. You let me know 
                        if you need anything else. 
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Atticus lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling. The TV is on 
           in the background--

                                 ESPN ANALYST
                        Unbelievable footage is surfacing 
                        from Auburn last night.

           Blurry footage of the fight. We see it from a few different 
           angles. All show FLUKER punching the Astronaut and being 
           tackled. It looks like he started it.

                                 ESPN ANALYST (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        Auburn released a short statement: 
                        We are aware of the incident late 
                        last night involving visiting 
                        recruit Chance Fluker. We regard 
                        these matters with the utmost 
                        importance but will not rush to any 
                        swift conclusions without a full 
                        investigation. 

                                 ESPN ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        And in much more pressing news for 
                        the Tigers, freshman phenom Ricky 
                        Patterson has left the program 
                        without notice--

           Footage of Ricky coming home, it mirrors the first scene at 
           the Patterson’s. Press hounding the door.

                                 ESPN ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        Sources tell us that Patterson will 
                        not be playing in the Championship 
                        Game in just a few short days. 

           INT. REIS’ OFFICE - DAY

                                 BARRY REIS
                        How the fuck did this happen? 

           Atticus sits across from Reis. It looks like he’s still 
           trying to answer that same question. Bags under his eyes. 
           There’s a bright Auburn colored CHRISTMAS TREE in the office.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Everything spun out of control. But 
                        there’s no evidence. Car’s been 
                        taken care of. Other than that--

                                 BARRY REIS
                        Did he start that fight?
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        All I know is what’s in the 
                        footage. 

           Barry has his head in his hands. Shaking his head. Looks up.

                                 BARRY REIS
                        Do you need to take some time?

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        No. We still have a championship to 
                        win. Nothing’s changed. 

                                 BARRY REIS
                             (moving closer)
                        Atticus... forget that we... I’ll 
                        use the word “work” lightly. Forget 
                        that we work together. Just pretend 
                        it’s the two of us. Man to man. At 
                        a bar. In the stands at a game.
                             (he looks Atticus deep in 
                              the eye)
                        Why are you doing this?

           Atticus doesn’t say anything. 

                                 BARRY REIS (CONT’D)
                        They’re not going to remember you. 
                        They don’t remember AD’s and they 
                        don’t remember bag men. We don’t 
                        get trophies. We don’t get 
                        remembered. The players do. The 
                        coaches do. If you’re not in it for 
                        the glory, then you’re in it 
                        because you love the game. And no 
                        one can love the game this much. No 
                        one should.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I’ll see you in Dallas, Barry. 

           INT. KENDRICK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Kendrick is crammed in his office. Watching the reports on 
           ESPN. A KNOCK at the door. He opens it. Surprised. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Come in. 

           WE DON’T SEE WHO IT IS. 

           JANUARY
           #2 AUBURN vs. #1 OHIO STATE

           INT. COWBOY STADIUM - NIGHT

           The crown jewel of college football. All the pomp and 
           circumstance you can imagine. Fireworks. Marching bands.

           Auburn and Ohio State run out of their respective tunnels. 
           The players pumping up the fans. 

           HIGHLIGHTS:

           The game kicks.  McGuire looks like a man possessed. Opening 
           drive: TOUCHDOWN. 

           Atticus watches. But he’s distracted. Something isn’t right. 

           Ohio State answers back with a touchdown. As they celebrate--

           QUICK FLASHES:  

           CHANCE’S INJURY. LYING ON THE GROUND BLOODY. 

           Atticus shakes his head. A HELMET ON HELMET HIT ON THE FIELD. 
           Crunching bodies. 

           CHANCE’S SCREAMS. FLASHING LIGHTS. 

           Atticus has to get up. Walks into the darkness of the tunnel. 

           Leans up against the wall. Deep breaths. 

           DIANE SCREAMING. MS. FLUKER WRAPPED AROUND HER. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (V.O.)
                        ATTICUS!!! He needs a hospital!!

           A defensive struggle. McGuire continues to make plays. The 
           best we’ve seen him. No turnovers.

           14-14. Just minutes left. Auburn on the five yard line. 

                                 STEVE MCGUIRE
                             (to the other players)
                        Colt 16 Indiana!!

           He throws-- TOUCHDOWN. McGuire celebrates in the end zone 
           with his teammates. The game clock ticks to 0:00. 

           FINAL: Auburn 21, Ohio State 14

           The Auburn bench rushes the field. Students cheering. McGuire 
           hoisted up. Bissinger doused in Gatorade. 
           Atticus stands in the tunnel... silence. Alone. No one there 
           to celebrate with him.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Auburn has done it! They’re 
                        National Champions! Of all the 
                        unlikely heroes, Steve McGuire 
                        steps in and takes the Tigers to 
                        the promised land.

           Confetti STREAMS down over Atticus. He’s subdued. Watching 
           the team celebrate. Silent. 

           They won.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Atticus walks back into his hotel in Auburn. Sits at the bar. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Here you go, sir.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Sorry, don’t think that’s--

                                 BARTENDER
                        The gentleman over there brought 
                        you a drink. 

           Turns to see-- KENDRICK. Sitting at a table in the corner. 
           Atticus gets up. Walks over and sits down across from him. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Mr. Archer. I’m sorry I never got 
                        to introduce myself properly. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Whatever paper you’re freelancing 
                        for is going to have one hell of a 
                        story. And I don’t drink. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                             (takes a sip of his drink)
                        We have you nailed. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You don’t have shit. 

           Atticus looks Kendrick over. Assessing his statement. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        My favorite thing about the game 
                        has always been the competition. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS KENDRICK (CONT'D)
                        Competition is everything. There’s 
                        nothing more exhilarating than 
                        staring the man across from you in 
                        the eye and knowing you’re going to 
                        do everything in your power to beat 
                        him. And that he’s going to do the 
                        exact same to you. I haven’t felt 
                        that in a long time... not since I 
                        stopped playing. Not until I got 
                        here. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        North Texas and “competition” 
                        aren’t usually spoken in the same 
                        sentence.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        It’s not about the school. That’s 
                        the point. It’s the game. 
                             (a pause)
                        There was something my coach told 
                        me the day of my last game. He 
                        pulled me over on the sideline and 
                        said: this is going to be the worst 
                        day of your life. Because it’s 
                        over. It ends for everyone. It ends 
                        for high school players. It ends 
                        for college players who aren’t 
                        going pro. It ends for pros, who 
                        make millions and millions of 
                        dollars but have to hang up the 
                        cleats anyway. But the more and 
                        more I get to know you, there’s 
                        something I’ve realized. It never 
                        ended for you did it? You wouldn’t 
                        let it.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                             (a long pause)
                        Figure you read the same article as 
                        everyone else. Auburn drops star 
                        prospect after leg injury. Everyone 
                        just assumes it was a football 
                        injury. Loved the game so much, 
                        what else could it be? Article 
                        doesn’t say what it was because my 
                        mother didn’t want anyone to know 
                        her husband was a drunk who 
                        accidentally hit his son with his 
                        car.  

           QUICK FLASH: A YOUNG BISSINGER sits across from ATTICUS, leg 
           in a brace, shaking his head. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        No coach ever told me it was over 
                        in some poetic way. They just 
                        pulled my offer. Said: “I believe 
                        in Auburn Tigers Football.” Program 
                        is bigger than the individual. 
                        Can’t use a scholarship on a gimp.  
                             (pause)
                        I know your story. You think you’re 
                        special? Fuck up a payment and 
                        suddenly you’re going to save every 
                        kid from accepting money? Think 
                        we’re supposed to have sympathy for 
                        you? 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        No. You’re not. My life worked out 
                        exactly how it was supposed to.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        That’s exactly what people say when 
                        their life doesn’t work out.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        You see what money does to them? It 
                        destroys them. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        It’s not the money.

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        It is! I can tell you firsthand 
                        that it is. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You think you’re making a 
                        difference?? You’re a cog in the 
                        fucking machine. Take me down and 
                        another three of me will be ready 
                        to go next season. At every single 
                        school. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        This game can’t save you. It never 
                        has and it never will. 

           Atticus looks at him. Chews it over. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK (CONT’D)
                        You come clean we can offer full 
                        immunity. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        You told Benny the same thing. 
                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Didn’t think you would. But I held 
                        out hope. Think we would have 
                        worked well together. Maybe in a 
                        different life. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Sounds like a pretty fucked up life 
                        to me.
                             (holds his gaze)
                        You don’t have shit. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        Good luck, Atticus. Auburn is the 
                        champion. You got everything you 
                        wanted. Congratulations. 

           Kendrick downs his drink. Downs Atticus’ drink too. Walks 
           away. Atticus watches the empty glasses. 

           INT./EXT. - ATTICUS' CAR - MAIN STREET - DAY

           Atticus drives through Main Street. Championship gear/banners 
           everywhere. The magnolia trees have been TP’d, white strands 
           of toilet paper drifting in the breeze. 

           He should be ecstatic. Should be celebrating. But he drives 
           ahead, straight-faced. Thinking.

           EXT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - FRONT YARD - DAY

           He pulls up to his house and gets out. He hasn’t been here in 
           so long that it almost feels new. He limps to the front door. 
           Takes a deep breath. Pushes it open...

           INT. ARCHER HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           Atticus walks through the halls. Pictures on the wall. Their 
           wedding day. At games. College photos.    

                                 DIANE ARCHER (O.S.)
                        What are you doing here?

           He turns. Diane waits at the end of the hall. She looks like 
           she’s aged five years. They both do. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Came to get my watch. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        It’s not here. 
                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        We won the championship. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I didn’t watch. 

           He takes a deep breath. Tries to find the right words... 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I want to start over. I’m done. 
                        Done forever. No more football. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Get out. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane... please... I was wrong. You 
                        were right. Let’s go to the house. 
                        Right now. Forget everything. Start 
                        over.

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        House? I sold the house.

           His face drops.

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        You never wanted it. Not really. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        That’s not true. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        It is. 
                             (a deep breath)
                        Atticus, it was me. 

           Kendrick wasn’t bluffing. 

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        I did it. I told them everything. 
                        It’s over. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        How... Diane... 

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        Because I love you. I still love 
                        you. I always will. I’m not leaving 
                        you... I’m saving you. Atticus, 
                        you’re drowning. You’re so far 
                        underwater you can’t even see the 
                        surface. You have been for months. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT'D)
                        For years. I’m not doing this for 
                        me... I’m doing it for you.

           Atticus is speechless.

                                 DIANE ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        It’s one thing to lose yourself. 
                        But other people are getting hurt. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Diane...

                                 DIANE ARCHER
                        I want you to walk out that door 
                        and get as far away from here as 
                        possible. 

           INT. KENDRICK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Kendrick is on his computer. We see the cover of the report: 
           Auburn Football Investigation. He saves the file. 

           Loads an email he has prepared for SWANNER. Presses SEND. 

           Begins to pack up the last of his office. His work here is 
           done. He won. 

           INT. ATTICUS’ HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Have you ever woken up on the morning you’re going to die? 

           Atticus does. Strangely calm. Resigned. He’s had time to 
           process everything.  He checks BURNER. No messages. 

           Turns on ESPN, expecting to see a report: Nothing. They’re 
           live in Auburn to cover the championship parade.  

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Geoff hiding in a motel. Peering out between the shades as he 
           picks up his phone and dials Atticus.   

                                 GEOFF
                        The fuck is going on? Haven’t heard 
                        anything.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        Neither have I... 
           INT. SWANNER’S OFFICE - DAY 

           TAP TAP TAP. 

           Kendrick sits in Swanner’s office. He’s waiting. Rapping a 
           pencil against his chair. 

           From down the hall-- CLICK CLACK CLICK CLACK. Swanner enters 
           the room. Sits behind her desk. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        Thomas, good morning. 

           He adjusts himself in the seat. She’s being strangely 
           nonchalant. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER (CONT’D)
                        I read your report last night. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        And? 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        You’re promoted. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        When’s the press release going out?

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        What press release?

                                 KENDRICK
                        About Auburn... the sanctions. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        What sanctions? 

                                 KENDRICK
                        I don’t understand... aren’t we 
                        coming down on Auburn?

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        At this time, the NCAA sees no 
                        actionable issues as outlined in 
                        the report. As such, the 
                        investigation will be... ongoing. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        I don’t... 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        Who do you work for? 
                                 KENDRICK
                        I work for you. 

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        That’s right. And who do I work 
                        for? You’re grown up. Ask yourself 
                        what’s best for the NCAA. Is two 
                        SEC schools sanctioned within a 
                        calendar year good for the NCAA? To 
                        have the FBI launch another 
                        investigation? They come looking 
                        again and you and I are out of a 
                        job. 

                                 THOMAS KENDRICK
                        The NCAA’s responsibility is to be 
                        unbiased in our assessment of...

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        Thomas. Please. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        If we took action based on the 
                        report... I mean, it could change 
                        everything.

                                 SARAH SWANNER
                        Why would we want anything to 
                        change? 

           She SMILES. 

           INT. AUBURN MAIN STREET - MORNING 

           Atticus walks Main Street with Reis. The parade passing by.  

                                 BARRY REIS
                        They’re not doing anything. They 
                        sent Kendrick because they didn’t 
                        want him to find anything. Didn’t 
                        think he could. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        The paper pusher...

                                 BARRY REIS
                        And they still got us. Sloppy.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        And Kendrick? He’s complicit in 
                        this?  
                                 BARRY REIS
                        What do you think happened? It’s 
                        the NCAA... He got promoted. 
                        Probably making an extra couple 
                        hundred K. We’re all pawns in our 
                        own way. 

           Atticus shakes his head. The marching band continues to 
           sound. Blue and orange balloons everywhere. 

                                 BARRY REIS (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck cares about him? You 
                        can get out of here. Wash your 
                        hands. No one will ever know. Life 
                        goes on. Atticus...
                             (a long pause)
                        You’re free. 

           Close on Atticus’ eyes. They don’t look like the eyes of a 
           free man.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT 

           Those same eyes staring at the diner crowd. Auburn gear 
           everywhere... everyone drunk in the glory of a championship 
           parade. 

           Atticus sits at his customary table drinking a glass of 
           chocolate milk. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH (O.S.)
                        Where the hell have you been? 

           UPCHURCH hurries into her seat. Atticus says nothing. Takes a 
           long sip of his milk. 

                                 RACHEL UPCHURCH (CONT’D)
                        Atticus... 

           He finally looks up at her. And suddenly... she knows. 

           It’s time.

                        The NCAA and Auburn have responded 
                        with a joint lawsuit claiming 
                        defamation. Archer plans to testify 
                        in court in what could be a 
                        landmark case in the debate around 
                        amateurism in athletics. 

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY 

           Atticus is on the stand.

           An expectant silence as he takes a deep breath. Looks 
           around... begins... 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I spent my life thinking I was

                        I’ve come to realize over the last 
                        year, and what I hope to share with 
                        you, is that I was actually just 
                        one small cog in the NCAA’s 
                        machine...

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FIELD - DAY

           A public bus pulls to a stop. MS. FLUKER gets off. Makes her 
           way to-- Chance’s high school field. She climbs into the 
           stands where she first met Atticus.

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        That my actions were feeding into 
                        their system and hurting the very 
                        people I was trying to help.

           She watches Chance coach. His leg still in a LARGE BRACE. He 
           still smiles.  
           EXT. MULGA CITY COLLEGE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

           Ricky’s hair is long again. Flowing once again. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        The system corrupts, turning good 
                        and well intentioned people into 
                        something they’re not... 

           He sits with BILL. They watch as FRANCIS practices.  

           INT. BENNY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           Benny moving back in with his parents. He carries a box into 
           his room. Sets it down. Looks up at--

           An old Auburn poster on the wall. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        The only way I can truly help them 
                        after all the wrong that’s been 
                        done, is to take myself down with 
                        the ship.

           EXT. CAROLINA COAST - HOUSE - EVENING

           Diane sits outside her NEW HOME. A smaller cottage on the 
           coast. She closes her eyes as the wind picks up. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        Even after all of this horror... 
                        everything that happened over the 
                        past year... the NCAA wants to 
                        sweep it under the rug and let it 
                        keep going... 

           INT. NCAA MEETING ROOM - DAY

           SWANNER watches as a new group of employees give bull shit 
           presentations in front of the room. SHE SMILES.  

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        Because if anything changes, they 
                        lose hundreds of millions of 
                        dollars.  
           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER
                        I know that today I’m testifying 
                        things that the NCAA can’t survive.

           KENDRICK is in the audience. He’s going to testify. 

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (CONT’D)
                        My Dad used to say if you love 
                        something, you have to let it go. 
                        He told me that when I couldn’t 
                        play any longer. I never understood 
                        it. Always made sense to me that if 
                        you loved something, you gave your 
                        life for it. But I get it now. I 
                        know what he meant. 

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Welcome back Tiger fans! This is 
                        Frankie and the Tank... live from 
                        Jordan-Hare stadium.

           We’re back at JORDAN-HARE STADIUM. Opening day. Same as all 
           the others. Same as they always will be.

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        It’s a beautiful day to start the 
                        2019 season. We’re so glad you’re 
                        with us. 

           We drift away.... Higher and higher into the sky until all we 
           can see is the facade of the stadium...

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        So before everything, before I tell 
                        you my story. Let me start with 
                        this statement. It’s something I 
                        told thousands of young men and 
                        their families. It’s something that 
                        was told to me a long, long, time 
                        ago. And... it’s something I 
                        believed with all my heart.

           Its long shadow covering the rest of the town...

           SLAM TO BLACK

                                 ATTICUS ARCHER (V.O.)
                        I believe in Auburn Tigers 
                        Football. 

           END
