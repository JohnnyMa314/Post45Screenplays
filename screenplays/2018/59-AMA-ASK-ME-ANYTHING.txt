          GOOD FEAR
           OPEN ON:

           Gossip magazines.

           An endless sea of them. 

           A lengthy spread on a coffee table.

           US Weekly, InTouch, Enquirer, Star.

           Celebrities. Sex. Mockery. Melodrama. Far-fetched plots and 
           open secrets. 

           These aren’t just coffee table adornments. There are PILES. 
           Trade magazines too -- Billboard, Rolling Stone. Back issues 
           for all of them.

           We are in the LIVING ROOM of a PUBLICIST -- A cramped 
           apartment in Hollywood.

           MARGO, 29, sits at a small desk, on her laptop. She’s 
           doubletasking -- responding to an email while checking her 
           makeup on her Macbook’s PHOTO BOOTH.

           The computer’s tiny GREEN CAMERA LIGHT shines back at her.

           She’s sweet-looking, almost gentle. 

           Remember that soft-spoken person you did an internship with 
           when you first moved to LA? That person who was too sincere, 
           too nice, too Midwestern, and moved back home within a year?

           That’s Margo. But she never moved. She stayed and is now a 
           junior publicist.

           She finishes writing an email with one hand, holding 
           concealer in the other. Presses send. 

           Closes the computer’s Photo booth. The green light turns OFF.

           She walks to the bathroom to touch up her makeup in a real 
           mirror. We STAY on the computer.

                                 MARGO (O.S.)
                        Oof.

           A busy desktop, the default wallpaper of a mountain. A stock 
           image of a National Park she’ll never have time to visit.

           Prompted by nothing, the green camera light TURNS BACK ON.

           Watching.

           The mountain on her desktop DISSOLVES TO--
           ANOTHER MOUNTAIN -- SOMEWHERE ELSE

           But this isn’t a real landscape. We’re looking at a poster. 
           An older man stands stoically in front of a Western vista. 

           The man is DAVID DOLLAR, late 50’s. Part Johnny Cash, part 
           Marlboro man. Sophisticated and old school. A true legend.

           This is a poster for a music documentary. 

           A few people pass by.

           We’re in the lobby of a screening room in West Hollywood. 
           People are leaving the theater. 

           Additional posters, with art from his older albums stand 
           alongside as decoration. They go decades back.

           It’s clear that this documentary is a career retrospective. A 
           victory lap.

           He’s a crooner, Sinatra with a cowboy hat. There’s an old-
           fashioned sensibility to it all, with his look and the overt 
           Americana bearing tribute to an era long gone.

           In the older albums, he is devastatingly handsome.

           MARGO passes the poster, holding a thick wad of papers.

           She’s picking up press kits left by the journalists leaving 
           the theater -- discarded like trash.

           She walks towards the other side of the room, passing a group 
           of journalists -- she slows down to eavesdrop:

                                 CARDIGAN
                        David Dollar? In 2018? Who cares?

                                 BEARDSTER
                        They’re releasing another greatest 
                        hits album. Again.

                                 NEWSBOY CAP
                        And they’re doing this comeback 
                        awards push. It’s kind of gross.

           The three journalists notice Margo noticing them. They see 
           her pile of press kits and promptly hand them back to her. 

                                 MARGO
                        No - I’m not--

           Margo stops, doesn’t want to make a scene. She takes their 
           press kits. 
                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           The journalists walk off. 

           Margo walks to the other side of the room to NATALIE, 40’s, 
           her boss. Natalie is the image of a quintessential publicist: 
           powerful, sleek, intimidating. A tigershark in a pantsuit.

           Natalie’s replying to an email on her phone. Fingers tapping.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Yikes.

                                 NATALIE
                        I know. Got a long road ahead of us 
                        on this one.
                             (then)
                        TV Guide passed on the feature.

                                 MARGO
                        TV Guide?? Man. We are screwed. 

                                 NATALIE
                        The good news is nobody can back 
                        out of this Q&A. You should 
                        probably get going.

                                 MARGO
                        Starts at five, right?

                                 NATALIE
                        Yeah, but you should get there a 
                        little early. I still don’t think 
                        he understands what we’re doing. 
                        He’ll need some hand holding. 

           Natalie goes back to her phone.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to go with but I have some 
                        fires to put out. The usual 
                        suspects.

           Beat.

                                 MARGO
                        You don’t -- you don’t think Tori 
                        could cover for me, do you? She’s 
                        honestly the best at these Q&A’s.
                                 NATALIE
                        Tori’s in Palm Springs for the 
                        week. And Davey requested you 
                        specifically.

                                 MARGO
                        What? Really? I’ve only met him in 
                        person once.

                                 NATALIE
                        You must have left an impression. 
                             (then)
                        I think he was Married to a Margo 
                        once. A model or something.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s so weird. I walked him down 
                        a carpet last month but that’s it.

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo. You are not like most 
                        publicists. You are this... 
                        beautiful, delicate little 
                        creature. Most of us - well, we 
                        tend to come off a bit cold 
                        blooded. 

                                 MARGO
                        You’re the biggest softie I know.

           This is not true. Natalie laughs.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’ve said it since day one: you’re 
                        way too nice to be a publicist. 
                             (beat)
                        Which - happens to make you a very 
                        appealing one.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s a nice way of calling me a 
                        pushover.

                                 NATALIE
                        You’re also a certified hottie. 
                        He’s getting grey, but he’s still a 
                        man. Old habits die hard.

                                 MARGO
                        He’s like America’s dad. Ew.

           Natalie raises an eyebrow.
                                 NATALIE
                        America’s Grandad by now.

           Margo looks at the older albums: the tragedy of a handsome 
           man getting old.

                                 MARGO
                        Yeah. He’s pushing it.

                                 NATALIE
                        But you’ll be fine. He’s a hoot. 
                        Harmless.
                             (a moment, then)
                        Your laptop charged?

           Margo grabs her laptop from her bag. Opens it up.

                                 MARGO
                        Yup.

                                 NATALIE
                        Perfect. You have the address?

           Margo pauses - notices the green camera light on her laptop 
           is still on. Weird. 

                                 MARGO
                        Yeah.

                                                              MATCH TO:

           A GREEN TRAFFIC LIGHT

           And we’re--

           ABOVE LOS ANGELES - LATE AFTERNOON

           The sun sits low in the sky - making everything gold and 
           saturated. The hills, with the sun behind them, begin to form 
           an ominous, dark outline.

           A narrow, twisting road cuts through the haze like an artery. 

           We follow a pair of headlights as they twist through 
           Coldwater Canyon, headed into the Hollywood hills -- 

           A modest Honda Civic.

           IN THE CAR

           Margo drives along. Listening to a song - it’s old sounding. 
           A male voice. Haunted and pained. Timeless.
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SAME

           The car continues its winding path, passing million dollar 
           houses and yards.

           Various landscapers pack up their trucks, finishing up a 
           day’s work of keeping the grass green and the hedges trimmed.

           INSIDE THE CAR

           A long beat on Margo’s face, her deer-in-the-headlights eyes. 

           Natalie’s description feels apt - Margo looks small. Fragile, 
           even. A little girl, in a shitbox car, driving past some of 
           the most expensive real estate in the world.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Margo pulls up to THE HOUSE.

           It’s beautiful, vast, and sprawling. Unlike some of the other 
           mansions, there are no hedges or walls. 

                                 MARGO
                        Wow.

           The size of it should tell you a lot about David’s career. 
           His glory days may be over, but man, he had some serious 
           glory days.

           The car pulls into the driveway.

           She parks behind a vintage Ford Roadster. It’s in perfect 
           condition. A classic.

           She takes off her headphones, reaches into her purse. Pops a 
           Xanax. Breathes.

           She’s nervous.

           EXT. THE HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Margo approaches the door. There’s a large brass KNOCKER.

           She grabs it, knocks awkwardly. 

           The sound reverberates.

           She waits.

           Looks around the entrance, taking it in.
           It’s an enormous house - he probably didn’t hear the knock.

           She knocks again, HARDER, and the door swings ajar, jostled 
           open by the knock. 

           She looks around. Is anyone here?

                                 MARGO
                             (into the house)
                        Hello?

           Nothing. 

           She steps inside.

           INT. THE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Margo enters - spins around, taking it all in. Taxidermied 
           animals stand locked in a frozen snarl.

           There’s some modern touches, but it’s largely classic. Brass 
           statues. Paintings. Old money, old Hollywood. Regal.

                                 MARGO
                             (nearly a shout)
                        HELLO?

                                 DAVEY (O.S.)
                             (as if right behind her)
                        Hello there.

           She turns. A man emerges from a corner, stepping out of a 
           shadow. 

           And there he is. DAVID DOLLAR. Living legend. In person, he 
           looks a bit older, more frail than he does on his album art. 
           He’s wearing a smoker’s jacket. 

                                 MARGO
                        Mr. Dollar! It’s Margo. I’m here to 
                        moderate your AMA. It’s nice to 
                        meet you.

           They shake hands.

                                 DAVEY
                        We’ve met before. Call me Davey. 

                                 MARGO
                        Davey. Well - if that counts as 
                        meeting. That was for 30 seconds.
                                 DAVEY
                        Oh. I remember. 

           Despite his age, there’s still a twinkle in his eye, the same 
           spark of that young man we saw in the posters. Margo works 
           with celebrities every day but Davey is - different. An icon.

           There’s something almost off-putting about his warmth: the 
           freewheeling abandon of someone with nothing left to prove 
           and zero fucks to give. 

           Margo is visibly nervous. And he can tell. 

                                 MARGO
                        Your house is beautiful.

                                 DAVEY
                        When I moved to California a 
                        lifetime ago, I lived out of my car 
                        for two years. Promised that if I 
                        made something of myself I’d live 
                        comfortably. 

           Davey studies her - she’s awestruck by the size of it all. 
           He’s quite charmed by this.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        You want a tour? We have a few. 

           Margo looks at him. The answer is clearly yes.

           INT. THE HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Davey and Margo walk on - a narrow hallway.

           They pass a series of framed pictures throughout the years, 
           of Davey with different dignitaries, artists, and legends -- 
           a who’s who of the music industry.

                                 DAVEY
                        Moved here in the mid 80’s. Not too 
                        long after Renegade. The big 
                        selling point was its former 
                        residents: Rudolph Valentino, Jean 
                        Harlow, Harold Lloyd.

                                 MARGO
                        Wow.

                                 DAVEY
                        Had to gut a lot of it. Wasn’t all 
                        built to code. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVEY (CONT'D)
                        Felt like we were destroying 
                        history but sometimes you gotta 
                        move past sentiment.
                             (then)
                        Many of the original elements are 
                        still here - the stained glass, 
                        wrought iron. I’d like to think the 
                        soul of the house remains.

                                 MARGO
                        History with an updated kitchen. 
                        Must be a million people who’d like 
                        to take this off of your hands.

                                 DAVEY
                        You care for real estate?

                                 MARGO
                        Me? No. I like HouseHunters, 
                        daydreaming on Zillow. But that’s 
                        not - 
                             (ugh)
                        I mean I’d love to buy a condo in 
                        the next few years, but - the 
                        prices here are murder.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m familiar. 
                             (then)
                        Here -- 

           INT. FURTHER IN THE HOUSE - HALLWAY

           Davey leads Margo further in. It’s labyrinthine. Like the 
           Overlook hotel.

                                 DAVEY
                        There are six bedrooms, ten 
                        bathrooms, two dining areas. Don’t 
                        entertain much these days. 

           Margo takes it all in. He looks at her, as if anticipating 
           her next question:

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a big place to live alone, 
                        haven’t been married in a decade. 
                        No kids. But there are memories 
                        here. Don’t want to downsize those.

                                 MARGO
                        Of course.
           They turn a corner, to see A MAN pointing a gun at them.

           Margo jumps. Davey chuckles.

                                 DAVEY
                        A gift from Madame Tussaud’s.

           It’s a WAX FIGURE of young Davey, in full cowboy garb. He’s 
           pointing a revolver. It’s uncanny.

                                 MARGO
                        Jesus.
                             (beat)
                        That is so... Realistic.

                                 DAVEY
                        I hope so. I’d like to think it 
                        keeps the intruders away.

           They both stare at the wax figure.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t think they got my nose right. 
                        Other than that, pretty good.

           The corner leads to a LIVING ROOM, filled with memorabilia. A 
           temple, filled with relics of the past. 

           You'll see a lot of things that say Renegade -- the name of 
           his most successful album, and seemingly, his cowboy persona.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        The life I’ve lived. You almost 
                        wouldn’t believe it.

           Davey turns to a screen panel in the wall with several room 
           controls. It looks complicated. Smarthome stuff.

           He presses different buttons. The lights cycle on and off 
           indiscriminately. It’s clear he has no idea what he’s doing.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit.

           The changes get more drastic. The lights change colors. A 
           flatscreen TV pops out of the wall. Music starts playing 
           through speakers. Margo can’t help but laugh.

                                 MARGO
                        You want some help?
                                 DAVEY
                        Trying to turn on the fireplace.  
                        As you can see, I’m something of a 
                        luddite.

                                 MARGO
                        What does that mean?

                                 DAVEY
                        It means I miss light switches.

           Margo goes to the panel. Presses a few buttons. The fireplace 
           turns on. The flatbed kind. It’s nice.

           Above the fireplace, framed platinum records.

                                 MARGO
                        I loved these when I was a kid. 
                        Still do.

                                 DAVEY
                        Have a favorite?

           Margo pauses. She works with enough artists to know what he’s 
           really asking: Do you give a shit? 

           A test.

                                 MARGO
                        I mean Renegade’s a classic. Some 
                        of the songs on Honeytrap are super 
                        catchy but it’s a little...

                                 DAVEY
                        Sexist. You can say it. 

           Margo laughs.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I had just gone through a divorce. 
                        It’s embarrassing to look back on 
                        some of those now.

                                 MARGO
                        Yeah. Different Era.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m not proud of those lyrics, but 
                        I felt every word when I wrote ‘em. 
                        I don’t feel them anymore but it 
                        doesn’t change the past. Nothing 
                        ever does. 

           A moment. Then - 
                                 MARGO
                        Birdsong. The best album you made 
                        was Birdsong. I know it's not even 
                        the most popular but it's 
                        beautiful.
                             (then)
                        I still put it on when I’m having a 
                        bad day.

           Davey smiles, nods. That was a very good answer.

           Margo’s phone beeps. It’s an iCAL reminder for the Q&A.

                                 DAVEY
                        Is that our cue?

           INT. THE HOUSE - VARIOUS HALLWAYS AND CORRIDORS

           A series of extreme WIDES as Margo and Davey walk on. They’re 
           headed towards the front of the house.

                                 DAVEY
                        So tell me - how does this work?

                                 MARGO
                        We’ll both be on the same web page 
                        and I’ll be fielding the questions 
                        as they come in. There’s gonna be a 
                        lot so we can pick and choose which 
                        ones to answer.
                             (then)
                        I’m pretty good and picking ‘em. 
                        Some are going to be goofy, some 
                        will make you cringe, but it’s 
                        usually pretty fun.

                                 DAVEY
                        You’re doing the typing?

                                 MARGO
                        Right. You dictate, I type.

                                 DAVEY
                        How’d they pick you to do these?

                                 MARGO
                        Well, I’m one of the younger 
                        publicists, so I’m more tech savvy. 
                        I also clock in at about 120 words 
                        per minute.

                                 DAVEY
                        Typing?
           Margo nods. Davey’s impressed. 

           They head upstairs. Davey’s very slow on the steps. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Destroyed my knee in a motorcycle 
                        accident a few years back. Suppose 
                        I’m older than I’d like to admit.

           Margo smiles.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Which publication is it?

                                 MARGO
                        It’s being hosted through a site 
                        called Reddit, but the label’s 
                        going to be tweeting links to all 
                        of your answers - kind of like a CC 
                        on an email.

                                 DAVEY
                             (no fucking clue)
                        What?

                                 MARGO
                        It means, with any luck, we’ll have 
                        a big audience.

           The two enter a dark corridor. A LARGE MAN wearing a surgical 
           mask appears out of nowhere. Margo SCREAMS.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 DAVEY
                        Julio. My security guard and 
                        assistant. He has the flu.

                                 JULIO
                             (under mask)
                        Sorry.

           Julio tuns, leaves. Margo notices he has a handgun holstered 
           on his hip.

                                 DAVEY
                        He’s licensed, of course. Had a 
                        stalker incident a few years ago. 

                                 MARGO
                        What happened?
                                 DAVEY
                        Some deranged fan broke in. I was 
                        out of town, but they stole a bunch 
                        of my clothes, personal items. Left 
                        me little notes throughout the 
                        house. Took me the better part of a 
                        year to find them all.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s freaky.

                                 DAVEY
                        So you’ll notice --

           Davey knocks on a nearby window.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Hurricane glass. Bulletproof. Fixed 
                        windows. Need a key fob for every 
                        door besides the front one.

                                 MARGO
                        Put as much time into a place like 
                        this, it’s important to feel safe.

                                 DAVEY
                        With someone like me. Everyone 
                        wants a piece of you. 
                             (beat)
                        Well, they used to, anyway. Sounds 
                        like you haven’t had any luck 
                        pitching me.

           Margo smiles - uneasy.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Here we are.

           INT. THE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           The two enter. It’s a rich man’s idea of a study -- more so a 
           library, filled with large bookshelves, a couch, and a desk.

           Giant windows look out over the front lawn and give a 
           breathtaking panoramic view of the city.

           The sun has finished setting, the orange-blue glow of 
           Hollywood shines against the dusk.

                                 MARGO
                        Each room in this house really 
                        outdoes itself. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGO (CONT'D)
                             (faux-exasperation)
                        God, PLEASE let me be a homeowner!

                                 DAVEY
                        Well, this room’s my favorite. If 
                        we’ll be doing this for a while, 
                        might as well be comfortable.

           Davey walks to a decanter and pours himself a drink.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Scotch?

                                 MARGO
                        Oh - no. Try not to drink while I

                        Work?
                             (beat)
                        We’re spending an hour on Facebook. 

                                 MARGO
                        It’s work for me. And it’s not on 
                        Facebook.

                                 DAVEY
                        Well - we’re answering questions. 
                        They want honesty right? Think 
                        having something to wet the whistle 
                        will help me out. 

           Margo smiles. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t make an old man drink 
                        alone.

           He looks at her. Winks.

           Margo caves, nods. Davey is old but he is a charming 
           motherfucker.

           He pours her a scotch, hands it to her.

           She takes a sip. Nods.

                                 MARGO
                        Wow. Yeah. 

           Margo’s phone beeps again. It’s 5:00. Time to start. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Can I sit at the desk?
                                 DAVEY
                        Of course. 

           Davey sits at the couch as Margo takes out her laptop and 
           situates herself on the desk. 

                                 MARGO
                        So your email should have the link 
                        to the page. Questions will start 
                        flying in, so let me know if 
                        there’s any you’d like to answer - 
                        and I’ll dictate your response. 
                        I’ll flag ones I like.

           Davey opens the page on his tablet. It’s all geared up.

                                 DAVEY
                             (reading)
                        Hello internet, I am David Dollar, 
                        singer, songwriter, and record 
                        producer. I’ll be answering 
                        questions from 5-6 PST with the 
                        help of Margo here. You can see me 
                        in my upcoming documentary "Last 
                        Train to Nowhere", released on 
                        streaming platforms next Friday -- 
                        and hear me on my latest album 
                        Greatest Hits Volume IV.
                             (beat)
                        Ask me anything.

                                 MARGO
                        You ready? 

           Davey takes a sip of his scotch. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Showtime.

           Margo logs on as “David” -- a little ONLINE icon pops up next 
           to his username, indicating that he has entered the Q&A. 

           Questions start pouring in immediately.

           Davey looks at his iPad, a little overwhelmed.

           Reads over a few questions.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        “Would you rather fight 100 duck 
                        sized-horses, or one horse sized 
                        duck?”

           He looks at Margo.
                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 MARGO
                        I told you - some of these are 
                        going to be silly. And the idea is 
                        that they can ask you anything.

                                 DAVEY
                        I hate the internet.

           Margo laughs.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Okay -- 

           READER’S NOTE: Whenever Davey answers a question, Margo 
           dictates as he speaks. It won’t be called out each time. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I suppose I’d rather fight one 
                        horse-sized duck. In a fight, 
                        always bet on the swarm. There’s 
                        strength in numbers and they could 
                        overtake me like nothing.

           Margo’s hands move like a concert pianist’s. She’s really 
           good at this. 120 words per minute is FAST.

                        How is this supposed to help my 
                        movie?

           Margo posts his answer, smiles.

                                 DAVEY
                        I need more scotch. 

           A SERIES OF JUMP CUTS:

                                 MARGO
                        Okay -- “are there any records you 
                        regret putting out?”

           She looks at him. Honeytrap?
                                 DAVEY
                        No. But Memory is self serving. 
                        Have to believe I made all of the 
                        right choices. You’ve gotta have a 
                        selective memory in this business. 
                        Otherwise, it’s too painful. Next.

           LATER:

                                 MARGO
                        “Say, you die, go to heaven and you 
                        could punch anyone you ever worked

                        it at all. 

                                 MARGO
                        You... want me to type that? He’s 
                        still around.

                                 DAVEY
                        Please. I’ve got nothing to be 
                        scared of. Final answer.

           THEN:

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        “What do you think of Bono?”

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        No comment.

                                 MARGO
                        “What’s wrong with music today?”

                                 DAVEY
                        The internet. Nobody wants to pay 
                        artists anymore. So artists are 
                        making music that’s not worth 
                        paying for. It’s lazy.

                                 MARGO
                        “What contemporary music do you 
                        like?”

                                 DAVEY
                        None. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVEY (CONT'D)
                        Ed Sheeran is catchy. But so is the 
                        ebola virus.

                                 MARGO
                        “What is your biggest regret?”

                                 DAVEY
                        Don’t have a big one. But most of 
                        my small ones involve women. 

                                 MARGO
                        “What’s the thing nobody tells you 
                        about being famous?”

           Davey exhales. Really thinks.

                                 DAVEY
                        Living a life like mine. You walk 
                        in a room. Everybody’s already got 
                        an idea about you. Probably the 
                        wrong idea too. After that first 
                        album came out. I never made a 
                        first impression ever again. 

           He leans in, changes his tone. Like he’s imparting a secret. 
           This guy knows how to work a room. A showman.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Say we were in prison. And they 
                        really wanted to punish you. They’d 
                        put you in isolation. If they 
                        really want to mess with your head, 
                        they put you in isolation for a 
                        long time. And being a celebrity - 
                        that’s what it’s like. It’s a life 
                        sentence in an isolation tank.
                             (then)
                        And that’s why people go crazy. 
                        Elvis. Michael Jackson. Britney. 
                        That Kanye Fellow. It’s not the 
                        drugs, or the money. It’s the glass 
                        wall. 

                                 MARGO
                        Wow.

                                 DAVEY
                        Am I speaking out of turn?

                                 MARGO
                        No. Usually people are too afraid 
                        to rock the boat and don’t say 
                        anything interesting. I have a 
                        feeling this’ll be a good one. 
           LATER:

           Margo is bent over, hooking up a cable from her computer to a 
           PROJECTOR in the study. 

           She’s fumbling with the chord, you can tell she’s had two 
           glasses of scotch.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Ok!

           Margo’s desktop is now projected onto a screen on one of the 
           walls. This house has everything.

                                 DAVEY
                        Thank you. Easier on the eyes.

           She goes back to the computer. Adjusts herself.

           But Davey isn’t looking at the projector, or his iPad. He 
           looks to Margo for the next prompt.

           Margo re-reads a question. Something’s thrown her.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 MARGO
                        “What does Margo look like?”
                             (then)
                        It’s one of the most upvoted 
                        questions.

                                 DAVEY
                        Come again?

                        Nobody’s ever asked though.

                                 DAVEY
                        Ah. Well - let’s give the people 
                        what they want, right?

           Beat. Margo Obliges, gets ready to type.

                        Margo...

           Davey looks Margo up and down.

           His gaze lingers. 

           It’s strangely tense. Margo looks uncomfortable.

           It’s as if for the first time, she realized that she’s alone 
           with this man in this huge house.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        She’s really beautiful. Smart. 
                        Margo reminds me of a young Stevie 
                        Nicks. Almost demure. But I’ve 
                        already underestimated her.
                             (then)
                        I’ve worked with publicists for my 
                        entire life, I know their games. I 
                        know the tricks. But Margo feels 
                        different. She cares, honest to God 
                        cares which is rare in this city. I 
                        hope I don’t disappoint her. 

           Margo posts the response. Looks at him.

           Unsure how to take the compliment. 

                                 MARGO
                        Alright.

           A few comments pop up below his response.

           but is she hot tho?

           Hows that ass?

                        I have an idea. How about for every 
                        20 questions I answer, I get to ask 
                        you one.

                                 MARGO
                             (beat)
                        For the internet?

                                 DAVEY
                        No, just for me. For conversation. 

           Margo thinks. Seems harmless enough.
                                 MARGO
                        Okay. Sure.

                                 DAVEY
                        Do you like what you do?

                                 MARGO
                        Most of the time. 

                                 DAVEY
                        You really don’t seem like the 
                        publicist type. Can’t imagine you 
                        barking orders at people. 

                                 MARGO
                        I’m usually on the receiving end of 
                        the barks.

                                 DAVEY
                        Why do something so punishing if 
                        you’re not in love with it? 

                                 MARGO
                        It’s what I’m good at. It’s what I 
                        fell into. 

                                 DAVEY
                        So you hate it. 

           You can tell Margo’s speaking off the cuff here. Unguarded. 
           Remember, two drinks.

                                 MARGO
                        No. I like - thinking that I made a 
                        difference. Or changing someone’s 
                        mind. I like purpose. I don’t 
                        like... being a janitor.

                                 DAVEY
                        Cleaning up messes for people that 
                        won’t thank you.
                             (a beat; impressed)
                        There’s something about you I can’t 
                        put my finger on. What’s your 
                        endgame?

                                 MARGO
                        That - is a different question.

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay. Fair. My turn.
                             (reading)
                        “When did you know your glory days 
                        were over?”
           Ouch.

                                 MARGO
                        You don’t have to answer that.

                                 DAVEY
                        If you’ll be honest, I’ll be 
                        honest.
                             (takes a moment, thinks)
                        You ready?

           Margo readies her hands by the keyboard. He takes a breath.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        About 20 years ago. I was in a 
                        restaurant with a producer, 
                        discussing something that we were 
                        having trouble getting off the 
                        ground. It was going nowhere. I 
                        just didn’t know it yet. I saw a 
                        girl from across the room. She was 
                        so young, beautiful. Fresh. Looked 
                        something like Margo here.

           A moment. Margo keeps typing:

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        She came up to me, nervous. Asked 
                        for an autograph. Of course I 
                        pretended to be peeved, impatient, 
                        but let me tell you, when a certain 
                        kind of girl comes up to you - it 
                        is never a bother. As I was signing 
                        her napkin, she said, “This is for 
                        my mom. You’re her favorite 
                        singer.” And that’s when I knew. I 
                        wanted to be her favorite singer. 
                        And - I wasn’t. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s when I knew it was a matter 
                        of time.

           Davey looks down, finished. She posts his answer.

           Margo looks at him. This frail man in this large house, 
           surrounded with reminders of a young man’s life.

           And she actually feels bad for him.

                                 MARGO
                        Well, publicists can’t really have 
                        favorite artists, but you were 
                        always a staple growing up. 
           This makes Davey smile.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t even because of my mom. 
                        She was more of a Beatles gal. 

                                 DAVEY
                        They are the worst musicians in the 
                        world. John, that lucky son of a 
                        bitch got shot before his stock 
                        began to fall. Out in his prime, 
                        remembered forever. And here I am, 
                        fading away, promoting this dumb 
                        documentary.
                             (then)
                        How’d the press screening go? I 
                        never asked.

                                 MARGO
                        Good. Hard to get exact reactions 
                        but I think it was - positive. 

                                 DAVEY
                        You’re a bad liar. You need to get 
                        better about that.

                                 MARGO
                        I don’t fancy myself a liar.

                                 DAVEY
                        Publicists are the best 
                        storytellers in this town and they 
                        can’t even get nominated for 
                        awards. I mean that. But I know the 
                        doc or album won’t make a splash. 
                             (suddenly serious)
                        True artist’s gotta know when to 
                        call it. How to come to terms with 
                        their reign being over. Not much 
                        use thrashing in the water.

                                 MARGO
                        Let’s get back to the questions.

                                 DAVEY
                        Right.

                                 MARGO
                        “Singing or producing?”

                                 DAVEY
                        Singing. I am a showman at heart.
                                 MARGO
                        “What can you spill about partying 
                        in the 80’s?”

                                 DAVEY
                        We had fun.

           Margo re-reads another question, not out loud. 

           A long beat. Her eyes are glued to the computer. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        You ok?

           She doesn’t respond. Something’s clearly off. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the question?

                                 MARGO
                        “Did you beat the shit out of 
                        Elizabeth Kelly?”

                                 DAVEY
                        What?

           Margo refreshes the page, the question rises higher, buoyed 
           by upvotes.

                                 MARGO
                        It’s not worth answering. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Where did that come from?

                                 MARGO
                        There’s always trolls.
                             (already over it)
                        Finding you another one.

                                 DAVEY
                        I don’t want to get into that shit.

                                 MARGO
                        It’s spam.

           Davey thinks. Troubled by something.

                                 DAVEY
                        Now it looks like I have something 
                        to hide, doesn’t it?

                                 MARGO
                        Do you?
                                 DAVEY
                        No.

                                 MARGO
                        Then it’s a waste of your time. 
                        Answering it will just give it more 
                        attention.

                                 DAVEY
                        Maybe we should say something.

                                 MARGO
                        You asked for me to be here - and 
                        I’m saying, it’s not worth it.

                                 DAVEY
                        Can I play devil’s advocate?

                                 MARGO
                             (laughs)
                        “If you play devil’s advocate, you 
                        may find yourself advocating for an 
                        actual devil”.

                                 DAVEY
                        Advocating for the devil? Is that 
                        the publicist motto?

                                 MARGO
                        It’s my mantra for Reddit. And the 
                        internet at large.

                                 DAVEY
                        Are you drunk?

                                 MARGO
                        No.

           She isn’t, but she’s not perfectly sober either. She sits up.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        I do a lot of these Q&A’s. There’s 
                        a million rabbit holes and land 
                        mines you can step on. But I’ve 
                        found it best to not feed the 
                        trolls.
                             (then)
                        If you find yourself in a hole, 
                        stop digging.

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay, how about - 
                                 MARGO
                             (over, a little forceful)
                        We’re going to skip it. 

           This is the first time we’ve really heard Margo assert 
           herself. Davey takes note.

                                 DAVEY
                        Alright.

           Margo shakes her head - tries to snap out of it. Like when 
           you’re buzzed and try to focus your attention.

                                 MARGO
                        You didn’t hit her, right?

                                 DAVEY
                        Of course not.

                                 MARGO
                        Great. Moving on. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay. 

                                 MARGO
                        Have you ever been in love?

                                 DAVEY
                        What?

                                 MARGO
                        It’s one of the questions. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Oh. Let’s skip that one. I do have 
                        something to hide there.

           He winks at her.

                                 MARGO
                        “How is your day?”

                                 DAVEY
                        Good. Always nice to have a 
                        visitor. A woman’s energy makes my 
                        house feel so much more alive.

           Margo types his response. Sees a new post-

           Margo says nothing. Continues:

                                 MARGO
                        What’s your favorite line from a 
                        song you didn’t write?

                                 DAVEY
                        Pointed threats, they bluff with 
                        scorn
                        Suicide remarks are torn
                        From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the 
                        hollow horn
                        Plays wasted words, proves to warn
                        That he not busy being born is busy 
                        dying.
                             (then)
                        That’s Dylan. It’s why I want to 
                        punch him.

           Margo finishes the response to see a new post --

           ZAROFF404: Davey’s Address is 1175 Solar Drive - 90046

                                 MARGO
                        Holy shit. 

                                 DAVEY
                        I know. That prose can burn a hole 
                        right through you.

                                 MARGO
                        No - someone... someone posted your 
                        address.

           Beat.

                                 DAVEY
                        Delete it.

                                 MARGO
                        I can’t.

                                 DAVEY
                        What do you mean you can’t.

                                 MARGO
                        It’s a public forum. Reddit has a 
                        moderator. I can message him but - 
                        the answers are all posting to 
                        Twitter too.

                                 DAVEY
                        Who moderates Twitter?
                                 MARGO
                        No one.

           An ugly silence. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

                                 DAVEY
                        Jesus. Are you messaging-

                                 MARGO
                             (over)
                        I just did. 

                                 DAVEY
                        You said you do a lot of these. Has 
                        this ever happened before?

           Margo doesn’t say anything. The answer is clearly no.

           A ping from her computer. She looks - 

                                 MARGO
                        Okay - the Reddit moderator is 
                        going to delete it. They can ban 
                        this user too.

                                 DAVEY
                        Excellent.

                                 MARGO
                        Hold on. 

           She opens a Twitter tab she had open - picking up Davey’s 
           mentions.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. FUCK.

                                 DAVEY
                        What?

           Davey goes to her computer. SEVERAL screenshots of his 
           address show up on the twitter feed. Then -- GPS links... The 
           Google street view of his house...

           It’s starting to spread.

                                 MARGO
                        The first post’s deleted. 
                             (then, quietly)
                        But it looks like some people got a 
                        hold of it. 
                                 DAVEY
                        Cat’s out of the bag.

                                 MARGO
                        I’m so sorry. I’m sure we can try 
                        to take some of these down -- 

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s fine. I know I’m on some of 
                        those star maps.
                             (a smile)
                        Maybe I’ll have to put up some 
                        hedges after all. 

                                 MARGO
                        Sorry -- I’ll get this back on 
                        track. Let’s find a question about 
                        the album.

           Margo gets back to Reddit. A new message gets her attention.

           ZAROFF1139: 

           DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? I HAVE INFORMATION. AND I WILL KEEP 
           DUMPING IT OUT UNTIL YOU COME CLEAN. LET’S START WITH LIZ 
           KELLY. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES.

           AND DON’T THINK IT ENDS WITH HER. THIS WILL GET WORSE.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.

                                 DAVEY
                        Who is this asshole?

                                 MARGO
                        They blocked him but he just made a 
                        new account. 404 then, 1139.

                                 DAVEY

                             (beat)
                        The last four digits of my social 
                        security number.

           Margo sits back, reeling from this. Another warning shot.

           She grabs a bottle of water from her purse, chugging it, 
           trying to sober up.

           Another user’s post gets upvoted to the top. It’s a picture 
           of a young Davey and a beautiful woman who is clearly 
           ELIZABETH KELLY.
           It looks something like an early paparazzi photo. Davey’s 
           hand reaches towards the lens, trying to block it - but you 
           still get a clear view of Elizabeth. She’s really roughed up. 

           It looks like someone beat the shit out of her.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck did he get that?

                                 MARGO
                        We need to pull the plug.

                                 DAVEY
                        And leave people with this picture?

                                 MARGO
                        I’m calling my boss.

                                 DAVEY
                        What’s the protocol, MARGO?

           There’s a quiet anger in his voice. A coiled snake waiting to 
           strike.

                                 MARGO
                        Just... hold on...

           Margo steps away from the computer - walks into the 

           HALLWAY

           She dials her boss, phone to her ear.

           Ringing

           Ringing

           INT. CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Natalie answers her phone. She clicks her car’s hands-free 
           Bluetooth setup.

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo.

           INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

                                 MARGO
                        Natalie - something happened, and 
                        one of the users posted -

           IN THE CAR -
           Natalie is driving on COLDWATER CANYON. She’s in a near dead 
           zone. We hear small bits of dialogue come through but nothing 
           intelligible.

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo - I can’t hear you, I’m on 
                        Coldwater, reception is shit.

                        I’m sorry - I can’t make out 
                        anything.

                                 MARGO

                                 NATALIE
                        I’ll call you as soon as I’m on the 
                        other side. I’m sure you’re doing 
                        great.

           She hangs up.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Margo tenses her body - shaking.

           She calls Natalie again.

           It goes straight to voicemail.

           She lets out a small SCREAM.

           INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Margo walks in. Davey sits exactly where she left him.

                                 DAVEY
                        What’s the plan?

                                 MARGO
                        We need to stop.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m going to respond first.

                                 MARGO
                        I don’t think it makes any sense to 
                        engage.
                                 DAVEY
                        And let people make their own 
                        assumptions?

                                 MARGO
                             (over)
                        THIS IS A SITUATION.

                                 DAVEY
                        This is still manageable. But if 
                        you shut the laptop and we cancel 
                        this? Then we’ve got a situation.
                             (beat)
                        It’s a chicken-shit move. It’s 
                        going to make me look like I’m 
                        hiding something - and it’ll get 
                        you fired. You’re the captain of 
                        this ship, not me.

           Margo says nothing - her expression unreadable.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. You KNOW - we are in a time 
                        where an accusation is treated as a 
                        presumption of guilt. And hey, 
                        rightfully so. But if we back down, 
                        and try to spin this tomorrow, it’s 
                        going to make a stain. On me. On my 
                        career. And it’s a stain that I 
                        might not have time to remedy.

           Margo dials her boss on her cell again -- 

                                 MARGO
                        I don’t know, Davey.

                                 DAVEY
                        I didn’t touch her. 

           The call goes straight to voicemail. 

           She curses under her breath.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s the Streisand Effect. The more 
                        you try to hide something, the more 
                        it becomes publicized.

                                 MARGO
                             (what??)
                        Like - Barbara Streisand?
                                 DAVEY
                        You’re a publicist and you don’t 
                        know about the Streisand effect?

                                 MARGO
                        No - Why is it named after--

                                 DAVEY
                             (over)
                        This is only going to be a big deal 
                        if we make it a big deal. Five 
                        minutes are almost up. 

           Margo takes it in and breathes it out. Doesn’t have it in her 
           to say no. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay.

           Davey talks, Margo dictates.

                                 DAVEY
                        Did I beat up Elizabeth Kelly? Of 
                        course not. I remember - vividly - 
                        when that photo was taken. This is 
                        the first time I’ve seen it, and 
                        I’d be very curious to hear where 
                        you got it.

                        The reason she’s bruised in that 
                        photo is because she was in the 
                        middle of a bender. We were both 
                        doing this weeklong benefit 
                        concert. Elizabeth had been 
                        drinking for three days straight. 
                        One day she didn’t show up - and we 
                        found her in her dressing room, 
                        smelling like Bourbon and covered 
                        in blood.

                        She was 21. It was her second 
                        album. Her record label - her team, 
                        the head of the studio thought they 
                        had struck gold with her. Look at 
                        that face. A born star. A promising 
                        future. THE NEXT BIG THING.  So 
                        when they found out that she was 
                        pregnant, they convinced her to end 
                        it. They had just booked a yearlong 
                        tour around the country.

                        I’m not the first person to talk 
                        about such things. To say that the 
                        decisions about women’s bodies in 
                        the industry were often made in the 
                        interests of powerful men. Diet 
                        pills. Tranquilizers. And abortions 
                        as birth control - at least, what 
                        was mandated by labels, that 
                        supposedly stopped a while back. 
                        But - old habits die hard. 

           Davey takes a breath. Margo looks at him.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        They pressured her. It wasn’t 
                        contractual. It was her decision, 
                        and - it wasn’t. She terminated her 
                        pregnancy and hated herself for it. 
                        Hated herself for being subjected 
                        to the whims of other people. Men. 
                        Not owning her own body. 
                             (then)
                        Think she wanted to fuck herself up 
                        just to prove that she was in 
                        control. One morning she didn’t 
                        show up, and that’s when this was 
                        taken. See how the photo was taken 
                        in her dressing room? See how her 
                        mirror is broken? Look at her 
                        knuckles.

           Margo steals a glance to the picture. Opens it in a new tab 
           so she can see.

           Elizabeth’s knuckles are covered in blood and glass.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        She had punched the mirror seconds 
                        before the photo was taken. 
                             (beat)
                        So no, I wasn’t beating her. I was 
                        restraining her. She was hurting 
                        herself.

           Margo finishes typing - studies the photo. And you can’t un-
           see it. Davey is right. It’s clearly an image of him 
           restraining her.

           She’s typed out the response but hasn’t posted it yet.

                                 MARGO
                        Is Elizabeth Kelly still alive?
                                 DAVEY
                        No.

                                 MARGO
                        Are any of the other people in this 
                        story still alive? Is there anyone 
                        that could - 

                                 DAVEY
                        POST THE GODDAMN RESPONSE.

           This is the first time we’ve really heard Davey SHOUT - A far 
           cry from America’s handsome dad. It’s terrifying.

           Margo’s taken aback.

                                 MARGO
                        You want to speak publicly about 
                        label sponsored abortions, you are 
                        going to start a libel lawsuit.

                                 DAVEY
                        IT’S BEEN FIVE MINUTES.

                                 MARGO
                        I’m trying to protect you --

                                 DAVEY
                        THEN POST IT.

           Margo posts.

           Exhales.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay.

           A beat hangs in the air.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DAVEY
                             (suddenly calm again)
                        It’s alright.

                                 MARGO
                        I’m messaging the moderator, maybe 
                        they can ban his IP address.

           Comments begin pouring in under the response. It’s a 
           completely different picture once you know the context.
                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you won ‘em over.

                                 DAVEY
                             (smiles; what did you 
                              expect?)
                        “And the truth shall set you free.”

                                 MARGO
                        The user who leaked your address 
                        wasn’t even the one who asked about 
                        Elizabeth Kelly. He said he had way 
                        more. What dirt does this guy have?

                                 DAVEY
                        There is no dirt. It’s a bluff. 

                                 MARGO
                        He has information - what if he 
                        found something -

                                 DAVEY
                             (over)
                        There is NOTHING to find.

           Margo exhales. Thinks.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        There was that Equifax breach last 
                        year. I’m sure he found my address, 
                        and is using that to try and goose 
                        some confession out of me.

                                 MARGO
                        Why would you go to the trouble if 
                        he didn’t have... something? What’s 
                        the point?

                                 DAVEY
                        Honestly? Talking to people who’ve 
                        been around as long as I have? 
                        Abusive behavior and the 
                        entertainment industry aren’t 
                        exactly strange bedfellows. With 
                        everything that’s come out in the 
                        past year? I can think of ten of my 
                        peers who - who have some serious 
                        skeletons in the closet.

           An ugly pause.

           The question clearly ringing in Margo’s head:
                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking. How is 
                        that okay?

                                 MARGO
                        Right.

                                 DAVEY
                        It isn’t.

           The computer PINGS. A message from ZAROFF.

           THAT WAS SIX MINUTES. HERE’S MORE FOR THE READERS AT HOME.

           There are a three links after his message.

                                 MARGO
                        Oh my god. 

           She clicks one. 

           The first is 500 page Google Doc. She begins to scan it.

           These are Davey’s BANK STATEMENTS from the last 20 years. 

                                 DAVEY
                        What is it now?

                                 MARGO
                        He released more.

           For the first time, a helplessness in Davey’s voice. A fear:

                                 DAVEY
                        What did he say?

           The second link goes to a similar webpage. Whatever it is, it 
           takes a while to load.

           Margo opens a new tab and clicks on the third link.

           The third link loads quickly - it’s an itemized list of 
           websites and dates. Over 100 pages. It takes her a second.

           Davey’s COMPLETE INTERNET HISTORY.

                                 MARGO
                        Bank Statements - Your internet 
                        browsing history.

           Davey’s face betrays nothing.

           Margo goes back to the second tab, the page now loaded.
           It’s an indexed, searchable, INBOX.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        And your entire email inbox.

           In the blink of an eye, Davey GRABS his scotch glass and 
           THROWS it against the window.

           It’s no match for the hurricane glass. It crumbles like a 
           snowball.

                                 DAVEY
                        You have GOT to be FUCKING kidding 
                        me!!!

           He gets up and starts pacing. 

           Margo stays still. Stunned. Taken aback by his quickness and 
           hostility.

           MARGO’S PHONE RINGS

           It’s her boss.

           She runs back into the

           HALLWAY

                                 MARGO
                             (picking up)
                        Hey--

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo what the fuck is going on.

                                 MARGO
                        Someone posted David’s Address, and 
                        threatend to doxx him if he didn’t 
                        fess up.

                                 NATALIE
                        Fess up for what?

                                 MARGO
                        Someone posted a picture of 
                        Elizabeth Kelly and asked if he 
                        abused her.

                                 NATALIE
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 MARGO
                        No - he had a really good answer. 
                        Pull over and read it.
           A long pause.

           Margo inhales.

           Waits.

           Prays.

           For what feels like forever.

                                 NATALIE
                        You did the right thing.

           This is MUSIC to Margo’s ears.

           She almost cries.

                                 MARGO
                        He just did a huge file dump and. 
                        He says he has more.

                                 NATALIE
                        End it. You did the right thing 
                        with Elizabeth Kelly but - you 
                        don’t negotiate with terrorists.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay. I’ll call you back once we’re 
                        offline.

                                 NATALIE
                        We’ll recover from this.
                             (then)
                        I hope Davey does.

           Margo says nothing - a loss for words.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Margo enters the study, Davey’s at the window.

           There’s a few BYSTANDERS outside. An open-top STARLINE bus 
           seems to have parked in front of the house. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Got some rubberneckers.

                                 MARGO
                        That was fast.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGO (CONT'D)
                        I’m logging off, this has already 
                        gone off the rails.

           Margo checks the computer. Their AMA is at the top of the 
           front page of Reddit. DAVID DOLLAR is trending.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        At least you’re a trending topic on 
                        Twitter.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m sure everyone will buy the 
                        album now.

           Margo goes back to the Reddit window. 

           A new message from ZAROFF:

           DEAR PUBLICIST. BEAUTIFUL DEMURE MARGO.

           DO NOT END THIS Q&A. IF YOU LOG OFF THIS IS GOING TO GET MUCH 
           WORSE.

           THIS IS YOUR ONE WARNING: YOU HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME.

           Margo reads over the message, reads it again.

                                 MARGO
                             (to herself)
                        Skin in the game.

           Exhales.

           SHUTS THE LAPTOP.

           The little “online” icon next to Davey’s username turns off.

           WIDE ON THE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Davey’s still at the window.

           Margo sits for a moment, the laptop closed. 

           She takes a few deep breaths. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Okay. We’re going to handle this 
                        now. I’m going to call Natalie. 
                        I’ll tell her to come over and 
                        we’re -- we’re going to figure this 
                        out.

           Davey doesn’t say anything.
                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Is there anything - anything - that 
                        we should be worried about in those 
                        emails. Or those bank statements. 
                        Or your internet history. 

                                 DAVEY
                        You know what. There isn’t. 

                                 MARGO
                        Is there anything in there that 
                        someone could perceive to be 
                        troublesome?
                             (beat)
                        There’s NOTHING that could be a 
                        headline in there?

                                 DAVEY
                        I guess we’ll find out.

           Margo frowns.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like it but I think we 
                        should keep going. I can play 
                        hardball. I’ve lived an honorable 
                        life. I don’t have shit to answer 
                        for. I know my truth.

                                 MARGO
                        You really want more of your most 
                        personal info out there? Someone as 
                        private as you?

                                 DAVEY
                        Hell no. But quitting makes me look 
                        like I’m hiding from something. It 
                        looks like we backed down. 
                             (big here)
                        I don’t back down.

           For a moment, he looks like that glorious cowboy. Eyes on 
           fire:

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I never back down.

           Margo thinks.

                                 MARGO
                        You didn’t.
                             (then)
                        I did it for you.
           INT. THE HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER 

           Margo takes out her phone, calls Natalie. 

           She’s shaken, dreading this call.

           The phone rings. Anxiety mounting -- 

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo.  

                                 MARGO
                        It’s over --

                                 NATALIE
                             (over)
                        I am so sorry.

                                 MARGO
                        I know, this night has been hell.

                                 NATALIE
                        Absolutely nobody deserves that, 
                        least of all you.
                             (then)
                        Jesus Christ - I’m so sorry.

           Margo pauses. Something’s not right. Natalie pauses too.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                             (realizing)
                        You haven’t seen it. You didn’t see 
                        it, did you?

           A long, horrible beat.

                                 MARGO
                        See -- what?

                                 NATALIE
                        Oh God.

                                 MARGO
                        What!?

                                 NATALIE
                        Log back into the AMA. I’m on my 
                        way to David’s house. I’ll be there 
                        in -- 35 minutes. Fuck. Rush hour. 
                        45. I think.

                                 MARGO
                             (puts it together)
                        No...
                                 NATALIE
                        I’ll call the police. You just - 
                        stay on Davey.

           Margo hangs up. Runs into--

           INT. THE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           David is back at the Window, looking at his front yard.

                                 DAVEY
                        There’s more of them outside. 
                        Stopping by to see the train wreck.

           Margo ignores him, goes straight to her laptop.

           Opens Reddit.

           Her face goes WHITE.

           She continues looking at the page in disbelief. Panic 
           increasing by the second. She is MORTIFIED. And angry.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        What now?

           Margo breaks down. Hands in her face. Trying not to cry.

                                 MARGO
                        What the FUCK???

                                 DAVEY
                        Hey.

                                 MARGO
                             (muffled through hands)
                        Goddamnit.

           Davey goes back to the couch. Picks up the iPad.

           Zaroff embedded an image -- top of the Q&A. 

           It’s a PARTIALLY NUDE photo of Margo, taken on her iPhone. 

           She’s half covered in a bedsheet, touching herself.

                                 DAVEY
                        Jesus Christ.

           Back on Reddit: A message from Zaroff.

           MARGO. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT THERE ARE MUCH MORE DAMAGING 
           PHOTOS IN YOUR ICLOUD. VIDEOS TOO. 
           EVERY TIME YOU LOG OFF THIS AMA I WILL RELEASE MORE. SO I 
           RECOMMEND YOU KEEP THIS GOING.

           There’s a ton of comments under the picture.

           They’re... gross.

           It’s the internet...

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        How’d he get these?

                                 MARGO
                        He obviously hacked into my fucking 
                        icloud.

           Margo closes her eyes. Can’t bear to look at the screen.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        WHERE IS THE FUCKING MODERATOR??
                             (beat)
                        Not that it even MATTERS. Even if 
                        they delete his posts, the images 
                        aren’t hosted on Reddit. People 
                        have screenshots, and Twitter...

           Oh God. Twitter. She searches her name on Twitter.

           A LOT of people are posting the image.

                                 DAVEY
                        You’ve got some fans.

           Margo says nothing. Turning white with rage.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I mean. You look... good.

                                 MARGO
                        STOP. You need to stop that. 

                                 DAVEY
                        What?

                                 MARGO
                        THAT. The - suggestive, not 
                        flirting, but almost flirting. 
                        Whatever that is. Just please 
                        fucking stop.

           Beat.

           Davey crosses his arms.
                                 DAVEY
                        Okay Margo. You’re the expert. Tell 
                        me what we should do. 

           Margo exhales. Grabs another Xanax from her purse. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Is he right? Is there more where 
                        that came from? Does it get worse 
                        or is it more of the same?

                                 MARGO
                        It gets worse.
                             (beat)
                        It gets a lot worse.

                                 DAVEY
                        Margo. I didn’t take you for that 
                        kind of girl.

           Margo looks at him, like, fuck you.

                                 MARGO
                        I was dating a guy in New York. 
                        Long distance. You do what you have 
                        to. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay. Well. If you log off, you’re 
                        fucked. And if I stop, it looks 
                        like I’m hiding something. 
                             (then)
                        There’s no due process in the court 
                        of public opinion. We don’t have a 
                        choice here.

           Margo squares her jaw. Doesn’t want to concede that he’s 
           right.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to call his bluff. 

                                 MARGO
                        You’re sure it’s a bluff?

           A tense moment between them.

           Finally:

                                 DAVEY
                        Pointed threats, they bluff with 
                        scorn.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVEY (CONT'D)
                        You should lie down. I’ll type for 
                        a while.

           Margo goes on the couch. Davey takes over on the laptop.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                             (typing)
                        Does... anyone... have... any... 
                        questions... about... the... album?

           He types with his two index fingers, like an old person.

           Margo grabs her phone from her purse. It is BLOWING UP with 
           texts from friends and coworkers.

           Oh my god. // I’m so sorry // WTF IS HAPPENING // Are you 
           OK???

           Margo writes one text message to Natalie.

                                 MARGO 
                             (TEXT)
                        Please get in touch with the 
                        moderators. Have them delete what 
                        they can but DO NOT have them take 
                        down the page. DO NOT TAKE IT DOWN.

           She presses send. Then another text, an afterthought.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                             (TEXT)
                        I’m so sorry.

           She puts her phone down, all she can take. Turns to lie face 
           down on the couch. Head in the sand. She sees a small folded 
           piece of paper deep in the couch. She opens it:

                            EVERYTHING’S A LIE.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

                                 DAVEY
                        Oh you found one. Thought we got 
                        them all. Stalker left those all 
                        throughout the house.

                                 MARGO
                        What was his deal?
                                 DAVEY
                        He thought I was part of some 
                        global conspiracy or something. 
                        Usual crazy person nonsense.

           Margo studies the note. Wheels turning.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Something about being famous makes 
                        people connect dots that aren’t 
                        there. Paul’s not dead. Stevie 
                        Wonder’s not blind. We’re all in 
                        the illuminati. Everything’s a lie.

                                 MARGO
                        Is this guy..?

                                 DAVEY
                        Heard he killed himself not long 
                        after to get rid of the voices.
                             (beat)
                        So he’s not our guy.

                                 MARGO
                        Ah. Well - let me know if there’s 
                        anything else I should worry about.

                                 DAVEY
                        A user is saying that this is the 
                        most upvoted AMA of all time. We 
                        just beat Obama’s. 

                                 MARGO
                        Cool.

                                 DAVEY
                        And we’re still a trending topic. 
                        Go figure.

                             (muffled through couch)
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 DAVEY
                        That’s how you talk to your 
                        clients?

                                 MARGO
                        Look. This has quickly turned into 
                        the worst night of my life. I don’t 
                        know if I have a job anymore and 
                        those pictures aren’t going away. 
                        Sorry if I come off a little curt.

                        This is just a bad dream. This is 
                        just a bad fucking dream.

                                 DAVEY
                        Sweetheart. Look - I’m a different 
                        breed than these musicians today. I 
                        hate social media. Hate interviews. 
                        I only started doing press when I 
                        had to. I always thought the better 
                        they got to know you, the less 
                        interesting you became. I’ve spent 
                        the last forty or so years playing 
                        things close to the chest.
                             (then)
                        And look - I don’t have any sexual 
                        assault history, or anything hidden 
                        in those emails. But I’m feeling 
                        naked too.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s cute. Makes two of us.

           A silent moment.

                                 DAVEY
                        I have cancer.

                                 MARGO
                        What?
                             (beat)
                        Why didn’t you say anything?

                                 DAVEY
                        Didn’t want to brag.
                             (laughs)
                        My bank statements are out there 
                        now. Won’t take a detective to 
                        realize what recurring payments to 
                        KECK Cancer Center are for. Had it 
                        a few years ago, and it’s back. 
                        Bigger. Not looking good. 
                             (then)
                        So the retrospective, the album - 
                        all this. This is it. It’s the end 
                        of the line. 

                                 MARGO
                        Fuck Davey. I’m sorry.
                                 DAVEY
                        So I hope you’ll understand. I 
                        don’t want the last sentence on my 
                        Wikipedia page to be about some 
                        asswipe hacker starting some 
                        bullshit allegation.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s fair.

           Davey goes to the window, begins to pick up the glass shards 
           from his broken scotch glass.

                                 DAVEY
                        So I have a question. How come some 
                        of these people get away with this 
                        sort of thing and others don’t?

                                 MARGO
                        What sort of thing?

                                 DAVEY
                        Indiscretions. Abuse. Infidelity. 
                        Dirt. You name it. Sometimes it 
                        ruins careers and sometimes it 
                        doesn’t do a damn thing. Would love 
                        to hear your professional opinion.

           Margo thinks.

                                 MARGO
                        It’s about consistency. 

                                 DAVEY
                        I don’t follow.

                                 MARGO
                        When Matt Lauer cheats on his wife, 
                        it’s a big deal because we thought 
                        he was this wholesome, friendly 
                        guy. We thought we knew him.
                             (beat)
                        When Mike Tyson or Donald Trump 
                        does that or something worse, 
                        nobody really cares, because we all 
                        kind of knew they were scoundrels. 
                        Maybe it’s why we liked them in the 
                        first place. But someone like 
                        Lauer, that was a slap in the face. 
                        That wasn’t the guy we knew.

                                 DAVEY
                        It can’t be that simple.
                                 MARGO
                        But it is. It’s about knowing 
                        people. We want celebrities to be 
                        exactly who we think they are. 
                        Anything else feels like a 
                        betrayal. 

           Davey leans back, taking this in.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        So - as “America’s Dad”, I hope 
                        you’re really confident that you 
                        have nothing to hide. Because 
                        you’re not Mike Tyson.

           Davey is silent. Drops the glass shards in a wastebin. For a 
           moment, the two are just - quiet. Finally:

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Our friend hasn’t posted anything 
                        again, has he?

                                 DAVEY
                        No.

                                 MARGO
                        That’s so weird. Why in the world 
                        would he go to the trouble of 
                        getting all your shit - and mine, 
                        if he didn’t even have anything to 
                        hold over you?

                                 DAVEY
                        Like I said. He has my personal 
                        information but no dirt.

                                 MARGO
                        Everybody’s got dirty laundry.

                                 DAVEY
                        Not me. 

                                 MARGO
                        I dunno. Something’s wrong here. 
                        Something really weird is 
                        happening.

                                 DAVEY
                        Well, he picked a fight with an old 
                        man. I don’t have an iCloud. I’ve 
                        just got several decades of 
                        paperwork, so have fun rifling 
                        through it you cockamammy fucks.
                                 MARGO
                        Oh.

                                 DAVEY
                        What?

                                 MARGO
                        That’s it - you’re right.

                                 DAVEY
                        About what?

           Margo gets up from the couch.

                                 MARGO
                        Well, he doxxed you, and has all of 
                        your information -- he’s asking you 
                        to fess up, for what we don’t know. 
                        But he’s also not accusing you of 
                        anything yet. He wasn’t even the 
                        one who posted the picture of 
                        Elizabeth Kelly.

                                 DAVEY
                        Because there’s nothing to accuse 
                        me of.

                                 MARGO
                        He’s crowdsourcing.

                                 DAVEY
                        Excuse me?

                                 MARGO
                        There’s twenty years of bank 
                        statements, probably a hundred gigs 
                        of emails -- it would take a long 
                        time to go through all of that. So 
                        he’s crowdsourcing the work. 
                             (beat)
                        He’s using your audience against 
                        you.

                                 DAVEY
                        Well fuck me.

                                 MARGO
                        Still happy you’re trending?

           She walks to the computer, begins to type over his shoulder.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Hold on.
           She clicks - looking for something.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Okay see - look. There’s already an 
                        entire subreddit dedicated to 
                        combing through your docs.

           We see the page. A message board is getting on it’s legs - 
           filled with overviews:

           DAVID DOLLAR TAX RETURNS - THREAD 1/

           ...theories:

           STRANGE RECURRING PAYMENT - POSSIBLE BLACKMAIL?

           ...and everything in between:

           JUICY EMAIL BITS - THREAD 1/

                        I mean - think of how long a 
                        Congressional Investigation takes. 
                        You have DECADES of documents so --

                             (beat)
                        Kids these days. Can’t even 
                        blackmail someone without making

                        You don’t know it’s a young person.

                                 DAVEY
                        It is. We didn’t have to deal with 
                        this shit back in the day. This is 
                        a contemporary phenomenon.

           Margo gets up from the computer. Walks towards the window.

                                 MARGO
                        Natalie should be here in about 30 
                        minutes. I think. She’s good at 
                        handling things. 

                                 DAVEY
                        I pay your company $6,000 a month, 
                        I would hope so.
                                 MARGO
                        Keep answering questions. Just keep 
                        it surface.

                                 DAVEY
                        “Dear Davey, what advice do you 
                        have for up and coming artists?”
                             (then, typing)
                        Don’t... use... social... media. 

                        ...EVER.

           Davey continues to answer short questions, typing away.

           At the window, Margo looks out into the front lawn. 

           It is SWARMING with several TMZ-like news trucks and even 
           more rubberneckers.

                                 MARGO
                        Looks like we solved your press 
                        problem.

                                 MARGO
                        I’m sure we can try to scrub your 
                        address - or make a dent. Natalie’s 
                        gonna talk to the moderators.

                                 DAVEY
                        People will always be able to find 
                        it if they want. This will blow 
                        over. If we try to hide it - we’ll 
                        just get more scrutiny.

           A moment.

                                 MARGO
                        Why is it called the Streisand 
                        effect? What you said earlier?

                                 DAVEY
                        In the 90’s, Barbara Streisand 
                        bought this marvelous beach house. 
                        Some scientist taking pictures of 
                        the coastline snapped one of her 
                        mansion. Babs found out and threw a 
                        total tantrum.

                        The photo was for research. Erosion 
                        or something. Boring. But Barbara 
                        sued the photographer. Freaked out.

                                 DAVEY (CONT'D)
                        She didn’t want anyone to be able 
                        to see the picture of her home. Of 
                        course, people then found out about 
                        the lawsuit, and then this 
                        photograph, which would have only 
                        been seen by say, five people in 
                        labcoats, was suddenly in tabloids 
                        and online. Millions of people 
                        found out about the photo and 
                        simply had to see it.

                                 MARGO
                        Got it.

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s common sense. The more you 
                        make a big deal of something, the 
                        more attention you’ll attract. If 
                        people sniff that you’re trying to 
                        hide something, they’ll do their 
                        damndest to try and figure it out. 
                        That’s why I want to be an open 
                        book about this fucking - doxx. 
                        Doxxing? That’s the word?

           Margo nods.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        This is bad - but I want to 
                        maintain my name. People will move 
                        on. Someone else is going to cheat 
                        on their wife, some big juicy thing 
                        will soon steal the spotlight.

                                 MARGO
                        Hopefully.

                                 DAVEY
                        That’s how it works. If you’re on 
                        the highway and you see an 
                        accident. You slow down. You feel 
                        bad. But then what?
                             (beat)
                        You go on your way and never think 
                        about that poor schmuck again.

                                 MARGO
                        But the poor schmuck still has a 
                        totaled car and whiplash. We’re 
                        still the poor schmucks.
                                 DAVEY
                        That’s true. Ten Grammys and two 
                        Oscars -- and Barbara Streisand’s 
                        name is used as a term for 
                        psychological reactance. That’s 
                        legacy for ya.
                             (beat)
                        How did you not learn about the 
                        Streisand effect in PR school? What 
                        are they teaching you?

                                 MARGO
                        I didn’t go to school for Public 
                        Relations.

                                 DAVEY
                        What did you study? 
                             (silence)
                        That’s my second question for you. 
                        It’s your turn to answer.

                                 MARGO
                        Why are we talking about this?

                                 DAVEY
                        Ah. I know that answer. I know that 
                        answer very well. You’re a singer?
                             (no)
                        Art school? Theater degree? 

           There it is.

                                 MARGO
                        Musical theater.

                                 DAVEY
                        That’s wonderful.

                                 MARGO
                        I’ve already been dragged through 
                        the mud tonight so if you could not 
                        patronize me, that would be really 
                        great.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m not. I think it’s lovely.

                                 MARGO
                        Well it’s super funny because after 
                        I get fired from this publicist 
                        job, I am qualified, for literally, 
                        nothing else. So yes. Ha... Ha. 
                        Delightful.
                                 DAVEY
                        Hard to make it in that world isn’t 
                        it? Merciless line of work.

           A WHITE FLASH comes through the window. Margo squints.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        The hell was that?

           Through the window: a photographer in one of the trees.

                                 MARGO
                        Some asshole climbed one of your 
                        trees. Took a photo.

           Margo goes back to the couch.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Damnit I do not... I do NOT, need 
                        any more pictures.

           Davey thinks.

                                 DAVEY
                        There’s another study. In the back 
                        of the house. 

                                 MARGO
                        The one with the fireplace?

                                 DAVEY
                        Further back.
                             (then)
                        You don’t deserve to have any 
                        pictures in the tabloids. That’s my 
                        cross to bear.

           On Davey: that warmth of his is back. A protective gesture. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t deserve any more eyes 
                        tonight.

           Margo looks at the window -- the audience has a very good 
           view of what they’re doing.

                                 MARGO
                        Yeah. We should find somewhere more 
                        private to handle this.

           Davey, still at the desk, motions to close the laptop.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        DON’T!
           He stops.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        If it shows that I’m offline he 
                        said he’d do another dump. Of my 
                        iCloud.
                             (beat)
                        I cannot afford for him to do that.

           Margo grabs her purse and her laptop, careful not to close 
           it. Unhooks it from the projector.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           INT. HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - WIDE

           A series of wide shots as Margo and Davey walk to the other 
           end of the house.

           The long hallways, once filled with natural light, seem 
           sinister in the dark. Like the innards of a haunted house.

           They walk through an -

           UPSTAIRS WALKWAY

           That looks over the downstairs living room.

           Julio stands, at attention, looking more like a bodyguard 
           than a personal assistant.

           There’s something... off about him. Standing there, taking 
           her in, as if he’s sizing her up. 

           His stare is broken by a sneeze. 

                                 MARGO
                        What time does he go home?

                                 DAVEY
                        This is his home. I’m getting old, 
                        and there’s six bedrooms here. Like 
                        I said - he helps with everything.

                                 MARGO
                        Ah.

                                 DAVEY
                        He’s worked for me for 15 years. 
                        That’s longer than any of my 
                        marriages.
                                 MARGO
                        Funny.

           ANOTHER HALLWAY - FURTHER DOWN

                                 DAVEY
                        I wanted to apologize.

                                 MARGO
                        For what?

                                 DAVEY
                        What you said earlier. The comments 
                        that made you uncomfortable. It was 
                        inappropriate. 
                             (then)
                        You know it’s harmless but that’s 
                        not the point. It made you 
                        uncomfortable and I’m sorry.

                                 MARGO
                        Thanks. Appreciate you saying that.

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s difficult. For guys like me. 
                        Built a career out of a smile and a 
                        wink. So it’s hard to know when to 
                        call it. 

           This could turn into a longer conversation. It doesn’t.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                             (a smile)
                        Old habits die hard.

           INT. OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           A room we haven’t seen before. This is a regal and stately 
           OFFICE. Dark oak and red tones. Looks like the desk from the 
           GODFATHER. It’s dark, foreboding.

                                 DAVEY
                        This should give us some privacy.

           Margo looks around. Her eyes flicker as a thought crosses her 
           mind.

           Maybe going to somewhere private, alone, was a very bad idea.

           She shakes that thought from her head.

           Looks at her laptop. 
           Her face DROPS

                                 MARGO
                        FUCK

           The laptop is asking for a WIFI password.

           It disconnected.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Did your modem go down?

                                 DAVEY
                        Oh - we use a different one on this 
                        side of the house. 

           Margo reels - doesn’t have time to tell him how fucking 
           mission critical that was.

           She clicks - finds the new network.

                                 MARGO
                        What’s the password?

           Davey blanks. An old man’s memory.

           He darts to the desk, starts looking through the drawers.

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s written down here somewhere.

           Margo seethes - on the verge of EXPLODING.

                                 MARGO
                        FIND IT!!

           Takes her phone out of her purse.

           Tries to activate a WIFI hotspot.

           Doesn’t have a good enough signal - can’t do it.

           She SCREAMS in frustration.

           Davey’s still fumbling through the drawers.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?

                                 DAVEY
                        Here.

           He hands her a sticky note full of passwords.
                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s the second one.

           Margo enters the password. 

           Connects.

           Refreshes the page.

           Starts scanning-

                                 MARGO
                        Doesn’t look like our guy noticed.

           She takes a huge breath of relief.

           But then, a new post:

           ZAROFF: Logged off again?? Stay online Margo.

           Below the text, there’s a link to a video.

           The air goes out of her lungs.

           She clicks it. 

           The sound of her moaning.

           We don’t see it. But we hear it.

           And it sounds - bad.

           You can use your imagination.

           Davey walks around to the laptop, to catch a glimpse.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        DO YOU FUCKING MIND?

           He stops, embarrassed.

           She closes the video. 

           Starts shaking.

           Looks around-

           Sees a door to a BATHROOM right outside the office. 

           She leaves the laptop on the desk -

           RUNS to the bathroom.
           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Margo closes the door, crumples on the floor and cries.

           Really, really CRIES.

           This is the worst fucking night of her life.

                                 MARGO
                        Why why why WHY -- 

           She keeps repeating it to herself, louder and louder.

           She starts rocking herself like a little kid. 

           Her breathing gets slower. 

           Starts to calm down.

           Stays still. As if she’s finding the will to move again. 

           After a long moment, she starts to get up.

           She cleans her smeared makeup. 

           Takes a few deep breaths. 

           Looks at herself.

           She looks like she’s aged several years in the last hour.

           Her breathing slows-

           Does her best no not let on how terrified she is.

           After a long moment, her eyes seem to change. The terror in 
           her face giving way.

           A look of resolution taking over.

           And on that look we’re...

           BACK IN THE OFFICE

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 MARGO
                        We don’t need to talk about it.

                                 DAVEY
                        I still think you can come out of 
                        this on top.

                        Monica Lewinksy is giving talks on 
                        bullying now. Opinions change.

                                 MARGO
                        DAVEY. Shut the fuck up.

           Davey pauses. Takes note of the new Margo.

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay.

                                 MARGO
                        Did I miss anything?

                                 DAVEY
                        Well. Comments on the video.

           She stares daggers at him.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Other than that, no.

           Margo gets out her phone. Sees a text from Natalie.

                                 NATALIE
                             (TEXT)
                        ETA 20 minutes. On the phone with 
                        the police.

                                 MARGO
                        Nothing from our cyber-terrorist?

                                 DAVEY
                        No. Guess he’s waiting for someone 
                        to find something.

           Margo grabs the laptop, sits at the desk.

                                 MARGO
                        Still seems weird to me. 
                        Something’s not right.

           She goes back to the page of people combing through the 
           documents.

           It’s a LOT busier now. 

           The biggest threads:

           DAVID DOLLAR TAX RETURNS - THREAD 1/

           STRANGE RECURRING PAYMENT - POSSIBLE BLACKMAIL?

           She clicks on the thread about his tax returns.
           The top item on the page is a breakdown of his charitable 
           givings over the years. It’s a LOT.

                        Never took you for a humanitarian.

                                 DAVEY
                        I don’t make a habit of talking 
                        about it.

           Margo scans the comments. They all share the same sentiment: 

           This guy is fucking nice // who gives 10 million to the 
           American Cancer Society without having cancer? // JK he has 
           cancer // Absolute legend

                        There’s an old heart in here, 
                        believe it or not.

                                 MARGO
                        I know, Davey.

           A moment.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        How much do you trust Julio?

                                 DAVEY
                        What are you saying?

                                 MARGO
                        I’m saying that whoever this is 
                        somehow has access to your records. 
                        Your WIFI security doesn’t fuck 
                        around. You have a crazy password.

                                 DAVEY
                        No - that’s impossible.

                                 MARGO
                        Is it? He has access. Does he know 
                        sensitive information? You been 
                        paying him well enough? And what 
                        the fuck is he doing looming 
                        downstairs like that?

                                 DAVEY
                        I can spot false loyalty. Learned 
                        that the hard way. It’s not him.
                                 MARGO
                        You have any other ideas?? What if 
                        he’s downstairs, on a laptop, 
                        fucking with us right now.

           Davey pulls out his iPad - goes to a HOME SECURITY APP. The 
           expensive, Smart-home kind - 

                                 DAVEY
                        Let’s see exactly what he’s doing.

           He taps the screen a few times, cycling through live security 
           feeds of different rooms. 

           It sounds like a Tivo as he scrolls through: Bloop-- Bloop--.

           We see a video feed of a second dining area. Bloop. Now a 
           large storage room. Bloop--

                        There.

           The app stops - Julio is playing pinball in a BILLIARDS ROOM.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay. Fine.

           Margo goes back to the computer. 

           Hits BACK on her browser-

           Clicks on the other thread:

           STRANGE RECURRING PAYMENT - POSSIBLE BLACKMAIL?

           A lot of comments here. Looks like they’re onto something:

           This is sexual assault money // Not alimony // This is hush

                             (a moment)
                        New question from our friend.
           Margo goes back to the Q&A tab - reads:

                        “David. For the last 18 years there

                                 DAVEY
                        Sure. You ready?

           She readies her hands above the keyboard.

                        In the late 90’s, I had an 
                        assistant named Rafael. Immigrant 
                        from Sao Paolo. Hardworking man. 
                             (then)
                        Someone in my position gets to know 
                        these kind of people very well. The 
                        fact of the matter is, those who 
                        live in ivory towers become well 
                        acquainted with the people who help 
                        maintain the tower. Rafi quickly 
                        became one of my best friends. We 
                        did everything together.

                        I was partying quite a bit then. 
                        Lot of substances. Lots of - large 
                        nights. And like I said, we did 
                        everything together. One night, 
                        which started like any other, he 
                        overdosed.
                             (beat)
                        I can’t help but feel like – part 
                        of it was my fault. Hardest working 
                        guy I knew. This life isn’t for 
                        everyone and I feel like I made him 
                        go too close to the flame. I’ve 
                        been clean ever since.

           Margo keeps typing. She watches Davey closely. We are deeply 
           in her point of view.

                        Now, Rafael had a wife. Debbie 
                        Palmer... 

           There is something about the way Davey is speaking, something 
           theatrical. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        She had just had twins. He spoke of 
                        them all the time. He was so 
                        nervous. Worried that he wouldn’t 
                        be able to provide for his family. 
                        He worked as a valet on his days 
                        off. It meant the world to him. 

           He pauses - an old man lost in thought. Or, a performer 
           building anticipation.

                        So, call it survivor’s guilt - or 
                        perhaps it’s because I’ve never had 
                        children of my own. But ever since 
                        his overdose, I’ve helped his wife 
                        manage. Paid for his children’s 
                        education. Been a surrogate uncle 
                        of sorts for a family that didn’t 
                        have the means to take care of 
                        themselves. Felt like my fault, 
                        whether it was or not. So please, 
                        find someone else in my tax returns 
                        to pick on. But not them.

           Another user posts the Facebook profile of one of the twins:

           Margo clicks -- the picture in question is with Davey. It’s

                        the bad guys. And he's here to 
                        clean house.
           Margo finishes and posts.

                                 MARGO
                        Who are the bad guys? 

                                 DAVEY
                        Well, there aren’t any. Maybe 
                        record labels. Shitty music. More 
                        of a hero myth I guess. 

           Davey walks to the bathroom. 

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me. The scotch.
                             (then)
                        Yell if there’s a situation.

           He closes the door. 

           Margo makes a sound that’s almost like a laugh.

                                 MARGO
                        This is all one big fuckin’ 
                        situation. 

           She goes back to the iCloud window. Tries one more password:

           Birdsong

           And she’s in.

           There’s about a dozen folders of images and documents. 

           One of the folders is named MARGO.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        What the FUCK?

           She clicks on it.

           There’s nothing in it. 

           She clicks on the other folders. 

           Nothing. All empty.

           Weird.

           She hears a COUGH from the bathroom.

           Closes the window. Goes back to the AMA. 

           Opens the tab of people going through his documents.
           There’s a newer thread:

           SOMETHING FISHY 1/

           She clicks. The top post. It’s long, from a user named “PM-ME 
           UR-TITS”

           She reads the post:

           Hi all. Forgive the username. I’m  the senior fraud monitor 
           at a bank and there’s something weird about these statements-- 

           A FLUSH from the bathroom. She blinks, focusing-

           Starts reading aloud to herself-

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        “The ending balances from prior 
                        statements don’t always match up 
                        with the beginning balances of the 
                        next ones. This is often where good 
                        fraudsters fuck up”
                             (then)
                        “The last ten years seem clean, but 
                        the farther you go back, the 
                        weirder the math gets.”

           Margo reads a bit slower-

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        “I’m pretty sure these records are 
                        incomplete.”
                             (beat)
                        “There are missing transactions.”

           We hear THE SINK. He’s washing his hands. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Why would he take things out?

           Furrows her brow. Really thinks.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is going on?

           Davey steps out. Margo quickly closes the window.

                                 DAVEY
                        So. What kind of situation are we 
                        dealing with here. In terms of 
                        backlash. What are people saying?
                                 MARGO
                        Well. We dodged the two biggest 
                        bullets - Elizabeth Kelly, and 
                        Debbie Palmer. I’m not sure what 
                        else people will find.

           Margo stares at him. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        It is funny. Everything he’s asked 
                        you about - not only do you have 
                        airtight answers to clear your 
                        name... but these make you look. 
                        Good. Really fucking good.

                                 DAVEY
                        That’s a relief.

                                 MARGO
                        Yeah. A relief. 
                             (as if she knows the 
                              answer already)
                        Let’s see if you’re getting any 
                        press--

           Margo does a cursory Google search of his name.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        “Buzzfeed: David Dollar had the 
                        perfect clapback to stop a hacker 
                        from humiliating him”. 

                        “CNN: David Dollar continues to 
                        remain innocent in buzzworthy email 
                        hack”

           Her tone grows louder, more insistent-

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        “Mashable: Don’t mess with 
                        America’s favorite Cowboy” 

                        “New York Times: David’s Digital 
                        Showdown raises questions about 
                        privacy in an era of accusations”
                             (beat)
                        This is the kind of press you 
                        cannot buy. 
                             (mocking)
                        What. A. Relief.

           Davey smiles, pleased.
                                 DAVEY
                        I guess there’s no such thing as 
                        bad publicity.

                                 MARGO
                             (even louder)
                        And you don’t seem to be that 
                        worried. With every single bank 
                        statement - and EVERY email you’ve 
                        ever written - EVERY website you’ve 
                        ever been on -- there’s not going 
                        to one speck of dirt. One TINY 
                        thing that could backfire on you? 
                        Because you look pretty fuckin’ 
                        smug.

           A long moment.

                                 DAVEY
                        What are you saying.

                                 MARGO
                        I’m SAYING -- that I’m a twenty 
                        nine year old with a theater 
                        degree, and somehow I have more 
                        dirt than a seventy year old 
                        playboy who has worked in the 
                        industry for forty years. Okay.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m truly sorry about your photos.

                                 MARGO
                        Why is there a folder called MARGO 
                        in your iCloud?

                                 DAVEY
                        Snooping around are we? You know I 
                        was married to a Margo. You’re as 
                        bad as these internet freaks. 
                        Trying to make a story where there 
                        isn’t one. 

                                 MARGO
                             (holds up the sticky note)
                        Why is it crossed out?

                                 DAVEY
                        Because I don’t use it?

                                 MARGO
                        YOUR BANK STATEMENTS WERE EDITED.

           Beat.
                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Somebody noticed that the balances 
                        don’t add up. If someone’s trying 
                        to make you look bad, why would 
                        they take out transactions?

                                 DAVEY
                        Of course they’ve been tampered 
                        with. This has all been tampered 
                        with.
                             (then, off her look)
                        You don’t look well.

                                 MARGO
                        For a smear job, it seems weird 
                        that they’d cover anything. Right?

                                 DAVEY
                        There’s details in there that make 
                        me look good. Maybe it’s the 
                        opposite. Who the fuck knows.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay.

                                 DAVEY
                        You best get to your point girl.

                                 MARGO
                        I need to ask you, just once -- Did 
                        you have any part in orchestrating 
                        this?

           Beat. 

                                 DAVEY
                        That’s the most ridiculous thing 
                        I’ve ever heard.

                                 MARGO
                        I - don’t think it is.

                                 DAVEY
                        Of course not. And I’m insulted 
                        that you would even ask.

                                 MARGO
                        You didn’t have anything to do with 
                        this? There’s NOTHING you’re not 
                        telling me?

                                 DAVEY
                        Ask me again and I’ll find a 
                        different PR firm in the morning.
                                 MARGO
                        It’s just - this is the kind of 
                        press we could never get you. In a 
                        million years.

                                 DAVEY
                        Well I’m sorry you’re not that good 
                        of a publicist.

                                 MARGO
                        I AM A GOOD PUBLICIST. I didn’t 
                        know about Barbara Streisand’s 
                        beach house but I can smell a 
                        mother-fucking NARRATIVE when I see 
                        one. This is way too clean. 

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s called being innocent, 
                        sweetheart.

                                 MARGO
                        Maybe. But now that I think about 
                        it, you know what else doesn’t make 
                        sense?? My computer always uses a 
                        VPN. My phone has an eight digit 
                        password that I change every two 
                        months. I don’t know a TON about 
                        digital security - but I know it 
                        would take more than - thirty 
                        fucking minutes to get into my 
                        iCloud. And I know that you 
                        specifically requested me for this 
                        Q&A. And there’s a folder with my 
                        name on it. 
                             (big here)
                        Why were you so insistent that it 
                        was me? 

                                 DAVEY
                        I thought you were cute.

                                 MARGO
                        Oh fuck off.

           Davey looks at Margo. Exhales.

                                 DAVEY
                        You’re fired. 

           This lingers in the air.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m finding another firm in the 
                        morning.
           Margo catches her breath. Begins to calm down.

           Sees a TEXT from Natalie. 

                                 NATALIE
                             (text)
                        15 min away

                                 DAVEY
                        You think I organized this myself? 
                        I don’t know how to attach a 
                        document to an email. I can barely 
                        use an iPad.

           Margo thinks for a really long time. 

           Did I just fuck this up?

                                 MARGO
                             (sincerely)
                        I’m sorry. None of this makes any 
                        sense.

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s not your fault. I think you’re 
                        having a panic attack. Trying to 
                        find reason in it all. But I don’t 
                        think this is for you. Being a 
                        publicist. No shame in that. 
                             (a moment, then)
                        You’re too soft for this. 

                                 MARGO
                        Okay. Whatever. But just so you 
                        know, it’s not only me... people 
                        are getting suspicious.

           She grabs the laptop, turns it around.

           Shows him the thread on the bank statements.

           He starts to read it over.

           It’s MUCH longer now. The suspicion is growing.

           Davey’s face hardens. Unreadable.

                                 DAVEY
                        People love a good conspiracy. 
                        Everything’s a lie, remember?

           But he keeps reading. The concern on his face growing.
           Margo watches him. Studying him. Her demeanor changes, 
           switching tactics:

                                 MARGO
                        Don’t take it personally. But it’s 
                        not just me. It is funny that each 
                        line item in a smear job ends up 
                        making you look -- incredibly good. 
                        Maybe it is a coincidence.

           She leans in. Speaks almost at a whisper.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        So if. IF. You are trying to lay 
                        down a convincing narrative, you 
                        need to do a better job. It’s 
                        already been going off the rails 
                        and the scrutiny’s only going to go 
                        up from here. So -

           She gets really close to his face. Almost seductive:

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        It sounds like you could use some 
                        help.

           Davey looks at her, completely taken aback. Shocked.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        I’m not like other publicists.
                             (beat)
                        But you are. So I can tell that 
                        you’re up to something.
                             (big here)
                        If you’ll be honest, I’ll be 
                        honest.

           He thinks. Breathes. Starts to nod.

                                 DAVEY
                        Okay.

           He reaches in his desk. Takes out a thick stapled document.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I need you to sign this.

           It’s a non disclosure agreement. A monster one at that.

                                 MARGO
                        What the FUCK is this?

                                 DAVEY
                        It’s an agreement.
                                 MARGO
                        I’m not signing shit.

           She shakes her head. Can’t believe it.

                                 DAVEY
                        Margo. 

                                 MARGO
                        No.

           He goes to CLOSE the laptop.

           Margo shoves her hand between the keyboard and screen.

           Their eyes meet.

                                 DAVEY
                        You said you wanted to know.
                             (beat)
                        Sign.

           Margo starts shaking, white with rage. SCREAMS.

                                 MARGO
                        You.... You fucking ruined me. For 
                        what, the stories? The PRESS? What 
                        were you thinking???

           Davey says nothing.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        You honestly think all of this was 
                        worth it just to be in the fucking 
                        spotlight again???

                                 DAVEY
                        Tonight was about something else. 

                                 MARGO
                        Besides stealing a woman’s photos 
                        to promote your dumb fucking 
                        album??

                                 DAVEY
                        No. This was for the big picture. 
                             (beat)
                        Legacy.

                                 MARGO
                        WHAT are you talking about?
                                 DAVEY
                        We are losing heroes right and 
                        left. People who were powerful, 
                        respected, gunned down by 
                        accusations. The last ride of the 
                        Renegade isn’t that fucking album. 
                        It’s not an article in the Times. 
                        It’s this. Taking on the slings and 
                        arrows, and not backing down. 
                        Standing out as one of the last 
                        bastions of goodness and honesty.

                                 MARGO
                             (laughs)
                        Honesty. Okay.

                                 DAVEY
                        Yes, I’m creating a narrative. Is 
                        that so hard to believe? It’s all 
                        storytelling. So don’t pretend I’m 
                        a monster because I’m looking out 
                        for how I’ll be remembered.

                                 MARGO
                        I don’t give a shit about your 
                        story, you GUTTED me in front of 
                        the entire world!

                                 DAVEY
                        You have a right to be angry. But 
                        there’s a way this ends up looking 
                        good for both of us.

                                 MARGO
                        For ME? You think those images - 
                        you think that video is going to do 
                        ME any favors going forward? I feel 
                        my skin crawling with those 
                        internet fucks watching me. Don’t 
                        fucking tell me about how this is 
                        going to help put a foot in a door 
                        you washed up piece of shit!

           Margo turns around, heads for the door.

           Davey presses a small button underneath his desk. The door to 
           the room silently LOCKS.

           She shakes the doorknob. Head spinning. She starts to cry.

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m truly sorry about the pictures.
           He says this with a sincerity that throws her. Back to his 
           warm dad mode. It’s effective, he’s a performer.

                                 MARGO
                        Why did you involve me in this? Are 
                        you INSANE?

                                 DAVEY
                        The AMA was your agency’s idea. 
                        When I realized that there was no 
                        press I could get anymore I 
                        realized this Q&A was the best time 
                        to stage the hack.

                                 MARGO
                        Why did you bring me here? Why did 
                        you use my photos???

                                 DAVEY
                        Me having a publicist interfering, 
                        trying to squelch it. Well, I 
                        figured someone trying to stop it 
                        would bring it the most attention 
                        it could possibly get. 

                                 MARGO
                        Okay.

                                 DAVEY
                        As for the pictures, well, I needed 
                        a failsafe in case you pulled the 
                        plug-

                                 MARGO
                             (over)
                        Which you SET ME UP TO DO-

                                 DAVEY
                        -and, I thought the story could use 
                        a little -- eye candy. Wasn’t sure 
                        if an old man’s papers would make 
                        the news on its own.

           This REALLY hits a nerve. She doesn’t have the words.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I am nothing if not a showman, 
                        Margo. 

                                 MARGO
                        You are CRAZY, Davey. You need 
                        HELP.
                                 DAVEY
                        Yes. Your help.
                             (beat)
                        I wouldn’t have done this to you if 
                        I saw you for who you were. I 
                        underestimated you. But it’s not 
                        over.

                                 MARGO
                        LET ME OUT OF THIS GODDAMN ROOM.

           Davey presses a call button on his desk - an ALL-CALL booms 
           through different speakers the house, like a PA system.

                                 DAVEY
                        Julio, please join us in my office.

           Margo SCREAMS.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Calm the fuck down. Let me tell you 
                        how this is going to go. 

           Davey takes out a small FOLDER. It’s something of a script 
           for the “hack”. He looks it over.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        We have a few more topics we’re 
                        going to address in the Q&A 
                        tonight. A few more human interest 
                        stories. Food for the birds. 

           There are bullet points about the topics we’ve seen: 
           Elizabeth Kelly, Maggie Hudson, the overdose. But then 
           there’s a few more pages--

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        And a few other incidents I need to 
                        get ahead of. Blisters. 
                        Liabilities. By the end of the 
                        night, my name will remain clear. 
                        My legacy secure. And you? You will 
                        look like a fucking ROCK STAR.

                                 MARGO
                        How is that exactly? I’m a 
                        punchline without a job.

                                 DAVEY
                        Because you took a washed up artist 
                        and made him the biggest trending 
                        topic in the world? Nobody’s going 
                        to fire you because of a picture.

                        You - little junior publicist 
                        Margo, did what nobody else in your 
                        company could do. Fuck your 
                        company. Start your own. 

                                 MARGO
                             (as if)
                        Okay.

                                 DAVEY
                        These pictures - Jesus, Margo 
                        you’re going to have so much public 
                        sympathy on your side, you can do 
                        whatever the fuck you want. To have 
                        them released, and to not blink and 
                        FIGHT BACK - you’re going to be an 
                        icon.

           Margo gives up on the doorknob. Listens.

                        That should be enough for the down 
                        payment on a condo, I should think.

           Margo turns this over in her head.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        This town doesn’t change. 
                        Everybody’s looking for a break. 
                        And you only get ONE. You’re 
                        staring yours right in the face. 
                        Ride this out with me. Cement my 
                        place - and start to make yours.

           She looks at him dead in the eye. 

                                 MARGO
                        A hundred grand is a little - 
                        cheap, don’t ya think?

                                 DAVEY
                        Two hundred.
                                 MARGO
                        I could sue you for more than that. 
                        Releasing that video?

                                 DAVEY
                        There’s no proof that any of this 
                        leads back to me. It all goes back 
                        to some fuck in the Ukraine, 
                        facilitated by payments and shell 
                        companies that don’t touch me at 
                        all. There’s no paper trail and you 
                        couldn’t beat me in a lawsuit. If 
                        you can’t afford a condo you sure 
                        as hell can’t afford a good legal 
                        team.

                                 MARGO
                        It doesn’t matter if I beat you in 
                        the suit. You said earlier - we’re 
                        in an age where an accusation alone 
                        can bring someone down. I don’t 
                        need to win at all.

           Margo raises her eyebrow. 

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        And it sounds like there may be 
                        others.

           Davey frowns. Ice cold:

                                 DAVEY
                        Margo. You’re not in a position to 
                        negotiate. 

                                 MARGO
                        The damage is done. What’s another 
                        video going to do? 
                             (beat)
                        Like you said. Monica Lewinsky is 
                        giving TED talks now. I’m not 
                        scared.

           Davey stares at her-

           Starts laughing-

           Claps.

           The warmth comes back:

                                 DAVEY
                        I had no idea - I had no idea this 
                        was the girl underneath all that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVEY (CONT'D)
                        You have it. I see it in you. 
                        Bottomless ambition. Unwillingness 
                        to back down. The GRIT. You and I 
                        deserve each other. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll give you $500,000 -- plus 
                        everything I can offer you.

                                 MARGO
                        What does that mean?

                                 DAVEY
                        I’m still a powerful man in this 
                        town. I will make you Margo. You 
                        can do whatever you want. You want 
                        to be a publicist? You want to act? 
                        Sing? I mean hell - look at the way 
                        people responded to those pictures. 
                        You wouldn’t be the first to build 
                        a career off such a thing. I will 
                        burst down doors for you Margo. And 
                        remember, I never back down.

           Margo shakes her head. Resisting his gravitational pull. A 
           moment of moral clarity.

                                 MARGO
                        This is crazy.

                                 DAVEY
                        Crazy? Little miss musical 
                        theater... You move to the city 
                        because you want to work in 
                        showbiz. Realize you don’t have the 
                        stones to hear ‘no’ everyday so you 
                        work as a publicist. Be star-
                        adjacent. Do your best to put 
                        daddy’s tuition money to work. But 
                        I know your secret. You hate it. 
                        You need more.
                             (here’s the teeth)
                        You’re going to get older and 
                        sadder and you’re going to hate 
                        this place more every single day. 
                        Or - you can sign this paper and 
                        become a miracle worker, and you 
                        can do whatever you want. I’m 
                        giving you a chance here. To make 
                        something of yourself. You finally 
                        have some cards to play. You should 
                        be thanking me.

           She looks away, each word hitting her like a precise dart.
                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        My third and final question for you 
                        Margo -- what do you want?

           On Margo, suddenly unsure. 

           The door knob to the room shakes - locked.

           Davey presses the button again-

           The door unlocks and Julio enters.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a publicist. What did you 
                        think this job was? Sign this paper 
                        and help me right this ship. 
                        Remember, I planned this. There’s a 
                        good ending.
                             (beat)
                        You’re going to come out on top.

           A long silence is broken by Margo’s PHONE ringing.

           It’s Natalie.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Julio.

           Julio walks forward, takes her phone.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        You’ll get it back as soon as you 
                        sign.

                                 MARGO
                        $500,000?

                                 DAVEY
                        Yes.

                                 MARGO
                        Can I see the - itinerary?

           She motions to the folder.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        I want to see what other shit 
                        you’re going to pull. What you’re 
                        covering for.

                                 DAVEY
                        Fine.
           He hands it to her. She takes a minute to read. It’s several 
           pages, she flips through.

                                 MARGO
                        Jesus Christ.

           She reads on. Eyes wide as we watch the realization form - 
           how thoroughly - how deeply she’s been played.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Who was the father of Elizabeth 
                        Kelly’s baby?

                                 DAVEY
                        I didn’t hit her.

                                 MARGO
                        That was your baby. You pressured 
                        her.

                                 DAVEY
                        I didn’t make her do anything.

                                 MARGO
                        This isn’t about legacy. This is 
                        about damage control.

                                 DAVEY
                        Same thing, dear.

                                 MARGO
                        And Rafi? What’s the full story 
                        there?

                                 DAVEY
                        Son of a bitch tried to blackmail 
                        me. $5 Million Dollars. Had that 
                        fucker iced.

                                 MARGO
                        What?

                                 DAVEY
                        The coroner ruled it an accidental 
                        overdose. I did pay for his kids 
                        education though. I’m not a 
                        monster.

           Margo is at a loss for words. Then, finally:

                                 MARGO
                        What - was he blackmailing you for?
           Davey says nothing. Margo looks back at the folder, sees more 
           settlements, non disclosure agreements. A paper trail of 
           lives ruined and voices silenced.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        “Last bastion of honesty?” 

                                 DAVEY
                        There’s a thing or two I’d like to 
                        get ahead of. Like I said, 
                        blisters. Liabilities.

                                 MARGO
                        So you’ve been a nervous man this 
                        past year.

           He frowns. Margo looks it over, thinks.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        I need a guarantee of the money in 
                        writing. 

                                 DAVEY
                        I’ll have my lawyer draw something 
                        up in the morning. 

                                 MARGO
                        That’s not good enough. 

           Davey smiles again - charmed by her insistence. He loves it.

                                 DAVEY
                        Julio, go to the vault and get two 
                        banker’s notes. 
                             (to Margo)
                        Now I can’t give it to you all at 
                        once. Think of this as something of 
                        a down payment.

           Julio goes - leaving the door open behind him.

                                 MARGO
                        So you do have your shit. Of course 
                        you do. 
                             (beat)
                        Everything’s a lie.

                                 DAVEY
                        What were George Washington’s teeth 
                        made of?

                                 MARGO
                        What?
                                 DAVEY
                        His dentures. What were they made 
                        of?

                                 MARGO
                             (what are you getting at?)
                        Wood?

                                 DAVEY
                        His dentures were made from the 
                        teeth of slaves. 

           He lets that sink in.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s perfect Margo. Especially 
                        heroes. But history isn’t written 
                        by the facts, it’s written by 
                        public opinion. 

           A silence between them. Davey chuckles-

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        “The problem with playing devil’s 
                        advocate is that eventually you’re 
                        going to find yourself advocating 
                        for an actual devil.”
                             (beat)
                        So. Ready to give the devil his 
                        due?

           Margo looks at her hands, ashamed.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been away from the Q&A for 
                        too long. It’s time.

           He slides the NDA towards her.

                                 MARGO
                        Okay.

           Margo grabs the pen. 

           Clicks.

           She signs the NDA.

           Davey leans back, satisfied with himself.

                                 DAVEY
                        So - Our friend is going to ask us 
                        a question involving --
                                 MARGO
                        Sorry - you pumped me full of 
                        scotch.  I’m about to piss myself. 
                        Just answer another question about 
                        pizza or something. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Alright.

           Margo walks to the bathroom, leaving Davey at his desk.

           For a moment, it’s just him.

           It’s the first moment we’ve seen him alone - and he deflates 
           a little. 

           And it looks kind of sad.

           Just a old man in his office.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                             (shouting towards the 
                              bathroom)
                        When is Natalie getting here? We 
                        need to get our story straight.

           No response.

           No sound of a flush.

           Davey looks towards the NDA. Flips towards the last page.

           On the signature line, written in cursive: 

           F U C K   Y O U

           INT. HALLWAY - SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE

           Margo is SPRINTING towards the front of the house.

           She’s carrying THE FOLDER. The night’s itinerary.

           The smoking gun.

           She reaches the end of a long hallway. Sees a WINDOW.

           The thick bulletproof glass. No handle, no way to open it.

           She’s also still on the second floor.

           Margo, spins around, disoriented.

           This place looks like a maze.
                                 MARGO
                        Goddamnit.

           Davey’s voice comes booming in through the PA system. 

                                 DAVEY (PA)
                        Margo Margo Margo. I thought we had 
                        a deal. 

           She keeps running, goes into -

           A BILLIARDS ROOM

           The one we saw in the security footage. The pinball machine 
           is still on.

           There’s several doors, she looks around-

           Trying to discern the way out.

                                 DAVEY (PA) (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to be able to get 
                        out of this house. The windows are 
                        sealed. None of the doors open 
                        without a key fob. And you’re not 
                        just going to waltz through the 
                        front door. 

           In the distance, she hears a sneeze. Julio.

           She chooses one door, goes through it. 

           A STORAGE ROOM

           A seeming dead end, but - 

           There’s a freight elevator.

                                 DAVEY (PA) (CONT’D)
                        If you come back to the office 
                        RIGHT NOW you can re-negotiate. 
                        Don’t make me do something I don’t 
                        want to. I’m not trying to be the 
                        monster you think I am.

           She runs to the elevator. Finds the button, presses it.

           The button lights up and the elevator lets out a horrible 
           SCREECH

           It doesn’t seem to be working - it’s making pained, metallic 
           sounds. Like a broken washing machine.
           And the screech is LOUD. It’s going to give her position 
           away.

           She RUNS back into

           THE BILLIARDS ROOM

           Goes in another door

           Runs into a 

           HALLWAY

           We recognize this one from earlier. 

           She’s on the right track.

                                 DAVEY (PA) (CONT’D)
                        And remember, we have cameras, so 
                        don’t try and hide.

           She runs faster, the hall takes sharp turn. 

           Sees JULIO at the end of the hall.

           She jumps back-

           Hiding behind the corner.

           Did he see her?

           Fuck.

           She hears his FOOTSTEPS.

           They’re getting closer.

           She SPRINTS in the opposite direction. 

           Still needs to get DOWNSTAIRS.

           BACK IN THE BILLIARDS ROOM

           Margo runs to the pool table.

           Grabs the 8 BALL.

           Runs through another door.

           INT. UPSTAIRS DINING AREA

           It’s another dining area and kitchenette. An upstairs living 
           room lies just ahead.
           (This place is fucking huge)

                                 MARGO
                        This place is fucking h--

           But before she can finish, JULIO’s FOOTSTEPS, not far behind. 

           She runs into a SMALL PANTRY.

           Catches her breath.

           Hears Julio walk in. He slows down, looking for her. 

                                 DAVEY (PA)
                             (theatrically)
                        Poor Margo. Had something of a 
                        panic attack. The stress of the 
                        hack, the shame of those photos. I 
                        saw her take medication. I really 
                        shouldn’t have offered her a drink. 
                        It’s a pity she got hurt. She found 
                        my pistol and shot herself in the 
                        mouth. She couldn’t take it.

           That gets her attention. 

           She blinks. He’s actually going to kill me.

                                 DAVEY (PA) (CONT’D)
                        The shame must have been too much 
                        for her.

           She peers through the gap between the doorframe and the 
           hinge.

           Sees Julio stalking the living area across the room.

           He’s carrying his HANDGUN.

                                 MARGO
                             (mouths to herself)
                        Oh my God.

           She takes this in. The latest in a long night of surprises.

           Julio turns towards the pantry-

           Margo recoils back to her hiding place.

           The footsteps grow LOUDER, he walks towards her.

           She puts the 8 ball in her palm.

           Closes her eyes
           The footsteps get even CLOSER

           He’s inches away-

           DING

           Julio pauses.

           It’s the freight elevator. It reached the second floor.

           He walks to the storage room to investigate the noise.

           Margo exhales, relief washes over her face.

           She peeks out of the pantry-

           Runs into the living room, looking for an exit. 

           She sees STAIRS on the opposite side of the room.

           Runs towards them.

           Hears FOOTSTEPS - she’s not at the stairs yet...

           Margo ducks behind a large couch-

           Seconds before Julio re-enters the room. 

           He walks into the living area. 

           Keeps walking-

           Right between Margo’s position and the stairs.

           Pinned behind the couch, Margo sees his reflection through a 
           glass door of a cabinet. 

           He’s holding a tablet.

           Bloop. Bloop.

           He’s on the HOME SECURITY APP.

           Clicking through the cameras.

           Margo scans the ceiling.

           There’s a camera pointed right at her.

           ON JULIO: Switching between feeds. The downstairs living 
           room. Bloop. The gym. Bloop. The billiards room. Bloop-

           Margo looks at the camera. Knows she has a matter of seconds. 
           She palms the 8 Ball, aims towards the stairs

           And THROWS

           The 8 ball soars - a high arc, headed towards the stairway--

           BAM

             BAM

               BAM

                 BAM

                   BAM...

           The 8 ball hits several stairs on the way down.

           Julio runs to the stairway - 

           He looks around. The 8 ball has rolled out of view. The coast 
           is clear.

           What the fuck?

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAGGGH!!

           Julio TURNS to see

           Margo CHARGING HIM

           He tries to draw his gun

           She PUSHES HIM

           BAM

             BAM

               BAM

                 BAM

                   And then, a horrible CRUNCH.

           He lies motionless at the bottom of the stairs. Margo pauses, 
           SHOCKED at what she’s just done. But there’s no time: 

           She flies downstairs.

           Grabs his GUN.

           Holds it like a dead rat.
           Looks at Julio. He’s out cold - dead or unconscious.

           She reaches in his pockets- looking for her phone. It isn’t 
           there.

           The sees the tablet a few feet away, turns it over.

           The screen is cracked. There’s some home controls. No 
           internet or calling capabilities.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           She takes the tablet. Looks around. She’s downstairs.

           Her expression hardens. Eyes burning. She has one thought and 
           one thought only: Get out of this fucking house.

           Starts running - 

           INT. FURTHER IN THE HOUSE - HALLWAY

           Margo SPRINTS as fast as she possibly can-

           Passes the downstairs living room

           Getting closer...

           The hallway takes a sharp turn.

           Sees DAVEY - holding a GUN.

           She SCREAMS.

           But... it’s not Davey. It’s his wax figure.

                                 MARGO
                        Jesus.

           She regains her composure, catches her breath.

           Keeps going-

           FURTHER IN THE HOUSE

           She passes the framed photos.

           She’s getting CLOSE.

           And finally: Sees a door to the front foyer.

           She enters--
           INT. THE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           She’s here, but-

           Davey stands in front of the door.

           Holding a rifle.

           It should be a jarring image, but it looks apt. Natural, 
           even. A cowboy with a Winchester. 

                                 DAVEY
                        Margo.

           She freezes. They both stare each other down.

           Is this really happening?

           Davey sees her holding Julio’s pistol. He raises the rifle.

           Margo turns and RUNS BACK into the house.

           She’s SPLINTERED with wood chips. Davey fires a shot, just 
           misses.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Margo runs through the hall -

           The taxidermied animals create a funhouse of shapes.

           Another SHOT whizzes through, hitting one of the busts.

           Margo flies to the back of the house.

           Starts pressing the tablet screen helplessly, looking for an 
           emergency function.

           The lights in the house change erratically. Music starts 
           playing, skipping, and playing again. It’s a garish show, a 
           house unraveling.

           ON DAVEY

           Walking as quickly as he can. But that’s not very quick. He’s 
           lost his bearings in the chaos.

           The house settles on a song. It’s familiar - pained, haunted. 
           The same song Margo was listening to in her car. Birdsong.

                                 DAVEY
                        Think you have the run of the house 
                        now?
           INT. HALLWAYS - VARIOUS

           On Davey. His knee is clearly in pain. He’s masking a limp. 
           Quite slow now.

                                 DAVEY
                        You’ve given me no choice Margo. I 
                        don’t want to do this. Give me the 
                        folder and go home. You’re young. 
                        You can still get out. 

           He waits. The house is silent.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m giving you one more chance. 
                        Take the money and get out of here. 
                             (a moment, then)
                        I was wrong about you. I thought 
                        you had what it takes. This is no 
                        time to suddenly grow a conscience. 
                        Go back to Stone Mountain or 
                        wherever the fuck you came from. 
                        Take this money and leave.

           The hallway turns into a LIVING ROOM. The one filled with 
           memorabilia.

           Davey scans, sees a SHAPE hiding under a blanket in the 
           corner.

           It’s clearly a body.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to hurt you.

           He raises his rifle. Still nothing.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           He SHOOTS. 

           Hits.

           His aim is true.

           The shape lies motionless.

           He takes a long breath.

           It’s over.

           He crosses the room, turns on the fireplace with ease - to 
           burn the documents.
           Walks to the body. He removes the blanket, to reveal - 

           A half naked wax figure.                              

           KA-BAM.

           Davey looks down, blood coming out of his hip.

           He turns-

           To see Margo standing in place of the wax figure. She’s 
           wearing his jacket and hat, looking both regal and 
           ridiculous. The barrel of her gun is smoking.

           THE MOTHERFUCKING RENEGADE. 

           Davey falls to his knees.

           Drops his Winchester. 

                                 MARGO
                        Don’t. Move.

           Davey inspects his wound. 

           He’s losing a lot of blood.

           Margo walks to the rifle and kicks it across the floor.

                                 DAVEY
                        This would have been so much easier 
                        if you kept to our agreement.
                             (beat)
                        This wasn’t how it was supposed to 
                        go.

                                 MARGO
                        I see you David. You got everyone 
                        fooled. Everyone but me. I know 
                        exactly who you are.
                             (then)
                        And so do you.

                                 DAVEY
                        I never wanted to hurt you.

                                 MARGO
                        Until you had to. Funny how that 
                        works.

           She takes off the jacket, throws it in the fire.

                        You could have made such an impact.

                                 MARGO
                        I will. Just not the one you want.

           She throws his hat in the fire.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna have a legacy alright. 
                        I hope you like magazine covers. 

           She grabs the folder. Takes note of the song playing 
           throughout the house.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        You really were my favorite artist 
                        you know.
                             (beat)
                        But sometimes you gotta move past 
                        sentiment.

           She turns to leave.

                                 DAVEY
                        Margo.

           She stops. 

           This is his old man voice again. Warm. Pained.

                                 DAVEY (CONT’D)
                        Shoot again.

           Is he asking what she thinks he’s asking?

                                 MARGO
                        No.

           She puts down the pistol.

                                 MARGO (CONT’D)
                        Was the cancer a lie? Was that part 
                        of the story too?

                                 DAVEY
                        No. That was true.

                                 MARGO
                        Damn. I hope you live another fifty 
                        years. You deserve to see this play 
                        out. 

           She walks off.
           And for the first time, Davey looks absolutely PETRIFIED. 

           INT. THE FOYER - SECONDS LATER

           Margo runs to the door - 

           Almost there...

           INT. THE LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Davey lies on the ground. Looks around at the relics 
           surrounding him. 

           His costume burning in the fire.

           He sees the gun on the floor.

           Reaches for it.

           INT. THE FOYER - SAME

           Margo at the door, hand shaking as she tries to unlock it.

           A GUNSHOT rings out, far back in the house.

           She pauses, knows what that means.

           She breathes. Opens the door.

           EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Margo is immediately greeted by a swarm of reporters and 
           onlookers. 

           She looks like she just went through hell.

           Natalie bursts to the front of the crowd.

                                 NATALIE
                        Margo - MARGO! What is going on? 
                        You haven’t been answering--

           Margo hands Natalie the folder.

                                 MARGO
                        Read through this. 
                             (beat)
                        I need a minute.

           Margo walks ahead, taking deep breaths.
           Natalie’s confused.

           She starts to read the document.

           Then:

                                 NATALIE
                        What the FUCK?

           Margo walks on - tries to get ahead of the crowd.

           CAMERA BOOMS UP revealing - a Hollywood skyline.

           The view is still quite lovely.

           CROSSFADE INTO

           Davey’s Hat. Burning.

           Super: Two weeks later.

           Close on Margo’s feet, zipping through other travelers on a 
           moving walkway.

           She looks rested. Like she’s taken some time off. 

           We hear bits and pieces of CNN as she approaches and passes 
           each terminal on the walkway. Margo pays it no mind.

           Margo steps off the moving walkway and into a small magazine 
           shop.

           INT. AIRPORT MINI SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A long dolly shot passes over DOZENS of magazine covers, and 
           the truth has emerged, albeit with a few different takes on 
           Davey’s story.

           Some paint it as an old man who went crazy, others think him 
           a predator who got his comeuppance, Horse & Rider simply says 
           “Rest in peace.”

           The camera settles, finishing on a store employee.

           He’s restocking the magazines, replacing the ones with Davey 
           with new issues--

           New people on the covers. New rumors. New gossip. Who’s 
           fucking who. You know the deal. The world keeps spinning.

           The employee grabs one of the old magazines.

           MARGO’s face is on this one. The headline is just two words.

           THE RENEGADE

           He turns around to face the cashier.

           MARGO’s in line. Holding a smartwater.

           He tries not to stare - gets back to work.

           ON MARGO: paying for her drink.

                                 CASHIER
                        Anything else?

                                 MARGO
                        No. Thank you. I’m fine.

           As she waits for change, she sees the magazines with Davey 
           all being replaced. 
           On to the next thing.

           She smiles - satisfied.

                                 CASHIER
                        Where to?

                        flight 1187 to Los Angeles.

           Margo perks up. Her flight. She turns towards the setting 
           sun, visible through the terminal window.

                                 MARGO
                        Back to work.

           She turns to her gate. A newfound purpose in her steps.

           And a plane to catch.

           BLACK.
